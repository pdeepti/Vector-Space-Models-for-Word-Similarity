top designer says world cup design " just embarrassing " when baring it all is not enough could goleo 's musical career spell the end for pille ? europe -pipe- 23.01.2005 opinion : germany 's own goal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this the pinnacle of german design ?
hosting the 2006 world cup offers germany an unparalleled opportunity to present itself as a modern and attractive place to visit .
but with less than 18 months to go , the event 's organizers are failing miserably . often thought of as uncool and boring , germany has an international image problem .
people around the world frequently consider it a gray and uninviting place .
want passion or good weather in europe ?
look to france or italy .
dynamism or hipness ?
spain and britain top the list .
in comparison , stereotypes peg germany as an orderly yet utterly dull country . shaking such preconceptions can be difficult , but large sporting events can go a long way toward refashioning the popular image of a nation abroad .
portugal successfully used the last european soccer championship to shake off the notion of it as a sleepy backwater forever in spain 's shadow .
and despite big reservations about greek organizational skills , athens showed it could carry off the olympics without major problems . of course , as the eu 's largest country , germany is anything but a sleepy backwater .
and there is little doubt that the teutons will easily master the organizational aspects of the upcoming world cup .
but soccer 's most important competition is also arguably the planet 's biggest sporting party .
every four years , fans come together to celebrate " the beautiful game " and revel in a month-long multicultural soccer -lrb- or football , if you prefer -rrb- carnival . bildunterschrift : the logo for the 1974 world cup in west germany .
that makes hosting the spectacle a national marketing opportunity that comes but once in a generation .
germany last held the world cup in 1974 , when west germany even managed to win the tournament by defeating the netherlands in the finals . it will be a tall order for the german squad to repeat such a feat on its home turf this time around .
but regardless of the outcome on the pitch , germany still has the chance to present itself to the world as a modern , stylish and attractive country , banishing all-too-common perceptions of it as part of the unhippest corner of europe . so far , unfortunately , the german organizers are completely botching the job and risk losing the pr game before it really gets underway . undeniably , preparations are already in full swing a year and a half from kickoff .
the venues have been set and tickets will go on sale feb .

as with any major sporting event , the tournament also has its own official logo and mascot .
and that 's where the trouble begins . germany the tasteless bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the official 2006 logo in all its glory .
the logo , essentially the shop sign germany is hanging outside its door to the world , is anything but inviting .
instead of showing off sleek teutonic flair – like the logo in ' 74 – the new one ended up a horrendous orgy of form and color .
rather than come up with something original , someone has thrown together a few vapid smiley faces in an attempt to grin the world into submission . who created this masterpiece of dilettante design ?
franz beckenbauer 's 12-year-old niece ? one shutters to think what fifa and the german football association shelled out for its amateur loveliness .
especially since germany is chock full of creative graphic designers who could have come up with something better . so forget merchandizing revenue . this logo is so painful to look at , who in their right mind would buy a t-shirt with it emblazoned across the chest ?
you can almost hear foreign visitors in 2006 : " that 's the best they could come up with ?
my god it 's true , the germans really do n't have any taste . "
so much for shaking that image of being a land of mustard-colored blazers and mullets . mascot madness which brings me to goleo , a mustard-colored , mulleted lion recently presented as the world cup 's next official mascot .
looking like a furry version of a member of the german rock band the scorpions , he will do little to update the world 's preconceptions of what german soccer fans look like . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goleo , germany 's mullet-wearing , furry bundle of fun and his pal pille .
even beckenbauer , who had the unenviable task of introducing the lumbering lion to the world , said it was up to " personal taste " whether he was the right mascot for the job .
it does n't help matters that goleo 's sidekick is a plasticky talking ball named pille , which means " pill " in german and absolutely nothing to anybody else . but the ball is relatively harmless compared to the furry mullet .
one german friend has expressed concern about goleo 's penchant for strutting about without pants .
her fear is the mascot 's exhibitionist tendencies will reinforce the stereotype of germans that like to strip naked in public at a moment 's notice . despite the organizers ' lamentable marketing campaign , there is , of course , always hope that visitors to germany during the world cup will realize that there 's more to the country than design-challenged , mustard blazer-wearing , exhibitionists with mullets . just do n't count on the country 's famous beer to help set things right .
fifa has given the beverage concession during the tournament to america 's budweiser . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german beer at the world cup ?

the average german breakfast might consist of ham from the black forest , mozzarella cheese and salmon .
but are the germans certain where their groceries really come from ? with the recent economic uncertainty , germans are not exactly being free and easy with their wallets .
they are saving wherever they can - particularly on their grocery bill .
around 38 percent of all food stuffs are purchased at discount supermarkets .
and why not ?
the selection is big and the price is right .
hardly anything is lacking what the average , and sometimes above average , consumer wants - champagne , mozzarella cheese , balsamic vinegar and black forest ham .
in fact , you might think you are getting more than what you are paying for .
but the head of the federation of german consumer organizations , edda müller , has a different opinion .
" labels like balsamic vinegar , cheese from raw milk or salmon caught in the wild do n't always offer the consumer what they promise .
product names are often misleading and manufacturing information is frequently just an empty promise , " said müller .
you ca n't judge a salmon by its package bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this fisher most definitely knows where his fish came from the purported natural salmon was not always spawned in pristine rivers .
most raw milk cheese is no longer produced from milk that was brought to a maximum temperature of 40 degrees celsius .
natural balsamic vinegar - you can almost forget it .
even the most italian-looking packaging can not cover up the fact that only 15 percent of mozzarella cheese is made in the traditional manner .
the biggest problem is that most names are insufficiently trademarked or not at all .
that is also true for producers who try to make a product stand out by saying it is made a certain way .
for example , we do not necessarily have to believe the pastry maker who uses the phrase " own production , " that he took the time to knead the cake dough himself .
according to food industry laws , " production " means to prepare and process .
" even decorating a frozen cake with whipped cream is considered an act of preparation and hence own production , " said müller .
only made in the black forest if you buy black forest ham , you can not be 100 percent positive that the pig grew up in southwest germany .
of course , nuremberger gingerbread must be made in the traditional city , but the ingredients do not necessarily come from the region .
this has to do with the eu seal " trademarked geographical information " which is found on the product .
the product must only somehow be connected to the region .
if the danish farmer herds his sows to the black forest to be slaughtered , then it is a black forest ham .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feta cheese made by hand and sold in local shops in greece such policies harm those manufacturers who truly make traditional products in the traditional way . customers suffer as well because they purchase a product with a seal on it they assume to be accurate .
" that 's the only way to retain your customers and expand your business , " müller explained .
she would like germany to urge the eu to create uniform and easily understood labels .
also , consumers should be better protected so they are not deceived .
most importantly , everyone should know where everything in the refrigerator and pantries comes from . ralf lehnert -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " bio food " goes big in germany organic food has long been popular among germans , but while such products have been sold in small stores so far , supermarket-style venues focusing exclusively on so-called " bio food " are becoming more prevalent .

the average german breakfast might consist of ham from the black forest , mozzarella cheese and salmon .
but are the germans certain where their groceries really come from ? with the recent economic uncertainty , germans are not exactly being free and easy with their wallets .
they are saving wherever they can - particularly on their grocery bill .
around 38 percent of all food stuffs are purchased at discount supermarkets .
and why not ?
the selection is big and the price is right .
hardly anything is lacking what the average , and sometimes above average , consumer wants - champagne , mozzarella cheese , balsamic vinegar and black forest ham .
in fact , you might think you are getting more than what you are paying for .
but the head of the federation of german consumer organizations , edda müller , has a different opinion .
" labels like balsamic vinegar , cheese from raw milk or salmon caught in the wild do n't always offer the consumer what they promise .
product names are often misleading and manufacturing information is frequently just an empty promise , " said müller .
you ca n't judge a salmon by its package bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this fisher most definitely knows where his fish came from the purported natural salmon was not always spawned in pristine rivers .
most raw milk cheese is no longer produced from milk that was brought to a maximum temperature of 40 degrees celsius .
natural balsamic vinegar - you can almost forget it .
even the most italian-looking packaging can not cover up the fact that only 15 percent of mozzarella cheese is made in the traditional manner .

top designer says world cup design " just embarrassing " when baring it all is not enough could goleo 's musical career spell the end for pille ? europe -pipe- 23.01.2005 opinion : germany 's own goal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this the pinnacle of german design ?
hosting the 2006 world cup offers germany an unparalleled opportunity to present itself as a modern and attractive place to visit .
but with less than 18 months to go , the event 's organizers are failing miserably . often thought of as uncool and boring , germany has an international image problem .
people around the world frequently consider it a gray and uninviting place .
want passion or good weather in europe ?
look to france or italy .
dynamism or hipness ?
spain and britain top the list .
in comparison , stereotypes peg germany as an orderly yet utterly dull country . shaking such preconceptions can be difficult , but large sporting events can go a long way toward refashioning the popular image of a nation abroad .
portugal successfully used the last european soccer championship to shake off the notion of it as a sleepy backwater forever in spain 's shadow .
and despite big reservations about greek organizational skills , athens showed it could carry off the olympics without major problems . of course , as the eu 's largest country , germany is anything but a sleepy backwater .
and there is little doubt that the teutons will easily master the organizational aspects of the upcoming world cup .
but soccer 's most important competition is also arguably the planet 's biggest sporting party .
every four years , fans come together to celebrate " the beautiful game " and revel in a month-long multicultural soccer -lrb- or football , if you prefer -rrb- carnival . bildunterschrift : the logo for the 1974 world cup in west germany .
that makes hosting the spectacle a national marketing opportunity that comes but once in a generation .
germany last held the world cup in 1974 , when west germany even managed to win the tournament by defeating the netherlands in the finals . it will be a tall order for the german squad to repeat such a feat on its home turf this time around .
but regardless of the outcome on the pitch , germany still has the chance to present itself to the world as a modern , stylish and attractive country , banishing all-too-common perceptions of it as part of the unhippest corner of europe . so far , unfortunately , the german organizers are completely botching the job and risk losing the pr game before it really gets underway . undeniably , preparations are already in full swing a year and a half from kickoff .
the venues have been set and tickets will go on sale feb .
1 .
as with any major sporting event , the tournament also has its own official logo and mascot .
and that 's where the trouble begins . germany the tasteless bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the official 2006 logo in all its glory .
the logo , essentially the shop sign germany is hanging outside its door to the world , is anything but inviting .
instead of showing off sleek teutonic flair – like the logo in ' 74 – the new one ended up a horrendous orgy of form and color .
rather than come up with something original , someone has thrown together a few vapid smiley faces in an attempt to grin the world into submission . who created this masterpiece of dilettante design ?
franz beckenbauer 's 12-year-old niece ? one shutters to think what fifa and the german football association shelled out for its amateur loveliness .
especially since germany is chock full of creative graphic designers who could have come up with something better . so forget merchandizing revenue . this logo is so painful to look at , who in their right mind would buy a t-shirt with it emblazoned across the chest ?
you can almost hear foreign visitors in 2006 : " that 's the best they could come up with ?
my god it 's true , the germans really do n't have any taste . "
so much for shaking that image of being a land of mustard-colored blazers and mullets . mascot madness which brings me to goleo , a mustard-colored , mulleted lion recently presented as the world cup 's next official mascot .
looking like a furry version of a member of the german rock band the scorpions , he will do little to update the world 's preconceptions of what german soccer fans look like . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goleo , germany 's mullet-wearing , furry bundle of fun and his pal pille .
even beckenbauer , who had the unenviable task of introducing the lumbering lion to the world , said it was up to " personal taste " whether he was the right mascot for the job .
it does n't help matters that goleo 's sidekick is a plasticky talking ball named pille , which means " pill " in german and absolutely nothing to anybody else . but the ball is relatively harmless compared to the furry mullet .
one german friend has expressed concern about goleo 's penchant for strutting about without pants .
her fear is the mascot 's exhibitionist tendencies will reinforce the stereotype of germans that like to strip naked in public at a moment 's notice . despite the organizers ' lamentable marketing campaign , there is , of course , always hope that visitors to germany during the world cup will realize that there 's more to the country than design-challenged , mustard blazer-wearing , exhibitionists with mullets . just do n't count on the country 's famous beer to help set things right .
fifa has given the beverage concession during the tournament to america 's budweiser . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german beer at the world cup ?
ja , bitte !
germans revere soccer almost as much as they do their beer , so fans of both found it hard to swallow the news that only american beer would be sold in stadiums when germany hosts the world cup .
but things are looking up .
-lrb- dec .
21 , 2004 -rrb- a mascot for all seasons ?
goleo the lion was revealed as the official mascot for the 2006 world cup this weekend .
while fame and fortune beckons for the face of the soccer spectacular , goleo will find out it 's not all furry handshakes and waving .

top designer says world cup design " just embarrassing " when baring it all is not enough could goleo 's musical career spell the end for pille ? europe -pipe- 23.01.2005 opinion : germany 's own goal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this the pinnacle of german design ?
hosting the 2006 world cup offers germany an unparalleled opportunity to present itself as a modern and attractive place to visit .
but with less than 18 months to go , the event 's organizers are failing miserably . often thought of as uncool and boring , germany has an international image problem .
people around the world frequently consider it a gray and uninviting place .
want passion or good weather in europe ?
look to france or italy .
dynamism or hipness ?
spain and britain top the list .
in comparison , stereotypes peg germany as an orderly yet utterly dull country . shaking such preconceptions can be difficult , but large sporting events can go a long way toward refashioning the popular image of a nation abroad .
portugal successfully used the last european soccer championship to shake off the notion of it as a sleepy backwater forever in spain 's shadow .
and despite big reservations about greek organizational skills , athens showed it could carry off the olympics without major problems . of course , as the eu 's largest country , germany is anything but a sleepy backwater .
and there is little doubt that the teutons will easily master the organizational aspects of the upcoming world cup .
but soccer 's most important competition is also arguably the planet 's biggest sporting party .
every four years , fans come together to celebrate " the beautiful game " and revel in a month-long multicultural soccer -lrb- or football , if you prefer -rrb- carnival . bildunterschrift : the logo for the 1974 world cup in west germany .
that makes hosting the spectacle a national marketing opportunity that comes but once in a generation .
germany last held the world cup in 1974 , when west germany even managed to win the tournament by defeating the netherlands in the finals . it will be a tall order for the german squad to repeat such a feat on its home turf this time around .
but regardless of the outcome on the pitch , germany still has the chance to present itself to the world as a modern , stylish and attractive country , banishing all-too-common perceptions of it as part of the unhippest corner of europe . so far , unfortunately , the german organizers are completely botching the job and risk losing the pr game before it really gets underway . undeniably , preparations are already in full swing a year and a half from kickoff .

after enduring weeks of roller-coaster like chaos in his country , a life-threatening poisoning attack , election fraud and an appeal before the country ’ s supreme court , the 50-year-old hero of the “ orange revolution ” finally saw his ambitions realized on sunday when he was sworn in as ukraine ’ s president . with his hand on the constitution and the bible , yushchenko read aloud the oath of office during a parliament ceremony attended by hundreds of international guests , including outgoing us secretary of state colin powell , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer and presidents of several former soviet satellite states . georgian parliament president nino burjanadze , who arrived in kiev ahead of the official ceremonies , applauded yushchenko and the historic moment his inauguration embodied .
drawing a parallel to the “ rose revolution ” in georgia a year ago , she said , “ there are similarities between the two countries .
the people of georgia and ukraine have defended their right to free election and have taken the future into their own hands . ” a new direction for ukraine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands rallied in kiev 's central square throughout november and december to show support for opposition candidate yushchenko for yushchenko ’ s supporters , the thousands who had gathered tirelessly in the streets of kiev and throughout the country to protest election fraud after the first presidential ballot in november put the moscow-backed viktor yanukovych in the lead , sunday ’ s swearing-in ceremony marks the start of a new political orientation for ukraine . yushchenko , who takes over after a decade of authoritarian-leaning rule by leonid kuchma , has vowed to eradicate corruption and build a country with a transparent economy and institutions .
he aims to move his country closer to mainstream europe and cooperate more with the european union .

despite his plans to re-orient the nation and integrate it more actively in the international community by developing a stronger market-based economy and striving to enter the world trade organization , yushchenko has also said he would focus on uniting the divided country .
the split between the nationalist , and largely pro-european , western regions and the russian-speaking east was accentuated during the election . in an effort to prove that he is not completely alienating the country from its long-time supporter russia , yushchenko is set to head to moscow for his first foreign visit .
after that , though , he will head on to strasbourg and brussels , where he is expected to address his country ’ s goals of entering the eu .
he will also put in an appearance at the world economic forum in davos , switzerland , before heading back east to participate in the ceremony commemorating the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : democracy triumphs in ukraine with over 95 percent of votes counted , pro-western opposition leader viktor yushchenko won the ukrainian presidential election .

payments for the survivors should now be completed by the end of the year . though their numbers are dwindling , there are still about 1.7 million people who were forced to work in german companies during the nazi regime and who could receive up to € 7,600 -lrb- $ 9,838 -rrb- from the four-year-old , € 5.12-billion remembrance , responsibility and future foundation , equally financed by the german government and an organization of german businesses .
" we expect the payments to come to a close by the end of the year , " the foundation 's director said last week , ahead of the start of a series of ceremonies commemorating the 60th anniversary of germany 's defeat in 1945 .
funds still available so far € 3.84 billion have been paid to about 1.63 million forced laborers or their descendants , and about 500,000 claims have been denied .
there are about € 387 million in interest still available .
in exchange for the payments the companies that participated in the organization received protection from further legal action . " the leading german industrials owe forced laborers because they were worked to death , " said benjamin ferencz , one of the prosecutors in the nuremberg war crimes tribunal in 1945 .
" one of the labors told me ' we were treated worse than slaves , you try to keep slaves alive .
we were like sandpaper : used , thrown away and burnt with the garbage . " '
firms profited from slave labor though the nazi regime lost the war , german companies profited from slave labor . german industrial wealth was 17 times larger after the war than in 1939 , according to economic historian dietrich eichholz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf hitler speaks at the opening ceremony of the volkswagen car factory in fallersleben , lower saxony , may 26 , 1938 .
in order to keep up production from 1939 to 1941 , as more and more men were being called up for military service , german companies needed 1.2 million workers , and they came in the form of forced laborers .
in all , there were about 12 million people taken from german occupied territory to serve as forced laborers during the world war ii .
for decades the companies ' executive boards got around paying victims compensation by saying they were compelled to use slave labors .
that , in turn , makes the german government , not the businesses themselves , responsible for remuneration .
courts raise pressure pressure built up in the 1990s after class-action suits were filed in the united states against a number of large german firms , including bmw , daimler-benz , deutsche bank , siemens and volkswagen - all companies that played important roles in the holocaust , according to new york lawyer edward fagan .
there were billions at stake for the companies involved in the law suits , as well as an immense public relations problem .
to solve those problems the companies set up the remembrance , responsibility and future foundation with the government .
" i have recently spoken with about 20 forced laborers from poland , and the reaction is very positive , " said michael jansen , who was the foundation 's head until the end of last year .
" for many of the older people who are living on very limited means , this is like a lotto win , and they are very glad that we are helping them .

after enduring weeks of roller-coaster like chaos in his country , a life-threatening poisoning attack , election fraud and an appeal before the country ’ s supreme court , the 50-year-old hero of the “ orange revolution ” finally saw his ambitions realized on sunday when he was sworn in as ukraine ’ s president . with his hand on the constitution and the bible , yushchenko read aloud the oath of office during a parliament ceremony attended by hundreds of international guests , including outgoing us secretary of state colin powell , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer and presidents of several former soviet satellite states . georgian parliament president nino burjanadze , who arrived in kiev ahead of the official ceremonies , applauded yushchenko and the historic moment his inauguration embodied .
drawing a parallel to the “ rose revolution ” in georgia a year ago , she said , “ there are similarities between the two countries .
the people of georgia and ukraine have defended their right to free election and have taken the future into their own hands . ” a new direction for ukraine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands rallied in kiev 's central square throughout november and december to show support for opposition candidate yushchenko for yushchenko ’ s supporters , the thousands who had gathered tirelessly in the streets of kiev and throughout the country to protest election fraud after the first presidential ballot in november put the moscow-backed viktor yanukovych in the lead , sunday ’ s swearing-in ceremony marks the start of a new political orientation for ukraine . yushchenko , who takes over after a decade of authoritarian-leaning rule by leonid kuchma , has vowed to eradicate corruption and build a country with a transparent economy and institutions .
he aims to move his country closer to mainstream europe and cooperate more with the european union .
ukraine borders the 25-nation bloc , but in the past has turned more towards moscow than brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian opposition leader viktor yushchenko shows a v-sign as he greets supporters leaving a polling station in kiev , ukraine , on sunday dec .
26 , 2004 .
despite his plans to re-orient the nation and integrate it more actively in the international community by developing a stronger market-based economy and striving to enter the world trade organization , yushchenko has also said he would focus on uniting the divided country .
the split between the nationalist , and largely pro-european , western regions and the russian-speaking east was accentuated during the election . in an effort to prove that he is not completely alienating the country from its long-time supporter russia , yushchenko is set to head to moscow for his first foreign visit .
after that , though , he will head on to strasbourg and brussels , where he is expected to address his country ’ s goals of entering the eu .
he will also put in an appearance at the world economic forum in davos , switzerland , before heading back east to participate in the ceremony commemorating the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : democracy triumphs in ukraine with over 95 percent of votes counted , pro-western opposition leader viktor yushchenko won the ukrainian presidential election .

payments for the survivors should now be completed by the end of the year . though their numbers are dwindling , there are still about 1.7 million people who were forced to work in german companies during the nazi regime and who could receive up to € 7,600 -lrb- $ 9,838 -rrb- from the four-year-old , € 5.12-billion remembrance , responsibility and future foundation , equally financed by the german government and an organization of german businesses .
" we expect the payments to come to a close by the end of the year , " the foundation 's director said last week , ahead of the start of a series of ceremonies commemorating the 60th anniversary of germany 's defeat in 1945 .
funds still available so far € 3.84 billion have been paid to about 1.63 million forced laborers or their descendants , and about 500,000 claims have been denied .
there are about € 387 million in interest still available .
in exchange for the payments the companies that participated in the organization received protection from further legal action . " the leading german industrials owe forced laborers because they were worked to death , " said benjamin ferencz , one of the prosecutors in the nuremberg war crimes tribunal in 1945 .
" one of the labors told me ' we were treated worse than slaves , you try to keep slaves alive .
we were like sandpaper : used , thrown away and burnt with the garbage . " '
firms profited from slave labor though the nazi regime lost the war , german companies profited from slave labor . german industrial wealth was 17 times larger after the war than in 1939 , according to economic historian dietrich eichholz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf hitler speaks at the opening ceremony of the volkswagen car factory in fallersleben , lower saxony , may 26 , 1938 .
in order to keep up production from 1939 to 1941 , as more and more men were being called up for military service , german companies needed 1.2 million workers , and they came in the form of forced laborers .
in all , there were about 12 million people taken from german occupied territory to serve as forced laborers during the world war ii .
for decades the companies ' executive boards got around paying victims compensation by saying they were compelled to use slave labors .
that , in turn , makes the german government , not the businesses themselves , responsible for remuneration .
courts raise pressure pressure built up in the 1990s after class-action suits were filed in the united states against a number of large german firms , including bmw , daimler-benz , deutsche bank , siemens and volkswagen - all companies that played important roles in the holocaust , according to new york lawyer edward fagan .
there were billions at stake for the companies involved in the law suits , as well as an immense public relations problem .
to solve those problems the companies set up the remembrance , responsibility and future foundation with the government .
" i have recently spoken with about 20 forced laborers from poland , and the reaction is very positive , " said michael jansen , who was the foundation 's head until the end of last year .
" for many of the older people who are living on very limited means , this is like a lotto win , and they are very glad that we are helping them .

the average german breakfast might consist of ham from the black forest , mozzarella cheese and salmon .
but are the germans certain where their groceries really come from ? with the recent economic uncertainty , germans are not exactly being free and easy with their wallets .
they are saving wherever they can - particularly on their grocery bill .
around 38 percent of all food stuffs are purchased at discount supermarkets .
and why not ?
the selection is big and the price is right .
hardly anything is lacking what the average , and sometimes above average , consumer wants - champagne , mozzarella cheese , balsamic vinegar and black forest ham .
in fact , you might think you are getting more than what you are paying for .
but the head of the federation of german consumer organizations , edda müller , has a different opinion .
" labels like balsamic vinegar , cheese from raw milk or salmon caught in the wild do n't always offer the consumer what they promise .
product names are often misleading and manufacturing information is frequently just an empty promise , " said müller .
you ca n't judge a salmon by its package bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this fisher most definitely knows where his fish came from the purported natural salmon was not always spawned in pristine rivers .
most raw milk cheese is no longer produced from milk that was brought to a maximum temperature of 40 degrees celsius .
natural balsamic vinegar - you can almost forget it .
even the most italian-looking packaging can not cover up the fact that only 15 percent of mozzarella cheese is made in the traditional manner .
the biggest problem is that most names are insufficiently trademarked or not at all .
that is also true for producers who try to make a product stand out by saying it is made a certain way .
for example , we do not necessarily have to believe the pastry maker who uses the phrase " own production , " that he took the time to knead the cake dough himself .
according to food industry laws , " production " means to prepare and process .
" even decorating a frozen cake with whipped cream is considered an act of preparation and hence own production , " said müller .
only made in the black forest if you buy black forest ham , you can not be 100 percent positive that the pig grew up in southwest germany .
of course , nuremberger gingerbread must be made in the traditional city , but the ingredients do not necessarily come from the region .
this has to do with the eu seal " trademarked geographical information " which is found on the product .
the product must only somehow be connected to the region .
if the danish farmer herds his sows to the black forest to be slaughtered , then it is a black forest ham .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feta cheese made by hand and sold in local shops in greece such policies harm those manufacturers who truly make traditional products in the traditional way . customers suffer as well because they purchase a product with a seal on it they assume to be accurate .
" that 's the only way to retain your customers and expand your business , " müller explained .
she would like germany to urge the eu to create uniform and easily understood labels .

top designer says world cup design " just embarrassing " when baring it all is not enough could goleo 's musical career spell the end for pille ? europe -pipe- 23.01.2005 opinion : germany 's own goal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this the pinnacle of german design ?
hosting the 2006 world cup offers germany an unparalleled opportunity to present itself as a modern and attractive place to visit .
but with less than 18 months to go , the event 's organizers are failing miserably . often thought of as uncool and boring , germany has an international image problem .
people around the world frequently consider it a gray and uninviting place .
want passion or good weather in europe ?
look to france or italy .
dynamism or hipness ?
spain and britain top the list .
in comparison , stereotypes peg germany as an orderly yet utterly dull country . shaking such preconceptions can be difficult , but large sporting events can go a long way toward refashioning the popular image of a nation abroad .
portugal successfully used the last european soccer championship to shake off the notion of it as a sleepy backwater forever in spain 's shadow .
and despite big reservations about greek organizational skills , athens showed it could carry off the olympics without major problems . of course , as the eu 's largest country , germany is anything but a sleepy backwater .
and there is little doubt that the teutons will easily master the organizational aspects of the upcoming world cup .
but soccer 's most important competition is also arguably the planet 's biggest sporting party .
every four years , fans come together to celebrate " the beautiful game " and revel in a month-long multicultural soccer -lrb- or football , if you prefer -rrb- carnival . bildunterschrift : the logo for the 1974 world cup in west germany .
that makes hosting the spectacle a national marketing opportunity that comes but once in a generation .
germany last held the world cup in 1974 , when west germany even managed to win the tournament by defeating the netherlands in the finals . it will be a tall order for the german squad to repeat such a feat on its home turf this time around .
but regardless of the outcome on the pitch , germany still has the chance to present itself to the world as a modern , stylish and attractive country , banishing all-too-common perceptions of it as part of the unhippest corner of europe . so far , unfortunately , the german organizers are completely botching the job and risk losing the pr game before it really gets underway . undeniably , preparations are already in full swing a year and a half from kickoff .
the venues have been set and tickets will go on sale feb .
1 .
as with any major sporting event , the tournament also has its own official logo and mascot .
and that 's where the trouble begins . germany the tasteless bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the official 2006 logo in all its glory .
the logo , essentially the shop sign germany is hanging outside its door to the world , is anything but inviting .
instead of showing off sleek teutonic flair – like the logo in ' 74 – the new one ended up a horrendous orgy of form and color .
rather than come up with something original , someone has thrown together a few vapid smiley faces in an attempt to grin the world into submission . who created this masterpiece of dilettante design ?
franz beckenbauer 's 12-year-old niece ? one shutters to think what fifa and the german football association shelled out for its amateur loveliness .
especially since germany is chock full of creative graphic designers who could have come up with something better . so forget merchandizing revenue . this logo is so painful to look at , who in their right mind would buy a t-shirt with it emblazoned across the chest ?
you can almost hear foreign visitors in 2006 : " that 's the best they could come up with ?
my god it 's true , the germans really do n't have any taste . "
so much for shaking that image of being a land of mustard-colored blazers and mullets . mascot madness which brings me to goleo , a mustard-colored , mulleted lion recently presented as the world cup 's next official mascot .
looking like a furry version of a member of the german rock band the scorpions , he will do little to update the world 's preconceptions of what german soccer fans look like . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goleo , germany 's mullet-wearing , furry bundle of fun and his pal pille .
even beckenbauer , who had the unenviable task of introducing the lumbering lion to the world , said it was up to " personal taste " whether he was the right mascot for the job .
it does n't help matters that goleo 's sidekick is a plasticky talking ball named pille , which means " pill " in german and absolutely nothing to anybody else . but the ball is relatively harmless compared to the furry mullet .
one german friend has expressed concern about goleo 's penchant for strutting about without pants .
her fear is the mascot 's exhibitionist tendencies will reinforce the stereotype of germans that like to strip naked in public at a moment 's notice . despite the organizers ' lamentable marketing campaign , there is , of course , always hope that visitors to germany during the world cup will realize that there 's more to the country than design-challenged , mustard blazer-wearing , exhibitionists with mullets . just do n't count on the country 's famous beer to help set things right .
fifa has given the beverage concession during the tournament to america 's budweiser . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german beer at the world cup ?
ja , bitte !
germans revere soccer almost as much as they do their beer , so fans of both found it hard to swallow the news that only american beer would be sold in stadiums when germany hosts the world cup .
but things are looking up .

the average german breakfast might consist of ham from the black forest , mozzarella cheese and salmon .
but are the germans certain where their groceries really come from ? with the recent economic uncertainty , germans are not exactly being free and easy with their wallets .
they are saving wherever they can - particularly on their grocery bill .
around 38 percent of all food stuffs are purchased at discount supermarkets .
and why not ?
the selection is big and the price is right .
hardly anything is lacking what the average , and sometimes above average , consumer wants - champagne , mozzarella cheese , balsamic vinegar and black forest ham .
in fact , you might think you are getting more than what you are paying for .
but the head of the federation of german consumer organizations , edda müller , has a different opinion .
" labels like balsamic vinegar , cheese from raw milk or salmon caught in the wild do n't always offer the consumer what they promise .
product names are often misleading and manufacturing information is frequently just an empty promise , " said müller .
you ca n't judge a salmon by its package bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this fisher most definitely knows where his fish came from the purported natural salmon was not always spawned in pristine rivers .
most raw milk cheese is no longer produced from milk that was brought to a maximum temperature of 40 degrees celsius .
natural balsamic vinegar - you can almost forget it .
even the most italian-looking packaging can not cover up the fact that only 15 percent of mozzarella cheese is made in the traditional manner .
the biggest problem is that most names are insufficiently trademarked or not at all .
that is also true for producers who try to make a product stand out by saying it is made a certain way .
for example , we do not necessarily have to believe the pastry maker who uses the phrase " own production , " that he took the time to knead the cake dough himself .
according to food industry laws , " production " means to prepare and process .
" even decorating a frozen cake with whipped cream is considered an act of preparation and hence own production , " said müller .
only made in the black forest if you buy black forest ham , you can not be 100 percent positive that the pig grew up in southwest germany .
of course , nuremberger gingerbread must be made in the traditional city , but the ingredients do not necessarily come from the region .
this has to do with the eu seal " trademarked geographical information " which is found on the product .
the product must only somehow be connected to the region .
if the danish farmer herds his sows to the black forest to be slaughtered , then it is a black forest ham .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feta cheese made by hand and sold in local shops in greece such policies harm those manufacturers who truly make traditional products in the traditional way . customers suffer as well because they purchase a product with a seal on it they assume to be accurate .
" that 's the only way to retain your customers and expand your business , " müller explained .
she would like germany to urge the eu to create uniform and easily understood labels .
also , consumers should be better protected so they are not deceived .

" we expect the payments to come to a close by the end of the year , " the foundation 's director said last week , ahead of the start of a series of ceremonies commemorating the 60th anniversary of germany 's defeat in 1945 .
funds still available so far € 3.84 billion have been paid to about 1.63 million forced laborers or their descendants , and about 500,000 claims have been denied .
there are about € 387 million in interest still available .
in exchange for the payments the companies that participated in the organization received protection from further legal action . " the leading german industrials owe forced laborers because they were worked to death , " said benjamin ferencz , one of the prosecutors in the nuremberg war crimes tribunal in 1945 .
" one of the labors told me ' we were treated worse than slaves , you try to keep slaves alive .
we were like sandpaper : used , thrown away and burnt with the garbage . " '

there were billions at stake for the companies involved in the law suits , as well as an immense public relations problem .
to solve those problems the companies set up the remembrance , responsibility and future foundation with the government .
" i have recently spoken with about 20 forced laborers from poland , and the reaction is very positive , " said michael jansen , who was the foundation 's head until the end of last year .

but shortly before the tournament kicks off , his mother dies .
her will stipulates that her sons , who have been arch enemies for the past 40 years , can only claim her savings if they reconcile their differences and bring their families to hold a week long jewish vigil over her dead body .
while marlene takes a crash course in the intricacies of being jewish , and sweats over supplying the estranged and orthodox relations with kosher fare , jakob has another problem altogether .

in this foreign world , run according to the rules of nazi law and order , friedrich learns about competitive fighting and unexpected comradeship .
his participation in a horrific deployment against escaped prisoners of war , and his growing friendship with albrecht stein , the quiet and sensitive son of a nazi district leader , force him to make a decision which will write the closing chapter on his youth . schneeland -lrb- snowland -rrb- bildunterschrift : the poetry of snow is a silent character in schneeland this film by hans w. giessendörfer has been described as a modern gothic tale of lives that inhabit the darkest realms of humanity , while they struggle to find meaning and deep love .

after enduring weeks of roller-coaster like chaos in his country , a life-threatening poisoning attack , election fraud and an appeal before the country ’ s supreme court , the 50-year-old hero of the “ orange revolution ” finally saw his ambitions realized on sunday when he was sworn in as ukraine ’ s president . with his hand on the constitution and the bible , yushchenko read aloud the oath of office during a parliament ceremony attended by hundreds of international guests , including outgoing us secretary of state colin powell , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer and presidents of several former soviet satellite states . georgian parliament president nino burjanadze , who arrived in kiev ahead of the official ceremonies , applauded yushchenko and the historic moment his inauguration embodied .
drawing a parallel to the “ rose revolution ” in georgia a year ago , she said , “ there are similarities between the two countries .
the people of georgia and ukraine have defended their right to free election and have taken the future into their own hands . ” a new direction for ukraine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands rallied in kiev 's central square throughout november and december to show support for opposition candidate yushchenko for yushchenko ’ s supporters , the thousands who had gathered tirelessly in the streets of kiev and throughout the country to protest election fraud after the first presidential ballot in november put the moscow-backed viktor yanukovych in the lead , sunday ’ s swearing-in ceremony marks the start of a new political orientation for ukraine . yushchenko , who takes over after a decade of authoritarian-leaning rule by leonid kuchma , has vowed to eradicate corruption and build a country with a transparent economy and institutions .
he aims to move his country closer to mainstream europe and cooperate more with the european union .

26 , 2004 .
despite his plans to re-orient the nation and integrate it more actively in the international community by developing a stronger market-based economy and striving to enter the world trade organization , yushchenko has also said he would focus on uniting the divided country .
the split between the nationalist , and largely pro-european , western regions and the russian-speaking east was accentuated during the election . in an effort to prove that he is not completely alienating the country from its long-time supporter russia , yushchenko is set to head to moscow for his first foreign visit .
after that , though , he will head on to strasbourg and brussels , where he is expected to address his country ’ s goals of entering the eu .
he will also put in an appearance at the world economic forum in davos , switzerland , before heading back east to participate in the ceremony commemorating the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : democracy triumphs in ukraine with over 95 percent of votes counted , pro-western opposition leader viktor yushchenko won the ukrainian presidential election .

berlin hails ukrainian decision ; russia slams west yushchenko poisoned , doctors say court orders new ukrainian election europe -pipe- 23.01.2005 yushchenko signals new direction for ukraine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko takes his oath of office viktor yushchenko was sworn in as the third president of post-soviet ukraine sunday , capping months of political turmoil that saw the nation turn away from traditional russian influence toward the west . the wait is over for viktor yushchenko .
after enduring weeks of roller-coaster like chaos in his country , a life-threatening poisoning attack , election fraud and an appeal before the country ’ s supreme court , the 50-year-old hero of the “ orange revolution ” finally saw his ambitions realized on sunday when he was sworn in as ukraine ’ s president . with his hand on the constitution and the bible , yushchenko read aloud the oath of office during a parliament ceremony attended by hundreds of international guests , including outgoing us secretary of state colin powell , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer and presidents of several former soviet satellite states . georgian parliament president nino burjanadze , who arrived in kiev ahead of the official ceremonies , applauded yushchenko and the historic moment his inauguration embodied .
drawing a parallel to the “ rose revolution ” in georgia a year ago , she said , “ there are similarities between the two countries .
the people of georgia and ukraine have defended their right to free election and have taken the future into their own hands . ” a new direction for ukraine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands rallied in kiev 's central square throughout november and december to show support for opposition candidate yushchenko for yushchenko ’ s supporters , the thousands who had gathered tirelessly in the streets of kiev and throughout the country to protest election fraud after the first presidential ballot in november put the moscow-backed viktor yanukovych in the lead , sunday ’ s swearing-in ceremony marks the start of a new political orientation for ukraine . yushchenko , who takes over after a decade of authoritarian-leaning rule by leonid kuchma , has vowed to eradicate corruption and build a country with a transparent economy and institutions .
he aims to move his country closer to mainstream europe and cooperate more with the european union .
ukraine borders the 25-nation bloc , but in the past has turned more towards moscow than brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian opposition leader viktor yushchenko shows a v-sign as he greets supporters leaving a polling station in kiev , ukraine , on sunday dec .
26 , 2004 .
despite his plans to re-orient the nation and integrate it more actively in the international community by developing a stronger market-based economy and striving to enter the world trade organization , yushchenko has also said he would focus on uniting the divided country .
the split between the nationalist , and largely pro-european , western regions and the russian-speaking east was accentuated during the election . in an effort to prove that he is not completely alienating the country from its long-time supporter russia , yushchenko is set to head to moscow for his first foreign visit .
after that , though , he will head on to strasbourg and brussels , where he is expected to address his country ’ s goals of entering the eu .
he will also put in an appearance at the world economic forum in davos , switzerland , before heading back east to participate in the ceremony commemorating the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : democracy triumphs in ukraine with over 95 percent of votes counted , pro-western opposition leader viktor yushchenko won the ukrainian presidential election .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 23.01.2005 buyer beware ! großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is that parma ham really from italy ?
the average german breakfast might consist of ham from the black forest , mozzarella cheese and salmon .
but are the germans certain where their groceries really come from ? with the recent economic uncertainty , germans are not exactly being free and easy with their wallets .
they are saving wherever they can - particularly on their grocery bill .
around 38 percent of all food stuffs are purchased at discount supermarkets .
and why not ?
the selection is big and the price is right .
hardly anything is lacking what the average , and sometimes above average , consumer wants - champagne , mozzarella cheese , balsamic vinegar and black forest ham .
in fact , you might think you are getting more than what you are paying for .
but the head of the federation of german consumer organizations , edda müller , has a different opinion .
" labels like balsamic vinegar , cheese from raw milk or salmon caught in the wild do n't always offer the consumer what they promise .
product names are often misleading and manufacturing information is frequently just an empty promise , " said müller .
you ca n't judge a salmon by its package bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this fisher most definitely knows where his fish came from the purported natural salmon was not always spawned in pristine rivers .
most raw milk cheese is no longer produced from milk that was brought to a maximum temperature of 40 degrees celsius .
natural balsamic vinegar - you can almost forget it .
even the most italian-looking packaging can not cover up the fact that only 15 percent of mozzarella cheese is made in the traditional manner .
the biggest problem is that most names are insufficiently trademarked or not at all .
that is also true for producers who try to make a product stand out by saying it is made a certain way .
for example , we do not necessarily have to believe the pastry maker who uses the phrase " own production , " that he took the time to knead the cake dough himself .
according to food industry laws , " production " means to prepare and process .
" even decorating a frozen cake with whipped cream is considered an act of preparation and hence own production , " said müller .
only made in the black forest if you buy black forest ham , you can not be 100 percent positive that the pig grew up in southwest germany .
of course , nuremberger gingerbread must be made in the traditional city , but the ingredients do not necessarily come from the region .
this has to do with the eu seal " trademarked geographical information " which is found on the product .
the product must only somehow be connected to the region .
if the danish farmer herds his sows to the black forest to be slaughtered , then it is a black forest ham .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feta cheese made by hand and sold in local shops in greece such policies harm those manufacturers who truly make traditional products in the traditional way . customers suffer as well because they purchase a product with a seal on it they assume to be accurate .
" that 's the only way to retain your customers and expand your business , " müller explained .
she would like germany to urge the eu to create uniform and easily understood labels .
also , consumers should be better protected so they are not deceived .
most importantly , everyone should know where everything in the refrigerator and pantries comes from . ralf lehnert -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " bio food " goes big in germany organic food has long been popular among germans , but while such products have been sold in small stores so far , supermarket-style venues focusing exclusively on so-called " bio food " are becoming more prevalent .

berlin hails ukrainian decision ; russia slams west yushchenko poisoned , doctors say court orders new ukrainian election europe -pipe- 23.01.2005 yushchenko signals new direction for ukraine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko takes his oath of office viktor yushchenko was sworn in as the third president of post-soviet ukraine sunday , capping months of political turmoil that saw the nation turn away from traditional russian influence toward the west . the wait is over for viktor yushchenko .
after enduring weeks of roller-coaster like chaos in his country , a life-threatening poisoning attack , election fraud and an appeal before the country ’ s supreme court , the 50-year-old hero of the “ orange revolution ” finally saw his ambitions realized on sunday when he was sworn in as ukraine ’ s president . with his hand on the constitution and the bible , yushchenko read aloud the oath of office during a parliament ceremony attended by hundreds of international guests , including outgoing us secretary of state colin powell , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer and presidents of several former soviet satellite states . georgian parliament president nino burjanadze , who arrived in kiev ahead of the official ceremonies , applauded yushchenko and the historic moment his inauguration embodied .
drawing a parallel to the “ rose revolution ” in georgia a year ago , she said , “ there are similarities between the two countries .
the people of georgia and ukraine have defended their right to free election and have taken the future into their own hands . ” a new direction for ukraine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands rallied in kiev 's central square throughout november and december to show support for opposition candidate yushchenko for yushchenko ’ s supporters , the thousands who had gathered tirelessly in the streets of kiev and throughout the country to protest election fraud after the first presidential ballot in november put the moscow-backed viktor yanukovych in the lead , sunday ’ s swearing-in ceremony marks the start of a new political orientation for ukraine . yushchenko , who takes over after a decade of authoritarian-leaning rule by leonid kuchma , has vowed to eradicate corruption and build a country with a transparent economy and institutions .
he aims to move his country closer to mainstream europe and cooperate more with the european union .
ukraine borders the 25-nation bloc , but in the past has turned more towards moscow than brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian opposition leader viktor yushchenko shows a v-sign as he greets supporters leaving a polling station in kiev , ukraine , on sunday dec .
26 , 2004 .
despite his plans to re-orient the nation and integrate it more actively in the international community by developing a stronger market-based economy and striving to enter the world trade organization , yushchenko has also said he would focus on uniting the divided country .
the split between the nationalist , and largely pro-european , western regions and the russian-speaking east was accentuated during the election . in an effort to prove that he is not completely alienating the country from its long-time supporter russia , yushchenko is set to head to moscow for his first foreign visit .
after that , though , he will head on to strasbourg and brussels , where he is expected to address his country ’ s goals of entering the eu .
he will also put in an appearance at the world economic forum in davos , switzerland , before heading back east to participate in the ceremony commemorating the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : democracy triumphs in ukraine with over 95 percent of votes counted , pro-western opposition leader viktor yushchenko won the ukrainian presidential election .

payments for the survivors should now be completed by the end of the year . though their numbers are dwindling , there are still about 1.7 million people who were forced to work in german companies during the nazi regime and who could receive up to € 7,600 -lrb- $ 9,838 -rrb- from the four-year-old , € 5.12-billion remembrance , responsibility and future foundation , equally financed by the german government and an organization of german businesses .
" we expect the payments to come to a close by the end of the year , " the foundation 's director said last week , ahead of the start of a series of ceremonies commemorating the 60th anniversary of germany 's defeat in 1945 .
funds still available so far € 3.84 billion have been paid to about 1.63 million forced laborers or their descendants , and about 500,000 claims have been denied .
there are about € 387 million in interest still available .
in exchange for the payments the companies that participated in the organization received protection from further legal action . " the leading german industrials owe forced laborers because they were worked to death , " said benjamin ferencz , one of the prosecutors in the nuremberg war crimes tribunal in 1945 .
" one of the labors told me ' we were treated worse than slaves , you try to keep slaves alive .
we were like sandpaper : used , thrown away and burnt with the garbage . " '
firms profited from slave labor though the nazi regime lost the war , german companies profited from slave labor . german industrial wealth was 17 times larger after the war than in 1939 , according to economic historian dietrich eichholz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf hitler speaks at the opening ceremony of the volkswagen car factory in fallersleben , lower saxony , may 26 , 1938 .
in order to keep up production from 1939 to 1941 , as more and more men were being called up for military service , german companies needed 1.2 million workers , and they came in the form of forced laborers .
in all , there were about 12 million people taken from german occupied territory to serve as forced laborers during the world war ii .
for decades the companies ' executive boards got around paying victims compensation by saying they were compelled to use slave labors .
that , in turn , makes the german government , not the businesses themselves , responsible for remuneration .
courts raise pressure pressure built up in the 1990s after class-action suits were filed in the united states against a number of large german firms , including bmw , daimler-benz , deutsche bank , siemens and volkswagen - all companies that played important roles in the holocaust , according to new york lawyer edward fagan .
there were billions at stake for the companies involved in the law suits , as well as an immense public relations problem .
to solve those problems the companies set up the remembrance , responsibility and future foundation with the government .
" i have recently spoken with about 20 forced laborers from poland , and the reaction is very positive , " said michael jansen , who was the foundation 's head until the end of last year .
" for many of the older people who are living on very limited means , this is like a lotto win , and they are very glad that we are helping them .

the average german breakfast might consist of ham from the black forest , mozzarella cheese and salmon .
but are the germans certain where their groceries really come from ? with the recent economic uncertainty , germans are not exactly being free and easy with their wallets .
they are saving wherever they can - particularly on their grocery bill .
around 38 percent of all food stuffs are purchased at discount supermarkets .
and why not ?
the selection is big and the price is right .
hardly anything is lacking what the average , and sometimes above average , consumer wants - champagne , mozzarella cheese , balsamic vinegar and black forest ham .
in fact , you might think you are getting more than what you are paying for .
but the head of the federation of german consumer organizations , edda müller , has a different opinion .
" labels like balsamic vinegar , cheese from raw milk or salmon caught in the wild do n't always offer the consumer what they promise .
product names are often misleading and manufacturing information is frequently just an empty promise , " said müller .
you ca n't judge a salmon by its package bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this fisher most definitely knows where his fish came from the purported natural salmon was not always spawned in pristine rivers .
most raw milk cheese is no longer produced from milk that was brought to a maximum temperature of 40 degrees celsius .
natural balsamic vinegar - you can almost forget it .
even the most italian-looking packaging can not cover up the fact that only 15 percent of mozzarella cheese is made in the traditional manner .
the biggest problem is that most names are insufficiently trademarked or not at all .
that is also true for producers who try to make a product stand out by saying it is made a certain way .
for example , we do not necessarily have to believe the pastry maker who uses the phrase " own production , " that he took the time to knead the cake dough himself .
according to food industry laws , " production " means to prepare and process .
" even decorating a frozen cake with whipped cream is considered an act of preparation and hence own production , " said müller .
only made in the black forest if you buy black forest ham , you can not be 100 percent positive that the pig grew up in southwest germany .
of course , nuremberger gingerbread must be made in the traditional city , but the ingredients do not necessarily come from the region .
this has to do with the eu seal " trademarked geographical information " which is found on the product .
the product must only somehow be connected to the region .
if the danish farmer herds his sows to the black forest to be slaughtered , then it is a black forest ham .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feta cheese made by hand and sold in local shops in greece such policies harm those manufacturers who truly make traditional products in the traditional way . customers suffer as well because they purchase a product with a seal on it they assume to be accurate .
" that 's the only way to retain your customers and expand your business , " müller explained .
she would like germany to urge the eu to create uniform and easily understood labels .
also , consumers should be better protected so they are not deceived .
most importantly , everyone should know where everything in the refrigerator and pantries comes from . ralf lehnert -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " bio food " goes big in germany organic food has long been popular among germans , but while such products have been sold in small stores so far , supermarket-style venues focusing exclusively on so-called " bio food " are becoming more prevalent .

top designer says world cup design " just embarrassing " when baring it all is not enough could goleo 's musical career spell the end for pille ? europe -pipe- 23.01.2005 opinion : germany 's own goal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this the pinnacle of german design ?
hosting the 2006 world cup offers germany an unparalleled opportunity to present itself as a modern and attractive place to visit .
but with less than 18 months to go , the event 's organizers are failing miserably . often thought of as uncool and boring , germany has an international image problem .
people around the world frequently consider it a gray and uninviting place .
want passion or good weather in europe ?
look to france or italy .
dynamism or hipness ?
spain and britain top the list .
in comparison , stereotypes peg germany as an orderly yet utterly dull country . shaking such preconceptions can be difficult , but large sporting events can go a long way toward refashioning the popular image of a nation abroad .
portugal successfully used the last european soccer championship to shake off the notion of it as a sleepy backwater forever in spain 's shadow .
and despite big reservations about greek organizational skills , athens showed it could carry off the olympics without major problems . of course , as the eu 's largest country , germany is anything but a sleepy backwater .
and there is little doubt that the teutons will easily master the organizational aspects of the upcoming world cup .
but soccer 's most important competition is also arguably the planet 's biggest sporting party .
every four years , fans come together to celebrate " the beautiful game " and revel in a month-long multicultural soccer -lrb- or football , if you prefer -rrb- carnival . bildunterschrift : the logo for the 1974 world cup in west germany .
that makes hosting the spectacle a national marketing opportunity that comes but once in a generation .
germany last held the world cup in 1974 , when west germany even managed to win the tournament by defeating the netherlands in the finals . it will be a tall order for the german squad to repeat such a feat on its home turf this time around .
but regardless of the outcome on the pitch , germany still has the chance to present itself to the world as a modern , stylish and attractive country , banishing all-too-common perceptions of it as part of the unhippest corner of europe . so far , unfortunately , the german organizers are completely botching the job and risk losing the pr game before it really gets underway . undeniably , preparations are already in full swing a year and a half from kickoff .
the venues have been set and tickets will go on sale feb .
1 .
as with any major sporting event , the tournament also has its own official logo and mascot .
and that 's where the trouble begins . germany the tasteless bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the official 2006 logo in all its glory .
the logo , essentially the shop sign germany is hanging outside its door to the world , is anything but inviting .
instead of showing off sleek teutonic flair – like the logo in ' 74 – the new one ended up a horrendous orgy of form and color .
rather than come up with something original , someone has thrown together a few vapid smiley faces in an attempt to grin the world into submission . who created this masterpiece of dilettante design ?
franz beckenbauer 's 12-year-old niece ? one shutters to think what fifa and the german football association shelled out for its amateur loveliness .
especially since germany is chock full of creative graphic designers who could have come up with something better . so forget merchandizing revenue . this logo is so painful to look at , who in their right mind would buy a t-shirt with it emblazoned across the chest ?
you can almost hear foreign visitors in 2006 : " that 's the best they could come up with ?
my god it 's true , the germans really do n't have any taste . "
so much for shaking that image of being a land of mustard-colored blazers and mullets . mascot madness which brings me to goleo , a mustard-colored , mulleted lion recently presented as the world cup 's next official mascot .
looking like a furry version of a member of the german rock band the scorpions , he will do little to update the world 's preconceptions of what german soccer fans look like . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goleo , germany 's mullet-wearing , furry bundle of fun and his pal pille .
even beckenbauer , who had the unenviable task of introducing the lumbering lion to the world , said it was up to " personal taste " whether he was the right mascot for the job .
it does n't help matters that goleo 's sidekick is a plasticky talking ball named pille , which means " pill " in german and absolutely nothing to anybody else . but the ball is relatively harmless compared to the furry mullet .
one german friend has expressed concern about goleo 's penchant for strutting about without pants .
her fear is the mascot 's exhibitionist tendencies will reinforce the stereotype of germans that like to strip naked in public at a moment 's notice . despite the organizers ' lamentable marketing campaign , there is , of course , always hope that visitors to germany during the world cup will realize that there 's more to the country than design-challenged , mustard blazer-wearing , exhibitionists with mullets . just do n't count on the country 's famous beer to help set things right .
fifa has given the beverage concession during the tournament to america 's budweiser . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german beer at the world cup ?
ja , bitte !
germans revere soccer almost as much as they do their beer , so fans of both found it hard to swallow the news that only american beer would be sold in stadiums when germany hosts the world cup .
but things are looking up .
-lrb- dec .
21 , 2004 -rrb- a mascot for all seasons ?
goleo the lion was revealed as the official mascot for the 2006 world cup this weekend .
while fame and fortune beckons for the face of the soccer spectacular , goleo will find out it 's not all furry handshakes and waving .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 23.01.2005 buyer beware ! großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is that parma ham really from italy ?
the average german breakfast might consist of ham from the black forest , mozzarella cheese and salmon .
but are the germans certain where their groceries really come from ? with the recent economic uncertainty , germans are not exactly being free and easy with their wallets .
they are saving wherever they can - particularly on their grocery bill .
around 38 percent of all food stuffs are purchased at discount supermarkets .
and why not ?
the selection is big and the price is right .
hardly anything is lacking what the average , and sometimes above average , consumer wants - champagne , mozzarella cheese , balsamic vinegar and black forest ham .
in fact , you might think you are getting more than what you are paying for .
but the head of the federation of german consumer organizations , edda müller , has a different opinion .
" labels like balsamic vinegar , cheese from raw milk or salmon caught in the wild do n't always offer the consumer what they promise .
product names are often misleading and manufacturing information is frequently just an empty promise , " said müller .
you ca n't judge a salmon by its package bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this fisher most definitely knows where his fish came from the purported natural salmon was not always spawned in pristine rivers .
most raw milk cheese is no longer produced from milk that was brought to a maximum temperature of 40 degrees celsius .
natural balsamic vinegar - you can almost forget it .
even the most italian-looking packaging can not cover up the fact that only 15 percent of mozzarella cheese is made in the traditional manner .
the biggest problem is that most names are insufficiently trademarked or not at all .
that is also true for producers who try to make a product stand out by saying it is made a certain way .
for example , we do not necessarily have to believe the pastry maker who uses the phrase " own production , " that he took the time to knead the cake dough himself .
according to food industry laws , " production " means to prepare and process .
" even decorating a frozen cake with whipped cream is considered an act of preparation and hence own production , " said müller .
only made in the black forest if you buy black forest ham , you can not be 100 percent positive that the pig grew up in southwest germany .
of course , nuremberger gingerbread must be made in the traditional city , but the ingredients do not necessarily come from the region .
this has to do with the eu seal " trademarked geographical information " which is found on the product .
the product must only somehow be connected to the region .
if the danish farmer herds his sows to the black forest to be slaughtered , then it is a black forest ham .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feta cheese made by hand and sold in local shops in greece such policies harm those manufacturers who truly make traditional products in the traditional way . customers suffer as well because they purchase a product with a seal on it they assume to be accurate .
" that 's the only way to retain your customers and expand your business , " müller explained .
she would like germany to urge the eu to create uniform and easily understood labels .
also , consumers should be better protected so they are not deceived .
most importantly , everyone should know where everything in the refrigerator and pantries comes from . ralf lehnert -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " bio food " goes big in germany organic food has long been popular among germans , but while such products have been sold in small stores so far , supermarket-style venues focusing exclusively on so-called " bio food " are becoming more prevalent .

top designer says world cup design " just embarrassing " when baring it all is not enough could goleo 's musical career spell the end for pille ? europe -pipe- 23.01.2005 opinion : germany 's own goal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this the pinnacle of german design ?
hosting the 2006 world cup offers germany an unparalleled opportunity to present itself as a modern and attractive place to visit .
but with less than 18 months to go , the event 's organizers are failing miserably . often thought of as uncool and boring , germany has an international image problem .
people around the world frequently consider it a gray and uninviting place .
want passion or good weather in europe ?
look to france or italy .
dynamism or hipness ?
spain and britain top the list .
in comparison , stereotypes peg germany as an orderly yet utterly dull country . shaking such preconceptions can be difficult , but large sporting events can go a long way toward refashioning the popular image of a nation abroad .
portugal successfully used the last european soccer championship to shake off the notion of it as a sleepy backwater forever in spain 's shadow .
and despite big reservations about greek organizational skills , athens showed it could carry off the olympics without major problems . of course , as the eu 's largest country , germany is anything but a sleepy backwater .
and there is little doubt that the teutons will easily master the organizational aspects of the upcoming world cup .
but soccer 's most important competition is also arguably the planet 's biggest sporting party .
every four years , fans come together to celebrate " the beautiful game " and revel in a month-long multicultural soccer -lrb- or football , if you prefer -rrb- carnival . bildunterschrift : the logo for the 1974 world cup in west germany .
that makes hosting the spectacle a national marketing opportunity that comes but once in a generation .
germany last held the world cup in 1974 , when west germany even managed to win the tournament by defeating the netherlands in the finals . it will be a tall order for the german squad to repeat such a feat on its home turf this time around .
but regardless of the outcome on the pitch , germany still has the chance to present itself to the world as a modern , stylish and attractive country , banishing all-too-common perceptions of it as part of the unhippest corner of europe . so far , unfortunately , the german organizers are completely botching the job and risk losing the pr game before it really gets underway . undeniably , preparations are already in full swing a year and a half from kickoff .
the venues have been set and tickets will go on sale feb .
1 .
as with any major sporting event , the tournament also has its own official logo and mascot .
and that 's where the trouble begins . germany the tasteless bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the official 2006 logo in all its glory .
the logo , essentially the shop sign germany is hanging outside its door to the world , is anything but inviting .
instead of showing off sleek teutonic flair – like the logo in ' 74 – the new one ended up a horrendous orgy of form and color .
rather than come up with something original , someone has thrown together a few vapid smiley faces in an attempt to grin the world into submission . who created this masterpiece of dilettante design ?
franz beckenbauer 's 12-year-old niece ? one shutters to think what fifa and the german football association shelled out for its amateur loveliness .
especially since germany is chock full of creative graphic designers who could have come up with something better . so forget merchandizing revenue . this logo is so painful to look at , who in their right mind would buy a t-shirt with it emblazoned across the chest ?
you can almost hear foreign visitors in 2006 : " that 's the best they could come up with ?
my god it 's true , the germans really do n't have any taste . "
so much for shaking that image of being a land of mustard-colored blazers and mullets . mascot madness which brings me to goleo , a mustard-colored , mulleted lion recently presented as the world cup 's next official mascot .
looking like a furry version of a member of the german rock band the scorpions , he will do little to update the world 's preconceptions of what german soccer fans look like . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goleo , germany 's mullet-wearing , furry bundle of fun and his pal pille .
even beckenbauer , who had the unenviable task of introducing the lumbering lion to the world , said it was up to " personal taste " whether he was the right mascot for the job .
it does n't help matters that goleo 's sidekick is a plasticky talking ball named pille , which means " pill " in german and absolutely nothing to anybody else . but the ball is relatively harmless compared to the furry mullet .
one german friend has expressed concern about goleo 's penchant for strutting about without pants .
her fear is the mascot 's exhibitionist tendencies will reinforce the stereotype of germans that like to strip naked in public at a moment 's notice . despite the organizers ' lamentable marketing campaign , there is , of course , always hope that visitors to germany during the world cup will realize that there 's more to the country than design-challenged , mustard blazer-wearing , exhibitionists with mullets . just do n't count on the country 's famous beer to help set things right .
fifa has given the beverage concession during the tournament to america 's budweiser . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german beer at the world cup ?
ja , bitte !
germans revere soccer almost as much as they do their beer , so fans of both found it hard to swallow the news that only american beer would be sold in stadiums when germany hosts the world cup .
but things are looking up .

the average german breakfast might consist of ham from the black forest , mozzarella cheese and salmon .
but are the germans certain where their groceries really come from ? with the recent economic uncertainty , germans are not exactly being free and easy with their wallets .
they are saving wherever they can - particularly on their grocery bill .
around 38 percent of all food stuffs are purchased at discount supermarkets .
and why not ?
the selection is big and the price is right .
hardly anything is lacking what the average , and sometimes above average , consumer wants - champagne , mozzarella cheese , balsamic vinegar and black forest ham .
in fact , you might think you are getting more than what you are paying for .
but the head of the federation of german consumer organizations , edda müller , has a different opinion .
" labels like balsamic vinegar , cheese from raw milk or salmon caught in the wild do n't always offer the consumer what they promise .
product names are often misleading and manufacturing information is frequently just an empty promise , " said müller .
you ca n't judge a salmon by its package bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this fisher most definitely knows where his fish came from the purported natural salmon was not always spawned in pristine rivers .
most raw milk cheese is no longer produced from milk that was brought to a maximum temperature of 40 degrees celsius .
natural balsamic vinegar - you can almost forget it .
even the most italian-looking packaging can not cover up the fact that only 15 percent of mozzarella cheese is made in the traditional manner .
the biggest problem is that most names are insufficiently trademarked or not at all .
that is also true for producers who try to make a product stand out by saying it is made a certain way .
for example , we do not necessarily have to believe the pastry maker who uses the phrase " own production , " that he took the time to knead the cake dough himself .
according to food industry laws , " production " means to prepare and process .
" even decorating a frozen cake with whipped cream is considered an act of preparation and hence own production , " said müller .
only made in the black forest if you buy black forest ham , you can not be 100 percent positive that the pig grew up in southwest germany .
of course , nuremberger gingerbread must be made in the traditional city , but the ingredients do not necessarily come from the region .
this has to do with the eu seal " trademarked geographical information " which is found on the product .
the product must only somehow be connected to the region .
if the danish farmer herds his sows to the black forest to be slaughtered , then it is a black forest ham .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feta cheese made by hand and sold in local shops in greece such policies harm those manufacturers who truly make traditional products in the traditional way . customers suffer as well because they purchase a product with a seal on it they assume to be accurate .
" that 's the only way to retain your customers and expand your business , " müller explained .
she would like germany to urge the eu to create uniform and easily understood labels .
also , consumers should be better protected so they are not deceived .
most importantly , everyone should know where everything in the refrigerator and pantries comes from . ralf lehnert -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " bio food " goes big in germany organic food has long been popular among germans , but while such products have been sold in small stores so far , supermarket-style venues focusing exclusively on so-called " bio food " are becoming more prevalent .

the average german breakfast might consist of ham from the black forest , mozzarella cheese and salmon .
but are the germans certain where their groceries really come from ? with the recent economic uncertainty , germans are not exactly being free and easy with their wallets .
they are saving wherever they can - particularly on their grocery bill .
around 38 percent of all food stuffs are purchased at discount supermarkets .
and why not ?
the selection is big and the price is right .
hardly anything is lacking what the average , and sometimes above average , consumer wants - champagne , mozzarella cheese , balsamic vinegar and black forest ham .
in fact , you might think you are getting more than what you are paying for .
but the head of the federation of german consumer organizations , edda müller , has a different opinion .
" labels like balsamic vinegar , cheese from raw milk or salmon caught in the wild do n't always offer the consumer what they promise .
product names are often misleading and manufacturing information is frequently just an empty promise , " said müller .
you ca n't judge a salmon by its package bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this fisher most definitely knows where his fish came from the purported natural salmon was not always spawned in pristine rivers .
most raw milk cheese is no longer produced from milk that was brought to a maximum temperature of 40 degrees celsius .
natural balsamic vinegar - you can almost forget it .
even the most italian-looking packaging can not cover up the fact that only 15 percent of mozzarella cheese is made in the traditional manner .
the biggest problem is that most names are insufficiently trademarked or not at all .
that is also true for producers who try to make a product stand out by saying it is made a certain way .
for example , we do not necessarily have to believe the pastry maker who uses the phrase " own production , " that he took the time to knead the cake dough himself .
according to food industry laws , " production " means to prepare and process .
" even decorating a frozen cake with whipped cream is considered an act of preparation and hence own production , " said müller .
only made in the black forest if you buy black forest ham , you can not be 100 percent positive that the pig grew up in southwest germany .
of course , nuremberger gingerbread must be made in the traditional city , but the ingredients do not necessarily come from the region .
this has to do with the eu seal " trademarked geographical information " which is found on the product .
the product must only somehow be connected to the region .
if the danish farmer herds his sows to the black forest to be slaughtered , then it is a black forest ham .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feta cheese made by hand and sold in local shops in greece such policies harm those manufacturers who truly make traditional products in the traditional way . customers suffer as well because they purchase a product with a seal on it they assume to be accurate .
" that 's the only way to retain your customers and expand your business , " müller explained .
she would like germany to urge the eu to create uniform and easily understood labels .
also , consumers should be better protected so they are not deceived .
most importantly , everyone should know where everything in the refrigerator and pantries comes from . ralf lehnert -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " bio food " goes big in germany organic food has long been popular among germans , but while such products have been sold in small stores so far , supermarket-style venues focusing exclusively on so-called " bio food " are becoming more prevalent .

after enduring weeks of roller-coaster like chaos in his country , a life-threatening poisoning attack , election fraud and an appeal before the country ’ s supreme court , the 50-year-old hero of the “ orange revolution ” finally saw his ambitions realized on sunday when he was sworn in as ukraine ’ s president . with his hand on the constitution and the bible , yushchenko read aloud the oath of office during a parliament ceremony attended by hundreds of international guests , including outgoing us secretary of state colin powell , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer and presidents of several former soviet satellite states . georgian parliament president nino burjanadze , who arrived in kiev ahead of the official ceremonies , applauded yushchenko and the historic moment his inauguration embodied .
drawing a parallel to the “ rose revolution ” in georgia a year ago , she said , “ there are similarities between the two countries .
the people of georgia and ukraine have defended their right to free election and have taken the future into their own hands . ” a new direction for ukraine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands rallied in kiev 's central square throughout november and december to show support for opposition candidate yushchenko for yushchenko ’ s supporters , the thousands who had gathered tirelessly in the streets of kiev and throughout the country to protest election fraud after the first presidential ballot in november put the moscow-backed viktor yanukovych in the lead , sunday ’ s swearing-in ceremony marks the start of a new political orientation for ukraine . yushchenko , who takes over after a decade of authoritarian-leaning rule by leonid kuchma , has vowed to eradicate corruption and build a country with a transparent economy and institutions .
he aims to move his country closer to mainstream europe and cooperate more with the european union .

after enduring weeks of roller-coaster like chaos in his country , a life-threatening poisoning attack , election fraud and an appeal before the country ’ s supreme court , the 50-year-old hero of the “ orange revolution ” finally saw his ambitions realized on sunday when he was sworn in as ukraine ’ s president . with his hand on the constitution and the bible , yushchenko read aloud the oath of office during a parliament ceremony attended by hundreds of international guests , including outgoing us secretary of state colin powell , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer and presidents of several former soviet satellite states . georgian parliament president nino burjanadze , who arrived in kiev ahead of the official ceremonies , applauded yushchenko and the historic moment his inauguration embodied .

the average german breakfast might consist of ham from the black forest , mozzarella cheese and salmon .
but are the germans certain where their groceries really come from ? with the recent economic uncertainty , germans are not exactly being free and easy with their wallets .
they are saving wherever they can - particularly on their grocery bill .
around 38 percent of all food stuffs are purchased at discount supermarkets .
and why not ?
the selection is big and the price is right .
hardly anything is lacking what the average , and sometimes above average , consumer wants - champagne , mozzarella cheese , balsamic vinegar and black forest ham .
in fact , you might think you are getting more than what you are paying for .
but the head of the federation of german consumer organizations , edda müller , has a different opinion .
" labels like balsamic vinegar , cheese from raw milk or salmon caught in the wild do n't always offer the consumer what they promise .
product names are often misleading and manufacturing information is frequently just an empty promise , " said müller .
you ca n't judge a salmon by its package bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this fisher most definitely knows where his fish came from the purported natural salmon was not always spawned in pristine rivers .
most raw milk cheese is no longer produced from milk that was brought to a maximum temperature of 40 degrees celsius .
natural balsamic vinegar - you can almost forget it .
even the most italian-looking packaging can not cover up the fact that only 15 percent of mozzarella cheese is made in the traditional manner .
the biggest problem is that most names are insufficiently trademarked or not at all .
that is also true for producers who try to make a product stand out by saying it is made a certain way .
for example , we do not necessarily have to believe the pastry maker who uses the phrase " own production , " that he took the time to knead the cake dough himself .
according to food industry laws , " production " means to prepare and process .
" even decorating a frozen cake with whipped cream is considered an act of preparation and hence own production , " said müller .
only made in the black forest if you buy black forest ham , you can not be 100 percent positive that the pig grew up in southwest germany .
of course , nuremberger gingerbread must be made in the traditional city , but the ingredients do not necessarily come from the region .
this has to do with the eu seal " trademarked geographical information " which is found on the product .
the product must only somehow be connected to the region .
if the danish farmer herds his sows to the black forest to be slaughtered , then it is a black forest ham .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feta cheese made by hand and sold in local shops in greece such policies harm those manufacturers who truly make traditional products in the traditional way . customers suffer as well because they purchase a product with a seal on it they assume to be accurate .
" that 's the only way to retain your customers and expand your business , " müller explained .
she would like germany to urge the eu to create uniform and easily understood labels .
also , consumers should be better protected so they are not deceived .

the average german breakfast might consist of ham from the black forest , mozzarella cheese and salmon .
but are the germans certain where their groceries really come from ? with the recent economic uncertainty , germans are not exactly being free and easy with their wallets .
they are saving wherever they can - particularly on their grocery bill .
around 38 percent of all food stuffs are purchased at discount supermarkets .
and why not ?
the selection is big and the price is right .
hardly anything is lacking what the average , and sometimes above average , consumer wants - champagne , mozzarella cheese , balsamic vinegar and black forest ham .
in fact , you might think you are getting more than what you are paying for .
but the head of the federation of german consumer organizations , edda müller , has a different opinion .
" labels like balsamic vinegar , cheese from raw milk or salmon caught in the wild do n't always offer the consumer what they promise .
product names are often misleading and manufacturing information is frequently just an empty promise , " said müller .
you ca n't judge a salmon by its package bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this fisher most definitely knows where his fish came from the purported natural salmon was not always spawned in pristine rivers .
most raw milk cheese is no longer produced from milk that was brought to a maximum temperature of 40 degrees celsius .
natural balsamic vinegar - you can almost forget it .
even the most italian-looking packaging can not cover up the fact that only 15 percent of mozzarella cheese is made in the traditional manner .
the biggest problem is that most names are insufficiently trademarked or not at all .
that is also true for producers who try to make a product stand out by saying it is made a certain way .
for example , we do not necessarily have to believe the pastry maker who uses the phrase " own production , " that he took the time to knead the cake dough himself .
according to food industry laws , " production " means to prepare and process .
" even decorating a frozen cake with whipped cream is considered an act of preparation and hence own production , " said müller .
only made in the black forest if you buy black forest ham , you can not be 100 percent positive that the pig grew up in southwest germany .
of course , nuremberger gingerbread must be made in the traditional city , but the ingredients do not necessarily come from the region .
this has to do with the eu seal " trademarked geographical information " which is found on the product .
the product must only somehow be connected to the region .
if the danish farmer herds his sows to the black forest to be slaughtered , then it is a black forest ham .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feta cheese made by hand and sold in local shops in greece such policies harm those manufacturers who truly make traditional products in the traditional way . customers suffer as well because they purchase a product with a seal on it they assume to be accurate .
" that 's the only way to retain your customers and expand your business , " müller explained .
she would like germany to urge the eu to create uniform and easily understood labels .
also , consumers should be better protected so they are not deceived .

top designer says world cup design " just embarrassing " when baring it all is not enough could goleo 's musical career spell the end for pille ? europe -pipe- 23.01.2005 opinion : germany 's own goal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this the pinnacle of german design ?
hosting the 2006 world cup offers germany an unparalleled opportunity to present itself as a modern and attractive place to visit .
but with less than 18 months to go , the event 's organizers are failing miserably . often thought of as uncool and boring , germany has an international image problem .
people around the world frequently consider it a gray and uninviting place .
want passion or good weather in europe ?
look to france or italy .
dynamism or hipness ?
spain and britain top the list .
in comparison , stereotypes peg germany as an orderly yet utterly dull country . shaking such preconceptions can be difficult , but large sporting events can go a long way toward refashioning the popular image of a nation abroad .
portugal successfully used the last european soccer championship to shake off the notion of it as a sleepy backwater forever in spain 's shadow .
and despite big reservations about greek organizational skills , athens showed it could carry off the olympics without major problems . of course , as the eu 's largest country , germany is anything but a sleepy backwater .
and there is little doubt that the teutons will easily master the organizational aspects of the upcoming world cup .
but soccer 's most important competition is also arguably the planet 's biggest sporting party .
every four years , fans come together to celebrate " the beautiful game " and revel in a month-long multicultural soccer -lrb- or football , if you prefer -rrb- carnival . bildunterschrift : the logo for the 1974 world cup in west germany .
that makes hosting the spectacle a national marketing opportunity that comes but once in a generation .
germany last held the world cup in 1974 , when west germany even managed to win the tournament by defeating the netherlands in the finals . it will be a tall order for the german squad to repeat such a feat on its home turf this time around .
but regardless of the outcome on the pitch , germany still has the chance to present itself to the world as a modern , stylish and attractive country , banishing all-too-common perceptions of it as part of the unhippest corner of europe . so far , unfortunately , the german organizers are completely botching the job and risk losing the pr game before it really gets underway . undeniably , preparations are already in full swing a year and a half from kickoff .
the venues have been set and tickets will go on sale feb .
1 .
as with any major sporting event , the tournament also has its own official logo and mascot .
and that 's where the trouble begins . germany the tasteless bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the official 2006 logo in all its glory .
the logo , essentially the shop sign germany is hanging outside its door to the world , is anything but inviting .
instead of showing off sleek teutonic flair – like the logo in ' 74 – the new one ended up a horrendous orgy of form and color .
rather than come up with something original , someone has thrown together a few vapid smiley faces in an attempt to grin the world into submission . who created this masterpiece of dilettante design ?
franz beckenbauer 's 12-year-old niece ? one shutters to think what fifa and the german football association shelled out for its amateur loveliness .
especially since germany is chock full of creative graphic designers who could have come up with something better . so forget merchandizing revenue . this logo is so painful to look at , who in their right mind would buy a t-shirt with it emblazoned across the chest ?
you can almost hear foreign visitors in 2006 : " that 's the best they could come up with ?
my god it 's true , the germans really do n't have any taste . "
so much for shaking that image of being a land of mustard-colored blazers and mullets . mascot madness which brings me to goleo , a mustard-colored , mulleted lion recently presented as the world cup 's next official mascot .
looking like a furry version of a member of the german rock band the scorpions , he will do little to update the world 's preconceptions of what german soccer fans look like . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goleo , germany 's mullet-wearing , furry bundle of fun and his pal pille .
even beckenbauer , who had the unenviable task of introducing the lumbering lion to the world , said it was up to " personal taste " whether he was the right mascot for the job .
it does n't help matters that goleo 's sidekick is a plasticky talking ball named pille , which means " pill " in german and absolutely nothing to anybody else . but the ball is relatively harmless compared to the furry mullet .
one german friend has expressed concern about goleo 's penchant for strutting about without pants .
her fear is the mascot 's exhibitionist tendencies will reinforce the stereotype of germans that like to strip naked in public at a moment 's notice . despite the organizers ' lamentable marketing campaign , there is , of course , always hope that visitors to germany during the world cup will realize that there 's more to the country than design-challenged , mustard blazer-wearing , exhibitionists with mullets . just do n't count on the country 's famous beer to help set things right .
fifa has given the beverage concession during the tournament to america 's budweiser . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german beer at the world cup ?
ja , bitte !
germans revere soccer almost as much as they do their beer , so fans of both found it hard to swallow the news that only american beer would be sold in stadiums when germany hosts the world cup .
but things are looking up .
-lrb- dec .
21 , 2004 -rrb- a mascot for all seasons ?
goleo the lion was revealed as the official mascot for the 2006 world cup this weekend .
while fame and fortune beckons for the face of the soccer spectacular , goleo will find out it 's not all furry handshakes and waving .

but that is not to say there are no good home-grown movies out there . alles auf zucker !
-lrb- everything for sugar ! -rrb- jakob zuckermann is down on his luck .
the bailiffs are threatening to lock him up and his wife , marlene , is threatening divorce .
the only way the pool player sees to get out of his mess is to enter a contest and scoop the € 100,000 prize money .
but shortly before the tournament kicks off , his mother dies .
her will stipulates that her sons , who have been arch enemies for the past 40 years , can only claim her savings if they reconcile their differences and bring their families to hold a week long jewish vigil over her dead body .
while marlene takes a crash course in the intricacies of being jewish , and sweats over supplying the estranged and orthodox relations with kosher fare , jakob has another problem altogether .
the pool tournament has just started … die fetten jahre sind vorbei -lrb- the edukators -rrb- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans weingartner , director of " die fetten jahre sind vorbei " in his second film offering , director hans weingartner , who won several prizes and loud critical acclaim for his debut movie " the white sound , " tells the story of an accidental abduction . two friends , jan and peter are sick of the uneven distribution of world wealth , and in a bid to make a small difference , they break into villas at night .
they do n't steal , but simply tip furniture upside down , and leave messages such as " the good times are over , " or " you have too much money , " signing off as " the educators . "
jan and julia , who is actually romantically involved with peter , fall in love , and break into a villa together .
they are caught red-handed by the owner , and in the absence of any kind of plan , inadvertently become kidnappers . napola -lrb- the führer 's elite -rrb- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene photo from " napola - the führer 's elite " it 's 1942 in nazi germany .
friedrich weimer is a talented 17-year-old boxer from a working-class district of berlin .
his abilities open the door for him to attend a national political establishment , napola , designed to shape the future elite of the third reich .
in this foreign world , run according to the rules of nazi law and order , friedrich learns about competitive fighting and unexpected comradeship .
his participation in a horrific deployment against escaped prisoners of war , and his growing friendship with albrecht stein , the quiet and sensitive son of a nazi district leader , force him to make a decision which will write the closing chapter on his youth . schneeland -lrb- snowland -rrb- bildunterschrift : the poetry of snow is a silent character in schneeland this film by hans w. giessendörfer has been described as a modern gothic tale of lives that inhabit the darkest realms of humanity , while they struggle to find meaning and deep love .
nominated for the prestigious max ophüls prize , the movie tells the story of the writer , elisabeth , who is left alone with her three children after her husband is killed in a car accident .

the average german breakfast might consist of ham from the black forest , mozzarella cheese and salmon .
but are the germans certain where their groceries really come from ? with the recent economic uncertainty , germans are not exactly being free and easy with their wallets .
they are saving wherever they can - particularly on their grocery bill .
around 38 percent of all food stuffs are purchased at discount supermarkets .
and why not ?
the selection is big and the price is right .
hardly anything is lacking what the average , and sometimes above average , consumer wants - champagne , mozzarella cheese , balsamic vinegar and black forest ham .
in fact , you might think you are getting more than what you are paying for .
but the head of the federation of german consumer organizations , edda müller , has a different opinion .
" labels like balsamic vinegar , cheese from raw milk or salmon caught in the wild do n't always offer the consumer what they promise .
product names are often misleading and manufacturing information is frequently just an empty promise , " said müller .
you ca n't judge a salmon by its package bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this fisher most definitely knows where his fish came from the purported natural salmon was not always spawned in pristine rivers .
most raw milk cheese is no longer produced from milk that was brought to a maximum temperature of 40 degrees celsius .
natural balsamic vinegar - you can almost forget it .
even the most italian-looking packaging can not cover up the fact that only 15 percent of mozzarella cheese is made in the traditional manner .
the biggest problem is that most names are insufficiently trademarked or not at all .
that is also true for producers who try to make a product stand out by saying it is made a certain way .
for example , we do not necessarily have to believe the pastry maker who uses the phrase " own production , " that he took the time to knead the cake dough himself .
according to food industry laws , " production " means to prepare and process .
" even decorating a frozen cake with whipped cream is considered an act of preparation and hence own production , " said müller .
only made in the black forest if you buy black forest ham , you can not be 100 percent positive that the pig grew up in southwest germany .
of course , nuremberger gingerbread must be made in the traditional city , but the ingredients do not necessarily come from the region .
this has to do with the eu seal " trademarked geographical information " which is found on the product .
the product must only somehow be connected to the region .
if the danish farmer herds his sows to the black forest to be slaughtered , then it is a black forest ham .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feta cheese made by hand and sold in local shops in greece such policies harm those manufacturers who truly make traditional products in the traditional way . customers suffer as well because they purchase a product with a seal on it they assume to be accurate .
" that 's the only way to retain your customers and expand your business , " müller explained .
she would like germany to urge the eu to create uniform and easily understood labels .
also , consumers should be better protected so they are not deceived .
most importantly , everyone should know where everything in the refrigerator and pantries comes from . ralf lehnert -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " bio food " goes big in germany organic food has long been popular among germans , but while such products have been sold in small stores so far , supermarket-style venues focusing exclusively on so-called " bio food " are becoming more prevalent .

the average german breakfast might consist of ham from the black forest , mozzarella cheese and salmon .
but are the germans certain where their groceries really come from ? with the recent economic uncertainty , germans are not exactly being free and easy with their wallets .
they are saving wherever they can - particularly on their grocery bill .
around 38 percent of all food stuffs are purchased at discount supermarkets .
and why not ?
the selection is big and the price is right .
hardly anything is lacking what the average , and sometimes above average , consumer wants - champagne , mozzarella cheese , balsamic vinegar and black forest ham .
in fact , you might think you are getting more than what you are paying for .
but the head of the federation of german consumer organizations , edda müller , has a different opinion .
" labels like balsamic vinegar , cheese from raw milk or salmon caught in the wild do n't always offer the consumer what they promise .
product names are often misleading and manufacturing information is frequently just an empty promise , " said müller .
you ca n't judge a salmon by its package bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this fisher most definitely knows where his fish came from the purported natural salmon was not always spawned in pristine rivers .
most raw milk cheese is no longer produced from milk that was brought to a maximum temperature of 40 degrees celsius .
natural balsamic vinegar - you can almost forget it .
even the most italian-looking packaging can not cover up the fact that only 15 percent of mozzarella cheese is made in the traditional manner .
the biggest problem is that most names are insufficiently trademarked or not at all .
that is also true for producers who try to make a product stand out by saying it is made a certain way .
for example , we do not necessarily have to believe the pastry maker who uses the phrase " own production , " that he took the time to knead the cake dough himself .
according to food industry laws , " production " means to prepare and process .
" even decorating a frozen cake with whipped cream is considered an act of preparation and hence own production , " said müller .
only made in the black forest if you buy black forest ham , you can not be 100 percent positive that the pig grew up in southwest germany .
of course , nuremberger gingerbread must be made in the traditional city , but the ingredients do not necessarily come from the region .
this has to do with the eu seal " trademarked geographical information " which is found on the product .
the product must only somehow be connected to the region .
if the danish farmer herds his sows to the black forest to be slaughtered , then it is a black forest ham .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feta cheese made by hand and sold in local shops in greece such policies harm those manufacturers who truly make traditional products in the traditional way . customers suffer as well because they purchase a product with a seal on it they assume to be accurate .
" that 's the only way to retain your customers and expand your business , " müller explained .
she would like germany to urge the eu to create uniform and easily understood labels .
also , consumers should be better protected so they are not deceived .
most importantly , everyone should know where everything in the refrigerator and pantries comes from . ralf lehnert -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " bio food " goes big in germany organic food has long been popular among germans , but while such products have been sold in small stores so far , supermarket-style venues focusing exclusively on so-called " bio food " are becoming more prevalent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 23.01.2005 buyer beware ! großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is that parma ham really from italy ?
the average german breakfast might consist of ham from the black forest , mozzarella cheese and salmon .
but are the germans certain where their groceries really come from ? with the recent economic uncertainty , germans are not exactly being free and easy with their wallets .
they are saving wherever they can - particularly on their grocery bill .
around 38 percent of all food stuffs are purchased at discount supermarkets .
and why not ?
the selection is big and the price is right .
hardly anything is lacking what the average , and sometimes above average , consumer wants - champagne , mozzarella cheese , balsamic vinegar and black forest ham .
in fact , you might think you are getting more than what you are paying for .
but the head of the federation of german consumer organizations , edda müller , has a different opinion .
" labels like balsamic vinegar , cheese from raw milk or salmon caught in the wild do n't always offer the consumer what they promise .
product names are often misleading and manufacturing information is frequently just an empty promise , " said müller .
you ca n't judge a salmon by its package bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this fisher most definitely knows where his fish came from the purported natural salmon was not always spawned in pristine rivers .
most raw milk cheese is no longer produced from milk that was brought to a maximum temperature of 40 degrees celsius .
natural balsamic vinegar - you can almost forget it .
even the most italian-looking packaging can not cover up the fact that only 15 percent of mozzarella cheese is made in the traditional manner .
the biggest problem is that most names are insufficiently trademarked or not at all .
that is also true for producers who try to make a product stand out by saying it is made a certain way .
for example , we do not necessarily have to believe the pastry maker who uses the phrase " own production , " that he took the time to knead the cake dough himself .
according to food industry laws , " production " means to prepare and process .
" even decorating a frozen cake with whipped cream is considered an act of preparation and hence own production , " said müller .
only made in the black forest if you buy black forest ham , you can not be 100 percent positive that the pig grew up in southwest germany .
of course , nuremberger gingerbread must be made in the traditional city , but the ingredients do not necessarily come from the region .
this has to do with the eu seal " trademarked geographical information " which is found on the product .
the product must only somehow be connected to the region .
if the danish farmer herds his sows to the black forest to be slaughtered , then it is a black forest ham .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feta cheese made by hand and sold in local shops in greece such policies harm those manufacturers who truly make traditional products in the traditional way . customers suffer as well because they purchase a product with a seal on it they assume to be accurate .
" that 's the only way to retain your customers and expand your business , " müller explained .
she would like germany to urge the eu to create uniform and easily understood labels .
also , consumers should be better protected so they are not deceived .
most importantly , everyone should know where everything in the refrigerator and pantries comes from . ralf lehnert -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " bio food " goes big in germany organic food has long been popular among germans , but while such products have been sold in small stores so far , supermarket-style venues focusing exclusively on so-called " bio food " are becoming more prevalent .

payments for the survivors should now be completed by the end of the year . though their numbers are dwindling , there are still about 1.7 million people who were forced to work in german companies during the nazi regime and who could receive up to € 7,600 -lrb- $ 9,838 -rrb- from the four-year-old , € 5.12-billion remembrance , responsibility and future foundation , equally financed by the german government and an organization of german businesses .
" we expect the payments to come to a close by the end of the year , " the foundation 's director said last week , ahead of the start of a series of ceremonies commemorating the 60th anniversary of germany 's defeat in 1945 .
funds still available so far € 3.84 billion have been paid to about 1.63 million forced laborers or their descendants , and about 500,000 claims have been denied .
there are about € 387 million in interest still available .
in exchange for the payments the companies that participated in the organization received protection from further legal action . " the leading german industrials owe forced laborers because they were worked to death , " said benjamin ferencz , one of the prosecutors in the nuremberg war crimes tribunal in 1945 .
" one of the labors told me ' we were treated worse than slaves , you try to keep slaves alive .
we were like sandpaper : used , thrown away and burnt with the garbage . " '
firms profited from slave labor though the nazi regime lost the war , german companies profited from slave labor . german industrial wealth was 17 times larger after the war than in 1939 , according to economic historian dietrich eichholz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf hitler speaks at the opening ceremony of the volkswagen car factory in fallersleben , lower saxony , may 26 , 1938 .
in order to keep up production from 1939 to 1941 , as more and more men were being called up for military service , german companies needed 1.2 million workers , and they came in the form of forced laborers .
in all , there were about 12 million people taken from german occupied territory to serve as forced laborers during the world war ii .
for decades the companies ' executive boards got around paying victims compensation by saying they were compelled to use slave labors .
that , in turn , makes the german government , not the businesses themselves , responsible for remuneration .
courts raise pressure pressure built up in the 1990s after class-action suits were filed in the united states against a number of large german firms , including bmw , daimler-benz , deutsche bank , siemens and volkswagen - all companies that played important roles in the holocaust , according to new york lawyer edward fagan .
there were billions at stake for the companies involved in the law suits , as well as an immense public relations problem .
to solve those problems the companies set up the remembrance , responsibility and future foundation with the government .
" i have recently spoken with about 20 forced laborers from poland , and the reaction is very positive , " said michael jansen , who was the foundation 's head until the end of last year .
" for many of the older people who are living on very limited means , this is like a lotto win , and they are very glad that we are helping them .

the foundation responsible for the payments is running out of time .
-lrb- june 25 , 2004 -rrb- nazi forced laborers receive compensation more than 1.5 million people have so far received payments totalling € 2.6 billion from a german compensation fund for nazi-era forced laborers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 23.01.2005 buyer beware ! großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is that parma ham really from italy ?
the average german breakfast might consist of ham from the black forest , mozzarella cheese and salmon .
but are the germans certain where their groceries really come from ? with the recent economic uncertainty , germans are not exactly being free and easy with their wallets .
they are saving wherever they can - particularly on their grocery bill .
around 38 percent of all food stuffs are purchased at discount supermarkets .
and why not ?
the selection is big and the price is right .
hardly anything is lacking what the average , and sometimes above average , consumer wants - champagne , mozzarella cheese , balsamic vinegar and black forest ham .
in fact , you might think you are getting more than what you are paying for .
but the head of the federation of german consumer organizations , edda müller , has a different opinion .
" labels like balsamic vinegar , cheese from raw milk or salmon caught in the wild do n't always offer the consumer what they promise .
product names are often misleading and manufacturing information is frequently just an empty promise , " said müller .
you ca n't judge a salmon by its package bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this fisher most definitely knows where his fish came from the purported natural salmon was not always spawned in pristine rivers .
most raw milk cheese is no longer produced from milk that was brought to a maximum temperature of 40 degrees celsius .
natural balsamic vinegar - you can almost forget it .
even the most italian-looking packaging can not cover up the fact that only 15 percent of mozzarella cheese is made in the traditional manner .
the biggest problem is that most names are insufficiently trademarked or not at all .
that is also true for producers who try to make a product stand out by saying it is made a certain way .
for example , we do not necessarily have to believe the pastry maker who uses the phrase " own production , " that he took the time to knead the cake dough himself .
according to food industry laws , " production " means to prepare and process .
" even decorating a frozen cake with whipped cream is considered an act of preparation and hence own production , " said müller .
only made in the black forest if you buy black forest ham , you can not be 100 percent positive that the pig grew up in southwest germany .
of course , nuremberger gingerbread must be made in the traditional city , but the ingredients do not necessarily come from the region .
this has to do with the eu seal " trademarked geographical information " which is found on the product .
the product must only somehow be connected to the region .
if the danish farmer herds his sows to the black forest to be slaughtered , then it is a black forest ham .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feta cheese made by hand and sold in local shops in greece such policies harm those manufacturers who truly make traditional products in the traditional way . customers suffer as well because they purchase a product with a seal on it they assume to be accurate .
" that 's the only way to retain your customers and expand your business , " müller explained .
she would like germany to urge the eu to create uniform and easily understood labels .
also , consumers should be better protected so they are not deceived .
most importantly , everyone should know where everything in the refrigerator and pantries comes from . ralf lehnert -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " bio food " goes big in germany organic food has long been popular among germans , but while such products have been sold in small stores so far , supermarket-style venues focusing exclusively on so-called " bio food " are becoming more prevalent .

there were billions at stake for the companies involved in the law suits , as well as an immense public relations problem .
to solve those problems the companies set up the remembrance , responsibility and future foundation with the government .
" i have recently spoken with about 20 forced laborers from poland , and the reaction is very positive , " said michael jansen , who was the foundation 's head until the end of last year .

you can almost hear foreign visitors in 2006 : " that 's the best they could come up with ?
my god it 's true , the germans really do n't have any taste . "
so much for shaking that image of being a land of mustard-colored blazers and mullets . mascot madness which brings me to goleo , a mustard-colored , mulleted lion recently presented as the world cup 's next official mascot .

it does n't help matters that goleo 's sidekick is a plasticky talking ball named pille , which means " pill " in german and absolutely nothing to anybody else . but the ball is relatively harmless compared to the furry mullet .
one german friend has expressed concern about goleo 's penchant for strutting about without pants .
her fear is the mascot 's exhibitionist tendencies will reinforce the stereotype of germans that like to strip naked in public at a moment 's notice . despite the organizers ' lamentable marketing campaign , there is , of course , always hope that visitors to germany during the world cup will realize that there 's more to the country than design-challenged , mustard blazer-wearing , exhibitionists with mullets . just do n't count on the country 's famous beer to help set things right .

top designer says world cup design " just embarrassing " when baring it all is not enough could goleo 's musical career spell the end for pille ? europe -pipe- 23.01.2005 opinion : germany 's own goal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this the pinnacle of german design ?
hosting the 2006 world cup offers germany an unparalleled opportunity to present itself as a modern and attractive place to visit .
but with less than 18 months to go , the event 's organizers are failing miserably . often thought of as uncool and boring , germany has an international image problem .
people around the world frequently consider it a gray and uninviting place .
want passion or good weather in europe ?
look to france or italy .
dynamism or hipness ?
spain and britain top the list .
in comparison , stereotypes peg germany as an orderly yet utterly dull country . shaking such preconceptions can be difficult , but large sporting events can go a long way toward refashioning the popular image of a nation abroad .
portugal successfully used the last european soccer championship to shake off the notion of it as a sleepy backwater forever in spain 's shadow .
and despite big reservations about greek organizational skills , athens showed it could carry off the olympics without major problems . of course , as the eu 's largest country , germany is anything but a sleepy backwater .
and there is little doubt that the teutons will easily master the organizational aspects of the upcoming world cup .
but soccer 's most important competition is also arguably the planet 's biggest sporting party .
every four years , fans come together to celebrate " the beautiful game " and revel in a month-long multicultural soccer -lrb- or football , if you prefer -rrb- carnival . bildunterschrift : the logo for the 1974 world cup in west germany .
that makes hosting the spectacle a national marketing opportunity that comes but once in a generation .
germany last held the world cup in 1974 , when west germany even managed to win the tournament by defeating the netherlands in the finals . it will be a tall order for the german squad to repeat such a feat on its home turf this time around .
but regardless of the outcome on the pitch , germany still has the chance to present itself to the world as a modern , stylish and attractive country , banishing all-too-common perceptions of it as part of the unhippest corner of europe . so far , unfortunately , the german organizers are completely botching the job and risk losing the pr game before it really gets underway . undeniably , preparations are already in full swing a year and a half from kickoff .
the venues have been set and tickets will go on sale feb .
1 .
as with any major sporting event , the tournament also has its own official logo and mascot .
and that 's where the trouble begins . germany the tasteless bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the official 2006 logo in all its glory .
the logo , essentially the shop sign germany is hanging outside its door to the world , is anything but inviting .
instead of showing off sleek teutonic flair – like the logo in ' 74 – the new one ended up a horrendous orgy of form and color .
rather than come up with something original , someone has thrown together a few vapid smiley faces in an attempt to grin the world into submission . who created this masterpiece of dilettante design ?
franz beckenbauer 's 12-year-old niece ? one shutters to think what fifa and the german football association shelled out for its amateur loveliness .
especially since germany is chock full of creative graphic designers who could have come up with something better . so forget merchandizing revenue . this logo is so painful to look at , who in their right mind would buy a t-shirt with it emblazoned across the chest ?

the average german breakfast might consist of ham from the black forest , mozzarella cheese and salmon .
but are the germans certain where their groceries really come from ? with the recent economic uncertainty , germans are not exactly being free and easy with their wallets .
they are saving wherever they can - particularly on their grocery bill .
around 38 percent of all food stuffs are purchased at discount supermarkets .
and why not ?
the selection is big and the price is right .
hardly anything is lacking what the average , and sometimes above average , consumer wants - champagne , mozzarella cheese , balsamic vinegar and black forest ham .
in fact , you might think you are getting more than what you are paying for .
but the head of the federation of german consumer organizations , edda müller , has a different opinion .
" labels like balsamic vinegar , cheese from raw milk or salmon caught in the wild do n't always offer the consumer what they promise .
product names are often misleading and manufacturing information is frequently just an empty promise , " said müller .
you ca n't judge a salmon by its package bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this fisher most definitely knows where his fish came from the purported natural salmon was not always spawned in pristine rivers .
most raw milk cheese is no longer produced from milk that was brought to a maximum temperature of 40 degrees celsius .
natural balsamic vinegar - you can almost forget it .
even the most italian-looking packaging can not cover up the fact that only 15 percent of mozzarella cheese is made in the traditional manner .
the biggest problem is that most names are insufficiently trademarked or not at all .
that is also true for producers who try to make a product stand out by saying it is made a certain way .
for example , we do not necessarily have to believe the pastry maker who uses the phrase " own production , " that he took the time to knead the cake dough himself .
according to food industry laws , " production " means to prepare and process .
" even decorating a frozen cake with whipped cream is considered an act of preparation and hence own production , " said müller .
only made in the black forest if you buy black forest ham , you can not be 100 percent positive that the pig grew up in southwest germany .
of course , nuremberger gingerbread must be made in the traditional city , but the ingredients do not necessarily come from the region .
this has to do with the eu seal " trademarked geographical information " which is found on the product .
the product must only somehow be connected to the region .
if the danish farmer herds his sows to the black forest to be slaughtered , then it is a black forest ham .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feta cheese made by hand and sold in local shops in greece such policies harm those manufacturers who truly make traditional products in the traditional way . customers suffer as well because they purchase a product with a seal on it they assume to be accurate .
" that 's the only way to retain your customers and expand your business , " müller explained .
she would like germany to urge the eu to create uniform and easily understood labels .

payments for the survivors should now be completed by the end of the year . though their numbers are dwindling , there are still about 1.7 million people who were forced to work in german companies during the nazi regime and who could receive up to € 7,600 -lrb- $ 9,838 -rrb- from the four-year-old , € 5.12-billion remembrance , responsibility and future foundation , equally financed by the german government and an organization of german businesses .
" we expect the payments to come to a close by the end of the year , " the foundation 's director said last week , ahead of the start of a series of ceremonies commemorating the 60th anniversary of germany 's defeat in 1945 .
funds still available so far € 3.84 billion have been paid to about 1.63 million forced laborers or their descendants , and about 500,000 claims have been denied .
there are about € 387 million in interest still available .
in exchange for the payments the companies that participated in the organization received protection from further legal action . " the leading german industrials owe forced laborers because they were worked to death , " said benjamin ferencz , one of the prosecutors in the nuremberg war crimes tribunal in 1945 .
" one of the labors told me ' we were treated worse than slaves , you try to keep slaves alive .
we were like sandpaper : used , thrown away and burnt with the garbage . " '
firms profited from slave labor though the nazi regime lost the war , german companies profited from slave labor . german industrial wealth was 17 times larger after the war than in 1939 , according to economic historian dietrich eichholz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf hitler speaks at the opening ceremony of the volkswagen car factory in fallersleben , lower saxony , may 26 , 1938 .
in order to keep up production from 1939 to 1941 , as more and more men were being called up for military service , german companies needed 1.2 million workers , and they came in the form of forced laborers .
in all , there were about 12 million people taken from german occupied territory to serve as forced laborers during the world war ii .
for decades the companies ' executive boards got around paying victims compensation by saying they were compelled to use slave labors .
that , in turn , makes the german government , not the businesses themselves , responsible for remuneration .
courts raise pressure pressure built up in the 1990s after class-action suits were filed in the united states against a number of large german firms , including bmw , daimler-benz , deutsche bank , siemens and volkswagen - all companies that played important roles in the holocaust , according to new york lawyer edward fagan .
there were billions at stake for the companies involved in the law suits , as well as an immense public relations problem .
to solve those problems the companies set up the remembrance , responsibility and future foundation with the government .
" i have recently spoken with about 20 forced laborers from poland , and the reaction is very positive , " said michael jansen , who was the foundation 's head until the end of last year .

top designer says world cup design " just embarrassing " when baring it all is not enough could goleo 's musical career spell the end for pille ? europe -pipe- 23.01.2005 opinion : germany 's own goal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this the pinnacle of german design ?
hosting the 2006 world cup offers germany an unparalleled opportunity to present itself as a modern and attractive place to visit .
but with less than 18 months to go , the event 's organizers are failing miserably . often thought of as uncool and boring , germany has an international image problem .
people around the world frequently consider it a gray and uninviting place .
want passion or good weather in europe ?
look to france or italy .
dynamism or hipness ?
spain and britain top the list .
in comparison , stereotypes peg germany as an orderly yet utterly dull country . shaking such preconceptions can be difficult , but large sporting events can go a long way toward refashioning the popular image of a nation abroad .
portugal successfully used the last european soccer championship to shake off the notion of it as a sleepy backwater forever in spain 's shadow .
and despite big reservations about greek organizational skills , athens showed it could carry off the olympics without major problems . of course , as the eu 's largest country , germany is anything but a sleepy backwater .
and there is little doubt that the teutons will easily master the organizational aspects of the upcoming world cup .
but soccer 's most important competition is also arguably the planet 's biggest sporting party .
every four years , fans come together to celebrate " the beautiful game " and revel in a month-long multicultural soccer -lrb- or football , if you prefer -rrb- carnival . bildunterschrift : the logo for the 1974 world cup in west germany .
that makes hosting the spectacle a national marketing opportunity that comes but once in a generation .
germany last held the world cup in 1974 , when west germany even managed to win the tournament by defeating the netherlands in the finals . it will be a tall order for the german squad to repeat such a feat on its home turf this time around .
but regardless of the outcome on the pitch , germany still has the chance to present itself to the world as a modern , stylish and attractive country , banishing all-too-common perceptions of it as part of the unhippest corner of europe . so far , unfortunately , the german organizers are completely botching the job and risk losing the pr game before it really gets underway . undeniably , preparations are already in full swing a year and a half from kickoff .
the venues have been set and tickets will go on sale feb .
1 .
as with any major sporting event , the tournament also has its own official logo and mascot .
and that 's where the trouble begins . germany the tasteless bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the official 2006 logo in all its glory .
the logo , essentially the shop sign germany is hanging outside its door to the world , is anything but inviting .
instead of showing off sleek teutonic flair – like the logo in ' 74 – the new one ended up a horrendous orgy of form and color .
rather than come up with something original , someone has thrown together a few vapid smiley faces in an attempt to grin the world into submission . who created this masterpiece of dilettante design ?
franz beckenbauer 's 12-year-old niece ? one shutters to think what fifa and the german football association shelled out for its amateur loveliness .
especially since germany is chock full of creative graphic designers who could have come up with something better . so forget merchandizing revenue . this logo is so painful to look at , who in their right mind would buy a t-shirt with it emblazoned across the chest ?
you can almost hear foreign visitors in 2006 : " that 's the best they could come up with ?
my god it 's true , the germans really do n't have any taste . "
so much for shaking that image of being a land of mustard-colored blazers and mullets . mascot madness which brings me to goleo , a mustard-colored , mulleted lion recently presented as the world cup 's next official mascot .
looking like a furry version of a member of the german rock band the scorpions , he will do little to update the world 's preconceptions of what german soccer fans look like . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goleo , germany 's mullet-wearing , furry bundle of fun and his pal pille .
even beckenbauer , who had the unenviable task of introducing the lumbering lion to the world , said it was up to " personal taste " whether he was the right mascot for the job .
it does n't help matters that goleo 's sidekick is a plasticky talking ball named pille , which means " pill " in german and absolutely nothing to anybody else . but the ball is relatively harmless compared to the furry mullet .
one german friend has expressed concern about goleo 's penchant for strutting about without pants .
her fear is the mascot 's exhibitionist tendencies will reinforce the stereotype of germans that like to strip naked in public at a moment 's notice . despite the organizers ' lamentable marketing campaign , there is , of course , always hope that visitors to germany during the world cup will realize that there 's more to the country than design-challenged , mustard blazer-wearing , exhibitionists with mullets . just do n't count on the country 's famous beer to help set things right .
fifa has given the beverage concession during the tournament to america 's budweiser . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german beer at the world cup ?

by matthew davis bbc news should the allies have heeded calls to bomb auschwitz when they learnt the full horror of the nazi holocaust ?
it is one of the enduring controversies of world war ii .
by the summer of 1944 , detailed information about the true nature of the death camps had reached the west , but it was not until months later that auschwitz was finally liberated by the advancing red army .
during that time , thousands more had perished in the gas chambers . "
no-one was bothered enough to make bombing auschwitz a priority " laurence rees historian and television producer whether a precision strike was militarily possible or would have been effective in halting the killings is still hotly contested .
but many - including survivors of the camp - say the allies should have acted whatever the mission 's chances of success .
the debate also leads to wider questions of why more was not done around the world to save the jews from nazi persecution .
pressure to act information about auschwitz reached new levels of detail following the escapes of two prisoners in april 1944 , and two more a month later .
their combined testimonies formed the basis of documents known as the auschwitz protocols .
by june 1944 , jewish groups were imploring both us president franklin delano roosevelt and uk prime minister winston churchill to bomb the rail lines or the gas chambers in order to put a stop to the killing .
but arguments rumbled on throughout the summer .
military commanders said a precision strike had almost no chance of success .
however , no thorough study of the issue was made .
proposals to drop weapons into the camp to enable a rebellion were briefly considered but abandoned .
recently published reconnaissance images show the british photographed the camp from the air in august that year - suggesting that by 1944 the raf had the capability to reach auschwitz with bombers .
however , with allied troops moving through normandy after d-day and the red army at the gates of warsaw in 1944 , some believed the best way to destroy the death camps was to use all military resources to crush the enemy .
double standards ?
laurence rees - writer and producer of the bbc 's auschwitz series - says the lack of proper consideration given to bombing the camp and a " dismissive tone " in some of the documents of the time give the sense that " no-one was bothered enough to make bombing auschwitz a priority " .
" if they were exterminating british prisoners of war do we seriously think that we would n't have done all we could to stop it ? " he asks .
but rees also says that dwelling on the bombing of auschwitz , where the killings stopped in november 1944 , is a distraction from the " far more important question " of why the allies failed to do more to save the jews from nazi persecution .
the simon wiesenthal center -lrb- swc -rrb- - named after a death camp survivor who became a nazi-hunter - says the allies failed to take practical steps that could have helped many of hitler 's victims .
lessons of the past the swc says the uk and the us could have relaxed stringent immigration policies to allow refugees a safe haven , and sent frequent and unequivocal warnings to germany that its leaders would be held accountable .
but while no-one blames anyone other than the nazis for the horrors of the holocaust , the debate over what could or should have been done seems certain to continue .
in the words of auschwitz survivor kitty hart-moxon : " being the worst example , the holocaust is central to understanding the causes of the genocides that have occurred in many parts of the world since the end of the world war ii . "

a plan to drop weapons to the camp to assist a rebellion was considered " if they were exterminating british prisoners of war do we seriously think that we would n't have done all we could to stop it ? " he asks .

the debate also leads to wider questions of why more was not done around the world to save the jews from nazi persecution .
pressure to act information about auschwitz reached new levels of detail following the escapes of two prisoners in april 1944 , and two more a month later .
raf image of auschwitz taken in august 1944 -lrb- courtesy of aerial reconnaissance archives -rrb- enlarge image their combined testimonies formed the basis of documents known as the auschwitz protocols .
by june 1944 , jewish groups were imploring both us president franklin delano roosevelt and uk prime minister winston churchill to bomb the rail lines or the gas chambers in order to put a stop to the killing .
but arguments rumbled on throughout the summer .
military commanders said a precision strike had almost no chance of success .
however , no thorough study of the issue was made .
proposals to drop weapons into the camp to enable a rebellion were briefly considered but abandoned .
recently published reconnaissance images show the british photographed the camp from the air in august that year - suggesting that by 1944 the raf had the capability to reach auschwitz with bombers .
however , with allied troops moving through normandy after d-day and the red army at the gates of warsaw in 1944 , some believed the best way to destroy the death camps was to use all military resources to crush the enemy .
double standards ?
laurence rees - writer and producer of the bbc 's auschwitz series - says the lack of proper consideration given to bombing the camp and a " dismissive tone " in some of the documents of the time give the sense that " no-one was bothered enough to make bombing auschwitz a priority " .
a plan to drop weapons to the camp to assist a rebellion was considered " if they were exterminating british prisoners of war do we seriously think that we would n't have done all we could to stop it ? " he asks .
but rees also says that dwelling on the bombing of auschwitz , where the killings stopped in november 1944 , is a distraction from the " far more important question " of why the allies failed to do more to save the jews from nazi persecution .
the simon wiesenthal center -lrb- swc -rrb- - named after a death camp survivor who became a nazi-hunter - says the allies failed to take practical steps that could have helped many of hitler 's victims .
lessons of the past the swc says the uk and the us could have relaxed stringent immigration policies to allow refugees a safe haven , and sent frequent and unequivocal warnings to germany that its leaders would be held accountable .
but while no-one blames anyone other than the nazis for the horrors of the holocaust , the debate over what could or should have been done seems certain to continue .
in the words of auschwitz survivor kitty hart-moxon : " being the worst example , the holocaust is central to understanding the causes of the genocides that have occurred in many parts of the world since the end of the world war ii . "
