" i hope we can avoid getting into detailed discussions of the future financing issue at hampton court , " said british prime minister and summit host tony blair , referring to talks on the 2007-2013 budget for the 25-nation bloc . the budget standoff is of particularly urgent concern to the 10 new , mostly ex-communist , countries which joined the eu last year and need a resolution to unblock key eu funds for their still relatively poor economies . response to globalization but while some still want to discuss finances , formally the one-day meeting - cut down from two after some eu leaders clearly thought there was not enough meat to justify the overnight stop - will tackle the lofty subject of europe 's future in the age of " globalization . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing chancellor schröder -lrb- l -rrb- with the uk 's tony blair traditional eu heavyweights france and germany - whose outgoing social democratic leader gerhard schröder will be attending his last summit - will be keen to defend their long-cherished vision of europe 's " social model . " but blair , who currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , will be equally keen to bang the drum for the kind of free-market reforms espoused by schröder 's successor angela merkel . the main theme of discussions will be " the opportunities and challenges of globalization , " blair said in his letter of invitation to the summit .
" how do we meet the competitive challenge and maintain the security of our citizens in a world of unprecedented movement ? " french viewpoint french president jacques chirac - whose long-strained relations with the british leader have reached a new nadir amid the eu budget standoff - can be counted on to have diverging views from the summit host . paris has long been the champion of a european economic model which puts far more emphasis on generous social protection , workers ' rights and ensuring that key state enterprises remain viable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a french dairy farm , part of the beloved " terroir " france wants defended indeed , the summit takes place against the background of world trade talks in which france is fiercely defending the eu 's long-disputed common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- , of which french farmers are the main beneficiaries . the cap is at the heart of the budget standoff : britain is pushing hard for further reform of its trade-distorting payouts .
but france is standing firm , while countering that blair must surrender london 's long-cherished eu rebate . while serious budget haggling is not on the menu in hampton court , there is hope for some " informal discussion " in the corridors of henry viii 's palace by the thames , possibly even making some progress ahead of a december showdown . constitution question but no progress - and precious little discussion - is expected on the other key problem facing the eu : the rejection of its constitution by french and dutch voters , which plunged the bloc into crisis in june . the institutional blueprint was designed to avoid decision-making gridlock in the still-expanding union , which is set to welcome romania and bulgaria in 2007 with a line of others waiting at the eu door . few expect any progress on the issue until after french presidential polls in 2007 , when some hope that chirac may be succeeded by a more popular leader - such as nicolas sarkozy - who could somehow turn the french " non " around . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in the eu are skeptical about eu membership but the prospect of the charismatic rightwinger in the elysee palace - following the german transfer of power to merkel - raises another thorny strategic issue for the european bloc : turkey . the eu overcame last-minute problems this month to start membership talks with the vast mostly muslim state .
but both merkel and sarkozy are openly opposed to turkey ever actually joining . that issue may , again , be discussed in the sidelines of this week 's summit .

" i hope we can avoid getting into detailed discussions of the future financing issue at hampton court , " said british prime minister and summit host tony blair , referring to talks on the 2007-2013 budget for the 25-nation bloc . the budget standoff is of particularly urgent concern to the 10 new , mostly ex-communist , countries which joined the eu last year and need a resolution to unblock key eu funds for their still relatively poor economies . response to globalization but while some still want to discuss finances , formally the one-day meeting - cut down from two after some eu leaders clearly thought there was not enough meat to justify the overnight stop - will tackle the lofty subject of europe 's future in the age of " globalization .

" how do we meet the competitive challenge and maintain the security of our citizens in a world of unprecedented movement ? " french viewpoint french president jacques chirac - whose long-strained relations with the british leader have reached a new nadir amid the eu budget standoff - can be counted on to have diverging views from the summit host . paris has long been the champion of a european economic model which puts far more emphasis on generous social protection , workers ' rights and ensuring that key state enterprises remain viable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a french dairy farm , part of the beloved " terroir " france wants defended indeed , the summit takes place against the background of world trade talks in which france is fiercely defending the eu 's long-disputed common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- , of which french farmers are the main beneficiaries . the cap is at the heart of the budget standoff : britain is pushing hard for further reform of its trade-distorting payouts .
but france is standing firm , while countering that blair must surrender london 's long-cherished eu rebate . while serious budget haggling is not on the menu in hampton court , there is hope for some " informal discussion " in the corridors of henry viii 's palace by the thames , possibly even making some progress ahead of a december showdown . constitution question but no progress - and precious little discussion - is expected on the other key problem facing the eu : the rejection of its constitution by french and dutch voters , which plunged the bloc into crisis in june . the institutional blueprint was designed to avoid decision-making gridlock in the still-expanding union , which is set to welcome romania and bulgaria in 2007 with a line of others waiting at the eu door . few expect any progress on the issue until after french presidential polls in 2007 , when some hope that chirac may be succeeded by a more popular leader - such as nicolas sarkozy - who could somehow turn the french " non " around . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in the eu are skeptical about eu membership but the prospect of the charismatic rightwinger in the elysee palace - following the german transfer of power to merkel - raises another thorny strategic issue for the european bloc : turkey . the eu overcame last-minute problems this month to start membership talks with the vast mostly muslim state .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 23.10.2005 mönchengladbach looking for return to glory großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mönchengladbach can raise their hands after recent successes in the 1970s , mönchengladbach once fought it out with bayern munich for german league dominance .
but the end of that decade marked a long period of decline .
now , however , they are quietly coming back . the pressure was intense in mönchengladbach last april .
the once-proud club , a team that won five bundesliga titles from 1970 to 1977 , was on the fringes of dropping into the second division . hiring former dutch coach dick advocaat in the fall of 2004 - the first time in the club 's 115-year history that it had had a foreign coach - had turned out to be a disaster .
called the " general , " advocaat 's strict measures only resulted in mediocre performances by the players . something had to be done , and advocaat was given his marching orders .
now someone had to be found who could save the army .
the gladbach management went with a man who was a force behind the success of the team of the 1970 's : horst köppel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berti vogts : successful defender and german national coach the offensive-playing midfielder stood side-by-side with the likes of jupp heynckes and berti vogts , now coaches with experience both in the bundesliga -lrb- heynckes -rrb- and the national team -lrb- vogts -rrb- .
köppel 's resume is a little thinner , his biggest success as a coach was a german cup victory with borussia dortmund in 1989 . relegation held off but the move paid off .
it was n't necessarily done in spectacular fashion over the final five weeks of the season .
a 2-0 victory and three goalless draws sufficed to keep gladbach , a team that has only played one year in the second season , in the top division .
the team finished with 35 goals as a whole for the season . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich -lrb- red -rrb- squeezed gladbach in the season 's opening match at the beginning of the 2005-06 season , little was expected of the team .
they travelled to bayern munich for the first-ever bundesliga match in the new allianz arena .
even one man up , gladbach were no match for bayern who effortlessly won 3-0 .
for gladbach fans it was a pitiful start of the season . but something has changed since then .
in their last eight matches , they have taken all three points four times and tied three times .
one of the victories came against bremen in which köppel 's club could put a desolate first-half behind them to win .
the timing could n't have been better .
after a 2-1 loss to hated rhineland rivals cologne , people were calling for köppel 's head . " we are not going to talk about the coach , " team manager peter pander said after that game .
" we want to win as many games as possible and then everything will take care of itself . " back to the 1970 's bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gladbach 's -lrb- white -rrb- victory against bremen turned mediocre start around the victory against bremen started a three-game run that should have been a four-game winning streak .
the colts are defeating the teams they are supposed to beat ; those that frequently have to battle relegation .
in week seven , they beat bielefeld .
in week eight , they squeaked by mainz 1-0 . on the ninth match day , they led 89 minutes in stuttgart - not necessarily one of the teams they are supposed to win against .
in that last minute though , captain jeff strasser scored an own goal to ruin an otherwise satisfactory day . despite that small setback , gladbach are starting to reach heights that might make many in the club dizzy - they are fifth-place .
however , manager pander cautions that the impressive performances in the past few weeks are no cause for premature rejoicing . " nobody should forget that this is just a snapshot of the moment , " manager pander cautioned in the rheinische post newspaper . yet he also said that nobody would have thought that mönchengladbach would have been playing for fifth-place in october .
in may 2006 , such a finish would mean a spot in the uefa cup .
it 's not exactly the glory days of the 1970 's , but it is a long way off from the relegation fight in may 2005 . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hamburg the new challengers the streak was brought to an end .

but the end of that decade marked a long period of decline .
now , however , they are quietly coming back . the pressure was intense in mönchengladbach last april .
the once-proud club , a team that won five bundesliga titles from 1970 to 1977 , was on the fringes of dropping into the second division . hiring former dutch coach dick advocaat in the fall of 2004 - the first time in the club 's 115-year history that it had had a foreign coach - had turned out to be a disaster .
called the " general , " advocaat 's strict measures only resulted in mediocre performances by the players . something had to be done , and advocaat was given his marching orders .
now someone had to be found who could save the army .
the gladbach management went with a man who was a force behind the success of the team of the 1970 's : horst köppel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berti vogts : successful defender and german national coach the offensive-playing midfielder stood side-by-side with the likes of jupp heynckes and berti vogts , now coaches with experience both in the bundesliga -lrb- heynckes -rrb- and the national team -lrb- vogts -rrb- .
köppel 's resume is a little thinner , his biggest success as a coach was a german cup victory with borussia dortmund in 1989 . relegation held off but the move paid off .
it was n't necessarily done in spectacular fashion over the final five weeks of the season .
a 2-0 victory and three goalless draws sufficed to keep gladbach , a team that has only played one year in the second season , in the top division .
the team finished with 35 goals as a whole for the season . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich -lrb- red -rrb- squeezed gladbach in the season 's opening match at the beginning of the 2005-06 season , little was expected of the team .
they travelled to bayern munich for the first-ever bundesliga match in the new allianz arena .
even one man up , gladbach were no match for bayern who effortlessly won 3-0 .
for gladbach fans it was a pitiful start of the season . but something has changed since then .
in their last eight matches , they have taken all three points four times and tied three times .
one of the victories came against bremen in which köppel 's club could put a desolate first-half behind them to win .
the timing could n't have been better .
after a 2-1 loss to hated rhineland rivals cologne , people were calling for köppel 's head . " we are not going to talk about the coach , " team manager peter pander said after that game .
" we want to win as many games as possible and then everything will take care of itself . " back to the 1970 's bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gladbach 's -lrb- white -rrb- victory against bremen turned mediocre start around the victory against bremen started a three-game run that should have been a four-game winning streak .
the colts are defeating the teams they are supposed to beat ; those that frequently have to battle relegation .
in week seven , they beat bielefeld .
in week eight , they squeaked by mainz 1-0 . on the ninth match day , they led 89 minutes in stuttgart - not necessarily one of the teams they are supposed to win against .
in that last minute though , captain jeff strasser scored an own goal to ruin an otherwise satisfactory day . despite that small setback , gladbach are starting to reach heights that might make many in the club dizzy - they are fifth-place .
however , manager pander cautions that the impressive performances in the past few weeks are no cause for premature rejoicing . " nobody should forget that this is just a snapshot of the moment , " manager pander cautioned in the rheinische post newspaper . yet he also said that nobody would have thought that mönchengladbach would have been playing for fifth-place in october .
in may 2006 , such a finish would mean a spot in the uefa cup .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 23.10.2005 mönchengladbach looking for return to glory großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mönchengladbach can raise their hands after recent successes in the 1970s , mönchengladbach once fought it out with bayern munich for german league dominance .
but the end of that decade marked a long period of decline .
now , however , they are quietly coming back . the pressure was intense in mönchengladbach last april .
the once-proud club , a team that won five bundesliga titles from 1970 to 1977 , was on the fringes of dropping into the second division . hiring former dutch coach dick advocaat in the fall of 2004 - the first time in the club 's 115-year history that it had had a foreign coach - had turned out to be a disaster .
called the " general , " advocaat 's strict measures only resulted in mediocre performances by the players . something had to be done , and advocaat was given his marching orders .
now someone had to be found who could save the army .
the gladbach management went with a man who was a force behind the success of the team of the 1970 's : horst köppel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berti vogts : successful defender and german national coach the offensive-playing midfielder stood side-by-side with the likes of jupp heynckes and berti vogts , now coaches with experience both in the bundesliga -lrb- heynckes -rrb- and the national team -lrb- vogts -rrb- .
köppel 's resume is a little thinner , his biggest success as a coach was a german cup victory with borussia dortmund in 1989 . relegation held off but the move paid off .
it was n't necessarily done in spectacular fashion over the final five weeks of the season .
a 2-0 victory and three goalless draws sufficed to keep gladbach , a team that has only played one year in the second season , in the top division .
the team finished with 35 goals as a whole for the season . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich -lrb- red -rrb- squeezed gladbach in the season 's opening match at the beginning of the 2005-06 season , little was expected of the team .
they travelled to bayern munich for the first-ever bundesliga match in the new allianz arena .
even one man up , gladbach were no match for bayern who effortlessly won 3-0 .
for gladbach fans it was a pitiful start of the season . but something has changed since then .
in their last eight matches , they have taken all three points four times and tied three times .
one of the victories came against bremen in which köppel 's club could put a desolate first-half behind them to win .
the timing could n't have been better .
after a 2-1 loss to hated rhineland rivals cologne , people were calling for köppel 's head . " we are not going to talk about the coach , " team manager peter pander said after that game .
" we want to win as many games as possible and then everything will take care of itself . " back to the 1970 's bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gladbach 's -lrb- white -rrb- victory against bremen turned mediocre start around the victory against bremen started a three-game run that should have been a four-game winning streak .
the colts are defeating the teams they are supposed to beat ; those that frequently have to battle relegation .
in week seven , they beat bielefeld .
in week eight , they squeaked by mainz 1-0 . on the ninth match day , they led 89 minutes in stuttgart - not necessarily one of the teams they are supposed to win against .
in that last minute though , captain jeff strasser scored an own goal to ruin an otherwise satisfactory day . despite that small setback , gladbach are starting to reach heights that might make many in the club dizzy - they are fifth-place .
however , manager pander cautions that the impressive performances in the past few weeks are no cause for premature rejoicing . " nobody should forget that this is just a snapshot of the moment , " manager pander cautioned in the rheinische post newspaper . yet he also said that nobody would have thought that mönchengladbach would have been playing for fifth-place in october .
in may 2006 , such a finish would mean a spot in the uefa cup .

" i hope we can avoid getting into detailed discussions of the future financing issue at hampton court , " said british prime minister and summit host tony blair , referring to talks on the 2007-2013 budget for the 25-nation bloc . the budget standoff is of particularly urgent concern to the 10 new , mostly ex-communist , countries which joined the eu last year and need a resolution to unblock key eu funds for their still relatively poor economies . response to globalization but while some still want to discuss finances , formally the one-day meeting - cut down from two after some eu leaders clearly thought there was not enough meat to justify the overnight stop - will tackle the lofty subject of europe 's future in the age of " globalization . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing chancellor schröder -lrb- l -rrb- with the uk 's tony blair traditional eu heavyweights france and germany - whose outgoing social democratic leader gerhard schröder will be attending his last summit - will be keen to defend their long-cherished vision of europe 's " social model . " but blair , who currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , will be equally keen to bang the drum for the kind of free-market reforms espoused by schröder 's successor angela merkel . the main theme of discussions will be " the opportunities and challenges of globalization , " blair said in his letter of invitation to the summit .
" how do we meet the competitive challenge and maintain the security of our citizens in a world of unprecedented movement ? " french viewpoint french president jacques chirac - whose long-strained relations with the british leader have reached a new nadir amid the eu budget standoff - can be counted on to have diverging views from the summit host . paris has long been the champion of a european economic model which puts far more emphasis on generous social protection , workers ' rights and ensuring that key state enterprises remain viable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a french dairy farm , part of the beloved " terroir " france wants defended indeed , the summit takes place against the background of world trade talks in which france is fiercely defending the eu 's long-disputed common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- , of which french farmers are the main beneficiaries . the cap is at the heart of the budget standoff : britain is pushing hard for further reform of its trade-distorting payouts .
but france is standing firm , while countering that blair must surrender london 's long-cherished eu rebate . while serious budget haggling is not on the menu in hampton court , there is hope for some " informal discussion " in the corridors of henry viii 's palace by the thames , possibly even making some progress ahead of a december showdown . constitution question but no progress - and precious little discussion - is expected on the other key problem facing the eu : the rejection of its constitution by french and dutch voters , which plunged the bloc into crisis in june . the institutional blueprint was designed to avoid decision-making gridlock in the still-expanding union , which is set to welcome romania and bulgaria in 2007 with a line of others waiting at the eu door . few expect any progress on the issue until after french presidential polls in 2007 , when some hope that chirac may be succeeded by a more popular leader - such as nicolas sarkozy - who could somehow turn the french " non " around . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in the eu are skeptical about eu membership but the prospect of the charismatic rightwinger in the elysee palace - following the german transfer of power to merkel - raises another thorny strategic issue for the european bloc : turkey . the eu overcame last-minute problems this month to start membership talks with the vast mostly muslim state .
but both merkel and sarkozy are openly opposed to turkey ever actually joining . that issue may , again , be discussed in the sidelines of this week 's summit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 23.10.2005 mönchengladbach looking for return to glory großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mönchengladbach can raise their hands after recent successes in the 1970s , mönchengladbach once fought it out with bayern munich for german league dominance .
but the end of that decade marked a long period of decline .
now , however , they are quietly coming back . the pressure was intense in mönchengladbach last april .
the once-proud club , a team that won five bundesliga titles from 1970 to 1977 , was on the fringes of dropping into the second division . hiring former dutch coach dick advocaat in the fall of 2004 - the first time in the club 's 115-year history that it had had a foreign coach - had turned out to be a disaster .
called the " general , " advocaat 's strict measures only resulted in mediocre performances by the players . something had to be done , and advocaat was given his marching orders .
now someone had to be found who could save the army .
the gladbach management went with a man who was a force behind the success of the team of the 1970 's : horst köppel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berti vogts : successful defender and german national coach the offensive-playing midfielder stood side-by-side with the likes of jupp heynckes and berti vogts , now coaches with experience both in the bundesliga -lrb- heynckes -rrb- and the national team -lrb- vogts -rrb- .
köppel 's resume is a little thinner , his biggest success as a coach was a german cup victory with borussia dortmund in 1989 . relegation held off but the move paid off .
it was n't necessarily done in spectacular fashion over the final five weeks of the season .
a 2-0 victory and three goalless draws sufficed to keep gladbach , a team that has only played one year in the second season , in the top division .
the team finished with 35 goals as a whole for the season . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich -lrb- red -rrb- squeezed gladbach in the season 's opening match at the beginning of the 2005-06 season , little was expected of the team .
they travelled to bayern munich for the first-ever bundesliga match in the new allianz arena .
even one man up , gladbach were no match for bayern who effortlessly won 3-0 .
for gladbach fans it was a pitiful start of the season . but something has changed since then .
in their last eight matches , they have taken all three points four times and tied three times .
one of the victories came against bremen in which köppel 's club could put a desolate first-half behind them to win .
the timing could n't have been better .
after a 2-1 loss to hated rhineland rivals cologne , people were calling for köppel 's head . " we are not going to talk about the coach , " team manager peter pander said after that game .
" we want to win as many games as possible and then everything will take care of itself . " back to the 1970 's bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gladbach 's -lrb- white -rrb- victory against bremen turned mediocre start around the victory against bremen started a three-game run that should have been a four-game winning streak .
the colts are defeating the teams they are supposed to beat ; those that frequently have to battle relegation .
in week seven , they beat bielefeld .
in week eight , they squeaked by mainz 1-0 . on the ninth match day , they led 89 minutes in stuttgart - not necessarily one of the teams they are supposed to win against .
in that last minute though , captain jeff strasser scored an own goal to ruin an otherwise satisfactory day . despite that small setback , gladbach are starting to reach heights that might make many in the club dizzy - they are fifth-place .
however , manager pander cautions that the impressive performances in the past few weeks are no cause for premature rejoicing . " nobody should forget that this is just a snapshot of the moment , " manager pander cautioned in the rheinische post newspaper . yet he also said that nobody would have thought that mönchengladbach would have been playing for fifth-place in october .
in may 2006 , such a finish would mean a spot in the uefa cup .
it 's not exactly the glory days of the 1970 's , but it is a long way off from the relegation fight in may 2005 . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hamburg the new challengers the streak was brought to an end .

but the end of that decade marked a long period of decline .
now , however , they are quietly coming back . the pressure was intense in mönchengladbach last april .
the once-proud club , a team that won five bundesliga titles from 1970 to 1977 , was on the fringes of dropping into the second division . hiring former dutch coach dick advocaat in the fall of 2004 - the first time in the club 's 115-year history that it had had a foreign coach - had turned out to be a disaster .
called the " general , " advocaat 's strict measures only resulted in mediocre performances by the players . something had to be done , and advocaat was given his marching orders .
now someone had to be found who could save the army .
the gladbach management went with a man who was a force behind the success of the team of the 1970 's : horst köppel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berti vogts : successful defender and german national coach the offensive-playing midfielder stood side-by-side with the likes of jupp heynckes and berti vogts , now coaches with experience both in the bundesliga -lrb- heynckes -rrb- and the national team -lrb- vogts -rrb- .
köppel 's resume is a little thinner , his biggest success as a coach was a german cup victory with borussia dortmund in 1989 . relegation held off but the move paid off .
it was n't necessarily done in spectacular fashion over the final five weeks of the season .
a 2-0 victory and three goalless draws sufficed to keep gladbach , a team that has only played one year in the second season , in the top division .
the team finished with 35 goals as a whole for the season . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich -lrb- red -rrb- squeezed gladbach in the season 's opening match at the beginning of the 2005-06 season , little was expected of the team .
they travelled to bayern munich for the first-ever bundesliga match in the new allianz arena .
even one man up , gladbach were no match for bayern who effortlessly won 3-0 .
for gladbach fans it was a pitiful start of the season . but something has changed since then .
in their last eight matches , they have taken all three points four times and tied three times .
one of the victories came against bremen in which köppel 's club could put a desolate first-half behind them to win .
the timing could n't have been better .
after a 2-1 loss to hated rhineland rivals cologne , people were calling for köppel 's head . " we are not going to talk about the coach , " team manager peter pander said after that game .
" we want to win as many games as possible and then everything will take care of itself . " back to the 1970 's bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gladbach 's -lrb- white -rrb- victory against bremen turned mediocre start around the victory against bremen started a three-game run that should have been a four-game winning streak .
the colts are defeating the teams they are supposed to beat ; those that frequently have to battle relegation .
in week seven , they beat bielefeld .
in week eight , they squeaked by mainz 1-0 . on the ninth match day , they led 89 minutes in stuttgart - not necessarily one of the teams they are supposed to win against .
in that last minute though , captain jeff strasser scored an own goal to ruin an otherwise satisfactory day . despite that small setback , gladbach are starting to reach heights that might make many in the club dizzy - they are fifth-place .
however , manager pander cautions that the impressive performances in the past few weeks are no cause for premature rejoicing . " nobody should forget that this is just a snapshot of the moment , " manager pander cautioned in the rheinische post newspaper . yet he also said that nobody would have thought that mönchengladbach would have been playing for fifth-place in october .
in may 2006 , such a finish would mean a spot in the uefa cup .

" i hope we can avoid getting into detailed discussions of the future financing issue at hampton court , " said british prime minister and summit host tony blair , referring to talks on the 2007-2013 budget for the 25-nation bloc . the budget standoff is of particularly urgent concern to the 10 new , mostly ex-communist , countries which joined the eu last year and need a resolution to unblock key eu funds for their still relatively poor economies . response to globalization but while some still want to discuss finances , formally the one-day meeting - cut down from two after some eu leaders clearly thought there was not enough meat to justify the overnight stop - will tackle the lofty subject of europe 's future in the age of " globalization . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing chancellor schröder -lrb- l -rrb- with the uk 's tony blair traditional eu heavyweights france and germany - whose outgoing social democratic leader gerhard schröder will be attending his last summit - will be keen to defend their long-cherished vision of europe 's " social model . " but blair , who currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , will be equally keen to bang the drum for the kind of free-market reforms espoused by schröder 's successor angela merkel . the main theme of discussions will be " the opportunities and challenges of globalization , " blair said in his letter of invitation to the summit .
" how do we meet the competitive challenge and maintain the security of our citizens in a world of unprecedented movement ? " french viewpoint french president jacques chirac - whose long-strained relations with the british leader have reached a new nadir amid the eu budget standoff - can be counted on to have diverging views from the summit host . paris has long been the champion of a european economic model which puts far more emphasis on generous social protection , workers ' rights and ensuring that key state enterprises remain viable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a french dairy farm , part of the beloved " terroir " france wants defended indeed , the summit takes place against the background of world trade talks in which france is fiercely defending the eu 's long-disputed common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- , of which french farmers are the main beneficiaries . the cap is at the heart of the budget standoff : britain is pushing hard for further reform of its trade-distorting payouts .
but france is standing firm , while countering that blair must surrender london 's long-cherished eu rebate . while serious budget haggling is not on the menu in hampton court , there is hope for some " informal discussion " in the corridors of henry viii 's palace by the thames , possibly even making some progress ahead of a december showdown . constitution question but no progress - and precious little discussion - is expected on the other key problem facing the eu : the rejection of its constitution by french and dutch voters , which plunged the bloc into crisis in june . the institutional blueprint was designed to avoid decision-making gridlock in the still-expanding union , which is set to welcome romania and bulgaria in 2007 with a line of others waiting at the eu door . few expect any progress on the issue until after french presidential polls in 2007 , when some hope that chirac may be succeeded by a more popular leader - such as nicolas sarkozy - who could somehow turn the french " non " around . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in the eu are skeptical about eu membership but the prospect of the charismatic rightwinger in the elysee palace - following the german transfer of power to merkel - raises another thorny strategic issue for the european bloc : turkey . the eu overcame last-minute problems this month to start membership talks with the vast mostly muslim state .
but both merkel and sarkozy are openly opposed to turkey ever actually joining . that issue may , again , be discussed in the sidelines of this week 's summit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 23.10.2005 mönchengladbach looking for return to glory großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mönchengladbach can raise their hands after recent successes in the 1970s , mönchengladbach once fought it out with bayern munich for german league dominance .
but the end of that decade marked a long period of decline .
now , however , they are quietly coming back . the pressure was intense in mönchengladbach last april .
the once-proud club , a team that won five bundesliga titles from 1970 to 1977 , was on the fringes of dropping into the second division . hiring former dutch coach dick advocaat in the fall of 2004 - the first time in the club 's 115-year history that it had had a foreign coach - had turned out to be a disaster .
called the " general , " advocaat 's strict measures only resulted in mediocre performances by the players . something had to be done , and advocaat was given his marching orders .
now someone had to be found who could save the army .
the gladbach management went with a man who was a force behind the success of the team of the 1970 's : horst köppel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berti vogts : successful defender and german national coach the offensive-playing midfielder stood side-by-side with the likes of jupp heynckes and berti vogts , now coaches with experience both in the bundesliga -lrb- heynckes -rrb- and the national team -lrb- vogts -rrb- .
köppel 's resume is a little thinner , his biggest success as a coach was a german cup victory with borussia dortmund in 1989 . relegation held off but the move paid off .
it was n't necessarily done in spectacular fashion over the final five weeks of the season .
a 2-0 victory and three goalless draws sufficed to keep gladbach , a team that has only played one year in the second season , in the top division .
the team finished with 35 goals as a whole for the season . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich -lrb- red -rrb- squeezed gladbach in the season 's opening match at the beginning of the 2005-06 season , little was expected of the team .
they travelled to bayern munich for the first-ever bundesliga match in the new allianz arena .
even one man up , gladbach were no match for bayern who effortlessly won 3-0 .
for gladbach fans it was a pitiful start of the season . but something has changed since then .
in their last eight matches , they have taken all three points four times and tied three times .

" i hope we can avoid getting into detailed discussions of the future financing issue at hampton court , " said british prime minister and summit host tony blair , referring to talks on the 2007-2013 budget for the 25-nation bloc . the budget standoff is of particularly urgent concern to the 10 new , mostly ex-communist , countries which joined the eu last year and need a resolution to unblock key eu funds for their still relatively poor economies . response to globalization but while some still want to discuss finances , formally the one-day meeting - cut down from two after some eu leaders clearly thought there was not enough meat to justify the overnight stop - will tackle the lofty subject of europe 's future in the age of " globalization . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing chancellor schröder -lrb- l -rrb- with the uk 's tony blair traditional eu heavyweights france and germany - whose outgoing social democratic leader gerhard schröder will be attending his last summit - will be keen to defend their long-cherished vision of europe 's " social model . " but blair , who currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , will be equally keen to bang the drum for the kind of free-market reforms espoused by schröder 's successor angela merkel . the main theme of discussions will be " the opportunities and challenges of globalization , " blair said in his letter of invitation to the summit .
" how do we meet the competitive challenge and maintain the security of our citizens in a world of unprecedented movement ? " french viewpoint french president jacques chirac - whose long-strained relations with the british leader have reached a new nadir amid the eu budget standoff - can be counted on to have diverging views from the summit host . paris has long been the champion of a european economic model which puts far more emphasis on generous social protection , workers ' rights and ensuring that key state enterprises remain viable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a french dairy farm , part of the beloved " terroir " france wants defended indeed , the summit takes place against the background of world trade talks in which france is fiercely defending the eu 's long-disputed common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- , of which french farmers are the main beneficiaries . the cap is at the heart of the budget standoff : britain is pushing hard for further reform of its trade-distorting payouts .
but france is standing firm , while countering that blair must surrender london 's long-cherished eu rebate . while serious budget haggling is not on the menu in hampton court , there is hope for some " informal discussion " in the corridors of henry viii 's palace by the thames , possibly even making some progress ahead of a december showdown . constitution question but no progress - and precious little discussion - is expected on the other key problem facing the eu : the rejection of its constitution by french and dutch voters , which plunged the bloc into crisis in june . the institutional blueprint was designed to avoid decision-making gridlock in the still-expanding union , which is set to welcome romania and bulgaria in 2007 with a line of others waiting at the eu door . few expect any progress on the issue until after french presidential polls in 2007 , when some hope that chirac may be succeeded by a more popular leader - such as nicolas sarkozy - who could somehow turn the french " non " around . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in the eu are skeptical about eu membership but the prospect of the charismatic rightwinger in the elysee palace - following the german transfer of power to merkel - raises another thorny strategic issue for the european bloc : turkey . the eu overcame last-minute problems this month to start membership talks with the vast mostly muslim state .
but both merkel and sarkozy are openly opposed to turkey ever actually joining . that issue may , again , be discussed in the sidelines of this week 's summit .

" it 's been said that true art happens on the soccer pitch , and no where else .
but with germany getting ready to host the world cup next june , organizers have decided to let painters , video artists and sculptors offer their take on the beautiful game .
the result is " rundlederwelten , " or " round leather worlds , " a 10-week long installation and exhibition at berlin 's martin gropius bau museum .
the brainchild of documenta legend harald szeemann , with support from the world cup cultural program , the exhibit almost did n't get off the ground following szeemann 's sudden death earlier this year .
200 works in just six months organizers called in curator dorothea strauss at the last minute .
in six months , she had collected 200 works , ranging from video installations to paintings and drawings by martin kippenberger and andy warhol .
the exhibit 's purpose is to reveal the game 's many undercurrents using the diverse methods the art world has to offer .

german soccer " kaiser " and world cup organizing committee head franz beckenbauer is the face of the event , and contributed a portrait of himself that andy warhol drew .
the legendary new york artist said in the 1970s that athletes would be the " new stars . "
his portrait of beckenbauer is meant to portray the soccer legend as a sports icon and advertising machine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a soccer shirt reading " andy warhol " by stefan benz " that the art world is interested in soccer is indisputable , " write the exhibit 's organizers .

but the end of that decade marked a long period of decline .
now , however , they are quietly coming back . the pressure was intense in mönchengladbach last april .
the once-proud club , a team that won five bundesliga titles from 1970 to 1977 , was on the fringes of dropping into the second division . hiring former dutch coach dick advocaat in the fall of 2004 - the first time in the club 's 115-year history that it had had a foreign coach - had turned out to be a disaster .
called the " general , " advocaat 's strict measures only resulted in mediocre performances by the players . something had to be done , and advocaat was given his marching orders .

but the end of that decade marked a long period of decline .
now , however , they are quietly coming back . the pressure was intense in mönchengladbach last april .
the once-proud club , a team that won five bundesliga titles from 1970 to 1977 , was on the fringes of dropping into the second division . hiring former dutch coach dick advocaat in the fall of 2004 - the first time in the club 's 115-year history that it had had a foreign coach - had turned out to be a disaster .
called the " general , " advocaat 's strict measures only resulted in mediocre performances by the players . something had to be done , and advocaat was given his marching orders .
now someone had to be found who could save the army .
the gladbach management went with a man who was a force behind the success of the team of the 1970 's : horst köppel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berti vogts : successful defender and german national coach the offensive-playing midfielder stood side-by-side with the likes of jupp heynckes and berti vogts , now coaches with experience both in the bundesliga -lrb- heynckes -rrb- and the national team -lrb- vogts -rrb- .
köppel 's resume is a little thinner , his biggest success as a coach was a german cup victory with borussia dortmund in 1989 . relegation held off but the move paid off .
it was n't necessarily done in spectacular fashion over the final five weeks of the season .
a 2-0 victory and three goalless draws sufficed to keep gladbach , a team that has only played one year in the second season , in the top division .
the team finished with 35 goals as a whole for the season . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich -lrb- red -rrb- squeezed gladbach in the season 's opening match at the beginning of the 2005-06 season , little was expected of the team .
they travelled to bayern munich for the first-ever bundesliga match in the new allianz arena .
even one man up , gladbach were no match for bayern who effortlessly won 3-0 .
for gladbach fans it was a pitiful start of the season . but something has changed since then .
in their last eight matches , they have taken all three points four times and tied three times .
one of the victories came against bremen in which köppel 's club could put a desolate first-half behind them to win .
the timing could n't have been better .
after a 2-1 loss to hated rhineland rivals cologne , people were calling for köppel 's head . " we are not going to talk about the coach , " team manager peter pander said after that game .
" we want to win as many games as possible and then everything will take care of itself . " back to the 1970 's bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gladbach 's -lrb- white -rrb- victory against bremen turned mediocre start around the victory against bremen started a three-game run that should have been a four-game winning streak .
the colts are defeating the teams they are supposed to beat ; those that frequently have to battle relegation .
in week seven , they beat bielefeld .
in week eight , they squeaked by mainz 1-0 . on the ninth match day , they led 89 minutes in stuttgart - not necessarily one of the teams they are supposed to win against .
in that last minute though , captain jeff strasser scored an own goal to ruin an otherwise satisfactory day . despite that small setback , gladbach are starting to reach heights that might make many in the club dizzy - they are fifth-place .
however , manager pander cautions that the impressive performances in the past few weeks are no cause for premature rejoicing . " nobody should forget that this is just a snapshot of the moment , " manager pander cautioned in the rheinische post newspaper . yet he also said that nobody would have thought that mönchengladbach would have been playing for fifth-place in october .
in may 2006 , such a finish would mean a spot in the uefa cup .

" i hope we can avoid getting into detailed discussions of the future financing issue at hampton court , " said british prime minister and summit host tony blair , referring to talks on the 2007-2013 budget for the 25-nation bloc . the budget standoff is of particularly urgent concern to the 10 new , mostly ex-communist , countries which joined the eu last year and need a resolution to unblock key eu funds for their still relatively poor economies . response to globalization but while some still want to discuss finances , formally the one-day meeting - cut down from two after some eu leaders clearly thought there was not enough meat to justify the overnight stop - will tackle the lofty subject of europe 's future in the age of " globalization .

" how do we meet the competitive challenge and maintain the security of our citizens in a world of unprecedented movement ? " french viewpoint french president jacques chirac - whose long-strained relations with the british leader have reached a new nadir amid the eu budget standoff - can be counted on to have diverging views from the summit host . paris has long been the champion of a european economic model which puts far more emphasis on generous social protection , workers ' rights and ensuring that key state enterprises remain viable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a french dairy farm , part of the beloved " terroir " france wants defended indeed , the summit takes place against the background of world trade talks in which france is fiercely defending the eu 's long-disputed common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- , of which french farmers are the main beneficiaries . the cap is at the heart of the budget standoff : britain is pushing hard for further reform of its trade-distorting payouts .
but france is standing firm , while countering that blair must surrender london 's long-cherished eu rebate . while serious budget haggling is not on the menu in hampton court , there is hope for some " informal discussion " in the corridors of henry viii 's palace by the thames , possibly even making some progress ahead of a december showdown . constitution question but no progress - and precious little discussion - is expected on the other key problem facing the eu : the rejection of its constitution by french and dutch voters , which plunged the bloc into crisis in june . the institutional blueprint was designed to avoid decision-making gridlock in the still-expanding union , which is set to welcome romania and bulgaria in 2007 with a line of others waiting at the eu door . few expect any progress on the issue until after french presidential polls in 2007 , when some hope that chirac may be succeeded by a more popular leader - such as nicolas sarkozy - who could somehow turn the french " non " around . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in the eu are skeptical about eu membership but the prospect of the charismatic rightwinger in the elysee palace - following the german transfer of power to merkel - raises another thorny strategic issue for the european bloc : turkey . the eu overcame last-minute problems this month to start membership talks with the vast mostly muslim state .

" it 's been said that true art happens on the soccer pitch , and no where else .

the result is " rundlederwelten , " or " round leather worlds , " a 10-week long installation and exhibition at berlin 's martin gropius bau museum .
the brainchild of documenta legend harald szeemann , with support from the world cup cultural program , the exhibit almost did n't get off the ground following szeemann 's sudden death earlier this year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 23.10.2005 mönchengladbach looking for return to glory großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mönchengladbach can raise their hands after recent successes in the 1970s , mönchengladbach once fought it out with bayern munich for german league dominance .
but the end of that decade marked a long period of decline .
now , however , they are quietly coming back . the pressure was intense in mönchengladbach last april .
the once-proud club , a team that won five bundesliga titles from 1970 to 1977 , was on the fringes of dropping into the second division . hiring former dutch coach dick advocaat in the fall of 2004 - the first time in the club 's 115-year history that it had had a foreign coach - had turned out to be a disaster .
called the " general , " advocaat 's strict measures only resulted in mediocre performances by the players . something had to be done , and advocaat was given his marching orders .
now someone had to be found who could save the army .
the gladbach management went with a man who was a force behind the success of the team of the 1970 's : horst köppel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berti vogts : successful defender and german national coach the offensive-playing midfielder stood side-by-side with the likes of jupp heynckes and berti vogts , now coaches with experience both in the bundesliga -lrb- heynckes -rrb- and the national team -lrb- vogts -rrb- .
köppel 's resume is a little thinner , his biggest success as a coach was a german cup victory with borussia dortmund in 1989 . relegation held off but the move paid off .
it was n't necessarily done in spectacular fashion over the final five weeks of the season .
a 2-0 victory and three goalless draws sufficed to keep gladbach , a team that has only played one year in the second season , in the top division .
the team finished with 35 goals as a whole for the season . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich -lrb- red -rrb- squeezed gladbach in the season 's opening match at the beginning of the 2005-06 season , little was expected of the team .
they travelled to bayern munich for the first-ever bundesliga match in the new allianz arena .
even one man up , gladbach were no match for bayern who effortlessly won 3-0 .
for gladbach fans it was a pitiful start of the season . but something has changed since then .
in their last eight matches , they have taken all three points four times and tied three times .
one of the victories came against bremen in which köppel 's club could put a desolate first-half behind them to win .
the timing could n't have been better .
after a 2-1 loss to hated rhineland rivals cologne , people were calling for köppel 's head . " we are not going to talk about the coach , " team manager peter pander said after that game .
" we want to win as many games as possible and then everything will take care of itself . " back to the 1970 's bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gladbach 's -lrb- white -rrb- victory against bremen turned mediocre start around the victory against bremen started a three-game run that should have been a four-game winning streak .
the colts are defeating the teams they are supposed to beat ; those that frequently have to battle relegation .
in week seven , they beat bielefeld .
in week eight , they squeaked by mainz 1-0 . on the ninth match day , they led 89 minutes in stuttgart - not necessarily one of the teams they are supposed to win against .
in that last minute though , captain jeff strasser scored an own goal to ruin an otherwise satisfactory day . despite that small setback , gladbach are starting to reach heights that might make many in the club dizzy - they are fifth-place .
however , manager pander cautions that the impressive performances in the past few weeks are no cause for premature rejoicing . " nobody should forget that this is just a snapshot of the moment , " manager pander cautioned in the rheinische post newspaper . yet he also said that nobody would have thought that mönchengladbach would have been playing for fifth-place in october .
in may 2006 , such a finish would mean a spot in the uefa cup .
it 's not exactly the glory days of the 1970 's , but it is a long way off from the relegation fight in may 2005 . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hamburg the new challengers the streak was brought to an end .

but the end of that decade marked a long period of decline .
now , however , they are quietly coming back . the pressure was intense in mönchengladbach last april .
the once-proud club , a team that won five bundesliga titles from 1970 to 1977 , was on the fringes of dropping into the second division . hiring former dutch coach dick advocaat in the fall of 2004 - the first time in the club 's 115-year history that it had had a foreign coach - had turned out to be a disaster .
called the " general , " advocaat 's strict measures only resulted in mediocre performances by the players . something had to be done , and advocaat was given his marching orders .
now someone had to be found who could save the army .
the gladbach management went with a man who was a force behind the success of the team of the 1970 's : horst köppel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berti vogts : successful defender and german national coach the offensive-playing midfielder stood side-by-side with the likes of jupp heynckes and berti vogts , now coaches with experience both in the bundesliga -lrb- heynckes -rrb- and the national team -lrb- vogts -rrb- .
köppel 's resume is a little thinner , his biggest success as a coach was a german cup victory with borussia dortmund in 1989 . relegation held off but the move paid off .
it was n't necessarily done in spectacular fashion over the final five weeks of the season .
a 2-0 victory and three goalless draws sufficed to keep gladbach , a team that has only played one year in the second season , in the top division .
the team finished with 35 goals as a whole for the season . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich -lrb- red -rrb- squeezed gladbach in the season 's opening match at the beginning of the 2005-06 season , little was expected of the team .
they travelled to bayern munich for the first-ever bundesliga match in the new allianz arena .
even one man up , gladbach were no match for bayern who effortlessly won 3-0 .
for gladbach fans it was a pitiful start of the season . but something has changed since then .
in their last eight matches , they have taken all three points four times and tied three times .
one of the victories came against bremen in which köppel 's club could put a desolate first-half behind them to win .
the timing could n't have been better .
after a 2-1 loss to hated rhineland rivals cologne , people were calling for köppel 's head . " we are not going to talk about the coach , " team manager peter pander said after that game .
" we want to win as many games as possible and then everything will take care of itself . " back to the 1970 's bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gladbach 's -lrb- white -rrb- victory against bremen turned mediocre start around the victory against bremen started a three-game run that should have been a four-game winning streak .
the colts are defeating the teams they are supposed to beat ; those that frequently have to battle relegation .
in week seven , they beat bielefeld .
in week eight , they squeaked by mainz 1-0 . on the ninth match day , they led 89 minutes in stuttgart - not necessarily one of the teams they are supposed to win against .
in that last minute though , captain jeff strasser scored an own goal to ruin an otherwise satisfactory day . despite that small setback , gladbach are starting to reach heights that might make many in the club dizzy - they are fifth-place .
however , manager pander cautions that the impressive performances in the past few weeks are no cause for premature rejoicing . " nobody should forget that this is just a snapshot of the moment , " manager pander cautioned in the rheinische post newspaper . yet he also said that nobody would have thought that mönchengladbach would have been playing for fifth-place in october .
in may 2006 , such a finish would mean a spot in the uefa cup .
it 's not exactly the glory days of the 1970 's , but it is a long way off from the relegation fight in may 2005 . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hamburg the new challengers the streak was brought to an end .

" it 's been said that true art happens on the soccer pitch , and no where else .
but with germany getting ready to host the world cup next june , organizers have decided to let painters , video artists and sculptors offer their take on the beautiful game .
the result is " rundlederwelten , " or " round leather worlds , " a 10-week long installation and exhibition at berlin 's martin gropius bau museum .
the brainchild of documenta legend harald szeemann , with support from the world cup cultural program , the exhibit almost did n't get off the ground following szeemann 's sudden death earlier this year .
200 works in just six months organizers called in curator dorothea strauss at the last minute .
in six months , she had collected 200 works , ranging from video installations to paintings and drawings by martin kippenberger and andy warhol .
the exhibit 's purpose is to reveal the game 's many undercurrents using the diverse methods the art world has to offer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a ball of bread dough in front of photos of the 1974 german team bombay artist maria marshall filmed a boy kicking a ball in the midday sun against mediterranean white wall .

uruguayan artist federico arnaud transformed the anonymous plastic players of a foosball table into a heavenly tableau .
jesus , on the cross , serves as goalkeeper .
maria plays defense .
the kaiser is everywhere in all , 74 artists are taking part in the exhibit .
german soccer " kaiser " and world cup organizing committee head franz beckenbauer is the face of the event , and contributed a portrait of himself that andy warhol drew .
the legendary new york artist said in the 1970s that athletes would be the " new stars . "
his portrait of beckenbauer is meant to portray the soccer legend as a sports icon and advertising machine .

but the end of that decade marked a long period of decline .
now , however , they are quietly coming back . the pressure was intense in mönchengladbach last april .
the once-proud club , a team that won five bundesliga titles from 1970 to 1977 , was on the fringes of dropping into the second division . hiring former dutch coach dick advocaat in the fall of 2004 - the first time in the club 's 115-year history that it had had a foreign coach - had turned out to be a disaster .
called the " general , " advocaat 's strict measures only resulted in mediocre performances by the players . something had to be done , and advocaat was given his marching orders .
now someone had to be found who could save the army .
the gladbach management went with a man who was a force behind the success of the team of the 1970 's : horst köppel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berti vogts : successful defender and german national coach the offensive-playing midfielder stood side-by-side with the likes of jupp heynckes and berti vogts , now coaches with experience both in the bundesliga -lrb- heynckes -rrb- and the national team -lrb- vogts -rrb- .
köppel 's resume is a little thinner , his biggest success as a coach was a german cup victory with borussia dortmund in 1989 . relegation held off but the move paid off .
it was n't necessarily done in spectacular fashion over the final five weeks of the season .
a 2-0 victory and three goalless draws sufficed to keep gladbach , a team that has only played one year in the second season , in the top division .
the team finished with 35 goals as a whole for the season . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich -lrb- red -rrb- squeezed gladbach in the season 's opening match at the beginning of the 2005-06 season , little was expected of the team .
they travelled to bayern munich for the first-ever bundesliga match in the new allianz arena .
even one man up , gladbach were no match for bayern who effortlessly won 3-0 .
for gladbach fans it was a pitiful start of the season . but something has changed since then .
in their last eight matches , they have taken all three points four times and tied three times .
one of the victories came against bremen in which köppel 's club could put a desolate first-half behind them to win .
the timing could n't have been better .
after a 2-1 loss to hated rhineland rivals cologne , people were calling for köppel 's head . " we are not going to talk about the coach , " team manager peter pander said after that game .
" we want to win as many games as possible and then everything will take care of itself . " back to the 1970 's bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gladbach 's -lrb- white -rrb- victory against bremen turned mediocre start around the victory against bremen started a three-game run that should have been a four-game winning streak .
the colts are defeating the teams they are supposed to beat ; those that frequently have to battle relegation .
in week seven , they beat bielefeld .
in week eight , they squeaked by mainz 1-0 . on the ninth match day , they led 89 minutes in stuttgart - not necessarily one of the teams they are supposed to win against .
in that last minute though , captain jeff strasser scored an own goal to ruin an otherwise satisfactory day . despite that small setback , gladbach are starting to reach heights that might make many in the club dizzy - they are fifth-place .
however , manager pander cautions that the impressive performances in the past few weeks are no cause for premature rejoicing . " nobody should forget that this is just a snapshot of the moment , " manager pander cautioned in the rheinische post newspaper . yet he also said that nobody would have thought that mönchengladbach would have been playing for fifth-place in october .
in may 2006 , such a finish would mean a spot in the uefa cup .
it 's not exactly the glory days of the 1970 's , but it is a long way off from the relegation fight in may 2005 . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hamburg the new challengers the streak was brought to an end .

" i hope we can avoid getting into detailed discussions of the future financing issue at hampton court , " said british prime minister and summit host tony blair , referring to talks on the 2007-2013 budget for the 25-nation bloc . the budget standoff is of particularly urgent concern to the 10 new , mostly ex-communist , countries which joined the eu last year and need a resolution to unblock key eu funds for their still relatively poor economies . response to globalization but while some still want to discuss finances , formally the one-day meeting - cut down from two after some eu leaders clearly thought there was not enough meat to justify the overnight stop - will tackle the lofty subject of europe 's future in the age of " globalization .

but the end of that decade marked a long period of decline .
now , however , they are quietly coming back . the pressure was intense in mönchengladbach last april .
the once-proud club , a team that won five bundesliga titles from 1970 to 1977 , was on the fringes of dropping into the second division . hiring former dutch coach dick advocaat in the fall of 2004 - the first time in the club 's 115-year history that it had had a foreign coach - had turned out to be a disaster .
called the " general , " advocaat 's strict measures only resulted in mediocre performances by the players . something had to be done , and advocaat was given his marching orders .
now someone had to be found who could save the army .
the gladbach management went with a man who was a force behind the success of the team of the 1970 's : horst köppel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berti vogts : successful defender and german national coach the offensive-playing midfielder stood side-by-side with the likes of jupp heynckes and berti vogts , now coaches with experience both in the bundesliga -lrb- heynckes -rrb- and the national team -lrb- vogts -rrb- .
köppel 's resume is a little thinner , his biggest success as a coach was a german cup victory with borussia dortmund in 1989 . relegation held off but the move paid off .
it was n't necessarily done in spectacular fashion over the final five weeks of the season .
a 2-0 victory and three goalless draws sufficed to keep gladbach , a team that has only played one year in the second season , in the top division .
the team finished with 35 goals as a whole for the season . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich -lrb- red -rrb- squeezed gladbach in the season 's opening match at the beginning of the 2005-06 season , little was expected of the team .
they travelled to bayern munich for the first-ever bundesliga match in the new allianz arena .
even one man up , gladbach were no match for bayern who effortlessly won 3-0 .
for gladbach fans it was a pitiful start of the season . but something has changed since then .
in their last eight matches , they have taken all three points four times and tied three times .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 23.10.2005 mönchengladbach looking for return to glory großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mönchengladbach can raise their hands after recent successes in the 1970s , mönchengladbach once fought it out with bayern munich for german league dominance .
but the end of that decade marked a long period of decline .
now , however , they are quietly coming back . the pressure was intense in mönchengladbach last april .
the once-proud club , a team that won five bundesliga titles from 1970 to 1977 , was on the fringes of dropping into the second division . hiring former dutch coach dick advocaat in the fall of 2004 - the first time in the club 's 115-year history that it had had a foreign coach - had turned out to be a disaster .
called the " general , " advocaat 's strict measures only resulted in mediocre performances by the players . something had to be done , and advocaat was given his marching orders .
now someone had to be found who could save the army .
the gladbach management went with a man who was a force behind the success of the team of the 1970 's : horst köppel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berti vogts : successful defender and german national coach the offensive-playing midfielder stood side-by-side with the likes of jupp heynckes and berti vogts , now coaches with experience both in the bundesliga -lrb- heynckes -rrb- and the national team -lrb- vogts -rrb- .
köppel 's resume is a little thinner , his biggest success as a coach was a german cup victory with borussia dortmund in 1989 . relegation held off but the move paid off .
it was n't necessarily done in spectacular fashion over the final five weeks of the season .
a 2-0 victory and three goalless draws sufficed to keep gladbach , a team that has only played one year in the second season , in the top division .
the team finished with 35 goals as a whole for the season . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich -lrb- red -rrb- squeezed gladbach in the season 's opening match at the beginning of the 2005-06 season , little was expected of the team .
they travelled to bayern munich for the first-ever bundesliga match in the new allianz arena .
even one man up , gladbach were no match for bayern who effortlessly won 3-0 .
for gladbach fans it was a pitiful start of the season . but something has changed since then .
in their last eight matches , they have taken all three points four times and tied three times .
one of the victories came against bremen in which köppel 's club could put a desolate first-half behind them to win .
the timing could n't have been better .
after a 2-1 loss to hated rhineland rivals cologne , people were calling for köppel 's head . " we are not going to talk about the coach , " team manager peter pander said after that game .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.10.2005 eu leaders to avoid tough topics at summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tough eu issues to crack , but they 're on the back burner for now european union leaders will broach the " challenges of globalization " at an informal summit this week - while strenuously avoiding awkward topics which have dragged the bloc to the brink of all-out crisis . the summit talks , amid the tudor splendour of hampton court palace outside london , are officially aimed at working out europe 's strategic response to the threat typified by rising asian giants like china and india . but looming over the meeting like a royal specter will be the dual challenge of a deadlock over the bloc 's future budget , and the more fundamental question of its whole future , following the rejection by france and the netherlands of the eu constitution . " i hope we can avoid getting into detailed discussions of the future financing issue at hampton court , " said british prime minister and summit host tony blair , referring to talks on the 2007-2013 budget for the 25-nation bloc . the budget standoff is of particularly urgent concern to the 10 new , mostly ex-communist , countries which joined the eu last year and need a resolution to unblock key eu funds for their still relatively poor economies . response to globalization but while some still want to discuss finances , formally the one-day meeting - cut down from two after some eu leaders clearly thought there was not enough meat to justify the overnight stop - will tackle the lofty subject of europe 's future in the age of " globalization . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing chancellor schröder -lrb- l -rrb- with the uk 's tony blair traditional eu heavyweights france and germany - whose outgoing social democratic leader gerhard schröder will be attending his last summit - will be keen to defend their long-cherished vision of europe 's " social model . " but blair , who currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , will be equally keen to bang the drum for the kind of free-market reforms espoused by schröder 's successor angela merkel . the main theme of discussions will be " the opportunities and challenges of globalization , " blair said in his letter of invitation to the summit .
" how do we meet the competitive challenge and maintain the security of our citizens in a world of unprecedented movement ? " french viewpoint french president jacques chirac - whose long-strained relations with the british leader have reached a new nadir amid the eu budget standoff - can be counted on to have diverging views from the summit host . paris has long been the champion of a european economic model which puts far more emphasis on generous social protection , workers ' rights and ensuring that key state enterprises remain viable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a french dairy farm , part of the beloved " terroir " france wants defended indeed , the summit takes place against the background of world trade talks in which france is fiercely defending the eu 's long-disputed common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- , of which french farmers are the main beneficiaries . the cap is at the heart of the budget standoff : britain is pushing hard for further reform of its trade-distorting payouts .
but france is standing firm , while countering that blair must surrender london 's long-cherished eu rebate . while serious budget haggling is not on the menu in hampton court , there is hope for some " informal discussion " in the corridors of henry viii 's palace by the thames , possibly even making some progress ahead of a december showdown . constitution question but no progress - and precious little discussion - is expected on the other key problem facing the eu : the rejection of its constitution by french and dutch voters , which plunged the bloc into crisis in june . the institutional blueprint was designed to avoid decision-making gridlock in the still-expanding union , which is set to welcome romania and bulgaria in 2007 with a line of others waiting at the eu door . few expect any progress on the issue until after french presidential polls in 2007 , when some hope that chirac may be succeeded by a more popular leader - such as nicolas sarkozy - who could somehow turn the french " non " around . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in the eu are skeptical about eu membership but the prospect of the charismatic rightwinger in the elysee palace - following the german transfer of power to merkel - raises another thorny strategic issue for the european bloc : turkey . the eu overcame last-minute problems this month to start membership talks with the vast mostly muslim state .
but both merkel and sarkozy are openly opposed to turkey ever actually joining . that issue may , again , be discussed in the sidelines of this week 's summit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 23.10.2005 mönchengladbach looking for return to glory großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mönchengladbach can raise their hands after recent successes in the 1970s , mönchengladbach once fought it out with bayern munich for german league dominance .
but the end of that decade marked a long period of decline .
now , however , they are quietly coming back . the pressure was intense in mönchengladbach last april .
the once-proud club , a team that won five bundesliga titles from 1970 to 1977 , was on the fringes of dropping into the second division . hiring former dutch coach dick advocaat in the fall of 2004 - the first time in the club 's 115-year history that it had had a foreign coach - had turned out to be a disaster .
called the " general , " advocaat 's strict measures only resulted in mediocre performances by the players . something had to be done , and advocaat was given his marching orders .
now someone had to be found who could save the army .
the gladbach management went with a man who was a force behind the success of the team of the 1970 's : horst köppel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berti vogts : successful defender and german national coach the offensive-playing midfielder stood side-by-side with the likes of jupp heynckes and berti vogts , now coaches with experience both in the bundesliga -lrb- heynckes -rrb- and the national team -lrb- vogts -rrb- .
köppel 's resume is a little thinner , his biggest success as a coach was a german cup victory with borussia dortmund in 1989 . relegation held off but the move paid off .
it was n't necessarily done in spectacular fashion over the final five weeks of the season .
a 2-0 victory and three goalless draws sufficed to keep gladbach , a team that has only played one year in the second season , in the top division .
the team finished with 35 goals as a whole for the season . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich -lrb- red -rrb- squeezed gladbach in the season 's opening match at the beginning of the 2005-06 season , little was expected of the team .
they travelled to bayern munich for the first-ever bundesliga match in the new allianz arena .
even one man up , gladbach were no match for bayern who effortlessly won 3-0 .
for gladbach fans it was a pitiful start of the season . but something has changed since then .
in their last eight matches , they have taken all three points four times and tied three times .
one of the victories came against bremen in which köppel 's club could put a desolate first-half behind them to win .
the timing could n't have been better .
after a 2-1 loss to hated rhineland rivals cologne , people were calling for köppel 's head . " we are not going to talk about the coach , " team manager peter pander said after that game .
" we want to win as many games as possible and then everything will take care of itself . " back to the 1970 's bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gladbach 's -lrb- white -rrb- victory against bremen turned mediocre start around the victory against bremen started a three-game run that should have been a four-game winning streak .
the colts are defeating the teams they are supposed to beat ; those that frequently have to battle relegation .
in week seven , they beat bielefeld .
in week eight , they squeaked by mainz 1-0 . on the ninth match day , they led 89 minutes in stuttgart - not necessarily one of the teams they are supposed to win against .
in that last minute though , captain jeff strasser scored an own goal to ruin an otherwise satisfactory day . despite that small setback , gladbach are starting to reach heights that might make many in the club dizzy - they are fifth-place .
however , manager pander cautions that the impressive performances in the past few weeks are no cause for premature rejoicing . " nobody should forget that this is just a snapshot of the moment , " manager pander cautioned in the rheinische post newspaper . yet he also said that nobody would have thought that mönchengladbach would have been playing for fifth-place in october .
in may 2006 , such a finish would mean a spot in the uefa cup .
it 's not exactly the glory days of the 1970 's , but it is a long way off from the relegation fight in may 2005 . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hamburg the new challengers the streak was brought to an end .

" it 's been said that true art happens on the soccer pitch , and no where else .
but with germany getting ready to host the world cup next june , organizers have decided to let painters , video artists and sculptors offer their take on the beautiful game .
the result is " rundlederwelten , " or " round leather worlds , " a 10-week long installation and exhibition at berlin 's martin gropius bau museum .
the brainchild of documenta legend harald szeemann , with support from the world cup cultural program , the exhibit almost did n't get off the ground following szeemann 's sudden death earlier this year .
200 works in just six months organizers called in curator dorothea strauss at the last minute .
in six months , she had collected 200 works , ranging from video installations to paintings and drawings by martin kippenberger and andy warhol .
the exhibit 's purpose is to reveal the game 's many undercurrents using the diverse methods the art world has to offer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a ball of bread dough in front of photos of the 1974 german team bombay artist maria marshall filmed a boy kicking a ball in the midday sun against mediterranean white wall .
she digitally removed the ball so that viewers only see the boy kicking the shadow of a ball .
uruguayan artist federico arnaud transformed the anonymous plastic players of a foosball table into a heavenly tableau .
jesus , on the cross , serves as goalkeeper .
maria plays defense .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 23.10.2005 mönchengladbach looking for return to glory großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mönchengladbach can raise their hands after recent successes in the 1970s , mönchengladbach once fought it out with bayern munich for german league dominance .
but the end of that decade marked a long period of decline .
now , however , they are quietly coming back . the pressure was intense in mönchengladbach last april .
the once-proud club , a team that won five bundesliga titles from 1970 to 1977 , was on the fringes of dropping into the second division . hiring former dutch coach dick advocaat in the fall of 2004 - the first time in the club 's 115-year history that it had had a foreign coach - had turned out to be a disaster .
called the " general , " advocaat 's strict measures only resulted in mediocre performances by the players . something had to be done , and advocaat was given his marching orders .
now someone had to be found who could save the army .
the gladbach management went with a man who was a force behind the success of the team of the 1970 's : horst köppel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berti vogts : successful defender and german national coach the offensive-playing midfielder stood side-by-side with the likes of jupp heynckes and berti vogts , now coaches with experience both in the bundesliga -lrb- heynckes -rrb- and the national team -lrb- vogts -rrb- .
köppel 's resume is a little thinner , his biggest success as a coach was a german cup victory with borussia dortmund in 1989 . relegation held off but the move paid off .
it was n't necessarily done in spectacular fashion over the final five weeks of the season .
a 2-0 victory and three goalless draws sufficed to keep gladbach , a team that has only played one year in the second season , in the top division .
the team finished with 35 goals as a whole for the season . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich -lrb- red -rrb- squeezed gladbach in the season 's opening match at the beginning of the 2005-06 season , little was expected of the team .
they travelled to bayern munich for the first-ever bundesliga match in the new allianz arena .
even one man up , gladbach were no match for bayern who effortlessly won 3-0 .
for gladbach fans it was a pitiful start of the season . but something has changed since then .
in their last eight matches , they have taken all three points four times and tied three times .
one of the victories came against bremen in which köppel 's club could put a desolate first-half behind them to win .
the timing could n't have been better .
after a 2-1 loss to hated rhineland rivals cologne , people were calling for köppel 's head . " we are not going to talk about the coach , " team manager peter pander said after that game .
" we want to win as many games as possible and then everything will take care of itself . " back to the 1970 's bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gladbach 's -lrb- white -rrb- victory against bremen turned mediocre start around the victory against bremen started a three-game run that should have been a four-game winning streak .
the colts are defeating the teams they are supposed to beat ; those that frequently have to battle relegation .
in week seven , they beat bielefeld .
in week eight , they squeaked by mainz 1-0 . on the ninth match day , they led 89 minutes in stuttgart - not necessarily one of the teams they are supposed to win against .
in that last minute though , captain jeff strasser scored an own goal to ruin an otherwise satisfactory day . despite that small setback , gladbach are starting to reach heights that might make many in the club dizzy - they are fifth-place .
however , manager pander cautions that the impressive performances in the past few weeks are no cause for premature rejoicing . " nobody should forget that this is just a snapshot of the moment , " manager pander cautioned in the rheinische post newspaper . yet he also said that nobody would have thought that mönchengladbach would have been playing for fifth-place in october .
in may 2006 , such a finish would mean a spot in the uefa cup .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 23.10.2005 mönchengladbach looking for return to glory großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mönchengladbach can raise their hands after recent successes in the 1970s , mönchengladbach once fought it out with bayern munich for german league dominance .
but the end of that decade marked a long period of decline .
now , however , they are quietly coming back . the pressure was intense in mönchengladbach last april .
the once-proud club , a team that won five bundesliga titles from 1970 to 1977 , was on the fringes of dropping into the second division . hiring former dutch coach dick advocaat in the fall of 2004 - the first time in the club 's 115-year history that it had had a foreign coach - had turned out to be a disaster .
called the " general , " advocaat 's strict measures only resulted in mediocre performances by the players . something had to be done , and advocaat was given his marching orders .
now someone had to be found who could save the army .
the gladbach management went with a man who was a force behind the success of the team of the 1970 's : horst köppel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berti vogts : successful defender and german national coach the offensive-playing midfielder stood side-by-side with the likes of jupp heynckes and berti vogts , now coaches with experience both in the bundesliga -lrb- heynckes -rrb- and the national team -lrb- vogts -rrb- .
köppel 's resume is a little thinner , his biggest success as a coach was a german cup victory with borussia dortmund in 1989 . relegation held off but the move paid off .
it was n't necessarily done in spectacular fashion over the final five weeks of the season .
a 2-0 victory and three goalless draws sufficed to keep gladbach , a team that has only played one year in the second season , in the top division .
the team finished with 35 goals as a whole for the season . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich -lrb- red -rrb- squeezed gladbach in the season 's opening match at the beginning of the 2005-06 season , little was expected of the team .
they travelled to bayern munich for the first-ever bundesliga match in the new allianz arena .
even one man up , gladbach were no match for bayern who effortlessly won 3-0 .
for gladbach fans it was a pitiful start of the season . but something has changed since then .
in their last eight matches , they have taken all three points four times and tied three times .
one of the victories came against bremen in which köppel 's club could put a desolate first-half behind them to win .

" i hope we can avoid getting into detailed discussions of the future financing issue at hampton court , " said british prime minister and summit host tony blair , referring to talks on the 2007-2013 budget for the 25-nation bloc . the budget standoff is of particularly urgent concern to the 10 new , mostly ex-communist , countries which joined the eu last year and need a resolution to unblock key eu funds for their still relatively poor economies . response to globalization but while some still want to discuss finances , formally the one-day meeting - cut down from two after some eu leaders clearly thought there was not enough meat to justify the overnight stop - will tackle the lofty subject of europe 's future in the age of " globalization .

" how do we meet the competitive challenge and maintain the security of our citizens in a world of unprecedented movement ? " french viewpoint french president jacques chirac - whose long-strained relations with the british leader have reached a new nadir amid the eu budget standoff - can be counted on to have diverging views from the summit host . paris has long been the champion of a european economic model which puts far more emphasis on generous social protection , workers ' rights and ensuring that key state enterprises remain viable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a french dairy farm , part of the beloved " terroir " france wants defended indeed , the summit takes place against the background of world trade talks in which france is fiercely defending the eu 's long-disputed common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- , of which french farmers are the main beneficiaries . the cap is at the heart of the budget standoff : britain is pushing hard for further reform of its trade-distorting payouts .
but france is standing firm , while countering that blair must surrender london 's long-cherished eu rebate . while serious budget haggling is not on the menu in hampton court , there is hope for some " informal discussion " in the corridors of henry viii 's palace by the thames , possibly even making some progress ahead of a december showdown . constitution question but no progress - and precious little discussion - is expected on the other key problem facing the eu : the rejection of its constitution by french and dutch voters , which plunged the bloc into crisis in june . the institutional blueprint was designed to avoid decision-making gridlock in the still-expanding union , which is set to welcome romania and bulgaria in 2007 with a line of others waiting at the eu door . few expect any progress on the issue until after french presidential polls in 2007 , when some hope that chirac may be succeeded by a more popular leader - such as nicolas sarkozy - who could somehow turn the french " non " around . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in the eu are skeptical about eu membership but the prospect of the charismatic rightwinger in the elysee palace - following the german transfer of power to merkel - raises another thorny strategic issue for the european bloc : turkey . the eu overcame last-minute problems this month to start membership talks with the vast mostly muslim state .

but the end of that decade marked a long period of decline .
now , however , they are quietly coming back . the pressure was intense in mönchengladbach last april .
the once-proud club , a team that won five bundesliga titles from 1970 to 1977 , was on the fringes of dropping into the second division . hiring former dutch coach dick advocaat in the fall of 2004 - the first time in the club 's 115-year history that it had had a foreign coach - had turned out to be a disaster .
called the " general , " advocaat 's strict measures only resulted in mediocre performances by the players . something had to be done , and advocaat was given his marching orders .
now someone had to be found who could save the army .
the gladbach management went with a man who was a force behind the success of the team of the 1970 's : horst köppel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berti vogts : successful defender and german national coach the offensive-playing midfielder stood side-by-side with the likes of jupp heynckes and berti vogts , now coaches with experience both in the bundesliga -lrb- heynckes -rrb- and the national team -lrb- vogts -rrb- .
köppel 's resume is a little thinner , his biggest success as a coach was a german cup victory with borussia dortmund in 1989 . relegation held off but the move paid off .
it was n't necessarily done in spectacular fashion over the final five weeks of the season .
a 2-0 victory and three goalless draws sufficed to keep gladbach , a team that has only played one year in the second season , in the top division .

for gladbach fans it was a pitiful start of the season . but something has changed since then .
in their last eight matches , they have taken all three points four times and tied three times .
one of the victories came against bremen in which köppel 's club could put a desolate first-half behind them to win .
the timing could n't have been better .
after a 2-1 loss to hated rhineland rivals cologne , people were calling for köppel 's head . " we are not going to talk about the coach , " team manager peter pander said after that game .

in that last minute though , captain jeff strasser scored an own goal to ruin an otherwise satisfactory day . despite that small setback , gladbach are starting to reach heights that might make many in the club dizzy - they are fifth-place .
however , manager pander cautions that the impressive performances in the past few weeks are no cause for premature rejoicing . " nobody should forget that this is just a snapshot of the moment , " manager pander cautioned in the rheinische post newspaper . yet he also said that nobody would have thought that mönchengladbach would have been playing for fifth-place in october .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.10.2005 eu leaders to avoid tough topics at summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tough eu issues to crack , but they 're on the back burner for now european union leaders will broach the " challenges of globalization " at an informal summit this week - while strenuously avoiding awkward topics which have dragged the bloc to the brink of all-out crisis . the summit talks , amid the tudor splendour of hampton court palace outside london , are officially aimed at working out europe 's strategic response to the threat typified by rising asian giants like china and india . but looming over the meeting like a royal specter will be the dual challenge of a deadlock over the bloc 's future budget , and the more fundamental question of its whole future , following the rejection by france and the netherlands of the eu constitution . " i hope we can avoid getting into detailed discussions of the future financing issue at hampton court , " said british prime minister and summit host tony blair , referring to talks on the 2007-2013 budget for the 25-nation bloc . the budget standoff is of particularly urgent concern to the 10 new , mostly ex-communist , countries which joined the eu last year and need a resolution to unblock key eu funds for their still relatively poor economies . response to globalization but while some still want to discuss finances , formally the one-day meeting - cut down from two after some eu leaders clearly thought there was not enough meat to justify the overnight stop - will tackle the lofty subject of europe 's future in the age of " globalization . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing chancellor schröder -lrb- l -rrb- with the uk 's tony blair traditional eu heavyweights france and germany - whose outgoing social democratic leader gerhard schröder will be attending his last summit - will be keen to defend their long-cherished vision of europe 's " social model . " but blair , who currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , will be equally keen to bang the drum for the kind of free-market reforms espoused by schröder 's successor angela merkel . the main theme of discussions will be " the opportunities and challenges of globalization , " blair said in his letter of invitation to the summit .
" how do we meet the competitive challenge and maintain the security of our citizens in a world of unprecedented movement ? " french viewpoint french president jacques chirac - whose long-strained relations with the british leader have reached a new nadir amid the eu budget standoff - can be counted on to have diverging views from the summit host . paris has long been the champion of a european economic model which puts far more emphasis on generous social protection , workers ' rights and ensuring that key state enterprises remain viable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a french dairy farm , part of the beloved " terroir " france wants defended indeed , the summit takes place against the background of world trade talks in which france is fiercely defending the eu 's long-disputed common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- , of which french farmers are the main beneficiaries . the cap is at the heart of the budget standoff : britain is pushing hard for further reform of its trade-distorting payouts .
but france is standing firm , while countering that blair must surrender london 's long-cherished eu rebate . while serious budget haggling is not on the menu in hampton court , there is hope for some " informal discussion " in the corridors of henry viii 's palace by the thames , possibly even making some progress ahead of a december showdown . constitution question but no progress - and precious little discussion - is expected on the other key problem facing the eu : the rejection of its constitution by french and dutch voters , which plunged the bloc into crisis in june . the institutional blueprint was designed to avoid decision-making gridlock in the still-expanding union , which is set to welcome romania and bulgaria in 2007 with a line of others waiting at the eu door . few expect any progress on the issue until after french presidential polls in 2007 , when some hope that chirac may be succeeded by a more popular leader - such as nicolas sarkozy - who could somehow turn the french " non " around . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in the eu are skeptical about eu membership but the prospect of the charismatic rightwinger in the elysee palace - following the german transfer of power to merkel - raises another thorny strategic issue for the european bloc : turkey . the eu overcame last-minute problems this month to start membership talks with the vast mostly muslim state .
but both merkel and sarkozy are openly opposed to turkey ever actually joining . that issue may , again , be discussed in the sidelines of this week 's summit .
but in the formal talks blair will be keen to keep the focus squarely on more general strategic issues . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controlling eu farming subsidies eu member states pay millions into the european union each year .

" i hope we can avoid getting into detailed discussions of the future financing issue at hampton court , " said british prime minister and summit host tony blair , referring to talks on the 2007-2013 budget for the 25-nation bloc . the budget standoff is of particularly urgent concern to the 10 new , mostly ex-communist , countries which joined the eu last year and need a resolution to unblock key eu funds for their still relatively poor economies . response to globalization but while some still want to discuss finances , formally the one-day meeting - cut down from two after some eu leaders clearly thought there was not enough meat to justify the overnight stop - will tackle the lofty subject of europe 's future in the age of " globalization . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing chancellor schröder -lrb- l -rrb- with the uk 's tony blair traditional eu heavyweights france and germany - whose outgoing social democratic leader gerhard schröder will be attending his last summit - will be keen to defend their long-cherished vision of europe 's " social model . " but blair , who currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , will be equally keen to bang the drum for the kind of free-market reforms espoused by schröder 's successor angela merkel . the main theme of discussions will be " the opportunities and challenges of globalization , " blair said in his letter of invitation to the summit .
" how do we meet the competitive challenge and maintain the security of our citizens in a world of unprecedented movement ? " french viewpoint french president jacques chirac - whose long-strained relations with the british leader have reached a new nadir amid the eu budget standoff - can be counted on to have diverging views from the summit host . paris has long been the champion of a european economic model which puts far more emphasis on generous social protection , workers ' rights and ensuring that key state enterprises remain viable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a french dairy farm , part of the beloved " terroir " france wants defended indeed , the summit takes place against the background of world trade talks in which france is fiercely defending the eu 's long-disputed common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- , of which french farmers are the main beneficiaries . the cap is at the heart of the budget standoff : britain is pushing hard for further reform of its trade-distorting payouts .
but france is standing firm , while countering that blair must surrender london 's long-cherished eu rebate . while serious budget haggling is not on the menu in hampton court , there is hope for some " informal discussion " in the corridors of henry viii 's palace by the thames , possibly even making some progress ahead of a december showdown . constitution question but no progress - and precious little discussion - is expected on the other key problem facing the eu : the rejection of its constitution by french and dutch voters , which plunged the bloc into crisis in june . the institutional blueprint was designed to avoid decision-making gridlock in the still-expanding union , which is set to welcome romania and bulgaria in 2007 with a line of others waiting at the eu door . few expect any progress on the issue until after french presidential polls in 2007 , when some hope that chirac may be succeeded by a more popular leader - such as nicolas sarkozy - who could somehow turn the french " non " around . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in the eu are skeptical about eu membership but the prospect of the charismatic rightwinger in the elysee palace - following the german transfer of power to merkel - raises another thorny strategic issue for the european bloc : turkey . the eu overcame last-minute problems this month to start membership talks with the vast mostly muslim state .

four people were stabbed and two people shot in the disturbances .
a black man in his 20s died from stab wounds and a police officer was shot with a ball bearing gun .
the other injuries are not said to be serious .
a riot broke out after a public meeting in the area over an alleged sexual attack on a 14-year-old girl .
police say the violence was not a reaction to the meeting .
assistant chief constable david shaw said : " it does not appear that a lot of people got together in advance , but i do believe that some people started the day , with intent to cause mayhem . "
he added : " police and community leaders share their abhorrence with the loss of life experienced .
" this is the work of a small number of individuals and is not a true reflection of community relations in birmingham . "
tensions high some locals say a 14-year-old illegal immigrant was subjected to a serious sexual assault last tuesday .
there are a very small number of individuals who are carrying out this khalid mahmood mp " there is an allegation that a young black girl has been raped , some people say gang raped , by some asian men , and that is the core cause of the tension , " bishop joe aldred from the council of black led-churches , told bbc news 24 .
since then several people from the afro-caribbean community have been " campaigning for justice " outside a shop where the attack allegedly took place , he said .
bishop aldred said the meeting was held to shed some light on the issue .
" i think that the violence was linked to the tensions there have been in the community since maybe tuesday , " he said .
" it could not have been linked to the church meeting because what came out of that was the kind of stuff that would allay fears , not heighten them . "
police say they are following several lines of inquiry and have carried out forensic tests , house-to-house inquiries and distributed thousands of leaflets in a bid to find the alleged victim .
the home office has promised it will not investigate the victim 's immigrations status until after the end of any criminal proceedings .
mr shaw said there was " not a shred of evidence " to support the allegations but investigations were continuing .
he said : " birmingham is a city that prides itself on living together harmoniously with one another and has done a fantastic job for many years when other places have been challenged .
" we have to ask ourselves really searching questions now about how we can prevent our community that we so cherish being characterised by these events . "
arrests a police spokeswoman said the dead man would not be named until next of kin had been informed .
a number of arrests have been made .
history of tension the lozells area has a history of racial violence tension exists between the large afro-caribbean population and asian gangs drugs and gun crime are also major causes of trouble in 2002 a female asian shopkeeper was attacked with a machete by a black man in 2003 , charlene ellis , 18 , and letisha shakespeare , 17 were shot dead in nearby aston as the burger bar boys gang sought revenge on rivals the johnson crew the area also saw the september 1985 handsworth riots , triggered by the arrest of a black man after a police stop and search a spokeswoman for west midlands ambulance service said at least 12 people had been taken to the city hospital in dudley road in birmingham .
police officers in riot gear , dog handlers , fire engines , ambulances and vehicle recovery units patrolled streets in the area .
the confrontation between rioters and police saw cars burned , missiles thrown and groups of people wearing masks , or covering their faces with hoods .
a burnt-out wreck of a car was left abandoned outside the asian resource centre in the middle of lozells road .
bricks were also scattered across the road outside the new testament church of god where saturday 's meeting was held .
' without warning ' bbc correspondent deborah bain said the riots broke out after about 100 people outside the meeting started fighting with the police .
but she said it was " not yet clear what sparked the disturbances which came without warning " .
the meeting in a local church in lozells road , which was addressed by two senior police officers and the mp for perry barr , khalid mahmood , followed an earlier rally of about 200 people in support of victims of crime .
mr mahmood told bbc news he thought the incidents were linked to the assault allegation but a small group of people " predominantly from outside the area " were responsible .
" there are a very small number of individuals who are carrying out this , " he said .
" they 're a fairly mobile group of people . "
the rally was in support of victims of crime " there 's been about four or five flashpoints in different parts of the aston handsworth ward and what we are trying to do is to deal with that . "
mr shaw said he paid tribute to the work carried out by the local black and asian community to reassure people and " try and put some fact behind the rumours " .
a statement on the force website said the build-up to the violence started last weekend .
" police treated this as serious and have investigated it as if a crime had taken place but despite this there has not been any evidence that an attack has taken place . "

" inexperienced driving , a cavalier attitude to life , a night-time social life involving alcohol , and driving too fast , are combining to kill and maim young people and other road users every night of the week , " aa motoring trust road safety head andrew howard said .
he called for urgent police action to get thrill-seeking young men off the road .
he also said the government needed to improve young men 's attitude to driving as much as improving their ability to drive .

night-time accidents , a two-year study by ucl , was jointly funded by the aa trust and the rees jeffreys road fund .
the two-year study involved analysis of government road casualty and traffic data alongside the government 's diary-based national travel survey .

many landowners , who often live in remote areas out of the reach of law enforcement agencies , are fighting hard for a no vote .
opinion polls suggest the comfortable lead earlier allocated to the yes vote has now been eroded .
the head of the parliamentary commission of agriculture , deputy xico graziano , said landowners needed weapons in part to guard against " bandits and assailants " , many of whom he said had infiltrated the country 's militant , million-strong landless movement , the mst .
but civil groups point out that firearm deaths have fallen since a successful gun buy-back scheme was introduced in late 2003 .
they say violence-weary brazilians are beginning to understand that a safer country means fewer weapons .
land dispute the 23 october referendum looms against a backdrop of a new wave of assaults by members of the mst on land they say is unproductive and which the constitution therefore allows them to claim .
this has heightened the anger of the landowners .
i defend the farmers and rural workers who are out of the reach of public security lawmaker xico graziano " the mst knocks down fences and invades rural estates without any respect for the law .
they select the farms , according to their own criteria , and simply seize them , demanding from the government that they must be appropriated in the name of land reform , " said mr graziano - a deputy himself and former head of the governmental agrarian reform institute -lrb- incra -rrb- .
" in the past , up until a decade ago , such areas were indeed generally lying idle - those latifundios -lsb- landed estates -rsb- .
but today , the majority of farms are productive , thanks to the far-reaching technological modernisation that has occurred in the sector , " he said .
according to a recent article by jonne roriz in the country 's leading news magazine veja , " without weapons , -lsb- landowners and farmers -rsb- would ... lose a powerful instrument of dissuasion to prevent invasions by the mst " .
the referendum question should sales of firearms and ammunition be prohibited in brazil ?
mr graziano is reluctant to draw a direct link between the landowners ' demand to keep weapons and the renewed campaign by the mst to grab land , saying that like other brazilians , landowners need guns for self-defence in the face of the crime wave which has swept brazil over recent years .
but he does allege that the mst has been infiltrated by many of the common criminals - the " bandits and assailants " - he fears .
" i defend the farmers and rural workers who are out of the reach of public security , " he said .
landowners ' not victims ' a key backer of the mst , the pastoral land commission , disputes the idea that landowners are the victims of the landless peasants .
yes camp lose ground opinion polls asking : should gun sales be banned ?
yes : 73 % ; no : 24 % -lrb- source : cnt-sensus , 13 september -rrb- yes : 45 % ; no : 49 % -lrb- source : ibope , 15 october -rrb- yes : 34 % ; no : 52 % -lrb- source : toledo & associados , 19 october -rrb- it points to the state of para , where brazil 's conflict over land is at its most acute .
fourteen of the 28 violent deaths attributed to clashes over land in the first half of 2005 happened in para - but most of the victims were landless peasants , trade unionists and indians , it says .
" i do n't think the solution to the land problem in brazil is through weapons , " josephine bourgois at viva rio , a leading human rights group campaigning for a ban on gun sales , told the bbc news website .
she says the real victims of the widespread prevalence of firearms are young men , mainly in the cities , among whom bullet injuries are the leading cause of death .
she also disputes the notion that " gun crime is the preserve of criminals whose faces are on wanted posters " .
famed musician chico buarque is among the yes -lrb- " sim " -rrb- supporters " in fact , " she says , " violence is a lot more of a complicated phenomenon than that .
it 's common citizens involved in road rage , jealousy ... it 's a discussion in a bar which turns nasty .
it 's a form of conflict resolution with a weapon . "
there are more firearm-related deaths in brazil than any other country - 36,091 in 2004 .
this referendum is the latest phase in a gun law passed by congress in 2003 to try to tackle the problem .
voting is obligatory , and it is the first occasion that gun sales laws have been decided by a national vote .
opinion polls in august and september gave a healthy lead to supporters of the ban , but the latest poll suggests the no camp has an edge .
with supporters and opponents given daily slots on tv and radio to argue their case , the debate continues to rage .

many landowners , who often live in remote areas out of the reach of law enforcement agencies , are fighting hard for a no vote .
opinion polls suggest the comfortable lead earlier allocated to the yes vote has now been eroded .
the head of the parliamentary commission of agriculture , deputy xico graziano , said landowners needed weapons in part to guard against " bandits and assailants " , many of whom he said had infiltrated the country 's militant , million-strong landless movement , the mst .
but civil groups point out that firearm deaths have fallen since a successful gun buy-back scheme was introduced in late 2003 .
they say violence-weary brazilians are beginning to understand that a safer country means fewer weapons .
land dispute the 23 october referendum looms against a backdrop of a new wave of assaults by members of the mst on land they say is unproductive and which the constitution therefore allows them to claim .
this has heightened the anger of the landowners .
i defend the farmers and rural workers who are out of the reach of public security lawmaker xico graziano " the mst knocks down fences and invades rural estates without any respect for the law .
they select the farms , according to their own criteria , and simply seize them , demanding from the government that they must be appropriated in the name of land reform , " said mr graziano - a deputy himself and former head of the governmental agrarian reform institute -lrb- incra -rrb- .
" in the past , up until a decade ago , such areas were indeed generally lying idle - those latifundios -lsb- landed estates -rsb- .
but today , the majority of farms are productive , thanks to the far-reaching technological modernisation that has occurred in the sector , " he said .
according to a recent article by jonne roriz in the country 's leading news magazine veja , " without weapons , -lsb- landowners and farmers -rsb- would ... lose a powerful instrument of dissuasion to prevent invasions by the mst " .
the referendum question should sales of firearms and ammunition be prohibited in brazil ?
mr graziano is reluctant to draw a direct link between the landowners ' demand to keep weapons and the renewed campaign by the mst to grab land , saying that like other brazilians , landowners need guns for self-defence in the face of the crime wave which has swept brazil over recent years .
but he does allege that the mst has been infiltrated by many of the common criminals - the " bandits and assailants " - he fears .
" i defend the farmers and rural workers who are out of the reach of public security , " he said .
landowners ' not victims ' a key backer of the mst , the pastoral land commission , disputes the idea that landowners are the victims of the landless peasants .

the authorities say it is the world 's first nationwide vote on guns , and that it could set a precedent for campaigns in other countries .
the bbc news website looks at some of the key issues surrounding the referendum .
why is the vote important for brazil ?
brazil has the second-highest number - behind venezuela - of gun-related deaths in the world per capita , outstripping many war zones .
a recent united nations report said more than half a million people were killed by guns in brazil between 1979 and 2003 .
firearms are believed to be the biggest cause of death among brazil 's youth .
heavily armed drug gangs control slums , or favelas , and regularly engage in fights with outgunned police .
the cities of sao paulo and rio de janeiro are traditionally associated with gun crime .
last year , 36,000 people were killed with firearms - 99 deaths per day .
what exactly is to be decided ?
over 120 million people are expected to take part in the referendum - voting is compulsory in latin america 's largest country .
if brazil votes in favour of the ban , all sales of guns and ammunition to civilians will be halted , leaving those who already have registered firearms without bullets .
police , judges , military personnel and private security firms will still be able to buy them .
according to official figures , there are 17 million guns circulating in the country , 90 % of them in the hands of civilians and half of them unregistered .
over 60,000 firearms are sold every year .
what do brazilians think about the ban ?
months ago opinion polls suggested that most people were in favour of such a ban , but the latest survey shows a slight advantage of the " no " vote , so results of the referendum look very uncertain .
even the government is divided .
president luiz inacio lula da silva endorses the prohibition .
but his vice-president and defence minister , jose alencar , says it would encourage criminals .
what do supporters and opponents of the ban say ?
both have waged fierce campaigns on radio and television and in the press .
those wanting to see gun sales banned say it will contribute to cutting down the violence that has given brazil an annual death toll from firearms that is higher than many war zones .
but advocates of gun ownership say the prohibition would not reduce the arsenals held by drug gangs and other criminals , because it is not addressing the problem of illegal guns smuggled into brazil from neighbouring countries .
they also claim that the right to legitimate defence is an essential right .
some brazilians say that they will vote against the ban in order to keep protecting themselves from street crime .
what has the government done so far to fight gun-related crime ?
a law passed by congress recently has placed restrictions on who can buy and carry guns , and over the past year nearly half a million weapons have been handed in to police and destroyed under a buy-back scheme .
this year brazil reported a fall in the number of deaths caused by firearms for the first time in 13 years .
the government put the improvement down to its own disarmament policies .

harrow residents in north-west london discussed whether roads , teachers or libraries should be priorities .
they sat on tables of 10 and gave views by computer - final decisions will be presented to harrow council .
two years ago harrow residents delayed payments in protest at a 20 % hike in council tax .
the assembly idea was a suggestion from the power inquiry , which is trying to " re-engage people with local democracy and government " .
' next generation ' those on the assembly will reflect the age and racial mix of harrow and each table will have its own " facilitator " - to ensure no-one takes over the debate .
tessy akpeki , 17 , who is among those taking part , told bbc london : " we are the generation coming up .
we are the people who are going to have to live with decisions that are made .
" so if we do n't take part in what goes on right now , there 's no way we can blame anyone later . "
other experiments in local democracy have seen croydon hold council tax referendums , where residents were given the chance to vote on lower council tax , or better services .
hikes in council tax have seen more rebels , including some pensioners hit particularly hard because of their fixed income , going to court for refusing to pay .
the harrow council tax campaign was formed and some residents cancelled direct debits and standing orders in december 2003 .
it is still going strong with a new campaign to debate the cost of the 2012 olympics to londoners .
figures from the halifax released this month show the average council tax bill has doubled since it was introduced 12 years ago .
