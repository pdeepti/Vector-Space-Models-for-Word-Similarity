program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : educating germany germans mull sweeping education reforms germany to introduce federal school standards bad grades for german schools report lambastes german schools germany -pipe- 26.07.2005 east german school outshines competitors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when class becomes too dull , a demanding school is needed east germany discarded the socialist rule that all of its citizens were equal when it came to select schools .
only one such school remains .
could germany learn from it ? at the 27th technology students association -lrb- tsa -rrb- annual conference in chicago , illinois , the 10th graders martin and steffen do not stick out much more than the 3,500 middle and high school students who made the journey from around the usa .
the big difference between martin , steffen and six other schoolmates is their origin - they have come from leipzig , germany to show off their scientific skills at america 's largest science fair .
and it is n't martin 's first time at the tsa .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steffen and martin from leipzig 's wilhelm-ostwald-gymnasium in chicago the school they attend , the wilhelm ostwald gymnasium -lrb- wog -rrb- in leipzig in the state of saxony , is not just any run-of-the-mill high school that any student goes to after finishing primary education .
the selection criteria are daunting , the pupils only the best .
unusual for german schools , where despite the three-tiered system with the gymnasium , or university prep school , at the top , educators place a lot of value on egalitarianism .
' seediness ' of success wog , founded in 1985 , just four years before communist east germany collapsed , may have a short tradition , but it was deeply-rooted in the gdr 's system of promoting the best .
its niche was the advancement of math and natural sciences , and still possibly would be if erich honecker or egon krenz still ruled .
brigitte heink has been at the school either as a teacher or principal since 1986 .
after the fall of the berlin wall , the east german schools was transformed to mirror the west german system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin 's car entry built with lego blocks she was convinced that the school should remain dedicated to the natural sciences and took over the helm as principal in 1992 .
education for top kids at top speed is not the norm in germany , something heink can not understand .
" highlighting particularly good achievements by students , other than in sports , seems to have a ' seedy ' reputation in germany , " said the principal .
" i can not comprehend that , since i was raised with a different attitude towards achievement . "
achievement counts once a pupil is admitted , there is nothing normal about it .
on the school 's web site , a list of the winners and participants at various competitions is presented .
not only do math , chemistry and physics events turn up , but also chess and marathon .
one course in the curriculum is boomerang , not just throwing one , but learning just what makes the australian weapon fly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pisa results have not only forced school students to pull out their hair chicago does n't seem so exotic compared to istanbul , jakarta or taiwan , all locations where the students have proved their skills over the past 12 months .
fifth-graders may be thrown into deep water when they enter wog , but they almost all can swim .
but wog is the exception .
of the 14 schools for " gifted " students that existed in the gdr in 1989 , only the leipzig school retained its concentrated program of math and science .
that may have paid off in the last pisa 2003 results that test students from the world 's industrialized countries in areas such as science , math and reading competence .
saxony , in germany 's east , broke the stronghold of the southern states , finishing second only behind bavaria and far above the international pisa averages in mathematical and science competence .
thuringia and saxony-anhalt also have left their western german cousins far behind .
" i am certain that the traditional attitudes and demands of the school play a not so insignificant role -lrb- in the pisa results -rrb- , " heink believes .
gifted programs rare in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' jugend forscht ' -lrb- ' youth does research ' -rrb- allows german middle and high school students to show off their science and technical skills the shock of the first pisa results in 2000 still sits deep in germany .
the home of some of history ’ s greatest scientists and mathematicians - alexander von humboldt , albert einstein , werner von braun - was wallowing in mediocrity .
the university revolt of the 1960s which swept across west germany resulted in watered-down , less-strict educational standards .
that revolt never hit the gdr .
now people wonder if something can be learned from it .
an expert for programs for bright students , elke kaiser from the bavarian state institute for school quality and educational research , says more could be done to help the gifted .
in bavaria , only four schools in three cities have elite educational programs .
if a parent ’ s extremely bright child does n't live in or near munich , nuremberg or würzburg , which in germany 's geographically largest state is quite possible , then the smart tike can visit only a " normal " gymnasium .
kaiser feels more must be done outside of the big cities .
a variety of factors are involved .
money is one of the ´ most important - but so is envy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in a university lecture hall in tübingen : it 's never too early to visit college " if a class of eight gifted students were split off from the rest of the school , " she explained , " some parents get upset , wondering why their child isn ’ t amongst the smartest .
and then you 'll hear complaints that too much money is being spent on just a few pupils . "
brain drain there is also fear that after investing great time and money in someone with great potential , they might go to another country to study - like the us - and then possibly stay .
it 's something 18-year-old florian kraft from wog would consider .
he says german equivalents to the tsa , like " jugend forscht " -lrb- " youth does research " -rrb- , are n't respected by universities and companies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : albert einstein , probably germany 's greatest physicist " what a high school student does at ' jugend forscht ' doesn ’ t get any recognition , " kraft said .
" if i go to an american university and say ' i won this , this and this at tsa ' the response from the university is ' hello , when would you like to check in ' ? "
and this is one reason why kraft doesn ’ t participate in " jugend forscht . "
but he 's been at tsa four times .
back in leipzig , kraft feels at home at wog .
with only 500 students - other leipzig schools have easily over 1,000 - the school is small and everyone knows just about everyone else , both students and teachers alike .
to kraft , it 's family .
that family may have just been born at the right time and in the right place .
the berlin wall fell , and the east germans were reveling in the joys of freedom .
the west germans could provide money .
but now the morose financial situation of the german government may make the creation of a wog anywhere else an unachievable goal - at least in the public school system .
and martin , steffen , florian and their classmates can continue to travel to scholastic competitions around europe and the world - after receiving financial support from private and corporate sponsors . john kluempers , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the dumbing down of germany a german politician was roundly criticized recently for commenting that only the " wrong people " were having children in germany .

the islamic radical had admitted to killing filmmaker theo van gogh last november , saying he acted out of faith . the three-judge panel of the amsterdam high-security court announced the life sentence against bouyeri for the murder which the prosecution said signaled the end of innocence for the tolerant netherlands .
to show just how severe the judges believe this reading is , they have order that bouyeri be present in court as the verdict was read out - something almost unheard of in the netherlands , where suspects are not obliged to attend the reading of the verdict and it is very rare that a court orders a suspect to attend .
suspect flouts court 's authority bouyeri , a 27-year old who holds dual dutch and moroccan nationality , has made it clear he does not recognize the authority of the court .
during the trial he ordered his attorney not to present a defense .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theo van gogh was gunned down in broad daylight the slaying of van gogh , carried out in broad daylight as he cycled to work , shocked the netherlands .
it stoked ethnic tensions and sparked a wave of reprisal attacks primarily directed at the muslim community here .
the filmmaker , a distant relative of 19th century painter vincent van gogh , was also an outspoken columnist who often criticized islam and multicultural society .
together with dutch lawmaker ayaan hirsi ali , he made a short film called " submission , " linking islam to the abuse of women and causing outrage in the dutch muslim community .
after van gogh 's murder , hirsi ali went into hiding for three months because a letter threatening her and other politicians was found on the filmmaker 's body .
end of the innocence " the netherlands has lost its innocence .
our country has suddenly become a target of international terrorism , " prosecutor frits van straelen said during the trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch member of parliament ayaan hirsi ali had to go underground after van gogh 's murder bouyeri was charged with the premeditated murder of van gogh , the attempted murder of several police officers and bystanders , illegal possession of firearms , obstructing the work of hirsi ali as a member of parliament and threatening her with a terrorist act .
a life sentence carries no possibility of parole in the netherlands , but convicts can be released after receiving a royal pardon .
whether bouyeri would like a pardon from the queen is another matter .
in a dramatic final speech to the court at the end of his trial two weeks ago , he said he wanted to receive the maximum punishment and warned that he would do the same again if he were freed .
" i do not want to miss the chance to get the maximum sentence ...
i can assure you that if i am ever freed , i will do exactly the same , " he told the court .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence towards muslims , here a muslim school in flames , broke out after van gogh 's murder although he gave some insight as to why he killed van gogh , the dutch are still struggling to understand how bouyeri - who was born and raised in amsterdam - turned into radical islam .
bouyeri himself refused to comment on his transformation .
" you can set all your psychologists , psychiatrists and experts on me , but i tell you , you will never understand .
you ca n't , " he taunted the court . dw staff / afp -lrb- jdk , ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when freedom gets the death sentence the murder of a turkish woman and the applauding of the crime by some students have left berlin shaken and officials pushing for ethics class .

the islamic radical had admitted to killing filmmaker theo van gogh last november , saying he acted out of faith . the three-judge panel of the amsterdam high-security court announced the life sentence against bouyeri for the murder which the prosecution said signaled the end of innocence for the tolerant netherlands .
to show just how severe the judges believe this reading is , they have order that bouyeri be present in court as the verdict was read out - something almost unheard of in the netherlands , where suspects are not obliged to attend the reading of the verdict and it is very rare that a court orders a suspect to attend .
suspect flouts court 's authority bouyeri , a 27-year old who holds dual dutch and moroccan nationality , has made it clear he does not recognize the authority of the court .
during the trial he ordered his attorney not to present a defense .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theo van gogh was gunned down in broad daylight the slaying of van gogh , carried out in broad daylight as he cycled to work , shocked the netherlands .
it stoked ethnic tensions and sparked a wave of reprisal attacks primarily directed at the muslim community here .
the filmmaker , a distant relative of 19th century painter vincent van gogh , was also an outspoken columnist who often criticized islam and multicultural society .
together with dutch lawmaker ayaan hirsi ali , he made a short film called " submission , " linking islam to the abuse of women and causing outrage in the dutch muslim community .
after van gogh 's murder , hirsi ali went into hiding for three months because a letter threatening her and other politicians was found on the filmmaker 's body .
end of the innocence " the netherlands has lost its innocence .
our country has suddenly become a target of international terrorism , " prosecutor frits van straelen said during the trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch member of parliament ayaan hirsi ali had to go underground after van gogh 's murder bouyeri was charged with the premeditated murder of van gogh , the attempted murder of several police officers and bystanders , illegal possession of firearms , obstructing the work of hirsi ali as a member of parliament and threatening her with a terrorist act .
a life sentence carries no possibility of parole in the netherlands , but convicts can be released after receiving a royal pardon .
whether bouyeri would like a pardon from the queen is another matter .
in a dramatic final speech to the court at the end of his trial two weeks ago , he said he wanted to receive the maximum punishment and warned that he would do the same again if he were freed .
" i do not want to miss the chance to get the maximum sentence ...
i can assure you that if i am ever freed , i will do exactly the same , " he told the court .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence towards muslims , here a muslim school in flames , broke out after van gogh 's murder although he gave some insight as to why he killed van gogh , the dutch are still struggling to understand how bouyeri - who was born and raised in amsterdam - turned into radical islam .
bouyeri himself refused to comment on his transformation .
" you can set all your psychologists , psychiatrists and experts on me , but i tell you , you will never understand .
you ca n't , " he taunted the court . dw staff / afp -lrb- jdk , ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when freedom gets the death sentence the murder of a turkish woman and the applauding of the crime by some students have left berlin shaken and officials pushing for ethics class .

today , the country can look back on a checkered history of bundestag elections since the german federal republic was founded in 1949 . west german citizens went to the polls in august 1949 .
it was the first time since the end of the weimar republic in 1933 that men and women could vote in a democratic election for a new parliament . the turnout was one many other countries could only dream of .
nearly 80 percent of eligible voters headed to the ballot boxes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad adenauer takes his oath of office on sept .
20 , 1949 from president erich koehler the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , got the best results , with 31 percent of the votes .
cdu chairman konrad adenauer was elected the nation 's first chancellor , based on a coalition of cdu / csu , free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the very conservative german party -lrb- dp -rrb- . the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who won 29.2 percent of the vote , began a 17-year period in the opposition . 1957 : " no experiments " adenauer 's policies were focused on consolidating germany 's market economy and integrating the country into the western camp .
a significant step toward this aim was germany 's entry into nato in 1955 . voters in the 1957 election confirmed the government , which had run on the slogan " no experiments . "
the cdu / csu won 50.2 percent of the votes .
it was the only time in german postwar history that a party could gain the absolute majority in parliament in federal elections . but 1957 also marked the beginning of the spd 's rise in support , which continued to 1972 . 1965 : the grand coalition the coalition partners cdu / csu and fdp won a significant victory in the 1965 federal elections .
but one year later , the partners could n't reach agreement on how to fill the impending budget gap .
the fdp resisted the union 's aimed tax increases and the coalition collapsed . this marked the beginning of a three-year grand coalition of cdu / csu and spd .
kurt-georg kiesinger -lrb- cdu -rrb- was elected chancellor .
spd chairman and former mayor of berlin willy brandt became his deputy and foreign minister . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : willy brandt 's push for relations with east germany led to his fall the 1969 elections forced the cdu / csu to retreat to the opposition for the first time in postwar german history .
the spd formed a coalition with the fdp and brandt became chancellor . 1972 : confirmation for brandt chancellor brandt emphasized domestic reforms but more importantly , he wanted to improve relations with eastern bloc countries and the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- . this controversial ostpolitik led to fierce domestic wrangling and almost to brandt 's fall in 1972 .
several mps from spd and fdp left their parties .
the cdu / csu felt its time had come and demanded a vote on a motion of no confidence . the attempt failed by an extremely narrow margin .
but the government no longer had the necessary majority in parliament .
the bundestag was dissolved and new elections were called in the fall of 1972 .
these gave the spd 45.8 percent of the vote , its best result on a federal level ever .
the spd / fdp coalition remained in power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut schmidt won a vote of no confidence in feb .
1982 but was later defeated by kohl brandt was forced to resign in 1974 following an espionage scandal .
he was replaced by his finance minister helmut schmidt , also a social democrat . 1983 : kohl comes to power although the cdu / csu faction was the strongest in parliament , the spd continued ruling with schmidt through a coalition with the fdp .
but following elections in 1980 , growing disputes with the fdp in tackling economic issues led several fdp ministers to leave schmidt 's cabinet in 1982 . schmidt attempted to continue with a minority spd-only government .
but he was forced to resign by a constructive vote of no confidence on oct .
1 , 1982 - the first in german history to be successful . the fdp joined the cdu / csu and elected helmut kohl as chancellor .
german voters confirmed this new coalition in early elections in 1983 , giving the cdu / csu 48.8 percent and the fdp 7 percent of the vote .
the spd only won 38.2 percent . in 1983 the environmentalist green party made it into parliament for the first time , winning 5.6 percent of the vote . bildunterschrift : west german chancellor helmut kohl ahead of a parliamentary vote of no confidence in december 1982 1990 : a unified german vote the first federal elections following german unification in 1990 gave the parliament a new face .
although the green party did n't make the five-percent hurdle necessary to hold seats in the bundestag , special rules for this first united german election allowed the greens ' eastern german partner buendnis 90 to have eight representatives . under these rules , the reform communist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- was also represented with 17 mps , although it had only won 2.4 percent of votes . the ruling cdu / csu saw a slight loss of votes , from 44.3 percent to 43.8 percent .
but it could continue its coalition with the fdp .
in the 1994 elections , this majority was even narrower .
the cdu / csu won just 41.4 percent of the vote . the greens , however , marched back into parliament with 7.3 percent of the vote in 1994 .
this result topped even the fdp , which dipped from 11 percent to 6.9 percent . 1998 : the beginning of spd-green power the federal elections in 1998 represented a true break in postwar german history .
for the first time ever , the change in government forced all parties of the old government into the opposition . after 16 years in power , helmut kohl had to step down .
the cdu / csu lost more than six percentage points in the election and only won 35.1 percent of the vote . " we ran to win this election and we lost , " said kohl at the time .
" it is quite clear that the social democrats won this election .
there is nothing to discuss about this result . " the spd won just under 41 percent of votes , its second best result since 1949 .
by then the greens had joined forces with the eastern buendnis 90 to become one party , with which the spd quickly formed a coalition , and social democrat gerhard schroeder was elected germany 's seventh chancellor .
bildunterschrift : after being confirmed chancellor on oct .
27 , 1998 , schroeder thanks his party colleagues , oskar lafontaine and rudolf scharping 2002 : the beginning of the end ? four years later , the comfortable spd / green majority considerably dipped , winning only a slight majority over cdu / csu and fdp in the 2002 elections .
the still positive outcome was partially attributed to the schroeder government 's successful crisis management during the 2002 flooding of the rivers elbe and oder in eastern germany . but above all , berlin 's " no " to the us-led war in iraq was a significant reason for voters to stick with schroeder . this popular backing waned , however , with the social and labor market reforms which the government introduced in spring 2003 .
the spd in particular was held responsible for the cuts in germany 's social net .
the party lost a number of state elections , including its stronghold north rhine-westphalia .
in may 2005 , the last spd-green coalition government on a state level was voted out .
on the same day chancellor schroeder called for snap elections . 2005 : the first female chancellor the election in 2005 failed to produce a clear winner .
with the spd polling 34.2 and the cdu / csu bringing home 35.2 percent , neither party had a big enough mandate to create a coalition with their preferred partners .
after a three-week battle between gerhard schroeder and christian democrat party chief angela merkel for political supremacy , their two parties agreed to form a " grand coalition " together .
merkel came out on top as the first woman to become german chancellor .
she started off on a wave of popularity that continued to grow as she launched a tour of diplomacy to germany 's traditional allies , france , britain and the united states , and brokered a european union budget deal all within months of taking over the chancellery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinmeier have ruled together but would rather not afghanistan loomed large throughout the government 's tenure , with the partners steadfast in their insistence that german soldiers remain part of the nato-led mission to stabilize the country .
the grand coalition government was also marked by the global financial crisis .
in late 2008 taxpayers shelled out 100 billion euros for the bailout of a single bank , hypo real estate , as they saw their country lurch into recession . the government has hardly been challenged by the small opposition parties in the bundestag .
rather , the grand coalition has been its own worst enemy , and opinion polls rule out a continuation .
instead , angela merkel is likely to win another term as chancellor at the helm of a cdu / csu coalition with the free-market liberal fdp .
the social democrats and their candidate for chancellor , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , will probably end up back in the role of opposition for the first time in over a decade .

today , the country can look back on a checkered history of bundestag elections since the german federal republic was founded in 1949 . west german citizens went to the polls in august 1949 .
it was the first time since the end of the weimar republic in 1933 that men and women could vote in a democratic election for a new parliament . the turnout was one many other countries could only dream of .
nearly 80 percent of eligible voters headed to the ballot boxes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad adenauer takes his oath of office on sept .
20 , 1949 from president erich koehler the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , got the best results , with 31 percent of the votes .
cdu chairman konrad adenauer was elected the nation 's first chancellor , based on a coalition of cdu / csu , free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the very conservative german party -lrb- dp -rrb- . the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who won 29.2 percent of the vote , began a 17-year period in the opposition . 1957 : " no experiments " adenauer 's policies were focused on consolidating germany 's market economy and integrating the country into the western camp .
a significant step toward this aim was germany 's entry into nato in 1955 . voters in the 1957 election confirmed the government , which had run on the slogan " no experiments . "
the cdu / csu won 50.2 percent of the votes .
it was the only time in german postwar history that a party could gain the absolute majority in parliament in federal elections . but 1957 also marked the beginning of the spd 's rise in support , which continued to 1972 . 1965 : the grand coalition the coalition partners cdu / csu and fdp won a significant victory in the 1965 federal elections .
but one year later , the partners could n't reach agreement on how to fill the impending budget gap .
the fdp resisted the union 's aimed tax increases and the coalition collapsed . this marked the beginning of a three-year grand coalition of cdu / csu and spd .
kurt-georg kiesinger -lrb- cdu -rrb- was elected chancellor .
spd chairman and former mayor of berlin willy brandt became his deputy and foreign minister . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : willy brandt 's push for relations with east germany led to his fall the 1969 elections forced the cdu / csu to retreat to the opposition for the first time in postwar german history .
the spd formed a coalition with the fdp and brandt became chancellor . 1972 : confirmation for brandt chancellor brandt emphasized domestic reforms but more importantly , he wanted to improve relations with eastern bloc countries and the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- . this controversial ostpolitik led to fierce domestic wrangling and almost to brandt 's fall in 1972 .
several mps from spd and fdp left their parties .
the cdu / csu felt its time had come and demanded a vote on a motion of no confidence . the attempt failed by an extremely narrow margin .
but the government no longer had the necessary majority in parliament .
the bundestag was dissolved and new elections were called in the fall of 1972 .
these gave the spd 45.8 percent of the vote , its best result on a federal level ever .
the spd / fdp coalition remained in power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut schmidt won a vote of no confidence in feb .
1982 but was later defeated by kohl brandt was forced to resign in 1974 following an espionage scandal .
he was replaced by his finance minister helmut schmidt , also a social democrat . 1983 : kohl comes to power although the cdu / csu faction was the strongest in parliament , the spd continued ruling with schmidt through a coalition with the fdp .
but following elections in 1980 , growing disputes with the fdp in tackling economic issues led several fdp ministers to leave schmidt 's cabinet in 1982 . schmidt attempted to continue with a minority spd-only government .
but he was forced to resign by a constructive vote of no confidence on oct .
1 , 1982 - the first in german history to be successful . the fdp joined the cdu / csu and elected helmut kohl as chancellor .
german voters confirmed this new coalition in early elections in 1983 , giving the cdu / csu 48.8 percent and the fdp 7 percent of the vote .
the spd only won 38.2 percent . in 1983 the environmentalist green party made it into parliament for the first time , winning 5.6 percent of the vote . bildunterschrift : west german chancellor helmut kohl ahead of a parliamentary vote of no confidence in december 1982 1990 : a unified german vote the first federal elections following german unification in 1990 gave the parliament a new face .

today , the country can look back on a checkered history of bundestag elections since the german federal republic was founded in 1949 . west german citizens went to the polls in august 1949 .
it was the first time since the end of the weimar republic in 1933 that men and women could vote in a democratic election for a new parliament . the turnout was one many other countries could only dream of .
nearly 80 percent of eligible voters headed to the ballot boxes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad adenauer takes his oath of office on sept .
20 , 1949 from president erich koehler the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , got the best results , with 31 percent of the votes .
cdu chairman konrad adenauer was elected the nation 's first chancellor , based on a coalition of cdu / csu , free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the very conservative german party -lrb- dp -rrb- . the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who won 29.2 percent of the vote , began a 17-year period in the opposition . 1957 : " no experiments " adenauer 's policies were focused on consolidating germany 's market economy and integrating the country into the western camp .
a significant step toward this aim was germany 's entry into nato in 1955 . voters in the 1957 election confirmed the government , which had run on the slogan " no experiments . "
the cdu / csu won 50.2 percent of the votes .
it was the only time in german postwar history that a party could gain the absolute majority in parliament in federal elections . but 1957 also marked the beginning of the spd 's rise in support , which continued to 1972 . 1965 : the grand coalition the coalition partners cdu / csu and fdp won a significant victory in the 1965 federal elections .
but one year later , the partners could n't reach agreement on how to fill the impending budget gap .
the fdp resisted the union 's aimed tax increases and the coalition collapsed . this marked the beginning of a three-year grand coalition of cdu / csu and spd .
kurt-georg kiesinger -lrb- cdu -rrb- was elected chancellor .
spd chairman and former mayor of berlin willy brandt became his deputy and foreign minister . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : willy brandt 's push for relations with east germany led to his fall the 1969 elections forced the cdu / csu to retreat to the opposition for the first time in postwar german history .
the spd formed a coalition with the fdp and brandt became chancellor . 1972 : confirmation for brandt chancellor brandt emphasized domestic reforms but more importantly , he wanted to improve relations with eastern bloc countries and the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- . this controversial ostpolitik led to fierce domestic wrangling and almost to brandt 's fall in 1972 .
several mps from spd and fdp left their parties .
the cdu / csu felt its time had come and demanded a vote on a motion of no confidence . the attempt failed by an extremely narrow margin .
but the government no longer had the necessary majority in parliament .
the bundestag was dissolved and new elections were called in the fall of 1972 .
these gave the spd 45.8 percent of the vote , its best result on a federal level ever .
the spd / fdp coalition remained in power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut schmidt won a vote of no confidence in feb .
1982 but was later defeated by kohl brandt was forced to resign in 1974 following an espionage scandal .
he was replaced by his finance minister helmut schmidt , also a social democrat . 1983 : kohl comes to power although the cdu / csu faction was the strongest in parliament , the spd continued ruling with schmidt through a coalition with the fdp .
but following elections in 1980 , growing disputes with the fdp in tackling economic issues led several fdp ministers to leave schmidt 's cabinet in 1982 . schmidt attempted to continue with a minority spd-only government .
but he was forced to resign by a constructive vote of no confidence on oct .
1 , 1982 - the first in german history to be successful . the fdp joined the cdu / csu and elected helmut kohl as chancellor .
german voters confirmed this new coalition in early elections in 1983 , giving the cdu / csu 48.8 percent and the fdp 7 percent of the vote .
the spd only won 38.2 percent . in 1983 the environmentalist green party made it into parliament for the first time , winning 5.6 percent of the vote . bildunterschrift : west german chancellor helmut kohl ahead of a parliamentary vote of no confidence in december 1982 1990 : a unified german vote the first federal elections following german unification in 1990 gave the parliament a new face .
although the green party did n't make the five-percent hurdle necessary to hold seats in the bundestag , special rules for this first united german election allowed the greens ' eastern german partner buendnis 90 to have eight representatives . under these rules , the reform communist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- was also represented with 17 mps , although it had only won 2.4 percent of votes . the ruling cdu / csu saw a slight loss of votes , from 44.3 percent to 43.8 percent .
but it could continue its coalition with the fdp .
in the 1994 elections , this majority was even narrower .
the cdu / csu won just 41.4 percent of the vote . the greens , however , marched back into parliament with 7.3 percent of the vote in 1994 .
this result topped even the fdp , which dipped from 11 percent to 6.9 percent . 1998 : the beginning of spd-green power the federal elections in 1998 represented a true break in postwar german history .
for the first time ever , the change in government forced all parties of the old government into the opposition . after 16 years in power , helmut kohl had to step down .
the cdu / csu lost more than six percentage points in the election and only won 35.1 percent of the vote . " we ran to win this election and we lost , " said kohl at the time .
" it is quite clear that the social democrats won this election .
there is nothing to discuss about this result . " the spd won just under 41 percent of votes , its second best result since 1949 .
by then the greens had joined forces with the eastern buendnis 90 to become one party , with which the spd quickly formed a coalition , and social democrat gerhard schroeder was elected germany 's seventh chancellor .
bildunterschrift : after being confirmed chancellor on oct .
27 , 1998 , schroeder thanks his party colleagues , oskar lafontaine and rudolf scharping 2002 : the beginning of the end ? four years later , the comfortable spd / green majority considerably dipped , winning only a slight majority over cdu / csu and fdp in the 2002 elections .
the still positive outcome was partially attributed to the schroeder government 's successful crisis management during the 2002 flooding of the rivers elbe and oder in eastern germany . but above all , berlin 's " no " to the us-led war in iraq was a significant reason for voters to stick with schroeder . this popular backing waned , however , with the social and labor market reforms which the government introduced in spring 2003 .
the spd in particular was held responsible for the cuts in germany 's social net .
the party lost a number of state elections , including its stronghold north rhine-westphalia .
in may 2005 , the last spd-green coalition government on a state level was voted out .
on the same day chancellor schroeder called for snap elections . 2005 : the first female chancellor the election in 2005 failed to produce a clear winner .
with the spd polling 34.2 and the cdu / csu bringing home 35.2 percent , neither party had a big enough mandate to create a coalition with their preferred partners .
after a three-week battle between gerhard schroeder and christian democrat party chief angela merkel for political supremacy , their two parties agreed to form a " grand coalition " together .
merkel came out on top as the first woman to become german chancellor .
she started off on a wave of popularity that continued to grow as she launched a tour of diplomacy to germany 's traditional allies , france , britain and the united states , and brokered a european union budget deal all within months of taking over the chancellery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinmeier have ruled together but would rather not afghanistan loomed large throughout the government 's tenure , with the partners steadfast in their insistence that german soldiers remain part of the nato-led mission to stabilize the country .
the grand coalition government was also marked by the global financial crisis .
in late 2008 taxpayers shelled out 100 billion euros for the bailout of a single bank , hypo real estate , as they saw their country lurch into recession . the government has hardly been challenged by the small opposition parties in the bundestag .
rather , the grand coalition has been its own worst enemy , and opinion polls rule out a continuation .
instead , angela merkel is likely to win another term as chancellor at the helm of a cdu / csu coalition with the free-market liberal fdp .
the social democrats and their candidate for chancellor , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , will probably end up back in the role of opposition for the first time in over a decade .

only one such school remains .
could germany learn from it ? at the 27th technology students association -lrb- tsa -rrb- annual conference in chicago , illinois , the 10th graders martin and steffen do not stick out much more than the 3,500 middle and high school students who made the journey from around the usa .
the big difference between martin , steffen and six other schoolmates is their origin - they have come from leipzig , germany to show off their scientific skills at america 's largest science fair .
and it is n't martin 's first time at the tsa .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steffen and martin from leipzig 's wilhelm-ostwald-gymnasium in chicago the school they attend , the wilhelm ostwald gymnasium -lrb- wog -rrb- in leipzig in the state of saxony , is not just any run-of-the-mill high school that any student goes to after finishing primary education .
the selection criteria are daunting , the pupils only the best .
unusual for german schools , where despite the three-tiered system with the gymnasium , or university prep school , at the top , educators place a lot of value on egalitarianism .
' seediness ' of success wog , founded in 1985 , just four years before communist east germany collapsed , may have a short tradition , but it was deeply-rooted in the gdr 's system of promoting the best .
its niche was the advancement of math and natural sciences , and still possibly would be if erich honecker or egon krenz still ruled .
brigitte heink has been at the school either as a teacher or principal since 1986 .
after the fall of the berlin wall , the east german schools was transformed to mirror the west german system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin 's car entry built with lego blocks she was convinced that the school should remain dedicated to the natural sciences and took over the helm as principal in 1992 .
education for top kids at top speed is not the norm in germany , something heink can not understand .
" highlighting particularly good achievements by students , other than in sports , seems to have a ' seedy ' reputation in germany , " said the principal .
" i can not comprehend that , since i was raised with a different attitude towards achievement . "
achievement counts once a pupil is admitted , there is nothing normal about it .
on the school 's web site , a list of the winners and participants at various competitions is presented .
not only do math , chemistry and physics events turn up , but also chess and marathon .
one course in the curriculum is boomerang , not just throwing one , but learning just what makes the australian weapon fly .

fifth-graders may be thrown into deep water when they enter wog , but they almost all can swim .
but wog is the exception .
of the 14 schools for " gifted " students that existed in the gdr in 1989 , only the leipzig school retained its concentrated program of math and science .
that may have paid off in the last pisa 2003 results that test students from the world 's industrialized countries in areas such as science , math and reading competence .
saxony , in germany 's east , broke the stronghold of the southern states , finishing second only behind bavaria and far above the international pisa averages in mathematical and science competence .
thuringia and saxony-anhalt also have left their western german cousins far behind .

the home of some of history ’ s greatest scientists and mathematicians - alexander von humboldt , albert einstein , werner von braun - was wallowing in mediocrity .
the university revolt of the 1960s which swept across west germany resulted in watered-down , less-strict educational standards .
that revolt never hit the gdr .
now people wonder if something can be learned from it .
an expert for programs for bright students , elke kaiser from the bavarian state institute for school quality and educational research , says more could be done to help the gifted .
in bavaria , only four schools in three cities have elite educational programs .
if a parent ’ s extremely bright child does n't live in or near munich , nuremberg or würzburg , which in germany 's geographically largest state is quite possible , then the smart tike can visit only a " normal " gymnasium .
kaiser feels more must be done outside of the big cities .
a variety of factors are involved .
money is one of the ´ most important - but so is envy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in a university lecture hall in tübingen : it 's never too early to visit college " if a class of eight gifted students were split off from the rest of the school , " she explained , " some parents get upset , wondering why their child isn ’ t amongst the smartest .
and then you 'll hear complaints that too much money is being spent on just a few pupils . "
brain drain there is also fear that after investing great time and money in someone with great potential , they might go to another country to study - like the us - and then possibly stay .
it 's something 18-year-old florian kraft from wog would consider .
he says german equivalents to the tsa , like " jugend forscht " -lrb- " youth does research " -rrb- , are n't respected by universities and companies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : albert einstein , probably germany 's greatest physicist " what a high school student does at ' jugend forscht ' doesn ’ t get any recognition , " kraft said .
" if i go to an american university and say ' i won this , this and this at tsa ' the response from the university is ' hello , when would you like to check in ' ? "
and this is one reason why kraft doesn ’ t participate in " jugend forscht . "
but he 's been at tsa four times .
back in leipzig , kraft feels at home at wog .
with only 500 students - other leipzig schools have easily over 1,000 - the school is small and everyone knows just about everyone else , both students and teachers alike .
to kraft , it 's family .
that family may have just been born at the right time and in the right place .
the berlin wall fell , and the east germans were reveling in the joys of freedom .
the west germans could provide money .
but now the morose financial situation of the german government may make the creation of a wog anywhere else an unachievable goal - at least in the public school system .

now , one german state is recognizing them as a national " minority . " rhineland-palatinate is the first state in germany to recognize as a national minority the roughly 8,000 romas and sintis who live there .
in 1997 , the federal government recognized the 50,000 danish in the north and the 60,000 sorbs who reside in the southeast as national minorities .
rhineland-palatinate 's premier , kurt beck , and the head of the state 's sintis and roma association , jacques delfeld , signed the agreement on monday .
" we want to send a signal with this agreement against the discrimination and for the rights of sinti and roma in our society , " beck said after the signing .

the central committee says the procedure helps to propagate negative stereotypes .
the new agreement in rhineland-palatinate will prohibit police from mentioning the ethnic identity of sinti or roma when publishing criminal reports in the state .
the sinti and roma languages will also be promoted .
no national recognition - yet whether berlin will take up the matter and put the recognition of the two groups on the legislative agenda remains to be seen .
so far , the government describes the sinti and roma as an " ethnic group , " which allow them some special protection .
but the federal government has not yet taken the final step , saying that the sintis and romas do not meet one of the five criteria set up in the eu framework - namely that they do not have a permanent region they reside in .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : educating germany germans mull sweeping education reforms germany to introduce federal school standards bad grades for german schools report lambastes german schools germany -pipe- 26.07.2005 east german school outshines competitors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when class becomes too dull , a demanding school is needed east germany discarded the socialist rule that all of its citizens were equal when it came to select schools .
only one such school remains .
could germany learn from it ? at the 27th technology students association -lrb- tsa -rrb- annual conference in chicago , illinois , the 10th graders martin and steffen do not stick out much more than the 3,500 middle and high school students who made the journey from around the usa .
the big difference between martin , steffen and six other schoolmates is their origin - they have come from leipzig , germany to show off their scientific skills at america 's largest science fair .
and it is n't martin 's first time at the tsa .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steffen and martin from leipzig 's wilhelm-ostwald-gymnasium in chicago the school they attend , the wilhelm ostwald gymnasium -lrb- wog -rrb- in leipzig in the state of saxony , is not just any run-of-the-mill high school that any student goes to after finishing primary education .
the selection criteria are daunting , the pupils only the best .
unusual for german schools , where despite the three-tiered system with the gymnasium , or university prep school , at the top , educators place a lot of value on egalitarianism .
' seediness ' of success wog , founded in 1985 , just four years before communist east germany collapsed , may have a short tradition , but it was deeply-rooted in the gdr 's system of promoting the best .
its niche was the advancement of math and natural sciences , and still possibly would be if erich honecker or egon krenz still ruled .
brigitte heink has been at the school either as a teacher or principal since 1986 .
after the fall of the berlin wall , the east german schools was transformed to mirror the west german system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin 's car entry built with lego blocks she was convinced that the school should remain dedicated to the natural sciences and took over the helm as principal in 1992 .
education for top kids at top speed is not the norm in germany , something heink can not understand .
" highlighting particularly good achievements by students , other than in sports , seems to have a ' seedy ' reputation in germany , " said the principal .
" i can not comprehend that , since i was raised with a different attitude towards achievement . "
achievement counts once a pupil is admitted , there is nothing normal about it .
on the school 's web site , a list of the winners and participants at various competitions is presented .
not only do math , chemistry and physics events turn up , but also chess and marathon .
one course in the curriculum is boomerang , not just throwing one , but learning just what makes the australian weapon fly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pisa results have not only forced school students to pull out their hair chicago does n't seem so exotic compared to istanbul , jakarta or taiwan , all locations where the students have proved their skills over the past 12 months .
fifth-graders may be thrown into deep water when they enter wog , but they almost all can swim .
but wog is the exception .
of the 14 schools for " gifted " students that existed in the gdr in 1989 , only the leipzig school retained its concentrated program of math and science .
that may have paid off in the last pisa 2003 results that test students from the world 's industrialized countries in areas such as science , math and reading competence .
saxony , in germany 's east , broke the stronghold of the southern states , finishing second only behind bavaria and far above the international pisa averages in mathematical and science competence .
thuringia and saxony-anhalt also have left their western german cousins far behind .

if a parent ’ s extremely bright child does n't live in or near munich , nuremberg or würzburg , which in germany 's geographically largest state is quite possible , then the smart tike can visit only a " normal " gymnasium .
kaiser feels more must be done outside of the big cities .
a variety of factors are involved .
money is one of the ´ most important - but so is envy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in a university lecture hall in tübingen : it 's never too early to visit college " if a class of eight gifted students were split off from the rest of the school , " she explained , " some parents get upset , wondering why their child isn ’ t amongst the smartest .

only one such school remains .
could germany learn from it ? at the 27th technology students association -lrb- tsa -rrb- annual conference in chicago , illinois , the 10th graders martin and steffen do not stick out much more than the 3,500 middle and high school students who made the journey from around the usa .
the big difference between martin , steffen and six other schoolmates is their origin - they have come from leipzig , germany to show off their scientific skills at america 's largest science fair .
and it is n't martin 's first time at the tsa .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steffen and martin from leipzig 's wilhelm-ostwald-gymnasium in chicago the school they attend , the wilhelm ostwald gymnasium -lrb- wog -rrb- in leipzig in the state of saxony , is not just any run-of-the-mill high school that any student goes to after finishing primary education .
the selection criteria are daunting , the pupils only the best .
unusual for german schools , where despite the three-tiered system with the gymnasium , or university prep school , at the top , educators place a lot of value on egalitarianism .
' seediness ' of success wog , founded in 1985 , just four years before communist east germany collapsed , may have a short tradition , but it was deeply-rooted in the gdr 's system of promoting the best .
its niche was the advancement of math and natural sciences , and still possibly would be if erich honecker or egon krenz still ruled .
brigitte heink has been at the school either as a teacher or principal since 1986 .
after the fall of the berlin wall , the east german schools was transformed to mirror the west german system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin 's car entry built with lego blocks she was convinced that the school should remain dedicated to the natural sciences and took over the helm as principal in 1992 .
education for top kids at top speed is not the norm in germany , something heink can not understand .
" highlighting particularly good achievements by students , other than in sports , seems to have a ' seedy ' reputation in germany , " said the principal .
" i can not comprehend that , since i was raised with a different attitude towards achievement . "
achievement counts once a pupil is admitted , there is nothing normal about it .
on the school 's web site , a list of the winners and participants at various competitions is presented .
not only do math , chemistry and physics events turn up , but also chess and marathon .
one course in the curriculum is boomerang , not just throwing one , but learning just what makes the australian weapon fly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pisa results have not only forced school students to pull out their hair chicago does n't seem so exotic compared to istanbul , jakarta or taiwan , all locations where the students have proved their skills over the past 12 months .
fifth-graders may be thrown into deep water when they enter wog , but they almost all can swim .
but wog is the exception .
of the 14 schools for " gifted " students that existed in the gdr in 1989 , only the leipzig school retained its concentrated program of math and science .
that may have paid off in the last pisa 2003 results that test students from the world 's industrialized countries in areas such as science , math and reading competence .
saxony , in germany 's east , broke the stronghold of the southern states , finishing second only behind bavaria and far above the international pisa averages in mathematical and science competence .
thuringia and saxony-anhalt also have left their western german cousins far behind .
" i am certain that the traditional attitudes and demands of the school play a not so insignificant role -lrb- in the pisa results -rrb- , " heink believes .
gifted programs rare in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' jugend forscht ' -lrb- ' youth does research ' -rrb- allows german middle and high school students to show off their science and technical skills the shock of the first pisa results in 2000 still sits deep in germany .
the home of some of history ’ s greatest scientists and mathematicians - alexander von humboldt , albert einstein , werner von braun - was wallowing in mediocrity .
the university revolt of the 1960s which swept across west germany resulted in watered-down , less-strict educational standards .
that revolt never hit the gdr .
now people wonder if something can be learned from it .
an expert for programs for bright students , elke kaiser from the bavarian state institute for school quality and educational research , says more could be done to help the gifted .
in bavaria , only four schools in three cities have elite educational programs .
if a parent ’ s extremely bright child does n't live in or near munich , nuremberg or würzburg , which in germany 's geographically largest state is quite possible , then the smart tike can visit only a " normal " gymnasium .

" this is a legal necessity for turkey .
we have to make our position clear , in written form , " the eu diplomat told reuters , saying the declaration would be issued " at an appropriate time " . cyprus became a member of the european union last year despite the failure of the un-brokered peace plan to reunite the divided mediterranean island , which turkish cypriots backed but greek cypriots vetoed . turkey and greece have been at loggerheads over cyprus since the former invaded the island in 1974 in response to a coup in nicosia engineered by greece 's then-ruling military junta .
turkey still has some 35,000 troops deployed in the north of the island . cyprus issue not a condition , eu says in the eu statement , the diplomat added that the bloc had not made it a condition for opening negotiations that ankara recognizes cyprus before the talks start .
he said the eu would have to consider the form and content of any political declaration turkey might make on the subject . turkey 's proposed accession is a disputed topic in some quarters of the eu despite the decision last month by the bloc 's 25 leaders which reaffirmed their decision to begin talks with the country , with the goal of membership .
poll shows widespread opposition a european commission survey published last week indicated 52 percent of eu citizens oppose turkish accession and only 35 percent support it .
the poll suggested 80 percent of austrians , 74 percent of germans and 70 percent of french were against admitting the mainly muslim nation of 70 million citizens . however , the turkish bid for membership continues despite the opposition , domestic problems with terrorism and a faltering democracy and human rights program .
in october last year , the european commission concluded that ankara had sufficiently met the eu 's criteria on democracy , human and minority rights and the rule of law to begin membership talks , despite protests from a number of european politicians to the contrary . turkey slowly ticking off eu conditions turkey was set a number of conditions to comply with before negotiations could begin , including several packages of legal reforms , which were introduced by ankara in april . the eu has said accession will take at least a decade and negotiations are an open-ended process whose outcome can not be guaranteed in advance . the 25-nation bloc must agree a negotiating mandate unanimously for talks to start .
the executive eu commission put forward a proposal in june , but cyprus and austria have sought amendments while france has reserved its position . erdogan to meet turkey bid supporter blair on the same day that the customs union protocol is signed , turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan will meet british prime minister tony blair , current holder of the rotating six-month eu presidency , in london .
britain has championed turkey 's bid , highlighting the strategic value of embracing a large muslim democracy and nato ally . wednesday 's blair-erdogan talks are expected to cover eu issues including cyprus and the customs protocol , as well as the fight against terrorism . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey resilient despite europe 's crisis turkey 's hopes of eu accession remain high despite the rejection of the eu constitution by france and the netherlands and a potential swing to the right in ankara 's key supporter germany .

celebrities from the world over are walking the red carpet at the bayreuth festival .
but how do mere mortals get their hands on a coveted ticket ? the new production by swiss director christoph marthaler of " tristan and isolde " opened the 94th richard wagner festival in bayreuth .
until august 28 , some 60,000 people will have the opportunity to hear works from the master performed in the festival hall he designed himself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " tristan und isolde " those who actually managed to get tickets can count themselves extremely lucky , since they 've been sold out for quite some time now .
the demand outpaced supply this year by a factor of 10 , as usual . " unfortunately , visitors have to count on a waiting time for tickets from between eight and ten years , " said peter emmerich , spokesman for the festival . black-market boom opera lovers who either ca n't or do n't want to wait that long basically have two choices : they can work their connections , if they have any , or turn to the black market .
while the connection option is a desired one , most people who want a ticket often have to try the other road . everything these days is available on the internet and festival tickets are no exception .
but most online prices range from 310 to 1,200 euros -lrb- $ 373 to $ 1,446 -rrb- .
the us ticket seller , ticket-finder.com , is honest about the price it 's asking for a ticket to tristan ii , up to $ 2,717 : " the price is arrived at taking into consideration the costs for the ticket , taxes and the great demand for a limited supply .

those prices are astronomical , especially when one considers that the most expensive ticket at the official outlets costs 192 euros .
this price is arrived at due to the fact that the state provides subsidies for the tickets and the organization committee .
the purpose of these public monies is to make the festival affordable for the average person . little action taken the organizers of the festival are aware of the black market problem , but they have hardly any legal room to take action against the high prices and rampant reselling .
random inspections of tickets at the entrance to performances are carried out sometimes to check that the buyer is the one using the ticket for entry to a performance , but buyers face no real consequences - despite rumors to the contrary . " the highest priority in bayreuth is and will remain the comfort and enjoyment of the festival by our visitors .
that means tickets are transferable , " said emmerich . festival fans who want legitimate , and affordable , tickets have a rocky road ahead of them : get an order form from the festival ticket office , fill it out and start hoping . " we take great pains to be fair in the distribution of tickets .
we take into consideration how long someone has been on the waiting list , " said emmerich .
" the longer the wait , the greater the chance there is of getting a ticket . " parting is such sweet sorrow exceptions , of course , prove the rule .
festival veterans report that there is actually a chance to get affordable tickets at the festival itself .
the secret is to go to the official tickets outlets and ask about tickets that have been handed back in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's possible to score this way , but lady luck has to be on your side , or you have to count on the misfortune and fairness of other wagner fans who might have waited years to get the precious tickets , but for some reason could n't use them , and handed them back in .

celebrities from the world over are walking the red carpet at the bayreuth festival .
but how do mere mortals get their hands on a coveted ticket ? the new production by swiss director christoph marthaler of " tristan and isolde " opened the 94th richard wagner festival in bayreuth .
until august 28 , some 60,000 people will have the opportunity to hear works from the master performed in the festival hall he designed himself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " tristan und isolde " those who actually managed to get tickets can count themselves extremely lucky , since they 've been sold out for quite some time now .
the demand outpaced supply this year by a factor of 10 , as usual . " unfortunately , visitors have to count on a waiting time for tickets from between eight and ten years , " said peter emmerich , spokesman for the festival . black-market boom opera lovers who either ca n't or do n't want to wait that long basically have two choices : they can work their connections , if they have any , or turn to the black market .
while the connection option is a desired one , most people who want a ticket often have to try the other road . everything these days is available on the internet and festival tickets are no exception .
but most online prices range from 310 to 1,200 euros -lrb- $ 373 to $ 1,446 -rrb- .
the us ticket seller , ticket-finder.com , is honest about the price it 's asking for a ticket to tristan ii , up to $ 2,717 : " the price is arrived at taking into consideration the costs for the ticket , taxes and the great demand for a limited supply .
that means the price can increase by up to 500 percent . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel , chancellor candidate of the christian democratic union , cdu , waves to spectators as she arrives for the opening of the wagner opera festival in bayreuth , southern germany , monday , july 25 , 2005 .
those prices are astronomical , especially when one considers that the most expensive ticket at the official outlets costs 192 euros .
this price is arrived at due to the fact that the state provides subsidies for the tickets and the organization committee .
the purpose of these public monies is to make the festival affordable for the average person . little action taken the organizers of the festival are aware of the black market problem , but they have hardly any legal room to take action against the high prices and rampant reselling .
random inspections of tickets at the entrance to performances are carried out sometimes to check that the buyer is the one using the ticket for entry to a performance , but buyers face no real consequences - despite rumors to the contrary . " the highest priority in bayreuth is and will remain the comfort and enjoyment of the festival by our visitors .
that means tickets are transferable , " said emmerich . festival fans who want legitimate , and affordable , tickets have a rocky road ahead of them : get an order form from the festival ticket office , fill it out and start hoping . " we take great pains to be fair in the distribution of tickets .
we take into consideration how long someone has been on the waiting list , " said emmerich .
" the longer the wait , the greater the chance there is of getting a ticket . " parting is such sweet sorrow exceptions , of course , prove the rule .
festival veterans report that there is actually a chance to get affordable tickets at the festival itself .
the secret is to go to the official tickets outlets and ask about tickets that have been handed back in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's possible to score this way , but lady luck has to be on your side , or you have to count on the misfortune and fairness of other wagner fans who might have waited years to get the precious tickets , but for some reason could n't use them , and handed them back in .
others choose the internet auction route .
" i was so happy , " wrote mercedes200869 , who auctioned two tickets on ebay .
" but my boyfriend ca n't come with me , my best friend is on vacation and another one ca n't come for sure because of her child .
i did n't want to go alone to an experience like this , which you do n't get offered that often in life .
especially not alone .
so after long consideration , i decided to part with my two tickets .

now , one german state is recognizing them as a national " minority . " rhineland-palatinate is the first state in germany to recognize as a national minority the roughly 8,000 romas and sintis who live there .
in 1997 , the federal government recognized the 50,000 danish in the north and the 60,000 sorbs who reside in the southeast as national minorities .
rhineland-palatinate 's premier , kurt beck , and the head of the state 's sintis and roma association , jacques delfeld , signed the agreement on monday .
" we want to send a signal with this agreement against the discrimination and for the rights of sinti and roma in our society , " beck said after the signing .
protection of minorities recognition of european minorities on a continent-wide basis dates back only to the eu 's framework agreement , passed in the 1990s .
germany ratified it in 1997 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roma frequently live in poverty in europe with it come certain responsibilities towards minorities .
in rhineland-palatinate , the state will promote special support for sintis and romas in kindergartens , schools and colleges .
this measure is supposed to level the playing field for the two groups in the educational system .
stereotypes perpetuated the central committee of german sintis and romas , in heidelberg , has been demanding for over a decade that an end be brought to what it believes to be discriminatory reporting against the people it represents .
this comes primarily in the form of arrest warrants and reports .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romani rose , head of the german sinti and roma organization , in front of a collection of signatures seeking recognition of the fact that they were also persecuted by the nazis police sometimes include the terms " sinti , " " roma " or even " gypsy " in their reports , which are frequently published in the media .
the central committee says the procedure helps to propagate negative stereotypes .
the new agreement in rhineland-palatinate will prohibit police from mentioning the ethnic identity of sinti or roma when publishing criminal reports in the state .
the sinti and roma languages will also be promoted .
no national recognition - yet whether berlin will take up the matter and put the recognition of the two groups on the legislative agenda remains to be seen .
so far , the government describes the sinti and roma as an " ethnic group , " which allow them some special protection .
but the federal government has not yet taken the final step , saying that the sintis and romas do not meet one of the five criteria set up in the eu framework - namely that they do not have a permanent region they reside in .
over 500,000 sintis and romas were killed by the nazis in the 1930s and 1940s .

today , the country can look back on a checkered history of bundestag elections since the german federal republic was founded in 1949 . west german citizens went to the polls in august 1949 .
it was the first time since the end of the weimar republic in 1933 that men and women could vote in a democratic election for a new parliament . the turnout was one many other countries could only dream of .
nearly 80 percent of eligible voters headed to the ballot boxes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad adenauer takes his oath of office on sept .
20 , 1949 from president erich koehler the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , got the best results , with 31 percent of the votes .
cdu chairman konrad adenauer was elected the nation 's first chancellor , based on a coalition of cdu / csu , free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the very conservative german party -lrb- dp -rrb- . the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who won 29.2 percent of the vote , began a 17-year period in the opposition . 1957 : " no experiments " adenauer 's policies were focused on consolidating germany 's market economy and integrating the country into the western camp .
a significant step toward this aim was germany 's entry into nato in 1955 . voters in the 1957 election confirmed the government , which had run on the slogan " no experiments . "
the cdu / csu won 50.2 percent of the votes .
it was the only time in german postwar history that a party could gain the absolute majority in parliament in federal elections . but 1957 also marked the beginning of the spd 's rise in support , which continued to 1972 . 1965 : the grand coalition the coalition partners cdu / csu and fdp won a significant victory in the 1965 federal elections .
but one year later , the partners could n't reach agreement on how to fill the impending budget gap .
the fdp resisted the union 's aimed tax increases and the coalition collapsed . this marked the beginning of a three-year grand coalition of cdu / csu and spd .
kurt-georg kiesinger -lrb- cdu -rrb- was elected chancellor .
spd chairman and former mayor of berlin willy brandt became his deputy and foreign minister . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : willy brandt 's push for relations with east germany led to his fall the 1969 elections forced the cdu / csu to retreat to the opposition for the first time in postwar german history .
the spd formed a coalition with the fdp and brandt became chancellor . 1972 : confirmation for brandt chancellor brandt emphasized domestic reforms but more importantly , he wanted to improve relations with eastern bloc countries and the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- . this controversial ostpolitik led to fierce domestic wrangling and almost to brandt 's fall in 1972 .
several mps from spd and fdp left their parties .
the cdu / csu felt its time had come and demanded a vote on a motion of no confidence . the attempt failed by an extremely narrow margin .
but the government no longer had the necessary majority in parliament .
the bundestag was dissolved and new elections were called in the fall of 1972 .
these gave the spd 45.8 percent of the vote , its best result on a federal level ever .
the spd / fdp coalition remained in power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut schmidt won a vote of no confidence in feb .
1982 but was later defeated by kohl brandt was forced to resign in 1974 following an espionage scandal .
he was replaced by his finance minister helmut schmidt , also a social democrat . 1983 : kohl comes to power although the cdu / csu faction was the strongest in parliament , the spd continued ruling with schmidt through a coalition with the fdp .
but following elections in 1980 , growing disputes with the fdp in tackling economic issues led several fdp ministers to leave schmidt 's cabinet in 1982 . schmidt attempted to continue with a minority spd-only government .
but he was forced to resign by a constructive vote of no confidence on oct .
1 , 1982 - the first in german history to be successful . the fdp joined the cdu / csu and elected helmut kohl as chancellor .
german voters confirmed this new coalition in early elections in 1983 , giving the cdu / csu 48.8 percent and the fdp 7 percent of the vote .
the spd only won 38.2 percent . in 1983 the environmentalist green party made it into parliament for the first time , winning 5.6 percent of the vote . bildunterschrift : west german chancellor helmut kohl ahead of a parliamentary vote of no confidence in december 1982 1990 : a unified german vote the first federal elections following german unification in 1990 gave the parliament a new face .
although the green party did n't make the five-percent hurdle necessary to hold seats in the bundestag , special rules for this first united german election allowed the greens ' eastern german partner buendnis 90 to have eight representatives . under these rules , the reform communist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- was also represented with 17 mps , although it had only won 2.4 percent of votes . the ruling cdu / csu saw a slight loss of votes , from 44.3 percent to 43.8 percent .
but it could continue its coalition with the fdp .
in the 1994 elections , this majority was even narrower .
the cdu / csu won just 41.4 percent of the vote . the greens , however , marched back into parliament with 7.3 percent of the vote in 1994 .
this result topped even the fdp , which dipped from 11 percent to 6.9 percent . 1998 : the beginning of spd-green power the federal elections in 1998 represented a true break in postwar german history .
for the first time ever , the change in government forced all parties of the old government into the opposition . after 16 years in power , helmut kohl had to step down .
the cdu / csu lost more than six percentage points in the election and only won 35.1 percent of the vote . " we ran to win this election and we lost , " said kohl at the time .
" it is quite clear that the social democrats won this election .
there is nothing to discuss about this result . " the spd won just under 41 percent of votes , its second best result since 1949 .
by then the greens had joined forces with the eastern buendnis 90 to become one party , with which the spd quickly formed a coalition , and social democrat gerhard schroeder was elected germany 's seventh chancellor .
bildunterschrift : after being confirmed chancellor on oct .
27 , 1998 , schroeder thanks his party colleagues , oskar lafontaine and rudolf scharping 2002 : the beginning of the end ? four years later , the comfortable spd / green majority considerably dipped , winning only a slight majority over cdu / csu and fdp in the 2002 elections .
the still positive outcome was partially attributed to the schroeder government 's successful crisis management during the 2002 flooding of the rivers elbe and oder in eastern germany . but above all , berlin 's " no " to the us-led war in iraq was a significant reason for voters to stick with schroeder . this popular backing waned , however , with the social and labor market reforms which the government introduced in spring 2003 .
the spd in particular was held responsible for the cuts in germany 's social net .
the party lost a number of state elections , including its stronghold north rhine-westphalia .
in may 2005 , the last spd-green coalition government on a state level was voted out .
on the same day chancellor schroeder called for snap elections . 2005 : the first female chancellor the election in 2005 failed to produce a clear winner .
with the spd polling 34.2 and the cdu / csu bringing home 35.2 percent , neither party had a big enough mandate to create a coalition with their preferred partners .
after a three-week battle between gerhard schroeder and christian democrat party chief angela merkel for political supremacy , their two parties agreed to form a " grand coalition " together .
merkel came out on top as the first woman to become german chancellor .
she started off on a wave of popularity that continued to grow as she launched a tour of diplomacy to germany 's traditional allies , france , britain and the united states , and brokered a european union budget deal all within months of taking over the chancellery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinmeier have ruled together but would rather not afghanistan loomed large throughout the government 's tenure , with the partners steadfast in their insistence that german soldiers remain part of the nato-led mission to stabilize the country .
the grand coalition government was also marked by the global financial crisis .
in late 2008 taxpayers shelled out 100 billion euros for the bailout of a single bank , hypo real estate , as they saw their country lurch into recession . the government has hardly been challenged by the small opposition parties in the bundestag .
rather , the grand coalition has been its own worst enemy , and opinion polls rule out a continuation .
instead , angela merkel is likely to win another term as chancellor at the helm of a cdu / csu coalition with the free-market liberal fdp .
the social democrats and their candidate for chancellor , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , will probably end up back in the role of opposition for the first time in over a decade .

now , one german state is recognizing them as a national " minority . " rhineland-palatinate is the first state in germany to recognize as a national minority the roughly 8,000 romas and sintis who live there .
in 1997 , the federal government recognized the 50,000 danish in the north and the 60,000 sorbs who reside in the southeast as national minorities .
rhineland-palatinate 's premier , kurt beck , and the head of the state 's sintis and roma association , jacques delfeld , signed the agreement on monday .
" we want to send a signal with this agreement against the discrimination and for the rights of sinti and roma in our society , " beck said after the signing .
protection of minorities recognition of european minorities on a continent-wide basis dates back only to the eu 's framework agreement , passed in the 1990s .
germany ratified it in 1997 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roma frequently live in poverty in europe with it come certain responsibilities towards minorities .
in rhineland-palatinate , the state will promote special support for sintis and romas in kindergartens , schools and colleges .
this measure is supposed to level the playing field for the two groups in the educational system .
stereotypes perpetuated the central committee of german sintis and romas , in heidelberg , has been demanding for over a decade that an end be brought to what it believes to be discriminatory reporting against the people it represents .
this comes primarily in the form of arrest warrants and reports .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romani rose , head of the german sinti and roma organization , in front of a collection of signatures seeking recognition of the fact that they were also persecuted by the nazis police sometimes include the terms " sinti , " " roma " or even " gypsy " in their reports , which are frequently published in the media .
the central committee says the procedure helps to propagate negative stereotypes .
the new agreement in rhineland-palatinate will prohibit police from mentioning the ethnic identity of sinti or roma when publishing criminal reports in the state .
the sinti and roma languages will also be promoted .
no national recognition - yet whether berlin will take up the matter and put the recognition of the two groups on the legislative agenda remains to be seen .
so far , the government describes the sinti and roma as an " ethnic group , " which allow them some special protection .
but the federal government has not yet taken the final step , saying that the sintis and romas do not meet one of the five criteria set up in the eu framework - namely that they do not have a permanent region they reside in .
over 500,000 sintis and romas were killed by the nazis in the 1930s and 1940s .

celebrities from the world over are walking the red carpet at the bayreuth festival .
but how do mere mortals get their hands on a coveted ticket ? the new production by swiss director christoph marthaler of " tristan and isolde " opened the 94th richard wagner festival in bayreuth .
until august 28 , some 60,000 people will have the opportunity to hear works from the master performed in the festival hall he designed himself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " tristan und isolde " those who actually managed to get tickets can count themselves extremely lucky , since they 've been sold out for quite some time now .
the demand outpaced supply this year by a factor of 10 , as usual . " unfortunately , visitors have to count on a waiting time for tickets from between eight and ten years , " said peter emmerich , spokesman for the festival . black-market boom opera lovers who either ca n't or do n't want to wait that long basically have two choices : they can work their connections , if they have any , or turn to the black market .
while the connection option is a desired one , most people who want a ticket often have to try the other road . everything these days is available on the internet and festival tickets are no exception .
but most online prices range from 310 to 1,200 euros -lrb- $ 373 to $ 1,446 -rrb- .
the us ticket seller , ticket-finder.com , is honest about the price it 's asking for a ticket to tristan ii , up to $ 2,717 : " the price is arrived at taking into consideration the costs for the ticket , taxes and the great demand for a limited supply .
that means the price can increase by up to 500 percent . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel , chancellor candidate of the christian democratic union , cdu , waves to spectators as she arrives for the opening of the wagner opera festival in bayreuth , southern germany , monday , july 25 , 2005 .
those prices are astronomical , especially when one considers that the most expensive ticket at the official outlets costs 192 euros .
this price is arrived at due to the fact that the state provides subsidies for the tickets and the organization committee .
the purpose of these public monies is to make the festival affordable for the average person . little action taken the organizers of the festival are aware of the black market problem , but they have hardly any legal room to take action against the high prices and rampant reselling .
random inspections of tickets at the entrance to performances are carried out sometimes to check that the buyer is the one using the ticket for entry to a performance , but buyers face no real consequences - despite rumors to the contrary . " the highest priority in bayreuth is and will remain the comfort and enjoyment of the festival by our visitors .
that means tickets are transferable , " said emmerich . festival fans who want legitimate , and affordable , tickets have a rocky road ahead of them : get an order form from the festival ticket office , fill it out and start hoping . " we take great pains to be fair in the distribution of tickets .
we take into consideration how long someone has been on the waiting list , " said emmerich .
" the longer the wait , the greater the chance there is of getting a ticket . " parting is such sweet sorrow exceptions , of course , prove the rule .
festival veterans report that there is actually a chance to get affordable tickets at the festival itself .
the secret is to go to the official tickets outlets and ask about tickets that have been handed back in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's possible to score this way , but lady luck has to be on your side , or you have to count on the misfortune and fairness of other wagner fans who might have waited years to get the precious tickets , but for some reason could n't use them , and handed them back in .
others choose the internet auction route .
" i was so happy , " wrote mercedes200869 , who auctioned two tickets on ebay .
" but my boyfriend ca n't come with me , my best friend is on vacation and another one ca n't come for sure because of her child .
i did n't want to go alone to an experience like this , which you do n't get offered that often in life .
especially not alone .
so after long consideration , i decided to part with my two tickets .

the islamic radical had admitted to killing filmmaker theo van gogh last november , saying he acted out of faith . the three-judge panel of the amsterdam high-security court announced the life sentence against bouyeri for the murder which the prosecution said signaled the end of innocence for the tolerant netherlands .
to show just how severe the judges believe this reading is , they have order that bouyeri be present in court as the verdict was read out - something almost unheard of in the netherlands , where suspects are not obliged to attend the reading of the verdict and it is very rare that a court orders a suspect to attend .
suspect flouts court 's authority bouyeri , a 27-year old who holds dual dutch and moroccan nationality , has made it clear he does not recognize the authority of the court .
during the trial he ordered his attorney not to present a defense .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theo van gogh was gunned down in broad daylight the slaying of van gogh , carried out in broad daylight as he cycled to work , shocked the netherlands .
it stoked ethnic tensions and sparked a wave of reprisal attacks primarily directed at the muslim community here .
the filmmaker , a distant relative of 19th century painter vincent van gogh , was also an outspoken columnist who often criticized islam and multicultural society .
together with dutch lawmaker ayaan hirsi ali , he made a short film called " submission , " linking islam to the abuse of women and causing outrage in the dutch muslim community .
after van gogh 's murder , hirsi ali went into hiding for three months because a letter threatening her and other politicians was found on the filmmaker 's body .
end of the innocence " the netherlands has lost its innocence .
our country has suddenly become a target of international terrorism , " prosecutor frits van straelen said during the trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch member of parliament ayaan hirsi ali had to go underground after van gogh 's murder bouyeri was charged with the premeditated murder of van gogh , the attempted murder of several police officers and bystanders , illegal possession of firearms , obstructing the work of hirsi ali as a member of parliament and threatening her with a terrorist act .
a life sentence carries no possibility of parole in the netherlands , but convicts can be released after receiving a royal pardon .
whether bouyeri would like a pardon from the queen is another matter .
in a dramatic final speech to the court at the end of his trial two weeks ago , he said he wanted to receive the maximum punishment and warned that he would do the same again if he were freed .
" i do not want to miss the chance to get the maximum sentence ...

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : educating germany germans mull sweeping education reforms germany to introduce federal school standards bad grades for german schools report lambastes german schools germany -pipe- 26.07.2005 east german school outshines competitors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when class becomes too dull , a demanding school is needed east germany discarded the socialist rule that all of its citizens were equal when it came to select schools .
only one such school remains .
could germany learn from it ? at the 27th technology students association -lrb- tsa -rrb- annual conference in chicago , illinois , the 10th graders martin and steffen do not stick out much more than the 3,500 middle and high school students who made the journey from around the usa .
the big difference between martin , steffen and six other schoolmates is their origin - they have come from leipzig , germany to show off their scientific skills at america 's largest science fair .
and it is n't martin 's first time at the tsa .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steffen and martin from leipzig 's wilhelm-ostwald-gymnasium in chicago the school they attend , the wilhelm ostwald gymnasium -lrb- wog -rrb- in leipzig in the state of saxony , is not just any run-of-the-mill high school that any student goes to after finishing primary education .
the selection criteria are daunting , the pupils only the best .
unusual for german schools , where despite the three-tiered system with the gymnasium , or university prep school , at the top , educators place a lot of value on egalitarianism .
' seediness ' of success wog , founded in 1985 , just four years before communist east germany collapsed , may have a short tradition , but it was deeply-rooted in the gdr 's system of promoting the best .
its niche was the advancement of math and natural sciences , and still possibly would be if erich honecker or egon krenz still ruled .
brigitte heink has been at the school either as a teacher or principal since 1986 .
after the fall of the berlin wall , the east german schools was transformed to mirror the west german system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin 's car entry built with lego blocks she was convinced that the school should remain dedicated to the natural sciences and took over the helm as principal in 1992 .
education for top kids at top speed is not the norm in germany , something heink can not understand .
" highlighting particularly good achievements by students , other than in sports , seems to have a ' seedy ' reputation in germany , " said the principal .
" i can not comprehend that , since i was raised with a different attitude towards achievement . "
achievement counts once a pupil is admitted , there is nothing normal about it .
on the school 's web site , a list of the winners and participants at various competitions is presented .
not only do math , chemistry and physics events turn up , but also chess and marathon .
one course in the curriculum is boomerang , not just throwing one , but learning just what makes the australian weapon fly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pisa results have not only forced school students to pull out their hair chicago does n't seem so exotic compared to istanbul , jakarta or taiwan , all locations where the students have proved their skills over the past 12 months .
fifth-graders may be thrown into deep water when they enter wog , but they almost all can swim .
but wog is the exception .
of the 14 schools for " gifted " students that existed in the gdr in 1989 , only the leipzig school retained its concentrated program of math and science .
that may have paid off in the last pisa 2003 results that test students from the world 's industrialized countries in areas such as science , math and reading competence .
saxony , in germany 's east , broke the stronghold of the southern states , finishing second only behind bavaria and far above the international pisa averages in mathematical and science competence .
thuringia and saxony-anhalt also have left their western german cousins far behind .
" i am certain that the traditional attitudes and demands of the school play a not so insignificant role -lrb- in the pisa results -rrb- , " heink believes .
gifted programs rare in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' jugend forscht ' -lrb- ' youth does research ' -rrb- allows german middle and high school students to show off their science and technical skills the shock of the first pisa results in 2000 still sits deep in germany .
the home of some of history ’ s greatest scientists and mathematicians - alexander von humboldt , albert einstein , werner von braun - was wallowing in mediocrity .
the university revolt of the 1960s which swept across west germany resulted in watered-down , less-strict educational standards .
that revolt never hit the gdr .
now people wonder if something can be learned from it .
an expert for programs for bright students , elke kaiser from the bavarian state institute for school quality and educational research , says more could be done to help the gifted .
in bavaria , only four schools in three cities have elite educational programs .
if a parent ’ s extremely bright child does n't live in or near munich , nuremberg or würzburg , which in germany 's geographically largest state is quite possible , then the smart tike can visit only a " normal " gymnasium .
kaiser feels more must be done outside of the big cities .
a variety of factors are involved .
money is one of the ´ most important - but so is envy .

the fees for day care centers will be gradually phased out .
the three-year parental -lrb- not exclusively intended for the mother -rrb- leave will remain untouched - and will include a job guarantee after and the possibility of part-time work .
the spd has declared that it wants to increase the number of working women to more than 60 percent in keeping with european directives . cdu / csu the union 's party platform talks of a targeted promotion of highly-gifted and talented children and teenagers , but it does n't outline any concrete plans about how it intends to do that .

british police 's shoot-to-kill policy led on friday to the death of an innocent brazilian .
scotland yard expressed regret but justified the policy .
german laws are much more nebulous . the police officer who killed 27-year-old jean charles de menezes received full support from scotland yard .
metropolitan police commissioner ian blair called the shooting tragic , but the national shoot-to-kill policy necessary . when the issue of a shoot-to-kill policy comes up in germany , most police officers find themselves in legal limbo .
until terrorism became a viable , ubiquitous threat , it had only arisen in cases of hostage takings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a member of the arab commando group which seized members of the israeli olympic team at their quarters at the munich olympic village september 5 , 1972 appears with a hood over his face on the balcony of the village building where the commandos held several members of the israeli team hostage bavaria became the first german state to allow the practice , which it authorized the year after terrorists killed 11 israeli athletes at the 1972 olympic games in munich .
currently 12 of germany 's 16 states permit police officers to kill suspects in order to save the lives of innocent people but only as a last resort . responsibility rests alone on the officer but lawmakers in some states have been wary about creating legislation that puts a top-ranking police commissioner in position to hand down a potential death sentence . as a result , several states , including berlin , allow police officers themselves to decide which action to take ; their superiors may not order them to kill a suspected terrorist or hostage-taker . the policy is not without its critics .

today , the country can look back on a checkered history of bundestag elections since the german federal republic was founded in 1949 . west german citizens went to the polls in august 1949 .
it was the first time since the end of the weimar republic in 1933 that men and women could vote in a democratic election for a new parliament . the turnout was one many other countries could only dream of .
nearly 80 percent of eligible voters headed to the ballot boxes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad adenauer takes his oath of office on sept .
20 , 1949 from president erich koehler the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , got the best results , with 31 percent of the votes .
cdu chairman konrad adenauer was elected the nation 's first chancellor , based on a coalition of cdu / csu , free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the very conservative german party -lrb- dp -rrb- . the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who won 29.2 percent of the vote , began a 17-year period in the opposition . 1957 : " no experiments " adenauer 's policies were focused on consolidating germany 's market economy and integrating the country into the western camp .
a significant step toward this aim was germany 's entry into nato in 1955 . voters in the 1957 election confirmed the government , which had run on the slogan " no experiments . "
the cdu / csu won 50.2 percent of the votes .
it was the only time in german postwar history that a party could gain the absolute majority in parliament in federal elections . but 1957 also marked the beginning of the spd 's rise in support , which continued to 1972 . 1965 : the grand coalition the coalition partners cdu / csu and fdp won a significant victory in the 1965 federal elections .
but one year later , the partners could n't reach agreement on how to fill the impending budget gap .
the fdp resisted the union 's aimed tax increases and the coalition collapsed . this marked the beginning of a three-year grand coalition of cdu / csu and spd .
kurt-georg kiesinger -lrb- cdu -rrb- was elected chancellor .
spd chairman and former mayor of berlin willy brandt became his deputy and foreign minister . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : willy brandt 's push for relations with east germany led to his fall the 1969 elections forced the cdu / csu to retreat to the opposition for the first time in postwar german history .
the spd formed a coalition with the fdp and brandt became chancellor . 1972 : confirmation for brandt chancellor brandt emphasized domestic reforms but more importantly , he wanted to improve relations with eastern bloc countries and the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- . this controversial ostpolitik led to fierce domestic wrangling and almost to brandt 's fall in 1972 .
several mps from spd and fdp left their parties .
the cdu / csu felt its time had come and demanded a vote on a motion of no confidence . the attempt failed by an extremely narrow margin .
but the government no longer had the necessary majority in parliament .
the bundestag was dissolved and new elections were called in the fall of 1972 .
these gave the spd 45.8 percent of the vote , its best result on a federal level ever .
the spd / fdp coalition remained in power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut schmidt won a vote of no confidence in feb .
1982 but was later defeated by kohl brandt was forced to resign in 1974 following an espionage scandal .
he was replaced by his finance minister helmut schmidt , also a social democrat . 1983 : kohl comes to power although the cdu / csu faction was the strongest in parliament , the spd continued ruling with schmidt through a coalition with the fdp .
but following elections in 1980 , growing disputes with the fdp in tackling economic issues led several fdp ministers to leave schmidt 's cabinet in 1982 . schmidt attempted to continue with a minority spd-only government .
but he was forced to resign by a constructive vote of no confidence on oct .
1 , 1982 - the first in german history to be successful . the fdp joined the cdu / csu and elected helmut kohl as chancellor .
german voters confirmed this new coalition in early elections in 1983 , giving the cdu / csu 48.8 percent and the fdp 7 percent of the vote .
the spd only won 38.2 percent . in 1983 the environmentalist green party made it into parliament for the first time , winning 5.6 percent of the vote . bildunterschrift : west german chancellor helmut kohl ahead of a parliamentary vote of no confidence in december 1982 1990 : a unified german vote the first federal elections following german unification in 1990 gave the parliament a new face .
although the green party did n't make the five-percent hurdle necessary to hold seats in the bundestag , special rules for this first united german election allowed the greens ' eastern german partner buendnis 90 to have eight representatives . under these rules , the reform communist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- was also represented with 17 mps , although it had only won 2.4 percent of votes . the ruling cdu / csu saw a slight loss of votes , from 44.3 percent to 43.8 percent .
but it could continue its coalition with the fdp .
in the 1994 elections , this majority was even narrower .
the cdu / csu won just 41.4 percent of the vote . the greens , however , marched back into parliament with 7.3 percent of the vote in 1994 .
this result topped even the fdp , which dipped from 11 percent to 6.9 percent . 1998 : the beginning of spd-green power the federal elections in 1998 represented a true break in postwar german history .
for the first time ever , the change in government forced all parties of the old government into the opposition . after 16 years in power , helmut kohl had to step down .
the cdu / csu lost more than six percentage points in the election and only won 35.1 percent of the vote . " we ran to win this election and we lost , " said kohl at the time .
" it is quite clear that the social democrats won this election .
there is nothing to discuss about this result . " the spd won just under 41 percent of votes , its second best result since 1949 .
by then the greens had joined forces with the eastern buendnis 90 to become one party , with which the spd quickly formed a coalition , and social democrat gerhard schroeder was elected germany 's seventh chancellor .
bildunterschrift : after being confirmed chancellor on oct .
27 , 1998 , schroeder thanks his party colleagues , oskar lafontaine and rudolf scharping 2002 : the beginning of the end ? four years later , the comfortable spd / green majority considerably dipped , winning only a slight majority over cdu / csu and fdp in the 2002 elections .
the still positive outcome was partially attributed to the schroeder government 's successful crisis management during the 2002 flooding of the rivers elbe and oder in eastern germany . but above all , berlin 's " no " to the us-led war in iraq was a significant reason for voters to stick with schroeder . this popular backing waned , however , with the social and labor market reforms which the government introduced in spring 2003 .
the spd in particular was held responsible for the cuts in germany 's social net .
the party lost a number of state elections , including its stronghold north rhine-westphalia .
in may 2005 , the last spd-green coalition government on a state level was voted out .
on the same day chancellor schroeder called for snap elections . 2005 : the first female chancellor the election in 2005 failed to produce a clear winner .
with the spd polling 34.2 and the cdu / csu bringing home 35.2 percent , neither party had a big enough mandate to create a coalition with their preferred partners .
after a three-week battle between gerhard schroeder and christian democrat party chief angela merkel for political supremacy , their two parties agreed to form a " grand coalition " together .
merkel came out on top as the first woman to become german chancellor .
she started off on a wave of popularity that continued to grow as she launched a tour of diplomacy to germany 's traditional allies , france , britain and the united states , and brokered a european union budget deal all within months of taking over the chancellery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinmeier have ruled together but would rather not afghanistan loomed large throughout the government 's tenure , with the partners steadfast in their insistence that german soldiers remain part of the nato-led mission to stabilize the country .
the grand coalition government was also marked by the global financial crisis .
in late 2008 taxpayers shelled out 100 billion euros for the bailout of a single bank , hypo real estate , as they saw their country lurch into recession . the government has hardly been challenged by the small opposition parties in the bundestag .
rather , the grand coalition has been its own worst enemy , and opinion polls rule out a continuation .
instead , angela merkel is likely to win another term as chancellor at the helm of a cdu / csu coalition with the free-market liberal fdp .
the social democrats and their candidate for chancellor , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , will probably end up back in the role of opposition for the first time in over a decade .

" this is a legal necessity for turkey .
we have to make our position clear , in written form , " the eu diplomat told reuters , saying the declaration would be issued " at an appropriate time " . cyprus became a member of the european union last year despite the failure of the un-brokered peace plan to reunite the divided mediterranean island , which turkish cypriots backed but greek cypriots vetoed . turkey and greece have been at loggerheads over cyprus since the former invaded the island in 1974 in response to a coup in nicosia engineered by greece 's then-ruling military junta .
turkey still has some 35,000 troops deployed in the north of the island . cyprus issue not a condition , eu says in the eu statement , the diplomat added that the bloc had not made it a condition for opening negotiations that ankara recognizes cyprus before the talks start .
he said the eu would have to consider the form and content of any political declaration turkey might make on the subject . turkey 's proposed accession is a disputed topic in some quarters of the eu despite the decision last month by the bloc 's 25 leaders which reaffirmed their decision to begin talks with the country , with the goal of membership .
poll shows widespread opposition a european commission survey published last week indicated 52 percent of eu citizens oppose turkish accession and only 35 percent support it .
the poll suggested 80 percent of austrians , 74 percent of germans and 70 percent of french were against admitting the mainly muslim nation of 70 million citizens . however , the turkish bid for membership continues despite the opposition , domestic problems with terrorism and a faltering democracy and human rights program .
in october last year , the european commission concluded that ankara had sufficiently met the eu 's criteria on democracy , human and minority rights and the rule of law to begin membership talks , despite protests from a number of european politicians to the contrary . turkey slowly ticking off eu conditions turkey was set a number of conditions to comply with before negotiations could begin , including several packages of legal reforms , which were introduced by ankara in april . the eu has said accession will take at least a decade and negotiations are an open-ended process whose outcome can not be guaranteed in advance . the 25-nation bloc must agree a negotiating mandate unanimously for talks to start .
the executive eu commission put forward a proposal in june , but cyprus and austria have sought amendments while france has reserved its position . erdogan to meet turkey bid supporter blair on the same day that the customs union protocol is signed , turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan will meet british prime minister tony blair , current holder of the rotating six-month eu presidency , in london .
britain has championed turkey 's bid , highlighting the strategic value of embracing a large muslim democracy and nato ally . wednesday 's blair-erdogan talks are expected to cover eu issues including cyprus and the customs protocol , as well as the fight against terrorism . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey resilient despite europe 's crisis turkey 's hopes of eu accession remain high despite the rejection of the eu constitution by france and the netherlands and a potential swing to the right in ankara 's key supporter germany .

celebrities from the world over are walking the red carpet at the bayreuth festival .
but how do mere mortals get their hands on a coveted ticket ? the new production by swiss director christoph marthaler of " tristan and isolde " opened the 94th richard wagner festival in bayreuth .
until august 28 , some 60,000 people will have the opportunity to hear works from the master performed in the festival hall he designed himself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " tristan und isolde " those who actually managed to get tickets can count themselves extremely lucky , since they 've been sold out for quite some time now .
the demand outpaced supply this year by a factor of 10 , as usual . " unfortunately , visitors have to count on a waiting time for tickets from between eight and ten years , " said peter emmerich , spokesman for the festival . black-market boom opera lovers who either ca n't or do n't want to wait that long basically have two choices : they can work their connections , if they have any , or turn to the black market .
while the connection option is a desired one , most people who want a ticket often have to try the other road . everything these days is available on the internet and festival tickets are no exception .
but most online prices range from 310 to 1,200 euros -lrb- $ 373 to $ 1,446 -rrb- .
the us ticket seller , ticket-finder.com , is honest about the price it 's asking for a ticket to tristan ii , up to $ 2,717 : " the price is arrived at taking into consideration the costs for the ticket , taxes and the great demand for a limited supply .
that means the price can increase by up to 500 percent . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel , chancellor candidate of the christian democratic union , cdu , waves to spectators as she arrives for the opening of the wagner opera festival in bayreuth , southern germany , monday , july 25 , 2005 .
those prices are astronomical , especially when one considers that the most expensive ticket at the official outlets costs 192 euros .
this price is arrived at due to the fact that the state provides subsidies for the tickets and the organization committee .
the purpose of these public monies is to make the festival affordable for the average person . little action taken the organizers of the festival are aware of the black market problem , but they have hardly any legal room to take action against the high prices and rampant reselling .
random inspections of tickets at the entrance to performances are carried out sometimes to check that the buyer is the one using the ticket for entry to a performance , but buyers face no real consequences - despite rumors to the contrary . " the highest priority in bayreuth is and will remain the comfort and enjoyment of the festival by our visitors .
that means tickets are transferable , " said emmerich . festival fans who want legitimate , and affordable , tickets have a rocky road ahead of them : get an order form from the festival ticket office , fill it out and start hoping . " we take great pains to be fair in the distribution of tickets .
we take into consideration how long someone has been on the waiting list , " said emmerich .
" the longer the wait , the greater the chance there is of getting a ticket . " parting is such sweet sorrow exceptions , of course , prove the rule .
festival veterans report that there is actually a chance to get affordable tickets at the festival itself .
the secret is to go to the official tickets outlets and ask about tickets that have been handed back in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's possible to score this way , but lady luck has to be on your side , or you have to count on the misfortune and fairness of other wagner fans who might have waited years to get the precious tickets , but for some reason could n't use them , and handed them back in .
others choose the internet auction route .
" i was so happy , " wrote mercedes200869 , who auctioned two tickets on ebay .
" but my boyfriend ca n't come with me , my best friend is on vacation and another one ca n't come for sure because of her child .
i did n't want to go alone to an experience like this , which you do n't get offered that often in life .
especially not alone .
so after long consideration , i decided to part with my two tickets .

today , the country can look back on a checkered history of bundestag elections since the german federal republic was founded in 1949 . west german citizens went to the polls in august 1949 .
it was the first time since the end of the weimar republic in 1933 that men and women could vote in a democratic election for a new parliament . the turnout was one many other countries could only dream of .
nearly 80 percent of eligible voters headed to the ballot boxes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad adenauer takes his oath of office on sept .
20 , 1949 from president erich koehler the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , got the best results , with 31 percent of the votes .
cdu chairman konrad adenauer was elected the nation 's first chancellor , based on a coalition of cdu / csu , free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the very conservative german party -lrb- dp -rrb- . the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who won 29.2 percent of the vote , began a 17-year period in the opposition . 1957 : " no experiments " adenauer 's policies were focused on consolidating germany 's market economy and integrating the country into the western camp .
a significant step toward this aim was germany 's entry into nato in 1955 . voters in the 1957 election confirmed the government , which had run on the slogan " no experiments . "
the cdu / csu won 50.2 percent of the votes .
it was the only time in german postwar history that a party could gain the absolute majority in parliament in federal elections . but 1957 also marked the beginning of the spd 's rise in support , which continued to 1972 . 1965 : the grand coalition the coalition partners cdu / csu and fdp won a significant victory in the 1965 federal elections .
but one year later , the partners could n't reach agreement on how to fill the impending budget gap .
the fdp resisted the union 's aimed tax increases and the coalition collapsed . this marked the beginning of a three-year grand coalition of cdu / csu and spd .
kurt-georg kiesinger -lrb- cdu -rrb- was elected chancellor .
spd chairman and former mayor of berlin willy brandt became his deputy and foreign minister . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : willy brandt 's push for relations with east germany led to his fall the 1969 elections forced the cdu / csu to retreat to the opposition for the first time in postwar german history .
the spd formed a coalition with the fdp and brandt became chancellor . 1972 : confirmation for brandt chancellor brandt emphasized domestic reforms but more importantly , he wanted to improve relations with eastern bloc countries and the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- . this controversial ostpolitik led to fierce domestic wrangling and almost to brandt 's fall in 1972 .
several mps from spd and fdp left their parties .
the cdu / csu felt its time had come and demanded a vote on a motion of no confidence . the attempt failed by an extremely narrow margin .
but the government no longer had the necessary majority in parliament .
the bundestag was dissolved and new elections were called in the fall of 1972 .
these gave the spd 45.8 percent of the vote , its best result on a federal level ever .
the spd / fdp coalition remained in power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut schmidt won a vote of no confidence in feb .
1982 but was later defeated by kohl brandt was forced to resign in 1974 following an espionage scandal .
he was replaced by his finance minister helmut schmidt , also a social democrat . 1983 : kohl comes to power although the cdu / csu faction was the strongest in parliament , the spd continued ruling with schmidt through a coalition with the fdp .
but following elections in 1980 , growing disputes with the fdp in tackling economic issues led several fdp ministers to leave schmidt 's cabinet in 1982 . schmidt attempted to continue with a minority spd-only government .
but he was forced to resign by a constructive vote of no confidence on oct .
1 , 1982 - the first in german history to be successful . the fdp joined the cdu / csu and elected helmut kohl as chancellor .
german voters confirmed this new coalition in early elections in 1983 , giving the cdu / csu 48.8 percent and the fdp 7 percent of the vote .
the spd only won 38.2 percent . in 1983 the environmentalist green party made it into parliament for the first time , winning 5.6 percent of the vote . bildunterschrift : west german chancellor helmut kohl ahead of a parliamentary vote of no confidence in december 1982 1990 : a unified german vote the first federal elections following german unification in 1990 gave the parliament a new face .
although the green party did n't make the five-percent hurdle necessary to hold seats in the bundestag , special rules for this first united german election allowed the greens ' eastern german partner buendnis 90 to have eight representatives . under these rules , the reform communist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- was also represented with 17 mps , although it had only won 2.4 percent of votes . the ruling cdu / csu saw a slight loss of votes , from 44.3 percent to 43.8 percent .
but it could continue its coalition with the fdp .
in the 1994 elections , this majority was even narrower .
the cdu / csu won just 41.4 percent of the vote . the greens , however , marched back into parliament with 7.3 percent of the vote in 1994 .
this result topped even the fdp , which dipped from 11 percent to 6.9 percent . 1998 : the beginning of spd-green power the federal elections in 1998 represented a true break in postwar german history .
for the first time ever , the change in government forced all parties of the old government into the opposition . after 16 years in power , helmut kohl had to step down .
the cdu / csu lost more than six percentage points in the election and only won 35.1 percent of the vote . " we ran to win this election and we lost , " said kohl at the time .
" it is quite clear that the social democrats won this election .
there is nothing to discuss about this result . " the spd won just under 41 percent of votes , its second best result since 1949 .
by then the greens had joined forces with the eastern buendnis 90 to become one party , with which the spd quickly formed a coalition , and social democrat gerhard schroeder was elected germany 's seventh chancellor .
bildunterschrift : after being confirmed chancellor on oct .
27 , 1998 , schroeder thanks his party colleagues , oskar lafontaine and rudolf scharping 2002 : the beginning of the end ? four years later , the comfortable spd / green majority considerably dipped , winning only a slight majority over cdu / csu and fdp in the 2002 elections .
the still positive outcome was partially attributed to the schroeder government 's successful crisis management during the 2002 flooding of the rivers elbe and oder in eastern germany . but above all , berlin 's " no " to the us-led war in iraq was a significant reason for voters to stick with schroeder . this popular backing waned , however , with the social and labor market reforms which the government introduced in spring 2003 .
the spd in particular was held responsible for the cuts in germany 's social net .
the party lost a number of state elections , including its stronghold north rhine-westphalia .
in may 2005 , the last spd-green coalition government on a state level was voted out .
on the same day chancellor schroeder called for snap elections . 2005 : the first female chancellor the election in 2005 failed to produce a clear winner .
with the spd polling 34.2 and the cdu / csu bringing home 35.2 percent , neither party had a big enough mandate to create a coalition with their preferred partners .
after a three-week battle between gerhard schroeder and christian democrat party chief angela merkel for political supremacy , their two parties agreed to form a " grand coalition " together .
merkel came out on top as the first woman to become german chancellor .
she started off on a wave of popularity that continued to grow as she launched a tour of diplomacy to germany 's traditional allies , france , britain and the united states , and brokered a european union budget deal all within months of taking over the chancellery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinmeier have ruled together but would rather not afghanistan loomed large throughout the government 's tenure , with the partners steadfast in their insistence that german soldiers remain part of the nato-led mission to stabilize the country .
the grand coalition government was also marked by the global financial crisis .
in late 2008 taxpayers shelled out 100 billion euros for the bailout of a single bank , hypo real estate , as they saw their country lurch into recession . the government has hardly been challenged by the small opposition parties in the bundestag .
rather , the grand coalition has been its own worst enemy , and opinion polls rule out a continuation .
instead , angela merkel is likely to win another term as chancellor at the helm of a cdu / csu coalition with the free-market liberal fdp .
the social democrats and their candidate for chancellor , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , will probably end up back in the role of opposition for the first time in over a decade .

1 , 1982 - the first in german history to be successful . the fdp joined the cdu / csu and elected helmut kohl as chancellor .
german voters confirmed this new coalition in early elections in 1983 , giving the cdu / csu 48.8 percent and the fdp 7 percent of the vote .
the spd only won 38.2 percent . in 1983 the environmentalist green party made it into parliament for the first time , winning 5.6 percent of the vote . bildunterschrift : west german chancellor helmut kohl ahead of a parliamentary vote of no confidence in december 1982 1990 : a unified german vote the first federal elections following german unification in 1990 gave the parliament a new face .
although the green party did n't make the five-percent hurdle necessary to hold seats in the bundestag , special rules for this first united german election allowed the greens ' eastern german partner buendnis 90 to have eight representatives . under these rules , the reform communist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- was also represented with 17 mps , although it had only won 2.4 percent of votes . the ruling cdu / csu saw a slight loss of votes , from 44.3 percent to 43.8 percent .
but it could continue its coalition with the fdp .
in the 1994 elections , this majority was even narrower .
the cdu / csu won just 41.4 percent of the vote . the greens , however , marched back into parliament with 7.3 percent of the vote in 1994 .
this result topped even the fdp , which dipped from 11 percent to 6.9 percent . 1998 : the beginning of spd-green power the federal elections in 1998 represented a true break in postwar german history .
for the first time ever , the change in government forced all parties of the old government into the opposition . after 16 years in power , helmut kohl had to step down .
the cdu / csu lost more than six percentage points in the election and only won 35.1 percent of the vote . " we ran to win this election and we lost , " said kohl at the time .
" it is quite clear that the social democrats won this election .
there is nothing to discuss about this result . " the spd won just under 41 percent of votes , its second best result since 1949 .
by then the greens had joined forces with the eastern buendnis 90 to become one party , with which the spd quickly formed a coalition , and social democrat gerhard schroeder was elected germany 's seventh chancellor .
bildunterschrift : after being confirmed chancellor on oct .
27 , 1998 , schroeder thanks his party colleagues , oskar lafontaine and rudolf scharping 2002 : the beginning of the end ? four years later , the comfortable spd / green majority considerably dipped , winning only a slight majority over cdu / csu and fdp in the 2002 elections .
the still positive outcome was partially attributed to the schroeder government 's successful crisis management during the 2002 flooding of the rivers elbe and oder in eastern germany . but above all , berlin 's " no " to the us-led war in iraq was a significant reason for voters to stick with schroeder . this popular backing waned , however , with the social and labor market reforms which the government introduced in spring 2003 .
the spd in particular was held responsible for the cuts in germany 's social net .
the party lost a number of state elections , including its stronghold north rhine-westphalia .
in may 2005 , the last spd-green coalition government on a state level was voted out .
on the same day chancellor schroeder called for snap elections . 2005 : the first female chancellor the election in 2005 failed to produce a clear winner .
with the spd polling 34.2 and the cdu / csu bringing home 35.2 percent , neither party had a big enough mandate to create a coalition with their preferred partners .
after a three-week battle between gerhard schroeder and christian democrat party chief angela merkel for political supremacy , their two parties agreed to form a " grand coalition " together .
merkel came out on top as the first woman to become german chancellor .
she started off on a wave of popularity that continued to grow as she launched a tour of diplomacy to germany 's traditional allies , france , britain and the united states , and brokered a european union budget deal all within months of taking over the chancellery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinmeier have ruled together but would rather not afghanistan loomed large throughout the government 's tenure , with the partners steadfast in their insistence that german soldiers remain part of the nato-led mission to stabilize the country .
the grand coalition government was also marked by the global financial crisis .
in late 2008 taxpayers shelled out 100 billion euros for the bailout of a single bank , hypo real estate , as they saw their country lurch into recession . the government has hardly been challenged by the small opposition parties in the bundestag .
rather , the grand coalition has been its own worst enemy , and opinion polls rule out a continuation .
instead , angela merkel is likely to win another term as chancellor at the helm of a cdu / csu coalition with the free-market liberal fdp .
the social democrats and their candidate for chancellor , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , will probably end up back in the role of opposition for the first time in over a decade .

today , the country can look back on a checkered history of bundestag elections since the german federal republic was founded in 1949 . west german citizens went to the polls in august 1949 .
it was the first time since the end of the weimar republic in 1933 that men and women could vote in a democratic election for a new parliament . the turnout was one many other countries could only dream of .
nearly 80 percent of eligible voters headed to the ballot boxes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad adenauer takes his oath of office on sept .
20 , 1949 from president erich koehler the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , got the best results , with 31 percent of the votes .
cdu chairman konrad adenauer was elected the nation 's first chancellor , based on a coalition of cdu / csu , free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the very conservative german party -lrb- dp -rrb- . the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who won 29.2 percent of the vote , began a 17-year period in the opposition . 1957 : " no experiments " adenauer 's policies were focused on consolidating germany 's market economy and integrating the country into the western camp .
a significant step toward this aim was germany 's entry into nato in 1955 . voters in the 1957 election confirmed the government , which had run on the slogan " no experiments . "
the cdu / csu won 50.2 percent of the votes .
it was the only time in german postwar history that a party could gain the absolute majority in parliament in federal elections . but 1957 also marked the beginning of the spd 's rise in support , which continued to 1972 . 1965 : the grand coalition the coalition partners cdu / csu and fdp won a significant victory in the 1965 federal elections .
but one year later , the partners could n't reach agreement on how to fill the impending budget gap .
the fdp resisted the union 's aimed tax increases and the coalition collapsed . this marked the beginning of a three-year grand coalition of cdu / csu and spd .
kurt-georg kiesinger -lrb- cdu -rrb- was elected chancellor .
spd chairman and former mayor of berlin willy brandt became his deputy and foreign minister . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : willy brandt 's push for relations with east germany led to his fall the 1969 elections forced the cdu / csu to retreat to the opposition for the first time in postwar german history .
the spd formed a coalition with the fdp and brandt became chancellor . 1972 : confirmation for brandt chancellor brandt emphasized domestic reforms but more importantly , he wanted to improve relations with eastern bloc countries and the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- . this controversial ostpolitik led to fierce domestic wrangling and almost to brandt 's fall in 1972 .
several mps from spd and fdp left their parties .
the cdu / csu felt its time had come and demanded a vote on a motion of no confidence . the attempt failed by an extremely narrow margin .
but the government no longer had the necessary majority in parliament .
the bundestag was dissolved and new elections were called in the fall of 1972 .
these gave the spd 45.8 percent of the vote , its best result on a federal level ever .
the spd / fdp coalition remained in power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut schmidt won a vote of no confidence in feb .
1982 but was later defeated by kohl brandt was forced to resign in 1974 following an espionage scandal .
he was replaced by his finance minister helmut schmidt , also a social democrat . 1983 : kohl comes to power although the cdu / csu faction was the strongest in parliament , the spd continued ruling with schmidt through a coalition with the fdp .
but following elections in 1980 , growing disputes with the fdp in tackling economic issues led several fdp ministers to leave schmidt 's cabinet in 1982 . schmidt attempted to continue with a minority spd-only government .

but the future is not looking as bright . on the tarmac of schönefeld airport , in the south of the city , it 's almost impossible to pick out an airplane not colored in either the dark blue of ryanair , the magenta of germanwings or easyjet 's garish orange . the three low-cost airlines are one of the major reasons schönefeld currently finds itself expanding from the smaller regional airport it once was to a serious hub .
on june 4 , germanwings announced the berlin airport was joining stuttgart and cologne / bonn as one of its main hubs .
a little over a month later , airport officials broke ground on a new 12 million euro -lrb- $ 14.4 million -rrb- terminal that aims to accommodate a passenger count that is already at 2.16 million for the first half of this year . the news is good for berlin city officials , who have been waging a legal battle to expand the airport to become berlin 's main hub by 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schönefeld should be berlin 's biggest airport by 2010 , when it will be re-named berlin brandenburg international .
" we can justify the expansion with the increasing passenger count , " berlin mayor klaus wowereit said at the groundbreaking . berlin number one in continental europe not just schönefeld , but the city 's tegel airport - where most major airlines land - and the storied tempelhof are attracting low-cost passengers at a record count .
of the 7.9 million passengers that passed through the three , 3.5 million were customers of low-cost airlines , said the fbs , the company responsibility for all three airports .
though the u.k. and ireland , birthplace of airlines like easyjet and ryanair , remains the undisputed leaders in the low-cost rankings , berlin is catching up . " berlin is the most important and biggest low-cost market in all of continental europe , " said fbs chief dieter johannsen-roth . german no-frills airlines like air berlin and germanwings have been steadily building passenger lists over the past few years .
this year air berlin , ryanair and easyjet alone ordered a total of 300 airplanes until 2012 .
national european airlines , by comparison , ordered only 30 machines , according to a study by corporate consultants mckinsey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germanwings is germany 's leading low-cost airline long-term doubts for no-frills carriers the good vibes and inflated expectations of the no-frills market , however , are not likely to last .
over the long term , only two or three airlines will be able to survive on the european market , according to the mckinsey study , and only if they cut costs or manage to distinguish themselves from other airlines . " the days in which low-cost airlines expanded largely unrivalled through market stimulation , are over , " wrote lucio pompeo , the author of the study . charter and national airlines have already begun ratcheting down their prices , forcing low-cost carriers to switch to traditional routes filled with more competitors .
at airports in cologne , brussels and dublin , some routes have already been cancelled . but the mood at schönefeld remains high .
germanwings chief joachim klein said he expects the airline to attract 1 million passengers to the airport this year .
in 2006 , the number should be 2 million . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de calls grow to tax airlines for pollution in germany , airlines enjoy generous government tax breaks while rail companies pay environmental and fuel taxes , even though they pollute less .

celebrities from the world over are walking the red carpet at the bayreuth festival .
but how do mere mortals get their hands on a coveted ticket ? the new production by swiss director christoph marthaler of " tristan and isolde " opened the 94th richard wagner festival in bayreuth .
until august 28 , some 60,000 people will have the opportunity to hear works from the master performed in the festival hall he designed himself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " tristan und isolde " those who actually managed to get tickets can count themselves extremely lucky , since they 've been sold out for quite some time now .
the demand outpaced supply this year by a factor of 10 , as usual . " unfortunately , visitors have to count on a waiting time for tickets from between eight and ten years , " said peter emmerich , spokesman for the festival . black-market boom opera lovers who either ca n't or do n't want to wait that long basically have two choices : they can work their connections , if they have any , or turn to the black market .
while the connection option is a desired one , most people who want a ticket often have to try the other road . everything these days is available on the internet and festival tickets are no exception .
but most online prices range from 310 to 1,200 euros -lrb- $ 373 to $ 1,446 -rrb- .
the us ticket seller , ticket-finder.com , is honest about the price it 's asking for a ticket to tristan ii , up to $ 2,717 : " the price is arrived at taking into consideration the costs for the ticket , taxes and the great demand for a limited supply .
that means the price can increase by up to 500 percent . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel , chancellor candidate of the christian democratic union , cdu , waves to spectators as she arrives for the opening of the wagner opera festival in bayreuth , southern germany , monday , july 25 , 2005 .
those prices are astronomical , especially when one considers that the most expensive ticket at the official outlets costs 192 euros .
this price is arrived at due to the fact that the state provides subsidies for the tickets and the organization committee .
the purpose of these public monies is to make the festival affordable for the average person . little action taken the organizers of the festival are aware of the black market problem , but they have hardly any legal room to take action against the high prices and rampant reselling .
random inspections of tickets at the entrance to performances are carried out sometimes to check that the buyer is the one using the ticket for entry to a performance , but buyers face no real consequences - despite rumors to the contrary . " the highest priority in bayreuth is and will remain the comfort and enjoyment of the festival by our visitors .
that means tickets are transferable , " said emmerich . festival fans who want legitimate , and affordable , tickets have a rocky road ahead of them : get an order form from the festival ticket office , fill it out and start hoping . " we take great pains to be fair in the distribution of tickets .
we take into consideration how long someone has been on the waiting list , " said emmerich .
" the longer the wait , the greater the chance there is of getting a ticket . " parting is such sweet sorrow exceptions , of course , prove the rule .
festival veterans report that there is actually a chance to get affordable tickets at the festival itself .
the secret is to go to the official tickets outlets and ask about tickets that have been handed back in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's possible to score this way , but lady luck has to be on your side , or you have to count on the misfortune and fairness of other wagner fans who might have waited years to get the precious tickets , but for some reason could n't use them , and handed them back in .
others choose the internet auction route .
" i was so happy , " wrote mercedes200869 , who auctioned two tickets on ebay .
" but my boyfriend ca n't come with me , my best friend is on vacation and another one ca n't come for sure because of her child .
i did n't want to go alone to an experience like this , which you do n't get offered that often in life .
especially not alone .
so after long consideration , i decided to part with my two tickets .

the fees for day care centers will be gradually phased out .
the three-year parental -lrb- not exclusively intended for the mother -rrb- leave will remain untouched - and will include a job guarantee after and the possibility of part-time work .
the spd has declared that it wants to increase the number of working women to more than 60 percent in keeping with european directives . cdu / csu the union 's party platform talks of a targeted promotion of highly-gifted and talented children and teenagers , but it does n't outline any concrete plans about how it intends to do that .

the party is against the introduction of a state-run " ethics class " and instead want to hold on to a church-led religion class .
in addition , it guarantees that employees who take care of a child or need to nurse to a close relative , will have the right to part-time work . the greens the greens say that children -lrb- also those under three years of age -rrb- will have a right to a spot in a high-quality day center .

now , one german state is recognizing them as a national " minority . " rhineland-palatinate is the first state in germany to recognize as a national minority the roughly 8,000 romas and sintis who live there .
in 1997 , the federal government recognized the 50,000 danish in the north and the 60,000 sorbs who reside in the southeast as national minorities .
rhineland-palatinate 's premier , kurt beck , and the head of the state 's sintis and roma association , jacques delfeld , signed the agreement on monday .
" we want to send a signal with this agreement against the discrimination and for the rights of sinti and roma in our society , " beck said after the signing .
protection of minorities recognition of european minorities on a continent-wide basis dates back only to the eu 's framework agreement , passed in the 1990s .
germany ratified it in 1997 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roma frequently live in poverty in europe with it come certain responsibilities towards minorities .
in rhineland-palatinate , the state will promote special support for sintis and romas in kindergartens , schools and colleges .
this measure is supposed to level the playing field for the two groups in the educational system .
stereotypes perpetuated the central committee of german sintis and romas , in heidelberg , has been demanding for over a decade that an end be brought to what it believes to be discriminatory reporting against the people it represents .
this comes primarily in the form of arrest warrants and reports .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romani rose , head of the german sinti and roma organization , in front of a collection of signatures seeking recognition of the fact that they were also persecuted by the nazis police sometimes include the terms " sinti , " " roma " or even " gypsy " in their reports , which are frequently published in the media .
the central committee says the procedure helps to propagate negative stereotypes .
the new agreement in rhineland-palatinate will prohibit police from mentioning the ethnic identity of sinti or roma when publishing criminal reports in the state .
the sinti and roma languages will also be promoted .
no national recognition - yet whether berlin will take up the matter and put the recognition of the two groups on the legislative agenda remains to be seen .
so far , the government describes the sinti and roma as an " ethnic group , " which allow them some special protection .
but the federal government has not yet taken the final step , saying that the sintis and romas do not meet one of the five criteria set up in the eu framework - namely that they do not have a permanent region they reside in .
over 500,000 sintis and romas were killed by the nazis in the 1930s and 1940s .

celebrities from the world over are walking the red carpet at the bayreuth festival .
but how do mere mortals get their hands on a coveted ticket ? the new production by swiss director christoph marthaler of " tristan and isolde " opened the 94th richard wagner festival in bayreuth .
until august 28 , some 60,000 people will have the opportunity to hear works from the master performed in the festival hall he designed himself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " tristan und isolde " those who actually managed to get tickets can count themselves extremely lucky , since they 've been sold out for quite some time now .
the demand outpaced supply this year by a factor of 10 , as usual . " unfortunately , visitors have to count on a waiting time for tickets from between eight and ten years , " said peter emmerich , spokesman for the festival . black-market boom opera lovers who either ca n't or do n't want to wait that long basically have two choices : they can work their connections , if they have any , or turn to the black market .
while the connection option is a desired one , most people who want a ticket often have to try the other road . everything these days is available on the internet and festival tickets are no exception .
but most online prices range from 310 to 1,200 euros -lrb- $ 373 to $ 1,446 -rrb- .
the us ticket seller , ticket-finder.com , is honest about the price it 's asking for a ticket to tristan ii , up to $ 2,717 : " the price is arrived at taking into consideration the costs for the ticket , taxes and the great demand for a limited supply .

those prices are astronomical , especially when one considers that the most expensive ticket at the official outlets costs 192 euros .
this price is arrived at due to the fact that the state provides subsidies for the tickets and the organization committee .
the purpose of these public monies is to make the festival affordable for the average person . little action taken the organizers of the festival are aware of the black market problem , but they have hardly any legal room to take action against the high prices and rampant reselling .
random inspections of tickets at the entrance to performances are carried out sometimes to check that the buyer is the one using the ticket for entry to a performance , but buyers face no real consequences - despite rumors to the contrary . " the highest priority in bayreuth is and will remain the comfort and enjoyment of the festival by our visitors .
that means tickets are transferable , " said emmerich . festival fans who want legitimate , and affordable , tickets have a rocky road ahead of them : get an order form from the festival ticket office , fill it out and start hoping . " we take great pains to be fair in the distribution of tickets .
we take into consideration how long someone has been on the waiting list , " said emmerich .
" the longer the wait , the greater the chance there is of getting a ticket . " parting is such sweet sorrow exceptions , of course , prove the rule .
festival veterans report that there is actually a chance to get affordable tickets at the festival itself .
the secret is to go to the official tickets outlets and ask about tickets that have been handed back in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's possible to score this way , but lady luck has to be on your side , or you have to count on the misfortune and fairness of other wagner fans who might have waited years to get the precious tickets , but for some reason could n't use them , and handed them back in .

celebrities from the world over are walking the red carpet at the bayreuth festival .
but how do mere mortals get their hands on a coveted ticket ? the new production by swiss director christoph marthaler of " tristan and isolde " opened the 94th richard wagner festival in bayreuth .
until august 28 , some 60,000 people will have the opportunity to hear works from the master performed in the festival hall he designed himself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " tristan und isolde " those who actually managed to get tickets can count themselves extremely lucky , since they 've been sold out for quite some time now .
the demand outpaced supply this year by a factor of 10 , as usual . " unfortunately , visitors have to count on a waiting time for tickets from between eight and ten years , " said peter emmerich , spokesman for the festival . black-market boom opera lovers who either ca n't or do n't want to wait that long basically have two choices : they can work their connections , if they have any , or turn to the black market .
while the connection option is a desired one , most people who want a ticket often have to try the other road . everything these days is available on the internet and festival tickets are no exception .
but most online prices range from 310 to 1,200 euros -lrb- $ 373 to $ 1,446 -rrb- .
the us ticket seller , ticket-finder.com , is honest about the price it 's asking for a ticket to tristan ii , up to $ 2,717 : " the price is arrived at taking into consideration the costs for the ticket , taxes and the great demand for a limited supply .
that means the price can increase by up to 500 percent . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel , chancellor candidate of the christian democratic union , cdu , waves to spectators as she arrives for the opening of the wagner opera festival in bayreuth , southern germany , monday , july 25 , 2005 .
those prices are astronomical , especially when one considers that the most expensive ticket at the official outlets costs 192 euros .
this price is arrived at due to the fact that the state provides subsidies for the tickets and the organization committee .
the purpose of these public monies is to make the festival affordable for the average person . little action taken the organizers of the festival are aware of the black market problem , but they have hardly any legal room to take action against the high prices and rampant reselling .

the islamic radical had admitted to killing filmmaker theo van gogh last november , saying he acted out of faith . the three-judge panel of the amsterdam high-security court announced the life sentence against bouyeri for the murder which the prosecution said signaled the end of innocence for the tolerant netherlands .
to show just how severe the judges believe this reading is , they have order that bouyeri be present in court as the verdict was read out - something almost unheard of in the netherlands , where suspects are not obliged to attend the reading of the verdict and it is very rare that a court orders a suspect to attend .

the filmmaker , a distant relative of 19th century painter vincent van gogh , was also an outspoken columnist who often criticized islam and multicultural society .
together with dutch lawmaker ayaan hirsi ali , he made a short film called " submission , " linking islam to the abuse of women and causing outrage in the dutch muslim community .
after van gogh 's murder , hirsi ali went into hiding for three months because a letter threatening her and other politicians was found on the filmmaker 's body .

a life sentence carries no possibility of parole in the netherlands , but convicts can be released after receiving a royal pardon .
whether bouyeri would like a pardon from the queen is another matter .
in a dramatic final speech to the court at the end of his trial two weeks ago , he said he wanted to receive the maximum punishment and warned that he would do the same again if he were freed .

the islamic radical had admitted to killing filmmaker theo van gogh last november , saying he acted out of faith . the three-judge panel of the amsterdam high-security court announced the life sentence against bouyeri for the murder which the prosecution said signaled the end of innocence for the tolerant netherlands .
to show just how severe the judges believe this reading is , they have order that bouyeri be present in court as the verdict was read out - something almost unheard of in the netherlands , where suspects are not obliged to attend the reading of the verdict and it is very rare that a court orders a suspect to attend .

together with dutch lawmaker ayaan hirsi ali , he made a short film called " submission , " linking islam to the abuse of women and causing outrage in the dutch muslim community .
after van gogh 's murder , hirsi ali went into hiding for three months because a letter threatening her and other politicians was found on the filmmaker 's body .

a life sentence carries no possibility of parole in the netherlands , but convicts can be released after receiving a royal pardon .
whether bouyeri would like a pardon from the queen is another matter .

now , one german state is recognizing them as a national " minority . " rhineland-palatinate is the first state in germany to recognize as a national minority the roughly 8,000 romas and sintis who live there .
in 1997 , the federal government recognized the 50,000 danish in the north and the 60,000 sorbs who reside in the southeast as national minorities .
rhineland-palatinate 's premier , kurt beck , and the head of the state 's sintis and roma association , jacques delfeld , signed the agreement on monday .
" we want to send a signal with this agreement against the discrimination and for the rights of sinti and roma in our society , " beck said after the signing .
protection of minorities recognition of european minorities on a continent-wide basis dates back only to the eu 's framework agreement , passed in the 1990s .
germany ratified it in 1997 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roma frequently live in poverty in europe with it come certain responsibilities towards minorities .
in rhineland-palatinate , the state will promote special support for sintis and romas in kindergartens , schools and colleges .
this measure is supposed to level the playing field for the two groups in the educational system .
stereotypes perpetuated the central committee of german sintis and romas , in heidelberg , has been demanding for over a decade that an end be brought to what it believes to be discriminatory reporting against the people it represents .
this comes primarily in the form of arrest warrants and reports .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romani rose , head of the german sinti and roma organization , in front of a collection of signatures seeking recognition of the fact that they were also persecuted by the nazis police sometimes include the terms " sinti , " " roma " or even " gypsy " in their reports , which are frequently published in the media .
the central committee says the procedure helps to propagate negative stereotypes .
the new agreement in rhineland-palatinate will prohibit police from mentioning the ethnic identity of sinti or roma when publishing criminal reports in the state .
the sinti and roma languages will also be promoted .
no national recognition - yet whether berlin will take up the matter and put the recognition of the two groups on the legislative agenda remains to be seen .
so far , the government describes the sinti and roma as an " ethnic group , " which allow them some special protection .
but the federal government has not yet taken the final step , saying that the sintis and romas do not meet one of the five criteria set up in the eu framework - namely that they do not have a permanent region they reside in .
over 500,000 sintis and romas were killed by the nazis in the 1930s and 1940s .

celebrities from the world over are walking the red carpet at the bayreuth festival .
but how do mere mortals get their hands on a coveted ticket ? the new production by swiss director christoph marthaler of " tristan and isolde " opened the 94th richard wagner festival in bayreuth .
until august 28 , some 60,000 people will have the opportunity to hear works from the master performed in the festival hall he designed himself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " tristan und isolde " those who actually managed to get tickets can count themselves extremely lucky , since they 've been sold out for quite some time now .
the demand outpaced supply this year by a factor of 10 , as usual . " unfortunately , visitors have to count on a waiting time for tickets from between eight and ten years , " said peter emmerich , spokesman for the festival . black-market boom opera lovers who either ca n't or do n't want to wait that long basically have two choices : they can work their connections , if they have any , or turn to the black market .
while the connection option is a desired one , most people who want a ticket often have to try the other road . everything these days is available on the internet and festival tickets are no exception .
but most online prices range from 310 to 1,200 euros -lrb- $ 373 to $ 1,446 -rrb- .
the us ticket seller , ticket-finder.com , is honest about the price it 's asking for a ticket to tristan ii , up to $ 2,717 : " the price is arrived at taking into consideration the costs for the ticket , taxes and the great demand for a limited supply .
that means the price can increase by up to 500 percent . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel , chancellor candidate of the christian democratic union , cdu , waves to spectators as she arrives for the opening of the wagner opera festival in bayreuth , southern germany , monday , july 25 , 2005 .
those prices are astronomical , especially when one considers that the most expensive ticket at the official outlets costs 192 euros .
this price is arrived at due to the fact that the state provides subsidies for the tickets and the organization committee .
the purpose of these public monies is to make the festival affordable for the average person . little action taken the organizers of the festival are aware of the black market problem , but they have hardly any legal room to take action against the high prices and rampant reselling .
random inspections of tickets at the entrance to performances are carried out sometimes to check that the buyer is the one using the ticket for entry to a performance , but buyers face no real consequences - despite rumors to the contrary . " the highest priority in bayreuth is and will remain the comfort and enjoyment of the festival by our visitors .
that means tickets are transferable , " said emmerich . festival fans who want legitimate , and affordable , tickets have a rocky road ahead of them : get an order form from the festival ticket office , fill it out and start hoping . " we take great pains to be fair in the distribution of tickets .
we take into consideration how long someone has been on the waiting list , " said emmerich .
" the longer the wait , the greater the chance there is of getting a ticket . " parting is such sweet sorrow exceptions , of course , prove the rule .
festival veterans report that there is actually a chance to get affordable tickets at the festival itself .
the secret is to go to the official tickets outlets and ask about tickets that have been handed back in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's possible to score this way , but lady luck has to be on your side , or you have to count on the misfortune and fairness of other wagner fans who might have waited years to get the precious tickets , but for some reason could n't use them , and handed them back in .
others choose the internet auction route .
" i was so happy , " wrote mercedes200869 , who auctioned two tickets on ebay .
" but my boyfriend ca n't come with me , my best friend is on vacation and another one ca n't come for sure because of her child .
i did n't want to go alone to an experience like this , which you do n't get offered that often in life .
especially not alone .
so after long consideration , i decided to part with my two tickets .

celebrities from the world over are walking the red carpet at the bayreuth festival .
but how do mere mortals get their hands on a coveted ticket ? the new production by swiss director christoph marthaler of " tristan and isolde " opened the 94th richard wagner festival in bayreuth .
until august 28 , some 60,000 people will have the opportunity to hear works from the master performed in the festival hall he designed himself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " tristan und isolde " those who actually managed to get tickets can count themselves extremely lucky , since they 've been sold out for quite some time now .
the demand outpaced supply this year by a factor of 10 , as usual . " unfortunately , visitors have to count on a waiting time for tickets from between eight and ten years , " said peter emmerich , spokesman for the festival . black-market boom opera lovers who either ca n't or do n't want to wait that long basically have two choices : they can work their connections , if they have any , or turn to the black market .
while the connection option is a desired one , most people who want a ticket often have to try the other road . everything these days is available on the internet and festival tickets are no exception .
but most online prices range from 310 to 1,200 euros -lrb- $ 373 to $ 1,446 -rrb- .
the us ticket seller , ticket-finder.com , is honest about the price it 's asking for a ticket to tristan ii , up to $ 2,717 : " the price is arrived at taking into consideration the costs for the ticket , taxes and the great demand for a limited supply .
that means the price can increase by up to 500 percent . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel , chancellor candidate of the christian democratic union , cdu , waves to spectators as she arrives for the opening of the wagner opera festival in bayreuth , southern germany , monday , july 25 , 2005 .
those prices are astronomical , especially when one considers that the most expensive ticket at the official outlets costs 192 euros .
this price is arrived at due to the fact that the state provides subsidies for the tickets and the organization committee .
the purpose of these public monies is to make the festival affordable for the average person . little action taken the organizers of the festival are aware of the black market problem , but they have hardly any legal room to take action against the high prices and rampant reselling .
random inspections of tickets at the entrance to performances are carried out sometimes to check that the buyer is the one using the ticket for entry to a performance , but buyers face no real consequences - despite rumors to the contrary . " the highest priority in bayreuth is and will remain the comfort and enjoyment of the festival by our visitors .
that means tickets are transferable , " said emmerich . festival fans who want legitimate , and affordable , tickets have a rocky road ahead of them : get an order form from the festival ticket office , fill it out and start hoping . " we take great pains to be fair in the distribution of tickets .
we take into consideration how long someone has been on the waiting list , " said emmerich .
" the longer the wait , the greater the chance there is of getting a ticket . " parting is such sweet sorrow exceptions , of course , prove the rule .
festival veterans report that there is actually a chance to get affordable tickets at the festival itself .
the secret is to go to the official tickets outlets and ask about tickets that have been handed back in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's possible to score this way , but lady luck has to be on your side , or you have to count on the misfortune and fairness of other wagner fans who might have waited years to get the precious tickets , but for some reason could n't use them , and handed them back in .
others choose the internet auction route .
" i was so happy , " wrote mercedes200869 , who auctioned two tickets on ebay .
" but my boyfriend ca n't come with me , my best friend is on vacation and another one ca n't come for sure because of her child .
i did n't want to go alone to an experience like this , which you do n't get offered that often in life .
especially not alone .
so after long consideration , i decided to part with my two tickets .

today , the country can look back on a checkered history of bundestag elections since the german federal republic was founded in 1949 . west german citizens went to the polls in august 1949 .
it was the first time since the end of the weimar republic in 1933 that men and women could vote in a democratic election for a new parliament . the turnout was one many other countries could only dream of .
nearly 80 percent of eligible voters headed to the ballot boxes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad adenauer takes his oath of office on sept .
20 , 1949 from president erich koehler the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , got the best results , with 31 percent of the votes .
cdu chairman konrad adenauer was elected the nation 's first chancellor , based on a coalition of cdu / csu , free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the very conservative german party -lrb- dp -rrb- . the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who won 29.2 percent of the vote , began a 17-year period in the opposition . 1957 : " no experiments " adenauer 's policies were focused on consolidating germany 's market economy and integrating the country into the western camp .
a significant step toward this aim was germany 's entry into nato in 1955 . voters in the 1957 election confirmed the government , which had run on the slogan " no experiments . "
the cdu / csu won 50.2 percent of the votes .
it was the only time in german postwar history that a party could gain the absolute majority in parliament in federal elections . but 1957 also marked the beginning of the spd 's rise in support , which continued to 1972 . 1965 : the grand coalition the coalition partners cdu / csu and fdp won a significant victory in the 1965 federal elections .
but one year later , the partners could n't reach agreement on how to fill the impending budget gap .
the fdp resisted the union 's aimed tax increases and the coalition collapsed . this marked the beginning of a three-year grand coalition of cdu / csu and spd .
kurt-georg kiesinger -lrb- cdu -rrb- was elected chancellor .
spd chairman and former mayor of berlin willy brandt became his deputy and foreign minister . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : willy brandt 's push for relations with east germany led to his fall the 1969 elections forced the cdu / csu to retreat to the opposition for the first time in postwar german history .
the spd formed a coalition with the fdp and brandt became chancellor . 1972 : confirmation for brandt chancellor brandt emphasized domestic reforms but more importantly , he wanted to improve relations with eastern bloc countries and the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- . this controversial ostpolitik led to fierce domestic wrangling and almost to brandt 's fall in 1972 .
several mps from spd and fdp left their parties .
the cdu / csu felt its time had come and demanded a vote on a motion of no confidence . the attempt failed by an extremely narrow margin .
but the government no longer had the necessary majority in parliament .
the bundestag was dissolved and new elections were called in the fall of 1972 .
these gave the spd 45.8 percent of the vote , its best result on a federal level ever .
the spd / fdp coalition remained in power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut schmidt won a vote of no confidence in feb .
1982 but was later defeated by kohl brandt was forced to resign in 1974 following an espionage scandal .
he was replaced by his finance minister helmut schmidt , also a social democrat . 1983 : kohl comes to power although the cdu / csu faction was the strongest in parliament , the spd continued ruling with schmidt through a coalition with the fdp .
but following elections in 1980 , growing disputes with the fdp in tackling economic issues led several fdp ministers to leave schmidt 's cabinet in 1982 . schmidt attempted to continue with a minority spd-only government .
but he was forced to resign by a constructive vote of no confidence on oct .
1 , 1982 - the first in german history to be successful . the fdp joined the cdu / csu and elected helmut kohl as chancellor .
german voters confirmed this new coalition in early elections in 1983 , giving the cdu / csu 48.8 percent and the fdp 7 percent of the vote .
the spd only won 38.2 percent . in 1983 the environmentalist green party made it into parliament for the first time , winning 5.6 percent of the vote . bildunterschrift : west german chancellor helmut kohl ahead of a parliamentary vote of no confidence in december 1982 1990 : a unified german vote the first federal elections following german unification in 1990 gave the parliament a new face .
although the green party did n't make the five-percent hurdle necessary to hold seats in the bundestag , special rules for this first united german election allowed the greens ' eastern german partner buendnis 90 to have eight representatives . under these rules , the reform communist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- was also represented with 17 mps , although it had only won 2.4 percent of votes . the ruling cdu / csu saw a slight loss of votes , from 44.3 percent to 43.8 percent .
but it could continue its coalition with the fdp .
in the 1994 elections , this majority was even narrower .
the cdu / csu won just 41.4 percent of the vote . the greens , however , marched back into parliament with 7.3 percent of the vote in 1994 .
this result topped even the fdp , which dipped from 11 percent to 6.9 percent . 1998 : the beginning of spd-green power the federal elections in 1998 represented a true break in postwar german history .
for the first time ever , the change in government forced all parties of the old government into the opposition . after 16 years in power , helmut kohl had to step down .
the cdu / csu lost more than six percentage points in the election and only won 35.1 percent of the vote . " we ran to win this election and we lost , " said kohl at the time .
" it is quite clear that the social democrats won this election .
there is nothing to discuss about this result . " the spd won just under 41 percent of votes , its second best result since 1949 .
by then the greens had joined forces with the eastern buendnis 90 to become one party , with which the spd quickly formed a coalition , and social democrat gerhard schroeder was elected germany 's seventh chancellor .
bildunterschrift : after being confirmed chancellor on oct .
27 , 1998 , schroeder thanks his party colleagues , oskar lafontaine and rudolf scharping 2002 : the beginning of the end ? four years later , the comfortable spd / green majority considerably dipped , winning only a slight majority over cdu / csu and fdp in the 2002 elections .
the still positive outcome was partially attributed to the schroeder government 's successful crisis management during the 2002 flooding of the rivers elbe and oder in eastern germany . but above all , berlin 's " no " to the us-led war in iraq was a significant reason for voters to stick with schroeder . this popular backing waned , however , with the social and labor market reforms which the government introduced in spring 2003 .
the spd in particular was held responsible for the cuts in germany 's social net .
the party lost a number of state elections , including its stronghold north rhine-westphalia .
in may 2005 , the last spd-green coalition government on a state level was voted out .
on the same day chancellor schroeder called for snap elections . 2005 : the first female chancellor the election in 2005 failed to produce a clear winner .
with the spd polling 34.2 and the cdu / csu bringing home 35.2 percent , neither party had a big enough mandate to create a coalition with their preferred partners .
after a three-week battle between gerhard schroeder and christian democrat party chief angela merkel for political supremacy , their two parties agreed to form a " grand coalition " together .
merkel came out on top as the first woman to become german chancellor .
she started off on a wave of popularity that continued to grow as she launched a tour of diplomacy to germany 's traditional allies , france , britain and the united states , and brokered a european union budget deal all within months of taking over the chancellery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinmeier have ruled together but would rather not afghanistan loomed large throughout the government 's tenure , with the partners steadfast in their insistence that german soldiers remain part of the nato-led mission to stabilize the country .
the grand coalition government was also marked by the global financial crisis .
in late 2008 taxpayers shelled out 100 billion euros for the bailout of a single bank , hypo real estate , as they saw their country lurch into recession . the government has hardly been challenged by the small opposition parties in the bundestag .
rather , the grand coalition has been its own worst enemy , and opinion polls rule out a continuation .
instead , angela merkel is likely to win another term as chancellor at the helm of a cdu / csu coalition with the free-market liberal fdp .
the social democrats and their candidate for chancellor , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , will probably end up back in the role of opposition for the first time in over a decade .

celebrities from the world over are walking the red carpet at the bayreuth festival .
but how do mere mortals get their hands on a coveted ticket ? the new production by swiss director christoph marthaler of " tristan and isolde " opened the 94th richard wagner festival in bayreuth .
until august 28 , some 60,000 people will have the opportunity to hear works from the master performed in the festival hall he designed himself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " tristan und isolde " those who actually managed to get tickets can count themselves extremely lucky , since they 've been sold out for quite some time now .
the demand outpaced supply this year by a factor of 10 , as usual . " unfortunately , visitors have to count on a waiting time for tickets from between eight and ten years , " said peter emmerich , spokesman for the festival . black-market boom opera lovers who either ca n't or do n't want to wait that long basically have two choices : they can work their connections , if they have any , or turn to the black market .
while the connection option is a desired one , most people who want a ticket often have to try the other road . everything these days is available on the internet and festival tickets are no exception .
but most online prices range from 310 to 1,200 euros -lrb- $ 373 to $ 1,446 -rrb- .
the us ticket seller , ticket-finder.com , is honest about the price it 's asking for a ticket to tristan ii , up to $ 2,717 : " the price is arrived at taking into consideration the costs for the ticket , taxes and the great demand for a limited supply .
that means the price can increase by up to 500 percent . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel , chancellor candidate of the christian democratic union , cdu , waves to spectators as she arrives for the opening of the wagner opera festival in bayreuth , southern germany , monday , july 25 , 2005 .
those prices are astronomical , especially when one considers that the most expensive ticket at the official outlets costs 192 euros .
this price is arrived at due to the fact that the state provides subsidies for the tickets and the organization committee .
the purpose of these public monies is to make the festival affordable for the average person . little action taken the organizers of the festival are aware of the black market problem , but they have hardly any legal room to take action against the high prices and rampant reselling .
random inspections of tickets at the entrance to performances are carried out sometimes to check that the buyer is the one using the ticket for entry to a performance , but buyers face no real consequences - despite rumors to the contrary . " the highest priority in bayreuth is and will remain the comfort and enjoyment of the festival by our visitors .
that means tickets are transferable , " said emmerich . festival fans who want legitimate , and affordable , tickets have a rocky road ahead of them : get an order form from the festival ticket office , fill it out and start hoping . " we take great pains to be fair in the distribution of tickets .
we take into consideration how long someone has been on the waiting list , " said emmerich .
" the longer the wait , the greater the chance there is of getting a ticket . " parting is such sweet sorrow exceptions , of course , prove the rule .
festival veterans report that there is actually a chance to get affordable tickets at the festival itself .
the secret is to go to the official tickets outlets and ask about tickets that have been handed back in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's possible to score this way , but lady luck has to be on your side , or you have to count on the misfortune and fairness of other wagner fans who might have waited years to get the precious tickets , but for some reason could n't use them , and handed them back in .
others choose the internet auction route .
" i was so happy , " wrote mercedes200869 , who auctioned two tickets on ebay .
" but my boyfriend ca n't come with me , my best friend is on vacation and another one ca n't come for sure because of her child .
i did n't want to go alone to an experience like this , which you do n't get offered that often in life .

the spd has declared that it wants to increase the number of working women to more than 60 percent in keeping with european directives . cdu / csu the union 's party platform talks of a targeted promotion of highly-gifted and talented children and teenagers , but it does n't outline any concrete plans about how it intends to do that .

the party is against the introduction of a state-run " ethics class " and instead want to hold on to a church-led religion class .
in addition , it guarantees that employees who take care of a child or need to nurse to a close relative , will have the right to part-time work . the greens the greens say that children -lrb- also those under three years of age -rrb- will have a right to a spot in a high-quality day center .
the government will participate in the financing of day care centers .

even the status of unmarried partnerships will be improved .

it wants to introduce an education coupon or a " per head bonus pay " for kindergartens rather than promote kindergartens at large as a whole entity .

the islamic radical had admitted to killing filmmaker theo van gogh last november , saying he acted out of faith . the three-judge panel of the amsterdam high-security court announced the life sentence against bouyeri for the murder which the prosecution said signaled the end of innocence for the tolerant netherlands .
to show just how severe the judges believe this reading is , they have order that bouyeri be present in court as the verdict was read out - something almost unheard of in the netherlands , where suspects are not obliged to attend the reading of the verdict and it is very rare that a court orders a suspect to attend .
suspect flouts court 's authority bouyeri , a 27-year old who holds dual dutch and moroccan nationality , has made it clear he does not recognize the authority of the court .
during the trial he ordered his attorney not to present a defense .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theo van gogh was gunned down in broad daylight the slaying of van gogh , carried out in broad daylight as he cycled to work , shocked the netherlands .
it stoked ethnic tensions and sparked a wave of reprisal attacks primarily directed at the muslim community here .
the filmmaker , a distant relative of 19th century painter vincent van gogh , was also an outspoken columnist who often criticized islam and multicultural society .
together with dutch lawmaker ayaan hirsi ali , he made a short film called " submission , " linking islam to the abuse of women and causing outrage in the dutch muslim community .
after van gogh 's murder , hirsi ali went into hiding for three months because a letter threatening her and other politicians was found on the filmmaker 's body .
end of the innocence " the netherlands has lost its innocence .
our country has suddenly become a target of international terrorism , " prosecutor frits van straelen said during the trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch member of parliament ayaan hirsi ali had to go underground after van gogh 's murder bouyeri was charged with the premeditated murder of van gogh , the attempted murder of several police officers and bystanders , illegal possession of firearms , obstructing the work of hirsi ali as a member of parliament and threatening her with a terrorist act .
a life sentence carries no possibility of parole in the netherlands , but convicts can be released after receiving a royal pardon .
whether bouyeri would like a pardon from the queen is another matter .
in a dramatic final speech to the court at the end of his trial two weeks ago , he said he wanted to receive the maximum punishment and warned that he would do the same again if he were freed .
" i do not want to miss the chance to get the maximum sentence ...
i can assure you that if i am ever freed , i will do exactly the same , " he told the court .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence towards muslims , here a muslim school in flames , broke out after van gogh 's murder although he gave some insight as to why he killed van gogh , the dutch are still struggling to understand how bouyeri - who was born and raised in amsterdam - turned into radical islam .
bouyeri himself refused to comment on his transformation .
" you can set all your psychologists , psychiatrists and experts on me , but i tell you , you will never understand .

british police 's shoot-to-kill policy led on friday to the death of an innocent brazilian .
scotland yard expressed regret but justified the policy .
german laws are much more nebulous . the police officer who killed 27-year-old jean charles de menezes received full support from scotland yard .
metropolitan police commissioner ian blair called the shooting tragic , but the national shoot-to-kill policy necessary . when the issue of a shoot-to-kill policy comes up in germany , most police officers find themselves in legal limbo .
until terrorism became a viable , ubiquitous threat , it had only arisen in cases of hostage takings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a member of the arab commando group which seized members of the israeli olympic team at their quarters at the munich olympic village september 5 , 1972 appears with a hood over his face on the balcony of the village building where the commandos held several members of the israeli team hostage bavaria became the first german state to allow the practice , which it authorized the year after terrorists killed 11 israeli athletes at the 1972 olympic games in munich .
currently 12 of germany 's 16 states permit police officers to kill suspects in order to save the lives of innocent people but only as a last resort . responsibility rests alone on the officer but lawmakers in some states have been wary about creating legislation that puts a top-ranking police commissioner in position to hand down a potential death sentence . as a result , several states , including berlin , allow police officers themselves to decide which action to take ; their superiors may not order them to kill a suspected terrorist or hostage-taker . the policy is not without its critics .

the islamic radical had admitted to killing filmmaker theo van gogh last november , saying he acted out of faith . the three-judge panel of the amsterdam high-security court announced the life sentence against bouyeri for the murder which the prosecution said signaled the end of innocence for the tolerant netherlands .
to show just how severe the judges believe this reading is , they have order that bouyeri be present in court as the verdict was read out - something almost unheard of in the netherlands , where suspects are not obliged to attend the reading of the verdict and it is very rare that a court orders a suspect to attend .
suspect flouts court 's authority bouyeri , a 27-year old who holds dual dutch and moroccan nationality , has made it clear he does not recognize the authority of the court .
during the trial he ordered his attorney not to present a defense .

it stoked ethnic tensions and sparked a wave of reprisal attacks primarily directed at the muslim community here .
the filmmaker , a distant relative of 19th century painter vincent van gogh , was also an outspoken columnist who often criticized islam and multicultural society .
together with dutch lawmaker ayaan hirsi ali , he made a short film called " submission , " linking islam to the abuse of women and causing outrage in the dutch muslim community .
after van gogh 's murder , hirsi ali went into hiding for three months because a letter threatening her and other politicians was found on the filmmaker 's body .

a life sentence carries no possibility of parole in the netherlands , but convicts can be released after receiving a royal pardon .
whether bouyeri would like a pardon from the queen is another matter .
in a dramatic final speech to the court at the end of his trial two weeks ago , he said he wanted to receive the maximum punishment and warned that he would do the same again if he were freed .
" i do not want to miss the chance to get the maximum sentence ...
i can assure you that if i am ever freed , i will do exactly the same , " he told the court .

today , the country can look back on a checkered history of bundestag elections since the german federal republic was founded in 1949 . west german citizens went to the polls in august 1949 .
it was the first time since the end of the weimar republic in 1933 that men and women could vote in a democratic election for a new parliament . the turnout was one many other countries could only dream of .
nearly 80 percent of eligible voters headed to the ballot boxes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad adenauer takes his oath of office on sept .
20 , 1949 from president erich koehler the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , got the best results , with 31 percent of the votes .
cdu chairman konrad adenauer was elected the nation 's first chancellor , based on a coalition of cdu / csu , free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the very conservative german party -lrb- dp -rrb- . the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who won 29.2 percent of the vote , began a 17-year period in the opposition . 1957 : " no experiments " adenauer 's policies were focused on consolidating germany 's market economy and integrating the country into the western camp .
a significant step toward this aim was germany 's entry into nato in 1955 . voters in the 1957 election confirmed the government , which had run on the slogan " no experiments . "
the cdu / csu won 50.2 percent of the votes .
it was the only time in german postwar history that a party could gain the absolute majority in parliament in federal elections . but 1957 also marked the beginning of the spd 's rise in support , which continued to 1972 . 1965 : the grand coalition the coalition partners cdu / csu and fdp won a significant victory in the 1965 federal elections .
but one year later , the partners could n't reach agreement on how to fill the impending budget gap .
the fdp resisted the union 's aimed tax increases and the coalition collapsed . this marked the beginning of a three-year grand coalition of cdu / csu and spd .
kurt-georg kiesinger -lrb- cdu -rrb- was elected chancellor .
spd chairman and former mayor of berlin willy brandt became his deputy and foreign minister . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : willy brandt 's push for relations with east germany led to his fall the 1969 elections forced the cdu / csu to retreat to the opposition for the first time in postwar german history .
the spd formed a coalition with the fdp and brandt became chancellor . 1972 : confirmation for brandt chancellor brandt emphasized domestic reforms but more importantly , he wanted to improve relations with eastern bloc countries and the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- . this controversial ostpolitik led to fierce domestic wrangling and almost to brandt 's fall in 1972 .
several mps from spd and fdp left their parties .
the cdu / csu felt its time had come and demanded a vote on a motion of no confidence . the attempt failed by an extremely narrow margin .
but the government no longer had the necessary majority in parliament .
the bundestag was dissolved and new elections were called in the fall of 1972 .
these gave the spd 45.8 percent of the vote , its best result on a federal level ever .
the spd / fdp coalition remained in power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut schmidt won a vote of no confidence in feb .
1982 but was later defeated by kohl brandt was forced to resign in 1974 following an espionage scandal .
he was replaced by his finance minister helmut schmidt , also a social democrat . 1983 : kohl comes to power although the cdu / csu faction was the strongest in parliament , the spd continued ruling with schmidt through a coalition with the fdp .
but following elections in 1980 , growing disputes with the fdp in tackling economic issues led several fdp ministers to leave schmidt 's cabinet in 1982 . schmidt attempted to continue with a minority spd-only government .
but he was forced to resign by a constructive vote of no confidence on oct .
1 , 1982 - the first in german history to be successful . the fdp joined the cdu / csu and elected helmut kohl as chancellor .
german voters confirmed this new coalition in early elections in 1983 , giving the cdu / csu 48.8 percent and the fdp 7 percent of the vote .
the spd only won 38.2 percent . in 1983 the environmentalist green party made it into parliament for the first time , winning 5.6 percent of the vote . bildunterschrift : west german chancellor helmut kohl ahead of a parliamentary vote of no confidence in december 1982 1990 : a unified german vote the first federal elections following german unification in 1990 gave the parliament a new face .
although the green party did n't make the five-percent hurdle necessary to hold seats in the bundestag , special rules for this first united german election allowed the greens ' eastern german partner buendnis 90 to have eight representatives . under these rules , the reform communist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- was also represented with 17 mps , although it had only won 2.4 percent of votes . the ruling cdu / csu saw a slight loss of votes , from 44.3 percent to 43.8 percent .
but it could continue its coalition with the fdp .
in the 1994 elections , this majority was even narrower .
the cdu / csu won just 41.4 percent of the vote . the greens , however , marched back into parliament with 7.3 percent of the vote in 1994 .
this result topped even the fdp , which dipped from 11 percent to 6.9 percent . 1998 : the beginning of spd-green power the federal elections in 1998 represented a true break in postwar german history .
for the first time ever , the change in government forced all parties of the old government into the opposition . after 16 years in power , helmut kohl had to step down .
the cdu / csu lost more than six percentage points in the election and only won 35.1 percent of the vote . " we ran to win this election and we lost , " said kohl at the time .
" it is quite clear that the social democrats won this election .
there is nothing to discuss about this result . " the spd won just under 41 percent of votes , its second best result since 1949 .
by then the greens had joined forces with the eastern buendnis 90 to become one party , with which the spd quickly formed a coalition , and social democrat gerhard schroeder was elected germany 's seventh chancellor .
bildunterschrift : after being confirmed chancellor on oct .
27 , 1998 , schroeder thanks his party colleagues , oskar lafontaine and rudolf scharping 2002 : the beginning of the end ? four years later , the comfortable spd / green majority considerably dipped , winning only a slight majority over cdu / csu and fdp in the 2002 elections .
the still positive outcome was partially attributed to the schroeder government 's successful crisis management during the 2002 flooding of the rivers elbe and oder in eastern germany . but above all , berlin 's " no " to the us-led war in iraq was a significant reason for voters to stick with schroeder . this popular backing waned , however , with the social and labor market reforms which the government introduced in spring 2003 .
the spd in particular was held responsible for the cuts in germany 's social net .
the party lost a number of state elections , including its stronghold north rhine-westphalia .
in may 2005 , the last spd-green coalition government on a state level was voted out .
on the same day chancellor schroeder called for snap elections . 2005 : the first female chancellor the election in 2005 failed to produce a clear winner .
with the spd polling 34.2 and the cdu / csu bringing home 35.2 percent , neither party had a big enough mandate to create a coalition with their preferred partners .
after a three-week battle between gerhard schroeder and christian democrat party chief angela merkel for political supremacy , their two parties agreed to form a " grand coalition " together .
merkel came out on top as the first woman to become german chancellor .
she started off on a wave of popularity that continued to grow as she launched a tour of diplomacy to germany 's traditional allies , france , britain and the united states , and brokered a european union budget deal all within months of taking over the chancellery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinmeier have ruled together but would rather not afghanistan loomed large throughout the government 's tenure , with the partners steadfast in their insistence that german soldiers remain part of the nato-led mission to stabilize the country .
the grand coalition government was also marked by the global financial crisis .
in late 2008 taxpayers shelled out 100 billion euros for the bailout of a single bank , hypo real estate , as they saw their country lurch into recession . the government has hardly been challenged by the small opposition parties in the bundestag .
rather , the grand coalition has been its own worst enemy , and opinion polls rule out a continuation .
instead , angela merkel is likely to win another term as chancellor at the helm of a cdu / csu coalition with the free-market liberal fdp .
the social democrats and their candidate for chancellor , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , will probably end up back in the role of opposition for the first time in over a decade .

he was replaced by his finance minister helmut schmidt , also a social democrat . 1983 : kohl comes to power although the cdu / csu faction was the strongest in parliament , the spd continued ruling with schmidt through a coalition with the fdp .
but following elections in 1980 , growing disputes with the fdp in tackling economic issues led several fdp ministers to leave schmidt 's cabinet in 1982 . schmidt attempted to continue with a minority spd-only government .
but he was forced to resign by a constructive vote of no confidence on oct .
1 , 1982 - the first in german history to be successful . the fdp joined the cdu / csu and elected helmut kohl as chancellor .
german voters confirmed this new coalition in early elections in 1983 , giving the cdu / csu 48.8 percent and the fdp 7 percent of the vote .
the spd only won 38.2 percent . in 1983 the environmentalist green party made it into parliament for the first time , winning 5.6 percent of the vote . bildunterschrift : west german chancellor helmut kohl ahead of a parliamentary vote of no confidence in december 1982 1990 : a unified german vote the first federal elections following german unification in 1990 gave the parliament a new face .
although the green party did n't make the five-percent hurdle necessary to hold seats in the bundestag , special rules for this first united german election allowed the greens ' eastern german partner buendnis 90 to have eight representatives . under these rules , the reform communist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- was also represented with 17 mps , although it had only won 2.4 percent of votes . the ruling cdu / csu saw a slight loss of votes , from 44.3 percent to 43.8 percent .
but it could continue its coalition with the fdp .
in the 1994 elections , this majority was even narrower .
the cdu / csu won just 41.4 percent of the vote . the greens , however , marched back into parliament with 7.3 percent of the vote in 1994 .
this result topped even the fdp , which dipped from 11 percent to 6.9 percent . 1998 : the beginning of spd-green power the federal elections in 1998 represented a true break in postwar german history .
for the first time ever , the change in government forced all parties of the old government into the opposition . after 16 years in power , helmut kohl had to step down .
the cdu / csu lost more than six percentage points in the election and only won 35.1 percent of the vote . " we ran to win this election and we lost , " said kohl at the time .
" it is quite clear that the social democrats won this election .
there is nothing to discuss about this result . " the spd won just under 41 percent of votes , its second best result since 1949 .
by then the greens had joined forces with the eastern buendnis 90 to become one party , with which the spd quickly formed a coalition , and social democrat gerhard schroeder was elected germany 's seventh chancellor .
bildunterschrift : after being confirmed chancellor on oct .
27 , 1998 , schroeder thanks his party colleagues , oskar lafontaine and rudolf scharping 2002 : the beginning of the end ? four years later , the comfortable spd / green majority considerably dipped , winning only a slight majority over cdu / csu and fdp in the 2002 elections .
the still positive outcome was partially attributed to the schroeder government 's successful crisis management during the 2002 flooding of the rivers elbe and oder in eastern germany . but above all , berlin 's " no " to the us-led war in iraq was a significant reason for voters to stick with schroeder . this popular backing waned , however , with the social and labor market reforms which the government introduced in spring 2003 .
the spd in particular was held responsible for the cuts in germany 's social net .
the party lost a number of state elections , including its stronghold north rhine-westphalia .
in may 2005 , the last spd-green coalition government on a state level was voted out .
on the same day chancellor schroeder called for snap elections . 2005 : the first female chancellor the election in 2005 failed to produce a clear winner .
with the spd polling 34.2 and the cdu / csu bringing home 35.2 percent , neither party had a big enough mandate to create a coalition with their preferred partners .
after a three-week battle between gerhard schroeder and christian democrat party chief angela merkel for political supremacy , their two parties agreed to form a " grand coalition " together .
merkel came out on top as the first woman to become german chancellor .
she started off on a wave of popularity that continued to grow as she launched a tour of diplomacy to germany 's traditional allies , france , britain and the united states , and brokered a european union budget deal all within months of taking over the chancellery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinmeier have ruled together but would rather not afghanistan loomed large throughout the government 's tenure , with the partners steadfast in their insistence that german soldiers remain part of the nato-led mission to stabilize the country .
the grand coalition government was also marked by the global financial crisis .
in late 2008 taxpayers shelled out 100 billion euros for the bailout of a single bank , hypo real estate , as they saw their country lurch into recession . the government has hardly been challenged by the small opposition parties in the bundestag .
rather , the grand coalition has been its own worst enemy , and opinion polls rule out a continuation .
instead , angela merkel is likely to win another term as chancellor at the helm of a cdu / csu coalition with the free-market liberal fdp .
the social democrats and their candidate for chancellor , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , will probably end up back in the role of opposition for the first time in over a decade .

but the future is not looking as bright . on the tarmac of schönefeld airport , in the south of the city , it 's almost impossible to pick out an airplane not colored in either the dark blue of ryanair , the magenta of germanwings or easyjet 's garish orange . the three low-cost airlines are one of the major reasons schönefeld currently finds itself expanding from the smaller regional airport it once was to a serious hub .
on june 4 , germanwings announced the berlin airport was joining stuttgart and cologne / bonn as one of its main hubs .
a little over a month later , airport officials broke ground on a new 12 million euro -lrb- $ 14.4 million -rrb- terminal that aims to accommodate a passenger count that is already at 2.16 million for the first half of this year . the news is good for berlin city officials , who have been waging a legal battle to expand the airport to become berlin 's main hub by 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schönefeld should be berlin 's biggest airport by 2010 , when it will be re-named berlin brandenburg international .
" we can justify the expansion with the increasing passenger count , " berlin mayor klaus wowereit said at the groundbreaking . berlin number one in continental europe not just schönefeld , but the city 's tegel airport - where most major airlines land - and the storied tempelhof are attracting low-cost passengers at a record count .
of the 7.9 million passengers that passed through the three , 3.5 million were customers of low-cost airlines , said the fbs , the company responsibility for all three airports .
though the u.k. and ireland , birthplace of airlines like easyjet and ryanair , remains the undisputed leaders in the low-cost rankings , berlin is catching up . " berlin is the most important and biggest low-cost market in all of continental europe , " said fbs chief dieter johannsen-roth . german no-frills airlines like air berlin and germanwings have been steadily building passenger lists over the past few years .
this year air berlin , ryanair and easyjet alone ordered a total of 300 airplanes until 2012 .
national european airlines , by comparison , ordered only 30 machines , according to a study by corporate consultants mckinsey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germanwings is germany 's leading low-cost airline long-term doubts for no-frills carriers the good vibes and inflated expectations of the no-frills market , however , are not likely to last .
over the long term , only two or three airlines will be able to survive on the european market , according to the mckinsey study , and only if they cut costs or manage to distinguish themselves from other airlines . " the days in which low-cost airlines expanded largely unrivalled through market stimulation , are over , " wrote lucio pompeo , the author of the study . charter and national airlines have already begun ratcheting down their prices , forcing low-cost carriers to switch to traditional routes filled with more competitors .
at airports in cologne , brussels and dublin , some routes have already been cancelled . but the mood at schönefeld remains high .
germanwings chief joachim klein said he expects the airline to attract 1 million passengers to the airport this year .
in 2006 , the number should be 2 million . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de calls grow to tax airlines for pollution in germany , airlines enjoy generous government tax breaks while rail companies pay environmental and fuel taxes , even though they pollute less .

now , one german state is recognizing them as a national " minority . " rhineland-palatinate is the first state in germany to recognize as a national minority the roughly 8,000 romas and sintis who live there .
in 1997 , the federal government recognized the 50,000 danish in the north and the 60,000 sorbs who reside in the southeast as national minorities .
rhineland-palatinate 's premier , kurt beck , and the head of the state 's sintis and roma association , jacques delfeld , signed the agreement on monday .
" we want to send a signal with this agreement against the discrimination and for the rights of sinti and roma in our society , " beck said after the signing .

in rhineland-palatinate , the state will promote special support for sintis and romas in kindergartens , schools and colleges .
this measure is supposed to level the playing field for the two groups in the educational system .

the central committee says the procedure helps to propagate negative stereotypes .
the new agreement in rhineland-palatinate will prohibit police from mentioning the ethnic identity of sinti or roma when publishing criminal reports in the state .
the sinti and roma languages will also be promoted .
no national recognition - yet whether berlin will take up the matter and put the recognition of the two groups on the legislative agenda remains to be seen .
so far , the government describes the sinti and roma as an " ethnic group , " which allow them some special protection .
but the federal government has not yet taken the final step , saying that the sintis and romas do not meet one of the five criteria set up in the eu framework - namely that they do not have a permanent region they reside in .

but the future is not looking as bright . on the tarmac of schönefeld airport , in the south of the city , it 's almost impossible to pick out an airplane not colored in either the dark blue of ryanair , the magenta of germanwings or easyjet 's garish orange . the three low-cost airlines are one of the major reasons schönefeld currently finds itself expanding from the smaller regional airport it once was to a serious hub .
on june 4 , germanwings announced the berlin airport was joining stuttgart and cologne / bonn as one of its main hubs .
a little over a month later , airport officials broke ground on a new 12 million euro -lrb- $ 14.4 million -rrb- terminal that aims to accommodate a passenger count that is already at 2.16 million for the first half of this year . the news is good for berlin city officials , who have been waging a legal battle to expand the airport to become berlin 's main hub by 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schönefeld should be berlin 's biggest airport by 2010 , when it will be re-named berlin brandenburg international .
" we can justify the expansion with the increasing passenger count , " berlin mayor klaus wowereit said at the groundbreaking . berlin number one in continental europe not just schönefeld , but the city 's tegel airport - where most major airlines land - and the storied tempelhof are attracting low-cost passengers at a record count .
of the 7.9 million passengers that passed through the three , 3.5 million were customers of low-cost airlines , said the fbs , the company responsibility for all three airports .
though the u.k. and ireland , birthplace of airlines like easyjet and ryanair , remains the undisputed leaders in the low-cost rankings , berlin is catching up . " berlin is the most important and biggest low-cost market in all of continental europe , " said fbs chief dieter johannsen-roth . german no-frills airlines like air berlin and germanwings have been steadily building passenger lists over the past few years .
this year air berlin , ryanair and easyjet alone ordered a total of 300 airplanes until 2012 .
national european airlines , by comparison , ordered only 30 machines , according to a study by corporate consultants mckinsey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germanwings is germany 's leading low-cost airline long-term doubts for no-frills carriers the good vibes and inflated expectations of the no-frills market , however , are not likely to last .
over the long term , only two or three airlines will be able to survive on the european market , according to the mckinsey study , and only if they cut costs or manage to distinguish themselves from other airlines . " the days in which low-cost airlines expanded largely unrivalled through market stimulation , are over , " wrote lucio pompeo , the author of the study . charter and national airlines have already begun ratcheting down their prices , forcing low-cost carriers to switch to traditional routes filled with more competitors .
at airports in cologne , brussels and dublin , some routes have already been cancelled . but the mood at schönefeld remains high .
germanwings chief joachim klein said he expects the airline to attract 1 million passengers to the airport this year .
in 2006 , the number should be 2 million . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de calls grow to tax airlines for pollution in germany , airlines enjoy generous government tax breaks while rail companies pay environmental and fuel taxes , even though they pollute less .

today , the country can look back on a checkered history of bundestag elections since the german federal republic was founded in 1949 . west german citizens went to the polls in august 1949 .
it was the first time since the end of the weimar republic in 1933 that men and women could vote in a democratic election for a new parliament . the turnout was one many other countries could only dream of .
nearly 80 percent of eligible voters headed to the ballot boxes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad adenauer takes his oath of office on sept .
20 , 1949 from president erich koehler the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , got the best results , with 31 percent of the votes .
cdu chairman konrad adenauer was elected the nation 's first chancellor , based on a coalition of cdu / csu , free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the very conservative german party -lrb- dp -rrb- . the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who won 29.2 percent of the vote , began a 17-year period in the opposition . 1957 : " no experiments " adenauer 's policies were focused on consolidating germany 's market economy and integrating the country into the western camp .
a significant step toward this aim was germany 's entry into nato in 1955 . voters in the 1957 election confirmed the government , which had run on the slogan " no experiments . "
the cdu / csu won 50.2 percent of the votes .
it was the only time in german postwar history that a party could gain the absolute majority in parliament in federal elections . but 1957 also marked the beginning of the spd 's rise in support , which continued to 1972 . 1965 : the grand coalition the coalition partners cdu / csu and fdp won a significant victory in the 1965 federal elections .
but one year later , the partners could n't reach agreement on how to fill the impending budget gap .
the fdp resisted the union 's aimed tax increases and the coalition collapsed . this marked the beginning of a three-year grand coalition of cdu / csu and spd .
kurt-georg kiesinger -lrb- cdu -rrb- was elected chancellor .
spd chairman and former mayor of berlin willy brandt became his deputy and foreign minister . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : willy brandt 's push for relations with east germany led to his fall the 1969 elections forced the cdu / csu to retreat to the opposition for the first time in postwar german history .
the spd formed a coalition with the fdp and brandt became chancellor . 1972 : confirmation for brandt chancellor brandt emphasized domestic reforms but more importantly , he wanted to improve relations with eastern bloc countries and the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- . this controversial ostpolitik led to fierce domestic wrangling and almost to brandt 's fall in 1972 .
several mps from spd and fdp left their parties .
the cdu / csu felt its time had come and demanded a vote on a motion of no confidence . the attempt failed by an extremely narrow margin .
but the government no longer had the necessary majority in parliament .
the bundestag was dissolved and new elections were called in the fall of 1972 .
these gave the spd 45.8 percent of the vote , its best result on a federal level ever .
the spd / fdp coalition remained in power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut schmidt won a vote of no confidence in feb .
1982 but was later defeated by kohl brandt was forced to resign in 1974 following an espionage scandal .
he was replaced by his finance minister helmut schmidt , also a social democrat . 1983 : kohl comes to power although the cdu / csu faction was the strongest in parliament , the spd continued ruling with schmidt through a coalition with the fdp .
but following elections in 1980 , growing disputes with the fdp in tackling economic issues led several fdp ministers to leave schmidt 's cabinet in 1982 . schmidt attempted to continue with a minority spd-only government .
but he was forced to resign by a constructive vote of no confidence on oct .
1 , 1982 - the first in german history to be successful . the fdp joined the cdu / csu and elected helmut kohl as chancellor .
german voters confirmed this new coalition in early elections in 1983 , giving the cdu / csu 48.8 percent and the fdp 7 percent of the vote .
the spd only won 38.2 percent . in 1983 the environmentalist green party made it into parliament for the first time , winning 5.6 percent of the vote . bildunterschrift : west german chancellor helmut kohl ahead of a parliamentary vote of no confidence in december 1982 1990 : a unified german vote the first federal elections following german unification in 1990 gave the parliament a new face .
although the green party did n't make the five-percent hurdle necessary to hold seats in the bundestag , special rules for this first united german election allowed the greens ' eastern german partner buendnis 90 to have eight representatives . under these rules , the reform communist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- was also represented with 17 mps , although it had only won 2.4 percent of votes . the ruling cdu / csu saw a slight loss of votes , from 44.3 percent to 43.8 percent .
but it could continue its coalition with the fdp .
in the 1994 elections , this majority was even narrower .
the cdu / csu won just 41.4 percent of the vote . the greens , however , marched back into parliament with 7.3 percent of the vote in 1994 .
this result topped even the fdp , which dipped from 11 percent to 6.9 percent . 1998 : the beginning of spd-green power the federal elections in 1998 represented a true break in postwar german history .
for the first time ever , the change in government forced all parties of the old government into the opposition . after 16 years in power , helmut kohl had to step down .
the cdu / csu lost more than six percentage points in the election and only won 35.1 percent of the vote . " we ran to win this election and we lost , " said kohl at the time .
" it is quite clear that the social democrats won this election .
there is nothing to discuss about this result . " the spd won just under 41 percent of votes , its second best result since 1949 .
by then the greens had joined forces with the eastern buendnis 90 to become one party , with which the spd quickly formed a coalition , and social democrat gerhard schroeder was elected germany 's seventh chancellor .
bildunterschrift : after being confirmed chancellor on oct .
27 , 1998 , schroeder thanks his party colleagues , oskar lafontaine and rudolf scharping 2002 : the beginning of the end ? four years later , the comfortable spd / green majority considerably dipped , winning only a slight majority over cdu / csu and fdp in the 2002 elections .
the still positive outcome was partially attributed to the schroeder government 's successful crisis management during the 2002 flooding of the rivers elbe and oder in eastern germany . but above all , berlin 's " no " to the us-led war in iraq was a significant reason for voters to stick with schroeder . this popular backing waned , however , with the social and labor market reforms which the government introduced in spring 2003 .
the spd in particular was held responsible for the cuts in germany 's social net .
the party lost a number of state elections , including its stronghold north rhine-westphalia .
in may 2005 , the last spd-green coalition government on a state level was voted out .
on the same day chancellor schroeder called for snap elections . 2005 : the first female chancellor the election in 2005 failed to produce a clear winner .
with the spd polling 34.2 and the cdu / csu bringing home 35.2 percent , neither party had a big enough mandate to create a coalition with their preferred partners .
after a three-week battle between gerhard schroeder and christian democrat party chief angela merkel for political supremacy , their two parties agreed to form a " grand coalition " together .
merkel came out on top as the first woman to become german chancellor .
she started off on a wave of popularity that continued to grow as she launched a tour of diplomacy to germany 's traditional allies , france , britain and the united states , and brokered a european union budget deal all within months of taking over the chancellery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinmeier have ruled together but would rather not afghanistan loomed large throughout the government 's tenure , with the partners steadfast in their insistence that german soldiers remain part of the nato-led mission to stabilize the country .
the grand coalition government was also marked by the global financial crisis .
in late 2008 taxpayers shelled out 100 billion euros for the bailout of a single bank , hypo real estate , as they saw their country lurch into recession . the government has hardly been challenged by the small opposition parties in the bundestag .
rather , the grand coalition has been its own worst enemy , and opinion polls rule out a continuation .
instead , angela merkel is likely to win another term as chancellor at the helm of a cdu / csu coalition with the free-market liberal fdp .
the social democrats and their candidate for chancellor , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , will probably end up back in the role of opposition for the first time in over a decade .

the islamic radical had admitted to killing filmmaker theo van gogh last november , saying he acted out of faith . the three-judge panel of the amsterdam high-security court announced the life sentence against bouyeri for the murder which the prosecution said signaled the end of innocence for the tolerant netherlands .
to show just how severe the judges believe this reading is , they have order that bouyeri be present in court as the verdict was read out - something almost unheard of in the netherlands , where suspects are not obliged to attend the reading of the verdict and it is very rare that a court orders a suspect to attend .
suspect flouts court 's authority bouyeri , a 27-year old who holds dual dutch and moroccan nationality , has made it clear he does not recognize the authority of the court .
during the trial he ordered his attorney not to present a defense .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theo van gogh was gunned down in broad daylight the slaying of van gogh , carried out in broad daylight as he cycled to work , shocked the netherlands .
it stoked ethnic tensions and sparked a wave of reprisal attacks primarily directed at the muslim community here .
the filmmaker , a distant relative of 19th century painter vincent van gogh , was also an outspoken columnist who often criticized islam and multicultural society .
together with dutch lawmaker ayaan hirsi ali , he made a short film called " submission , " linking islam to the abuse of women and causing outrage in the dutch muslim community .
after van gogh 's murder , hirsi ali went into hiding for three months because a letter threatening her and other politicians was found on the filmmaker 's body .
end of the innocence " the netherlands has lost its innocence .
our country has suddenly become a target of international terrorism , " prosecutor frits van straelen said during the trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch member of parliament ayaan hirsi ali had to go underground after van gogh 's murder bouyeri was charged with the premeditated murder of van gogh , the attempted murder of several police officers and bystanders , illegal possession of firearms , obstructing the work of hirsi ali as a member of parliament and threatening her with a terrorist act .
a life sentence carries no possibility of parole in the netherlands , but convicts can be released after receiving a royal pardon .
whether bouyeri would like a pardon from the queen is another matter .
in a dramatic final speech to the court at the end of his trial two weeks ago , he said he wanted to receive the maximum punishment and warned that he would do the same again if he were freed .
" i do not want to miss the chance to get the maximum sentence ...
i can assure you that if i am ever freed , i will do exactly the same , " he told the court .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence towards muslims , here a muslim school in flames , broke out after van gogh 's murder although he gave some insight as to why he killed van gogh , the dutch are still struggling to understand how bouyeri - who was born and raised in amsterdam - turned into radical islam .
bouyeri himself refused to comment on his transformation .

cdu chairman konrad adenauer was elected the nation 's first chancellor , based on a coalition of cdu / csu , free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the very conservative german party -lrb- dp -rrb- . the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who won 29.2 percent of the vote , began a 17-year period in the opposition . 1957 : " no experiments " adenauer 's policies were focused on consolidating germany 's market economy and integrating the country into the western camp .
a significant step toward this aim was germany 's entry into nato in 1955 . voters in the 1957 election confirmed the government , which had run on the slogan " no experiments . "
the cdu / csu won 50.2 percent of the votes .
it was the only time in german postwar history that a party could gain the absolute majority in parliament in federal elections . but 1957 also marked the beginning of the spd 's rise in support , which continued to 1972 . 1965 : the grand coalition the coalition partners cdu / csu and fdp won a significant victory in the 1965 federal elections .
but one year later , the partners could n't reach agreement on how to fill the impending budget gap .
the fdp resisted the union 's aimed tax increases and the coalition collapsed . this marked the beginning of a three-year grand coalition of cdu / csu and spd .
kurt-georg kiesinger -lrb- cdu -rrb- was elected chancellor .
spd chairman and former mayor of berlin willy brandt became his deputy and foreign minister . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : willy brandt 's push for relations with east germany led to his fall the 1969 elections forced the cdu / csu to retreat to the opposition for the first time in postwar german history .
the spd formed a coalition with the fdp and brandt became chancellor . 1972 : confirmation for brandt chancellor brandt emphasized domestic reforms but more importantly , he wanted to improve relations with eastern bloc countries and the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- . this controversial ostpolitik led to fierce domestic wrangling and almost to brandt 's fall in 1972 .
several mps from spd and fdp left their parties .
the cdu / csu felt its time had come and demanded a vote on a motion of no confidence . the attempt failed by an extremely narrow margin .
but the government no longer had the necessary majority in parliament .
the bundestag was dissolved and new elections were called in the fall of 1972 .
these gave the spd 45.8 percent of the vote , its best result on a federal level ever .
the spd / fdp coalition remained in power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut schmidt won a vote of no confidence in feb .
1982 but was later defeated by kohl brandt was forced to resign in 1974 following an espionage scandal .
he was replaced by his finance minister helmut schmidt , also a social democrat . 1983 : kohl comes to power although the cdu / csu faction was the strongest in parliament , the spd continued ruling with schmidt through a coalition with the fdp .
but following elections in 1980 , growing disputes with the fdp in tackling economic issues led several fdp ministers to leave schmidt 's cabinet in 1982 . schmidt attempted to continue with a minority spd-only government .
but he was forced to resign by a constructive vote of no confidence on oct .
1 , 1982 - the first in german history to be successful . the fdp joined the cdu / csu and elected helmut kohl as chancellor .
german voters confirmed this new coalition in early elections in 1983 , giving the cdu / csu 48.8 percent and the fdp 7 percent of the vote .
the spd only won 38.2 percent . in 1983 the environmentalist green party made it into parliament for the first time , winning 5.6 percent of the vote . bildunterschrift : west german chancellor helmut kohl ahead of a parliamentary vote of no confidence in december 1982 1990 : a unified german vote the first federal elections following german unification in 1990 gave the parliament a new face .
although the green party did n't make the five-percent hurdle necessary to hold seats in the bundestag , special rules for this first united german election allowed the greens ' eastern german partner buendnis 90 to have eight representatives . under these rules , the reform communist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- was also represented with 17 mps , although it had only won 2.4 percent of votes . the ruling cdu / csu saw a slight loss of votes , from 44.3 percent to 43.8 percent .
but it could continue its coalition with the fdp .
in the 1994 elections , this majority was even narrower .
the cdu / csu won just 41.4 percent of the vote . the greens , however , marched back into parliament with 7.3 percent of the vote in 1994 .
this result topped even the fdp , which dipped from 11 percent to 6.9 percent . 1998 : the beginning of spd-green power the federal elections in 1998 represented a true break in postwar german history .
for the first time ever , the change in government forced all parties of the old government into the opposition . after 16 years in power , helmut kohl had to step down .
the cdu / csu lost more than six percentage points in the election and only won 35.1 percent of the vote . " we ran to win this election and we lost , " said kohl at the time .
" it is quite clear that the social democrats won this election .
there is nothing to discuss about this result . " the spd won just under 41 percent of votes , its second best result since 1949 .
by then the greens had joined forces with the eastern buendnis 90 to become one party , with which the spd quickly formed a coalition , and social democrat gerhard schroeder was elected germany 's seventh chancellor .
bildunterschrift : after being confirmed chancellor on oct .
27 , 1998 , schroeder thanks his party colleagues , oskar lafontaine and rudolf scharping 2002 : the beginning of the end ? four years later , the comfortable spd / green majority considerably dipped , winning only a slight majority over cdu / csu and fdp in the 2002 elections .
the still positive outcome was partially attributed to the schroeder government 's successful crisis management during the 2002 flooding of the rivers elbe and oder in eastern germany . but above all , berlin 's " no " to the us-led war in iraq was a significant reason for voters to stick with schroeder . this popular backing waned , however , with the social and labor market reforms which the government introduced in spring 2003 .
the spd in particular was held responsible for the cuts in germany 's social net .
the party lost a number of state elections , including its stronghold north rhine-westphalia .
in may 2005 , the last spd-green coalition government on a state level was voted out .
on the same day chancellor schroeder called for snap elections . 2005 : the first female chancellor the election in 2005 failed to produce a clear winner .
with the spd polling 34.2 and the cdu / csu bringing home 35.2 percent , neither party had a big enough mandate to create a coalition with their preferred partners .
after a three-week battle between gerhard schroeder and christian democrat party chief angela merkel for political supremacy , their two parties agreed to form a " grand coalition " together .
merkel came out on top as the first woman to become german chancellor .
she started off on a wave of popularity that continued to grow as she launched a tour of diplomacy to germany 's traditional allies , france , britain and the united states , and brokered a european union budget deal all within months of taking over the chancellery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinmeier have ruled together but would rather not afghanistan loomed large throughout the government 's tenure , with the partners steadfast in their insistence that german soldiers remain part of the nato-led mission to stabilize the country .
the grand coalition government was also marked by the global financial crisis .
in late 2008 taxpayers shelled out 100 billion euros for the bailout of a single bank , hypo real estate , as they saw their country lurch into recession . the government has hardly been challenged by the small opposition parties in the bundestag .
rather , the grand coalition has been its own worst enemy , and opinion polls rule out a continuation .
instead , angela merkel is likely to win another term as chancellor at the helm of a cdu / csu coalition with the free-market liberal fdp .
the social democrats and their candidate for chancellor , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , will probably end up back in the role of opposition for the first time in over a decade .

" this is a legal necessity for turkey .
we have to make our position clear , in written form , " the eu diplomat told reuters , saying the declaration would be issued " at an appropriate time " . cyprus became a member of the european union last year despite the failure of the un-brokered peace plan to reunite the divided mediterranean island , which turkish cypriots backed but greek cypriots vetoed . turkey and greece have been at loggerheads over cyprus since the former invaded the island in 1974 in response to a coup in nicosia engineered by greece 's then-ruling military junta .
turkey still has some 35,000 troops deployed in the north of the island . cyprus issue not a condition , eu says in the eu statement , the diplomat added that the bloc had not made it a condition for opening negotiations that ankara recognizes cyprus before the talks start .
he said the eu would have to consider the form and content of any political declaration turkey might make on the subject . turkey 's proposed accession is a disputed topic in some quarters of the eu despite the decision last month by the bloc 's 25 leaders which reaffirmed their decision to begin talks with the country , with the goal of membership .
poll shows widespread opposition a european commission survey published last week indicated 52 percent of eu citizens oppose turkish accession and only 35 percent support it .
the poll suggested 80 percent of austrians , 74 percent of germans and 70 percent of french were against admitting the mainly muslim nation of 70 million citizens . however , the turkish bid for membership continues despite the opposition , domestic problems with terrorism and a faltering democracy and human rights program .
in october last year , the european commission concluded that ankara had sufficiently met the eu 's criteria on democracy , human and minority rights and the rule of law to begin membership talks , despite protests from a number of european politicians to the contrary . turkey slowly ticking off eu conditions turkey was set a number of conditions to comply with before negotiations could begin , including several packages of legal reforms , which were introduced by ankara in april . the eu has said accession will take at least a decade and negotiations are an open-ended process whose outcome can not be guaranteed in advance . the 25-nation bloc must agree a negotiating mandate unanimously for talks to start .
the executive eu commission put forward a proposal in june , but cyprus and austria have sought amendments while france has reserved its position . erdogan to meet turkey bid supporter blair on the same day that the customs union protocol is signed , turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan will meet british prime minister tony blair , current holder of the rotating six-month eu presidency , in london .
britain has championed turkey 's bid , highlighting the strategic value of embracing a large muslim democracy and nato ally . wednesday 's blair-erdogan talks are expected to cover eu issues including cyprus and the customs protocol , as well as the fight against terrorism . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey resilient despite europe 's crisis turkey 's hopes of eu accession remain high despite the rejection of the eu constitution by france and the netherlands and a potential swing to the right in ankara 's key supporter germany .

" this is a legal necessity for turkey .
we have to make our position clear , in written form , " the eu diplomat told reuters , saying the declaration would be issued " at an appropriate time " . cyprus became a member of the european union last year despite the failure of the un-brokered peace plan to reunite the divided mediterranean island , which turkish cypriots backed but greek cypriots vetoed . turkey and greece have been at loggerheads over cyprus since the former invaded the island in 1974 in response to a coup in nicosia engineered by greece 's then-ruling military junta .
turkey still has some 35,000 troops deployed in the north of the island . cyprus issue not a condition , eu says in the eu statement , the diplomat added that the bloc had not made it a condition for opening negotiations that ankara recognizes cyprus before the talks start .
he said the eu would have to consider the form and content of any political declaration turkey might make on the subject . turkey 's proposed accession is a disputed topic in some quarters of the eu despite the decision last month by the bloc 's 25 leaders which reaffirmed their decision to begin talks with the country , with the goal of membership .
poll shows widespread opposition a european commission survey published last week indicated 52 percent of eu citizens oppose turkish accession and only 35 percent support it .
the poll suggested 80 percent of austrians , 74 percent of germans and 70 percent of french were against admitting the mainly muslim nation of 70 million citizens . however , the turkish bid for membership continues despite the opposition , domestic problems with terrorism and a faltering democracy and human rights program .
in october last year , the european commission concluded that ankara had sufficiently met the eu 's criteria on democracy , human and minority rights and the rule of law to begin membership talks , despite protests from a number of european politicians to the contrary . turkey slowly ticking off eu conditions turkey was set a number of conditions to comply with before negotiations could begin , including several packages of legal reforms , which were introduced by ankara in april . the eu has said accession will take at least a decade and negotiations are an open-ended process whose outcome can not be guaranteed in advance . the 25-nation bloc must agree a negotiating mandate unanimously for talks to start .
the executive eu commission put forward a proposal in june , but cyprus and austria have sought amendments while france has reserved its position . erdogan to meet turkey bid supporter blair on the same day that the customs union protocol is signed , turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan will meet british prime minister tony blair , current holder of the rotating six-month eu presidency , in london .
britain has championed turkey 's bid , highlighting the strategic value of embracing a large muslim democracy and nato ally . wednesday 's blair-erdogan talks are expected to cover eu issues including cyprus and the customs protocol , as well as the fight against terrorism . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey resilient despite europe 's crisis turkey 's hopes of eu accession remain high despite the rejection of the eu constitution by france and the netherlands and a potential swing to the right in ankara 's key supporter germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : election 2009 economic , environmental issues top election agenda poll : most germans expect angela merkel will continue as chancellor steinmeier defends plan to create 4 million jobs by 2020 german conservatives gear up for fall elections history -pipe- 26.07.2005 a history of germany 's postwar elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have gone to the polls at least every four years since 1949 in september , germans will elect a new parliament .
today , the country can look back on a checkered history of bundestag elections since the german federal republic was founded in 1949 . west german citizens went to the polls in august 1949 .
it was the first time since the end of the weimar republic in 1933 that men and women could vote in a democratic election for a new parliament . the turnout was one many other countries could only dream of .
nearly 80 percent of eligible voters headed to the ballot boxes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad adenauer takes his oath of office on sept .
20 , 1949 from president erich koehler the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , got the best results , with 31 percent of the votes .
cdu chairman konrad adenauer was elected the nation 's first chancellor , based on a coalition of cdu / csu , free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the very conservative german party -lrb- dp -rrb- . the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who won 29.2 percent of the vote , began a 17-year period in the opposition . 1957 : " no experiments " adenauer 's policies were focused on consolidating germany 's market economy and integrating the country into the western camp .
a significant step toward this aim was germany 's entry into nato in 1955 . voters in the 1957 election confirmed the government , which had run on the slogan " no experiments . "
the cdu / csu won 50.2 percent of the votes .
it was the only time in german postwar history that a party could gain the absolute majority in parliament in federal elections . but 1957 also marked the beginning of the spd 's rise in support , which continued to 1972 . 1965 : the grand coalition the coalition partners cdu / csu and fdp won a significant victory in the 1965 federal elections .
but one year later , the partners could n't reach agreement on how to fill the impending budget gap .
the fdp resisted the union 's aimed tax increases and the coalition collapsed . this marked the beginning of a three-year grand coalition of cdu / csu and spd .
kurt-georg kiesinger -lrb- cdu -rrb- was elected chancellor .
spd chairman and former mayor of berlin willy brandt became his deputy and foreign minister . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : willy brandt 's push for relations with east germany led to his fall the 1969 elections forced the cdu / csu to retreat to the opposition for the first time in postwar german history .
the spd formed a coalition with the fdp and brandt became chancellor . 1972 : confirmation for brandt chancellor brandt emphasized domestic reforms but more importantly , he wanted to improve relations with eastern bloc countries and the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- . this controversial ostpolitik led to fierce domestic wrangling and almost to brandt 's fall in 1972 .
several mps from spd and fdp left their parties .
the cdu / csu felt its time had come and demanded a vote on a motion of no confidence . the attempt failed by an extremely narrow margin .
but the government no longer had the necessary majority in parliament .
the bundestag was dissolved and new elections were called in the fall of 1972 .
these gave the spd 45.8 percent of the vote , its best result on a federal level ever .
the spd / fdp coalition remained in power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut schmidt won a vote of no confidence in feb .
1982 but was later defeated by kohl brandt was forced to resign in 1974 following an espionage scandal .
he was replaced by his finance minister helmut schmidt , also a social democrat . 1983 : kohl comes to power although the cdu / csu faction was the strongest in parliament , the spd continued ruling with schmidt through a coalition with the fdp .
but following elections in 1980 , growing disputes with the fdp in tackling economic issues led several fdp ministers to leave schmidt 's cabinet in 1982 . schmidt attempted to continue with a minority spd-only government .
but he was forced to resign by a constructive vote of no confidence on oct .
1 , 1982 - the first in german history to be successful . the fdp joined the cdu / csu and elected helmut kohl as chancellor .
german voters confirmed this new coalition in early elections in 1983 , giving the cdu / csu 48.8 percent and the fdp 7 percent of the vote .
the spd only won 38.2 percent . in 1983 the environmentalist green party made it into parliament for the first time , winning 5.6 percent of the vote . bildunterschrift : west german chancellor helmut kohl ahead of a parliamentary vote of no confidence in december 1982 1990 : a unified german vote the first federal elections following german unification in 1990 gave the parliament a new face .
although the green party did n't make the five-percent hurdle necessary to hold seats in the bundestag , special rules for this first united german election allowed the greens ' eastern german partner buendnis 90 to have eight representatives . under these rules , the reform communist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- was also represented with 17 mps , although it had only won 2.4 percent of votes . the ruling cdu / csu saw a slight loss of votes , from 44.3 percent to 43.8 percent .
but it could continue its coalition with the fdp .
in the 1994 elections , this majority was even narrower .
the cdu / csu won just 41.4 percent of the vote . the greens , however , marched back into parliament with 7.3 percent of the vote in 1994 .
this result topped even the fdp , which dipped from 11 percent to 6.9 percent . 1998 : the beginning of spd-green power the federal elections in 1998 represented a true break in postwar german history .
for the first time ever , the change in government forced all parties of the old government into the opposition . after 16 years in power , helmut kohl had to step down .
the cdu / csu lost more than six percentage points in the election and only won 35.1 percent of the vote . " we ran to win this election and we lost , " said kohl at the time .
" it is quite clear that the social democrats won this election .
there is nothing to discuss about this result . " the spd won just under 41 percent of votes , its second best result since 1949 .
by then the greens had joined forces with the eastern buendnis 90 to become one party , with which the spd quickly formed a coalition , and social democrat gerhard schroeder was elected germany 's seventh chancellor .
bildunterschrift : after being confirmed chancellor on oct .
27 , 1998 , schroeder thanks his party colleagues , oskar lafontaine and rudolf scharping 2002 : the beginning of the end ? four years later , the comfortable spd / green majority considerably dipped , winning only a slight majority over cdu / csu and fdp in the 2002 elections .
the still positive outcome was partially attributed to the schroeder government 's successful crisis management during the 2002 flooding of the rivers elbe and oder in eastern germany . but above all , berlin 's " no " to the us-led war in iraq was a significant reason for voters to stick with schroeder . this popular backing waned , however , with the social and labor market reforms which the government introduced in spring 2003 .
the spd in particular was held responsible for the cuts in germany 's social net .
the party lost a number of state elections , including its stronghold north rhine-westphalia .
in may 2005 , the last spd-green coalition government on a state level was voted out .
on the same day chancellor schroeder called for snap elections . 2005 : the first female chancellor the election in 2005 failed to produce a clear winner .
with the spd polling 34.2 and the cdu / csu bringing home 35.2 percent , neither party had a big enough mandate to create a coalition with their preferred partners .
after a three-week battle between gerhard schroeder and christian democrat party chief angela merkel for political supremacy , their two parties agreed to form a " grand coalition " together .
merkel came out on top as the first woman to become german chancellor .
she started off on a wave of popularity that continued to grow as she launched a tour of diplomacy to germany 's traditional allies , france , britain and the united states , and brokered a european union budget deal all within months of taking over the chancellery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinmeier have ruled together but would rather not afghanistan loomed large throughout the government 's tenure , with the partners steadfast in their insistence that german soldiers remain part of the nato-led mission to stabilize the country .
the grand coalition government was also marked by the global financial crisis .
in late 2008 taxpayers shelled out 100 billion euros for the bailout of a single bank , hypo real estate , as they saw their country lurch into recession . the government has hardly been challenged by the small opposition parties in the bundestag .
rather , the grand coalition has been its own worst enemy , and opinion polls rule out a continuation .
instead , angela merkel is likely to win another term as chancellor at the helm of a cdu / csu coalition with the free-market liberal fdp .
the social democrats and their candidate for chancellor , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , will probably end up back in the role of opposition for the first time in over a decade .

the big difference between martin , steffen and six other schoolmates is their origin - they have come from leipzig , germany to show off their scientific skills at america 's largest science fair .
and it is n't martin 's first time at the tsa .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steffen and martin from leipzig 's wilhelm-ostwald-gymnasium in chicago the school they attend , the wilhelm ostwald gymnasium -lrb- wog -rrb- in leipzig in the state of saxony , is not just any run-of-the-mill high school that any student goes to after finishing primary education .
the selection criteria are daunting , the pupils only the best .
unusual for german schools , where despite the three-tiered system with the gymnasium , or university prep school , at the top , educators place a lot of value on egalitarianism .

education for top kids at top speed is not the norm in germany , something heink can not understand .
" highlighting particularly good achievements by students , other than in sports , seems to have a ' seedy ' reputation in germany , " said the principal .
" i can not comprehend that , since i was raised with a different attitude towards achievement . "
achievement counts once a pupil is admitted , there is nothing normal about it .
on the school 's web site , a list of the winners and participants at various competitions is presented .

fifth-graders may be thrown into deep water when they enter wog , but they almost all can swim .
but wog is the exception .
of the 14 schools for " gifted " students that existed in the gdr in 1989 , only the leipzig school retained its concentrated program of math and science .

the university revolt of the 1960s which swept across west germany resulted in watered-down , less-strict educational standards .
that revolt never hit the gdr .
now people wonder if something can be learned from it .
an expert for programs for bright students , elke kaiser from the bavarian state institute for school quality and educational research , says more could be done to help the gifted .
in bavaria , only four schools in three cities have elite educational programs .
if a parent ’ s extremely bright child does n't live in or near munich , nuremberg or würzburg , which in germany 's geographically largest state is quite possible , then the smart tike can visit only a " normal " gymnasium .
kaiser feels more must be done outside of the big cities .
a variety of factors are involved .
money is one of the ´ most important - but so is envy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in a university lecture hall in tübingen : it 's never too early to visit college " if a class of eight gifted students were split off from the rest of the school , " she explained , " some parents get upset , wondering why their child isn ’ t amongst the smartest .
and then you 'll hear complaints that too much money is being spent on just a few pupils . "
brain drain there is also fear that after investing great time and money in someone with great potential , they might go to another country to study - like the us - and then possibly stay .
it 's something 18-year-old florian kraft from wog would consider .
he says german equivalents to the tsa , like " jugend forscht " -lrb- " youth does research " -rrb- , are n't respected by universities and companies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : albert einstein , probably germany 's greatest physicist " what a high school student does at ' jugend forscht ' doesn ’ t get any recognition , " kraft said .
" if i go to an american university and say ' i won this , this and this at tsa ' the response from the university is ' hello , when would you like to check in ' ? "
and this is one reason why kraft doesn ’ t participate in " jugend forscht . "
but he 's been at tsa four times .
back in leipzig , kraft feels at home at wog .
with only 500 students - other leipzig schools have easily over 1,000 - the school is small and everyone knows just about everyone else , both students and teachers alike .
to kraft , it 's family .
that family may have just been born at the right time and in the right place .
the berlin wall fell , and the east germans were reveling in the joys of freedom .
the west germans could provide money .

" this is a legal necessity for turkey .
we have to make our position clear , in written form , " the eu diplomat told reuters , saying the declaration would be issued " at an appropriate time " . cyprus became a member of the european union last year despite the failure of the un-brokered peace plan to reunite the divided mediterranean island , which turkish cypriots backed but greek cypriots vetoed . turkey and greece have been at loggerheads over cyprus since the former invaded the island in 1974 in response to a coup in nicosia engineered by greece 's then-ruling military junta .
turkey still has some 35,000 troops deployed in the north of the island . cyprus issue not a condition , eu says in the eu statement , the diplomat added that the bloc had not made it a condition for opening negotiations that ankara recognizes cyprus before the talks start .
he said the eu would have to consider the form and content of any political declaration turkey might make on the subject . turkey 's proposed accession is a disputed topic in some quarters of the eu despite the decision last month by the bloc 's 25 leaders which reaffirmed their decision to begin talks with the country , with the goal of membership .
poll shows widespread opposition a european commission survey published last week indicated 52 percent of eu citizens oppose turkish accession and only 35 percent support it .
the poll suggested 80 percent of austrians , 74 percent of germans and 70 percent of french were against admitting the mainly muslim nation of 70 million citizens . however , the turkish bid for membership continues despite the opposition , domestic problems with terrorism and a faltering democracy and human rights program .
in october last year , the european commission concluded that ankara had sufficiently met the eu 's criteria on democracy , human and minority rights and the rule of law to begin membership talks , despite protests from a number of european politicians to the contrary . turkey slowly ticking off eu conditions turkey was set a number of conditions to comply with before negotiations could begin , including several packages of legal reforms , which were introduced by ankara in april . the eu has said accession will take at least a decade and negotiations are an open-ended process whose outcome can not be guaranteed in advance . the 25-nation bloc must agree a negotiating mandate unanimously for talks to start .
the executive eu commission put forward a proposal in june , but cyprus and austria have sought amendments while france has reserved its position . erdogan to meet turkey bid supporter blair on the same day that the customs union protocol is signed , turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan will meet british prime minister tony blair , current holder of the rotating six-month eu presidency , in london .
britain has championed turkey 's bid , highlighting the strategic value of embracing a large muslim democracy and nato ally . wednesday 's blair-erdogan talks are expected to cover eu issues including cyprus and the customs protocol , as well as the fight against terrorism . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey resilient despite europe 's crisis turkey 's hopes of eu accession remain high despite the rejection of the eu constitution by france and the netherlands and a potential swing to the right in ankara 's key supporter germany .

celebrities from the world over are walking the red carpet at the bayreuth festival .
but how do mere mortals get their hands on a coveted ticket ? the new production by swiss director christoph marthaler of " tristan and isolde " opened the 94th richard wagner festival in bayreuth .
until august 28 , some 60,000 people will have the opportunity to hear works from the master performed in the festival hall he designed himself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " tristan und isolde " those who actually managed to get tickets can count themselves extremely lucky , since they 've been sold out for quite some time now .
the demand outpaced supply this year by a factor of 10 , as usual . " unfortunately , visitors have to count on a waiting time for tickets from between eight and ten years , " said peter emmerich , spokesman for the festival . black-market boom opera lovers who either ca n't or do n't want to wait that long basically have two choices : they can work their connections , if they have any , or turn to the black market .
while the connection option is a desired one , most people who want a ticket often have to try the other road . everything these days is available on the internet and festival tickets are no exception .
but most online prices range from 310 to 1,200 euros -lrb- $ 373 to $ 1,446 -rrb- .
the us ticket seller , ticket-finder.com , is honest about the price it 's asking for a ticket to tristan ii , up to $ 2,717 : " the price is arrived at taking into consideration the costs for the ticket , taxes and the great demand for a limited supply .
that means the price can increase by up to 500 percent . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel , chancellor candidate of the christian democratic union , cdu , waves to spectators as she arrives for the opening of the wagner opera festival in bayreuth , southern germany , monday , july 25 , 2005 .
those prices are astronomical , especially when one considers that the most expensive ticket at the official outlets costs 192 euros .
this price is arrived at due to the fact that the state provides subsidies for the tickets and the organization committee .
the purpose of these public monies is to make the festival affordable for the average person . little action taken the organizers of the festival are aware of the black market problem , but they have hardly any legal room to take action against the high prices and rampant reselling .
random inspections of tickets at the entrance to performances are carried out sometimes to check that the buyer is the one using the ticket for entry to a performance , but buyers face no real consequences - despite rumors to the contrary . " the highest priority in bayreuth is and will remain the comfort and enjoyment of the festival by our visitors .
that means tickets are transferable , " said emmerich . festival fans who want legitimate , and affordable , tickets have a rocky road ahead of them : get an order form from the festival ticket office , fill it out and start hoping . " we take great pains to be fair in the distribution of tickets .
we take into consideration how long someone has been on the waiting list , " said emmerich .
" the longer the wait , the greater the chance there is of getting a ticket . " parting is such sweet sorrow exceptions , of course , prove the rule .
festival veterans report that there is actually a chance to get affordable tickets at the festival itself .
the secret is to go to the official tickets outlets and ask about tickets that have been handed back in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's possible to score this way , but lady luck has to be on your side , or you have to count on the misfortune and fairness of other wagner fans who might have waited years to get the precious tickets , but for some reason could n't use them , and handed them back in .
others choose the internet auction route .
" i was so happy , " wrote mercedes200869 , who auctioned two tickets on ebay .
" but my boyfriend ca n't come with me , my best friend is on vacation and another one ca n't come for sure because of her child .
i did n't want to go alone to an experience like this , which you do n't get offered that often in life .
especially not alone .
so after long consideration , i decided to part with my two tickets .

to show just how severe the judges believe this reading is , they have order that bouyeri be present in court as the verdict was read out - something almost unheard of in the netherlands , where suspects are not obliged to attend the reading of the verdict and it is very rare that a court orders a suspect to attend .

the islamic radical had admitted to killing filmmaker theo van gogh last november , saying he acted out of faith . the three-judge panel of the amsterdam high-security court announced the life sentence against bouyeri for the murder which the prosecution said signaled the end of innocence for the tolerant netherlands .
to show just how severe the judges believe this reading is , they have order that bouyeri be present in court as the verdict was read out - something almost unheard of in the netherlands , where suspects are not obliged to attend the reading of the verdict and it is very rare that a court orders a suspect to attend .
suspect flouts court 's authority bouyeri , a 27-year old who holds dual dutch and moroccan nationality , has made it clear he does not recognize the authority of the court .
during the trial he ordered his attorney not to present a defense .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theo van gogh was gunned down in broad daylight the slaying of van gogh , carried out in broad daylight as he cycled to work , shocked the netherlands .
it stoked ethnic tensions and sparked a wave of reprisal attacks primarily directed at the muslim community here .
the filmmaker , a distant relative of 19th century painter vincent van gogh , was also an outspoken columnist who often criticized islam and multicultural society .
together with dutch lawmaker ayaan hirsi ali , he made a short film called " submission , " linking islam to the abuse of women and causing outrage in the dutch muslim community .
after van gogh 's murder , hirsi ali went into hiding for three months because a letter threatening her and other politicians was found on the filmmaker 's body .
end of the innocence " the netherlands has lost its innocence .
our country has suddenly become a target of international terrorism , " prosecutor frits van straelen said during the trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch member of parliament ayaan hirsi ali had to go underground after van gogh 's murder bouyeri was charged with the premeditated murder of van gogh , the attempted murder of several police officers and bystanders , illegal possession of firearms , obstructing the work of hirsi ali as a member of parliament and threatening her with a terrorist act .
a life sentence carries no possibility of parole in the netherlands , but convicts can be released after receiving a royal pardon .
whether bouyeri would like a pardon from the queen is another matter .
in a dramatic final speech to the court at the end of his trial two weeks ago , he said he wanted to receive the maximum punishment and warned that he would do the same again if he were freed .
" i do not want to miss the chance to get the maximum sentence ...
i can assure you that if i am ever freed , i will do exactly the same , " he told the court .

british police 's shoot-to-kill policy led on friday to the death of an innocent brazilian .
scotland yard expressed regret but justified the policy .
german laws are much more nebulous . the police officer who killed 27-year-old jean charles de menezes received full support from scotland yard .
metropolitan police commissioner ian blair called the shooting tragic , but the national shoot-to-kill policy necessary . when the issue of a shoot-to-kill policy comes up in germany , most police officers find themselves in legal limbo .
until terrorism became a viable , ubiquitous threat , it had only arisen in cases of hostage takings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a member of the arab commando group which seized members of the israeli olympic team at their quarters at the munich olympic village september 5 , 1972 appears with a hood over his face on the balcony of the village building where the commandos held several members of the israeli team hostage bavaria became the first german state to allow the practice , which it authorized the year after terrorists killed 11 israeli athletes at the 1972 olympic games in munich .
currently 12 of germany 's 16 states permit police officers to kill suspects in order to save the lives of innocent people but only as a last resort . responsibility rests alone on the officer but lawmakers in some states have been wary about creating legislation that puts a top-ranking police commissioner in position to hand down a potential death sentence . as a result , several states , including berlin , allow police officers themselves to decide which action to take ; their superiors may not order them to kill a suspected terrorist or hostage-taker . the policy is not without its critics .
police union representatives say that the measure might not pass legal muster , even in dangerous situations . " i have my doubts if a shoot-to-kill policy , a preventative shooting , is legal in germany , " bernhard witthaut , deputy chief the german police union gdp , told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper . others say a shoot-to-kill policy is necessary not just in hostage-taking situations , but beyond . " if a hostage 's life can be saved by a deadly shot , why ca n't those of numerous passengers in an underground train ? "
wilfried albishausen , deputy head of the german association of detectives told the süddeutsche . scarce resources a more pressing issue but at the moment , the debate in germany is focusing more on police capabilities and resources .

in 1997 , the federal government recognized the 50,000 danish in the north and the 60,000 sorbs who reside in the southeast as national minorities .
rhineland-palatinate 's premier , kurt beck , and the head of the state 's sintis and roma association , jacques delfeld , signed the agreement on monday .

now , one german state is recognizing them as a national " minority . " rhineland-palatinate is the first state in germany to recognize as a national minority the roughly 8,000 romas and sintis who live there .
in 1997 , the federal government recognized the 50,000 danish in the north and the 60,000 sorbs who reside in the southeast as national minorities .
rhineland-palatinate 's premier , kurt beck , and the head of the state 's sintis and roma association , jacques delfeld , signed the agreement on monday .
" we want to send a signal with this agreement against the discrimination and for the rights of sinti and roma in our society , " beck said after the signing .
protection of minorities recognition of european minorities on a continent-wide basis dates back only to the eu 's framework agreement , passed in the 1990s .
germany ratified it in 1997 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roma frequently live in poverty in europe with it come certain responsibilities towards minorities .
in rhineland-palatinate , the state will promote special support for sintis and romas in kindergartens , schools and colleges .
this measure is supposed to level the playing field for the two groups in the educational system .
stereotypes perpetuated the central committee of german sintis and romas , in heidelberg , has been demanding for over a decade that an end be brought to what it believes to be discriminatory reporting against the people it represents .
this comes primarily in the form of arrest warrants and reports .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romani rose , head of the german sinti and roma organization , in front of a collection of signatures seeking recognition of the fact that they were also persecuted by the nazis police sometimes include the terms " sinti , " " roma " or even " gypsy " in their reports , which are frequently published in the media .
the central committee says the procedure helps to propagate negative stereotypes .
the new agreement in rhineland-palatinate will prohibit police from mentioning the ethnic identity of sinti or roma when publishing criminal reports in the state .
the sinti and roma languages will also be promoted .
no national recognition - yet whether berlin will take up the matter and put the recognition of the two groups on the legislative agenda remains to be seen .
so far , the government describes the sinti and roma as an " ethnic group , " which allow them some special protection .
but the federal government has not yet taken the final step , saying that the sintis and romas do not meet one of the five criteria set up in the eu framework - namely that they do not have a permanent region they reside in .
over 500,000 sintis and romas were killed by the nazis in the 1930s and 1940s .

today , the country can look back on a checkered history of bundestag elections since the german federal republic was founded in 1949 . west german citizens went to the polls in august 1949 .
it was the first time since the end of the weimar republic in 1933 that men and women could vote in a democratic election for a new parliament . the turnout was one many other countries could only dream of .
nearly 80 percent of eligible voters headed to the ballot boxes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad adenauer takes his oath of office on sept .
20 , 1949 from president erich koehler the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , got the best results , with 31 percent of the votes .
cdu chairman konrad adenauer was elected the nation 's first chancellor , based on a coalition of cdu / csu , free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the very conservative german party -lrb- dp -rrb- . the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who won 29.2 percent of the vote , began a 17-year period in the opposition . 1957 : " no experiments " adenauer 's policies were focused on consolidating germany 's market economy and integrating the country into the western camp .
a significant step toward this aim was germany 's entry into nato in 1955 . voters in the 1957 election confirmed the government , which had run on the slogan " no experiments . "
the cdu / csu won 50.2 percent of the votes .
it was the only time in german postwar history that a party could gain the absolute majority in parliament in federal elections . but 1957 also marked the beginning of the spd 's rise in support , which continued to 1972 . 1965 : the grand coalition the coalition partners cdu / csu and fdp won a significant victory in the 1965 federal elections .
but one year later , the partners could n't reach agreement on how to fill the impending budget gap .
the fdp resisted the union 's aimed tax increases and the coalition collapsed . this marked the beginning of a three-year grand coalition of cdu / csu and spd .
kurt-georg kiesinger -lrb- cdu -rrb- was elected chancellor .
spd chairman and former mayor of berlin willy brandt became his deputy and foreign minister . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : willy brandt 's push for relations with east germany led to his fall the 1969 elections forced the cdu / csu to retreat to the opposition for the first time in postwar german history .
the spd formed a coalition with the fdp and brandt became chancellor . 1972 : confirmation for brandt chancellor brandt emphasized domestic reforms but more importantly , he wanted to improve relations with eastern bloc countries and the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- . this controversial ostpolitik led to fierce domestic wrangling and almost to brandt 's fall in 1972 .
several mps from spd and fdp left their parties .
the cdu / csu felt its time had come and demanded a vote on a motion of no confidence . the attempt failed by an extremely narrow margin .
but the government no longer had the necessary majority in parliament .
the bundestag was dissolved and new elections were called in the fall of 1972 .
these gave the spd 45.8 percent of the vote , its best result on a federal level ever .
the spd / fdp coalition remained in power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut schmidt won a vote of no confidence in feb .
1982 but was later defeated by kohl brandt was forced to resign in 1974 following an espionage scandal .
he was replaced by his finance minister helmut schmidt , also a social democrat . 1983 : kohl comes to power although the cdu / csu faction was the strongest in parliament , the spd continued ruling with schmidt through a coalition with the fdp .
but following elections in 1980 , growing disputes with the fdp in tackling economic issues led several fdp ministers to leave schmidt 's cabinet in 1982 . schmidt attempted to continue with a minority spd-only government .
but he was forced to resign by a constructive vote of no confidence on oct .
1 , 1982 - the first in german history to be successful . the fdp joined the cdu / csu and elected helmut kohl as chancellor .
german voters confirmed this new coalition in early elections in 1983 , giving the cdu / csu 48.8 percent and the fdp 7 percent of the vote .
the spd only won 38.2 percent . in 1983 the environmentalist green party made it into parliament for the first time , winning 5.6 percent of the vote . bildunterschrift : west german chancellor helmut kohl ahead of a parliamentary vote of no confidence in december 1982 1990 : a unified german vote the first federal elections following german unification in 1990 gave the parliament a new face .
although the green party did n't make the five-percent hurdle necessary to hold seats in the bundestag , special rules for this first united german election allowed the greens ' eastern german partner buendnis 90 to have eight representatives . under these rules , the reform communist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- was also represented with 17 mps , although it had only won 2.4 percent of votes . the ruling cdu / csu saw a slight loss of votes , from 44.3 percent to 43.8 percent .
but it could continue its coalition with the fdp .
in the 1994 elections , this majority was even narrower .
the cdu / csu won just 41.4 percent of the vote . the greens , however , marched back into parliament with 7.3 percent of the vote in 1994 .
this result topped even the fdp , which dipped from 11 percent to 6.9 percent . 1998 : the beginning of spd-green power the federal elections in 1998 represented a true break in postwar german history .
for the first time ever , the change in government forced all parties of the old government into the opposition . after 16 years in power , helmut kohl had to step down .
the cdu / csu lost more than six percentage points in the election and only won 35.1 percent of the vote . " we ran to win this election and we lost , " said kohl at the time .
" it is quite clear that the social democrats won this election .
there is nothing to discuss about this result . " the spd won just under 41 percent of votes , its second best result since 1949 .
by then the greens had joined forces with the eastern buendnis 90 to become one party , with which the spd quickly formed a coalition , and social democrat gerhard schroeder was elected germany 's seventh chancellor .
bildunterschrift : after being confirmed chancellor on oct .
27 , 1998 , schroeder thanks his party colleagues , oskar lafontaine and rudolf scharping 2002 : the beginning of the end ? four years later , the comfortable spd / green majority considerably dipped , winning only a slight majority over cdu / csu and fdp in the 2002 elections .
the still positive outcome was partially attributed to the schroeder government 's successful crisis management during the 2002 flooding of the rivers elbe and oder in eastern germany . but above all , berlin 's " no " to the us-led war in iraq was a significant reason for voters to stick with schroeder . this popular backing waned , however , with the social and labor market reforms which the government introduced in spring 2003 .
the spd in particular was held responsible for the cuts in germany 's social net .
the party lost a number of state elections , including its stronghold north rhine-westphalia .
in may 2005 , the last spd-green coalition government on a state level was voted out .
on the same day chancellor schroeder called for snap elections . 2005 : the first female chancellor the election in 2005 failed to produce a clear winner .
with the spd polling 34.2 and the cdu / csu bringing home 35.2 percent , neither party had a big enough mandate to create a coalition with their preferred partners .
after a three-week battle between gerhard schroeder and christian democrat party chief angela merkel for political supremacy , their two parties agreed to form a " grand coalition " together .
merkel came out on top as the first woman to become german chancellor .
she started off on a wave of popularity that continued to grow as she launched a tour of diplomacy to germany 's traditional allies , france , britain and the united states , and brokered a european union budget deal all within months of taking over the chancellery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinmeier have ruled together but would rather not afghanistan loomed large throughout the government 's tenure , with the partners steadfast in their insistence that german soldiers remain part of the nato-led mission to stabilize the country .
the grand coalition government was also marked by the global financial crisis .
in late 2008 taxpayers shelled out 100 billion euros for the bailout of a single bank , hypo real estate , as they saw their country lurch into recession . the government has hardly been challenged by the small opposition parties in the bundestag .
rather , the grand coalition has been its own worst enemy , and opinion polls rule out a continuation .
instead , angela merkel is likely to win another term as chancellor at the helm of a cdu / csu coalition with the free-market liberal fdp .
the social democrats and their candidate for chancellor , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , will probably end up back in the role of opposition for the first time in over a decade .

but the future is not looking as bright . on the tarmac of schönefeld airport , in the south of the city , it 's almost impossible to pick out an airplane not colored in either the dark blue of ryanair , the magenta of germanwings or easyjet 's garish orange . the three low-cost airlines are one of the major reasons schönefeld currently finds itself expanding from the smaller regional airport it once was to a serious hub .
on june 4 , germanwings announced the berlin airport was joining stuttgart and cologne / bonn as one of its main hubs .
a little over a month later , airport officials broke ground on a new 12 million euro -lrb- $ 14.4 million -rrb- terminal that aims to accommodate a passenger count that is already at 2.16 million for the first half of this year . the news is good for berlin city officials , who have been waging a legal battle to expand the airport to become berlin 's main hub by 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schönefeld should be berlin 's biggest airport by 2010 , when it will be re-named berlin brandenburg international .
" we can justify the expansion with the increasing passenger count , " berlin mayor klaus wowereit said at the groundbreaking . berlin number one in continental europe not just schönefeld , but the city 's tegel airport - where most major airlines land - and the storied tempelhof are attracting low-cost passengers at a record count .
of the 7.9 million passengers that passed through the three , 3.5 million were customers of low-cost airlines , said the fbs , the company responsibility for all three airports .
though the u.k. and ireland , birthplace of airlines like easyjet and ryanair , remains the undisputed leaders in the low-cost rankings , berlin is catching up . " berlin is the most important and biggest low-cost market in all of continental europe , " said fbs chief dieter johannsen-roth . german no-frills airlines like air berlin and germanwings have been steadily building passenger lists over the past few years .
this year air berlin , ryanair and easyjet alone ordered a total of 300 airplanes until 2012 .
national european airlines , by comparison , ordered only 30 machines , according to a study by corporate consultants mckinsey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germanwings is germany 's leading low-cost airline long-term doubts for no-frills carriers the good vibes and inflated expectations of the no-frills market , however , are not likely to last .
over the long term , only two or three airlines will be able to survive on the european market , according to the mckinsey study , and only if they cut costs or manage to distinguish themselves from other airlines . " the days in which low-cost airlines expanded largely unrivalled through market stimulation , are over , " wrote lucio pompeo , the author of the study . charter and national airlines have already begun ratcheting down their prices , forcing low-cost carriers to switch to traditional routes filled with more competitors .
at airports in cologne , brussels and dublin , some routes have already been cancelled . but the mood at schönefeld remains high .
germanwings chief joachim klein said he expects the airline to attract 1 million passengers to the airport this year .
in 2006 , the number should be 2 million . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de calls grow to tax airlines for pollution in germany , airlines enjoy generous government tax breaks while rail companies pay environmental and fuel taxes , even though they pollute less .

the new agreement in rhineland-palatinate will prohibit police from mentioning the ethnic identity of sinti or roma when publishing criminal reports in the state .
the sinti and roma languages will also be promoted .
no national recognition - yet whether berlin will take up the matter and put the recognition of the two groups on the legislative agenda remains to be seen .
so far , the government describes the sinti and roma as an " ethnic group , " which allow them some special protection .
but the federal government has not yet taken the final step , saying that the sintis and romas do not meet one of the five criteria set up in the eu framework - namely that they do not have a permanent region they reside in .
over 500,000 sintis and romas were killed by the nazis in the 1930s and 1940s .

today , the country can look back on a checkered history of bundestag elections since the german federal republic was founded in 1949 . west german citizens went to the polls in august 1949 .
it was the first time since the end of the weimar republic in 1933 that men and women could vote in a democratic election for a new parliament . the turnout was one many other countries could only dream of .
nearly 80 percent of eligible voters headed to the ballot boxes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad adenauer takes his oath of office on sept .
20 , 1949 from president erich koehler the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , got the best results , with 31 percent of the votes .
cdu chairman konrad adenauer was elected the nation 's first chancellor , based on a coalition of cdu / csu , free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the very conservative german party -lrb- dp -rrb- . the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who won 29.2 percent of the vote , began a 17-year period in the opposition . 1957 : " no experiments " adenauer 's policies were focused on consolidating germany 's market economy and integrating the country into the western camp .
a significant step toward this aim was germany 's entry into nato in 1955 . voters in the 1957 election confirmed the government , which had run on the slogan " no experiments . "
the cdu / csu won 50.2 percent of the votes .
it was the only time in german postwar history that a party could gain the absolute majority in parliament in federal elections . but 1957 also marked the beginning of the spd 's rise in support , which continued to 1972 . 1965 : the grand coalition the coalition partners cdu / csu and fdp won a significant victory in the 1965 federal elections .
but one year later , the partners could n't reach agreement on how to fill the impending budget gap .
the fdp resisted the union 's aimed tax increases and the coalition collapsed . this marked the beginning of a three-year grand coalition of cdu / csu and spd .
kurt-georg kiesinger -lrb- cdu -rrb- was elected chancellor .
spd chairman and former mayor of berlin willy brandt became his deputy and foreign minister . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : willy brandt 's push for relations with east germany led to his fall the 1969 elections forced the cdu / csu to retreat to the opposition for the first time in postwar german history .
the spd formed a coalition with the fdp and brandt became chancellor . 1972 : confirmation for brandt chancellor brandt emphasized domestic reforms but more importantly , he wanted to improve relations with eastern bloc countries and the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- . this controversial ostpolitik led to fierce domestic wrangling and almost to brandt 's fall in 1972 .
several mps from spd and fdp left their parties .
the cdu / csu felt its time had come and demanded a vote on a motion of no confidence . the attempt failed by an extremely narrow margin .
but the government no longer had the necessary majority in parliament .
the bundestag was dissolved and new elections were called in the fall of 1972 .
these gave the spd 45.8 percent of the vote , its best result on a federal level ever .
the spd / fdp coalition remained in power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut schmidt won a vote of no confidence in feb .
1982 but was later defeated by kohl brandt was forced to resign in 1974 following an espionage scandal .
he was replaced by his finance minister helmut schmidt , also a social democrat . 1983 : kohl comes to power although the cdu / csu faction was the strongest in parliament , the spd continued ruling with schmidt through a coalition with the fdp .
but following elections in 1980 , growing disputes with the fdp in tackling economic issues led several fdp ministers to leave schmidt 's cabinet in 1982 . schmidt attempted to continue with a minority spd-only government .
but he was forced to resign by a constructive vote of no confidence on oct .
1 , 1982 - the first in german history to be successful . the fdp joined the cdu / csu and elected helmut kohl as chancellor .
german voters confirmed this new coalition in early elections in 1983 , giving the cdu / csu 48.8 percent and the fdp 7 percent of the vote .
the spd only won 38.2 percent . in 1983 the environmentalist green party made it into parliament for the first time , winning 5.6 percent of the vote . bildunterschrift : west german chancellor helmut kohl ahead of a parliamentary vote of no confidence in december 1982 1990 : a unified german vote the first federal elections following german unification in 1990 gave the parliament a new face .
although the green party did n't make the five-percent hurdle necessary to hold seats in the bundestag , special rules for this first united german election allowed the greens ' eastern german partner buendnis 90 to have eight representatives . under these rules , the reform communist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- was also represented with 17 mps , although it had only won 2.4 percent of votes . the ruling cdu / csu saw a slight loss of votes , from 44.3 percent to 43.8 percent .
but it could continue its coalition with the fdp .
in the 1994 elections , this majority was even narrower .
the cdu / csu won just 41.4 percent of the vote . the greens , however , marched back into parliament with 7.3 percent of the vote in 1994 .
this result topped even the fdp , which dipped from 11 percent to 6.9 percent . 1998 : the beginning of spd-green power the federal elections in 1998 represented a true break in postwar german history .
for the first time ever , the change in government forced all parties of the old government into the opposition . after 16 years in power , helmut kohl had to step down .
the cdu / csu lost more than six percentage points in the election and only won 35.1 percent of the vote . " we ran to win this election and we lost , " said kohl at the time .
" it is quite clear that the social democrats won this election .
there is nothing to discuss about this result . " the spd won just under 41 percent of votes , its second best result since 1949 .
by then the greens had joined forces with the eastern buendnis 90 to become one party , with which the spd quickly formed a coalition , and social democrat gerhard schroeder was elected germany 's seventh chancellor .
bildunterschrift : after being confirmed chancellor on oct .
27 , 1998 , schroeder thanks his party colleagues , oskar lafontaine and rudolf scharping 2002 : the beginning of the end ? four years later , the comfortable spd / green majority considerably dipped , winning only a slight majority over cdu / csu and fdp in the 2002 elections .
the still positive outcome was partially attributed to the schroeder government 's successful crisis management during the 2002 flooding of the rivers elbe and oder in eastern germany . but above all , berlin 's " no " to the us-led war in iraq was a significant reason for voters to stick with schroeder . this popular backing waned , however , with the social and labor market reforms which the government introduced in spring 2003 .
the spd in particular was held responsible for the cuts in germany 's social net .
the party lost a number of state elections , including its stronghold north rhine-westphalia .
in may 2005 , the last spd-green coalition government on a state level was voted out .
on the same day chancellor schroeder called for snap elections . 2005 : the first female chancellor the election in 2005 failed to produce a clear winner .
with the spd polling 34.2 and the cdu / csu bringing home 35.2 percent , neither party had a big enough mandate to create a coalition with their preferred partners .
after a three-week battle between gerhard schroeder and christian democrat party chief angela merkel for political supremacy , their two parties agreed to form a " grand coalition " together .
merkel came out on top as the first woman to become german chancellor .
she started off on a wave of popularity that continued to grow as she launched a tour of diplomacy to germany 's traditional allies , france , britain and the united states , and brokered a european union budget deal all within months of taking over the chancellery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinmeier have ruled together but would rather not afghanistan loomed large throughout the government 's tenure , with the partners steadfast in their insistence that german soldiers remain part of the nato-led mission to stabilize the country .
the grand coalition government was also marked by the global financial crisis .
in late 2008 taxpayers shelled out 100 billion euros for the bailout of a single bank , hypo real estate , as they saw their country lurch into recession . the government has hardly been challenged by the small opposition parties in the bundestag .
rather , the grand coalition has been its own worst enemy , and opinion polls rule out a continuation .
instead , angela merkel is likely to win another term as chancellor at the helm of a cdu / csu coalition with the free-market liberal fdp .
the social democrats and their candidate for chancellor , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , will probably end up back in the role of opposition for the first time in over a decade .

today , the country can look back on a checkered history of bundestag elections since the german federal republic was founded in 1949 . west german citizens went to the polls in august 1949 .
it was the first time since the end of the weimar republic in 1933 that men and women could vote in a democratic election for a new parliament . the turnout was one many other countries could only dream of .
nearly 80 percent of eligible voters headed to the ballot boxes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad adenauer takes his oath of office on sept .
20 , 1949 from president erich koehler the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , got the best results , with 31 percent of the votes .
cdu chairman konrad adenauer was elected the nation 's first chancellor , based on a coalition of cdu / csu , free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the very conservative german party -lrb- dp -rrb- . the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who won 29.2 percent of the vote , began a 17-year period in the opposition . 1957 : " no experiments " adenauer 's policies were focused on consolidating germany 's market economy and integrating the country into the western camp .
a significant step toward this aim was germany 's entry into nato in 1955 . voters in the 1957 election confirmed the government , which had run on the slogan " no experiments . "
the cdu / csu won 50.2 percent of the votes .
it was the only time in german postwar history that a party could gain the absolute majority in parliament in federal elections . but 1957 also marked the beginning of the spd 's rise in support , which continued to 1972 . 1965 : the grand coalition the coalition partners cdu / csu and fdp won a significant victory in the 1965 federal elections .
but one year later , the partners could n't reach agreement on how to fill the impending budget gap .
the fdp resisted the union 's aimed tax increases and the coalition collapsed . this marked the beginning of a three-year grand coalition of cdu / csu and spd .
kurt-georg kiesinger -lrb- cdu -rrb- was elected chancellor .
spd chairman and former mayor of berlin willy brandt became his deputy and foreign minister . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : willy brandt 's push for relations with east germany led to his fall the 1969 elections forced the cdu / csu to retreat to the opposition for the first time in postwar german history .
the spd formed a coalition with the fdp and brandt became chancellor . 1972 : confirmation for brandt chancellor brandt emphasized domestic reforms but more importantly , he wanted to improve relations with eastern bloc countries and the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- . this controversial ostpolitik led to fierce domestic wrangling and almost to brandt 's fall in 1972 .
several mps from spd and fdp left their parties .
the cdu / csu felt its time had come and demanded a vote on a motion of no confidence . the attempt failed by an extremely narrow margin .
but the government no longer had the necessary majority in parliament .
the bundestag was dissolved and new elections were called in the fall of 1972 .
these gave the spd 45.8 percent of the vote , its best result on a federal level ever .
the spd / fdp coalition remained in power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut schmidt won a vote of no confidence in feb .
1982 but was later defeated by kohl brandt was forced to resign in 1974 following an espionage scandal .
he was replaced by his finance minister helmut schmidt , also a social democrat . 1983 : kohl comes to power although the cdu / csu faction was the strongest in parliament , the spd continued ruling with schmidt through a coalition with the fdp .
but following elections in 1980 , growing disputes with the fdp in tackling economic issues led several fdp ministers to leave schmidt 's cabinet in 1982 . schmidt attempted to continue with a minority spd-only government .
but he was forced to resign by a constructive vote of no confidence on oct .
1 , 1982 - the first in german history to be successful . the fdp joined the cdu / csu and elected helmut kohl as chancellor .
german voters confirmed this new coalition in early elections in 1983 , giving the cdu / csu 48.8 percent and the fdp 7 percent of the vote .
the spd only won 38.2 percent . in 1983 the environmentalist green party made it into parliament for the first time , winning 5.6 percent of the vote . bildunterschrift : west german chancellor helmut kohl ahead of a parliamentary vote of no confidence in december 1982 1990 : a unified german vote the first federal elections following german unification in 1990 gave the parliament a new face .
although the green party did n't make the five-percent hurdle necessary to hold seats in the bundestag , special rules for this first united german election allowed the greens ' eastern german partner buendnis 90 to have eight representatives . under these rules , the reform communist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- was also represented with 17 mps , although it had only won 2.4 percent of votes . the ruling cdu / csu saw a slight loss of votes , from 44.3 percent to 43.8 percent .
but it could continue its coalition with the fdp .
in the 1994 elections , this majority was even narrower .
the cdu / csu won just 41.4 percent of the vote . the greens , however , marched back into parliament with 7.3 percent of the vote in 1994 .
this result topped even the fdp , which dipped from 11 percent to 6.9 percent . 1998 : the beginning of spd-green power the federal elections in 1998 represented a true break in postwar german history .
for the first time ever , the change in government forced all parties of the old government into the opposition . after 16 years in power , helmut kohl had to step down .
the cdu / csu lost more than six percentage points in the election and only won 35.1 percent of the vote . " we ran to win this election and we lost , " said kohl at the time .
" it is quite clear that the social democrats won this election .
there is nothing to discuss about this result . " the spd won just under 41 percent of votes , its second best result since 1949 .
by then the greens had joined forces with the eastern buendnis 90 to become one party , with which the spd quickly formed a coalition , and social democrat gerhard schroeder was elected germany 's seventh chancellor .
bildunterschrift : after being confirmed chancellor on oct .
27 , 1998 , schroeder thanks his party colleagues , oskar lafontaine and rudolf scharping 2002 : the beginning of the end ? four years later , the comfortable spd / green majority considerably dipped , winning only a slight majority over cdu / csu and fdp in the 2002 elections .
the still positive outcome was partially attributed to the schroeder government 's successful crisis management during the 2002 flooding of the rivers elbe and oder in eastern germany . but above all , berlin 's " no " to the us-led war in iraq was a significant reason for voters to stick with schroeder . this popular backing waned , however , with the social and labor market reforms which the government introduced in spring 2003 .
the spd in particular was held responsible for the cuts in germany 's social net .
the party lost a number of state elections , including its stronghold north rhine-westphalia .
in may 2005 , the last spd-green coalition government on a state level was voted out .
on the same day chancellor schroeder called for snap elections . 2005 : the first female chancellor the election in 2005 failed to produce a clear winner .
with the spd polling 34.2 and the cdu / csu bringing home 35.2 percent , neither party had a big enough mandate to create a coalition with their preferred partners .
after a three-week battle between gerhard schroeder and christian democrat party chief angela merkel for political supremacy , their two parties agreed to form a " grand coalition " together .
merkel came out on top as the first woman to become german chancellor .
she started off on a wave of popularity that continued to grow as she launched a tour of diplomacy to germany 's traditional allies , france , britain and the united states , and brokered a european union budget deal all within months of taking over the chancellery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinmeier have ruled together but would rather not afghanistan loomed large throughout the government 's tenure , with the partners steadfast in their insistence that german soldiers remain part of the nato-led mission to stabilize the country .
the grand coalition government was also marked by the global financial crisis .
in late 2008 taxpayers shelled out 100 billion euros for the bailout of a single bank , hypo real estate , as they saw their country lurch into recession . the government has hardly been challenged by the small opposition parties in the bundestag .
rather , the grand coalition has been its own worst enemy , and opinion polls rule out a continuation .
instead , angela merkel is likely to win another term as chancellor at the helm of a cdu / csu coalition with the free-market liberal fdp .
the social democrats and their candidate for chancellor , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , will probably end up back in the role of opposition for the first time in over a decade .

1982 but was later defeated by kohl brandt was forced to resign in 1974 following an espionage scandal .
he was replaced by his finance minister helmut schmidt , also a social democrat . 1983 : kohl comes to power although the cdu / csu faction was the strongest in parliament , the spd continued ruling with schmidt through a coalition with the fdp .
but following elections in 1980 , growing disputes with the fdp in tackling economic issues led several fdp ministers to leave schmidt 's cabinet in 1982 . schmidt attempted to continue with a minority spd-only government .
but he was forced to resign by a constructive vote of no confidence on oct .
1 , 1982 - the first in german history to be successful . the fdp joined the cdu / csu and elected helmut kohl as chancellor .
german voters confirmed this new coalition in early elections in 1983 , giving the cdu / csu 48.8 percent and the fdp 7 percent of the vote .
the spd only won 38.2 percent . in 1983 the environmentalist green party made it into parliament for the first time , winning 5.6 percent of the vote . bildunterschrift : west german chancellor helmut kohl ahead of a parliamentary vote of no confidence in december 1982 1990 : a unified german vote the first federal elections following german unification in 1990 gave the parliament a new face .
although the green party did n't make the five-percent hurdle necessary to hold seats in the bundestag , special rules for this first united german election allowed the greens ' eastern german partner buendnis 90 to have eight representatives . under these rules , the reform communist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- was also represented with 17 mps , although it had only won 2.4 percent of votes . the ruling cdu / csu saw a slight loss of votes , from 44.3 percent to 43.8 percent .
but it could continue its coalition with the fdp .
in the 1994 elections , this majority was even narrower .
the cdu / csu won just 41.4 percent of the vote . the greens , however , marched back into parliament with 7.3 percent of the vote in 1994 .
this result topped even the fdp , which dipped from 11 percent to 6.9 percent . 1998 : the beginning of spd-green power the federal elections in 1998 represented a true break in postwar german history .
for the first time ever , the change in government forced all parties of the old government into the opposition . after 16 years in power , helmut kohl had to step down .
the cdu / csu lost more than six percentage points in the election and only won 35.1 percent of the vote . " we ran to win this election and we lost , " said kohl at the time .
" it is quite clear that the social democrats won this election .
there is nothing to discuss about this result . " the spd won just under 41 percent of votes , its second best result since 1949 .
by then the greens had joined forces with the eastern buendnis 90 to become one party , with which the spd quickly formed a coalition , and social democrat gerhard schroeder was elected germany 's seventh chancellor .
bildunterschrift : after being confirmed chancellor on oct .
27 , 1998 , schroeder thanks his party colleagues , oskar lafontaine and rudolf scharping 2002 : the beginning of the end ? four years later , the comfortable spd / green majority considerably dipped , winning only a slight majority over cdu / csu and fdp in the 2002 elections .
the still positive outcome was partially attributed to the schroeder government 's successful crisis management during the 2002 flooding of the rivers elbe and oder in eastern germany . but above all , berlin 's " no " to the us-led war in iraq was a significant reason for voters to stick with schroeder . this popular backing waned , however , with the social and labor market reforms which the government introduced in spring 2003 .
the spd in particular was held responsible for the cuts in germany 's social net .
the party lost a number of state elections , including its stronghold north rhine-westphalia .
in may 2005 , the last spd-green coalition government on a state level was voted out .
on the same day chancellor schroeder called for snap elections . 2005 : the first female chancellor the election in 2005 failed to produce a clear winner .
with the spd polling 34.2 and the cdu / csu bringing home 35.2 percent , neither party had a big enough mandate to create a coalition with their preferred partners .
after a three-week battle between gerhard schroeder and christian democrat party chief angela merkel for political supremacy , their two parties agreed to form a " grand coalition " together .
merkel came out on top as the first woman to become german chancellor .
she started off on a wave of popularity that continued to grow as she launched a tour of diplomacy to germany 's traditional allies , france , britain and the united states , and brokered a european union budget deal all within months of taking over the chancellery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinmeier have ruled together but would rather not afghanistan loomed large throughout the government 's tenure , with the partners steadfast in their insistence that german soldiers remain part of the nato-led mission to stabilize the country .
the grand coalition government was also marked by the global financial crisis .
in late 2008 taxpayers shelled out 100 billion euros for the bailout of a single bank , hypo real estate , as they saw their country lurch into recession . the government has hardly been challenged by the small opposition parties in the bundestag .
rather , the grand coalition has been its own worst enemy , and opinion polls rule out a continuation .
instead , angela merkel is likely to win another term as chancellor at the helm of a cdu / csu coalition with the free-market liberal fdp .
the social democrats and their candidate for chancellor , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , will probably end up back in the role of opposition for the first time in over a decade .

the fees for day care centers will be gradually phased out .
the three-year parental -lrb- not exclusively intended for the mother -rrb- leave will remain untouched - and will include a job guarantee after and the possibility of part-time work .
the spd has declared that it wants to increase the number of working women to more than 60 percent in keeping with european directives . cdu / csu the union 's party platform talks of a targeted promotion of highly-gifted and talented children and teenagers , but it does n't outline any concrete plans about how it intends to do that .
the bloc has said it wants to introduce a per-child bonus and an additional tax benefit that would encourage people to have more children without suffering financial strain .
the party is against the introduction of a state-run " ethics class " and instead want to hold on to a church-led religion class .
in addition , it guarantees that employees who take care of a child or need to nurse to a close relative , will have the right to part-time work . the greens the greens say that children -lrb- also those under three years of age -rrb- will have a right to a spot in a high-quality day center .
the government will participate in the financing of day care centers .
the greens are against the existing form of the " ehegattensplittung " or a special tax category which benefits married couples . in addition , same-sex couples will be allowed to marry and have the right to adopt children .
even the status of unmarried partnerships will be improved .
the party wants to implement a law on genetic testing in order to prevent discrimination on the basis of genetic makeup . fdp the fdp wants half-day care for pre-school children above the age of three to be free for parents .
it wants to introduce an education coupon or a " per head bonus pay " for kindergartens rather than promote kindergartens at large as a whole entity .
the fdp rejects a child bonus concept as suggested by the union , but is in favor of a tax-free sum of 7,700 euros for every worker , his or her partner and every child . the left party the newly-formed left party wants to increase per child the state allowance from 150 to 250 euros per month without balancing it out against unemployment and social handouts .
the party wants free spots in kindergartens for all children - though without explaining how that would be financed .
every family be guaranteed at least 60 percent of the average family income in germany , which means that a family with two children will have an income of at least 1,900 euros per month - again there 's no mention of the financing .

today , the country is faced with some of the lowest education standards in europe .
what can be done to improve the situation ? spd the spd wants spending on research and development to increase to three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- by 2010 - a third of which will be financed by the government , two thirds by industry .
it is in favor of introducing nation-wide education standards in day care centers .
the spd , which has initiated a full day school program -lrb- in germany , schools usually run till noon -rrb- , wants to give the federal states an additional four million euros to set up 10,000 more full day schools in the country . university studies will continue to be free , but only for the first degree - a plan designed to reduce the number of years many german students spend before entering the workforce .
the bafög or financial support for students from the government , will remain untouched and will be converted into a complete student loan . cdu / csu starting 2010 , the union aims to invest three percent of gdp yearly in research and development .
in addition to the already agreed so-called " initiative for excellence " - that means in addition to the 1.9 billion euros meant to promote top study courses and so-called elite universities - a further one billion euros will flow into research and development .
that will be financed by reducing subsidies elsewhere .
the universities will be allowed to impose tuition fees . the greens the greens want to raise spending on research and development to three percent of gdp by 2010 .
the party wants to introduce a free pre-school year to better prepare all children for school entry .
the greens want to abolish the three-tier school system , which streamlines kids from an early age , and focus on full day schools instead .
in the future , educators will be trained at technical colleges .
the party favors a low-interest study credit and a state-promoted " bildungssparen " - loans that are only meant to be used to finance studies .
the first university degree will be free of cost and the bafög will be improved upon .
young scientists will be entitled to flexible wage agreements . fdp the fdp aims to focus on pre-school education .
it plans on introducing nation-wide education standards for day care centers .
their quality will be guaranteed through a system of certifications .
preparing young children for school will also include conducting language tests .
the fdp also wants to reduce the age at which children enter schools to five from the current six .
educators , or at least heads of day care centers , will be trained at technical colleges -lrb- instead of the current structure which requires no higher education for day-care instructors -rrb- , thereby improving the quality of instruction . the party is in favor of tuition fees and for more autonomy and competition between different universities . the left party the newly-formed left party wants to increase spending on education and research to six percent of gdp .
the three-tier school system will be abolished , instead students will go to a common school until the 10th grade .
university education will be free of cost .
the party wants to introduce a system , whereby companies who do n't offer traineeships for young people will have to pay a penalty . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de educating germany from berlin to bonn , educators , politicians and parents have recognized they must start doing their part to improve schools .
the consequences of failure are imminent : poorly educated students are a burden to the economy while the best and brightest leave for opportunities abroad .
tuition fees face uphill battle in germany with conservatives gaining ground in german politics , the idea of free university education appears to be a thing of the past .
but , the idea of tuition fees and even study loans remains anathema to many students .

the spd has declared that it wants to increase the number of working women to more than 60 percent in keeping with european directives . cdu / csu the union 's party platform talks of a targeted promotion of highly-gifted and talented children and teenagers , but it does n't outline any concrete plans about how it intends to do that .
the bloc has said it wants to introduce a per-child bonus and an additional tax benefit that would encourage people to have more children without suffering financial strain .
the party is against the introduction of a state-run " ethics class " and instead want to hold on to a church-led religion class .
in addition , it guarantees that employees who take care of a child or need to nurse to a close relative , will have the right to part-time work . the greens the greens say that children -lrb- also those under three years of age -rrb- will have a right to a spot in a high-quality day center .

it wants to introduce an education coupon or a " per head bonus pay " for kindergartens rather than promote kindergartens at large as a whole entity .

every family be guaranteed at least 60 percent of the average family income in germany , which means that a family with two children will have an income of at least 1,900 euros per month - again there 's no mention of the financing .

it is in favor of introducing nation-wide education standards in day care centers .

the bafög or financial support for students from the government , will remain untouched and will be converted into a complete student loan . cdu / csu starting 2010 , the union aims to invest three percent of gdp yearly in research and development .

now , one german state is recognizing them as a national " minority . " rhineland-palatinate is the first state in germany to recognize as a national minority the roughly 8,000 romas and sintis who live there .
in 1997 , the federal government recognized the 50,000 danish in the north and the 60,000 sorbs who reside in the southeast as national minorities .
rhineland-palatinate 's premier , kurt beck , and the head of the state 's sintis and roma association , jacques delfeld , signed the agreement on monday .
" we want to send a signal with this agreement against the discrimination and for the rights of sinti and roma in our society , " beck said after the signing .
protection of minorities recognition of european minorities on a continent-wide basis dates back only to the eu 's framework agreement , passed in the 1990s .
germany ratified it in 1997 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roma frequently live in poverty in europe with it come certain responsibilities towards minorities .
in rhineland-palatinate , the state will promote special support for sintis and romas in kindergartens , schools and colleges .
this measure is supposed to level the playing field for the two groups in the educational system .
stereotypes perpetuated the central committee of german sintis and romas , in heidelberg , has been demanding for over a decade that an end be brought to what it believes to be discriminatory reporting against the people it represents .
this comes primarily in the form of arrest warrants and reports .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romani rose , head of the german sinti and roma organization , in front of a collection of signatures seeking recognition of the fact that they were also persecuted by the nazis police sometimes include the terms " sinti , " " roma " or even " gypsy " in their reports , which are frequently published in the media .
the central committee says the procedure helps to propagate negative stereotypes .
the new agreement in rhineland-palatinate will prohibit police from mentioning the ethnic identity of sinti or roma when publishing criminal reports in the state .
the sinti and roma languages will also be promoted .
no national recognition - yet whether berlin will take up the matter and put the recognition of the two groups on the legislative agenda remains to be seen .
so far , the government describes the sinti and roma as an " ethnic group , " which allow them some special protection .
but the federal government has not yet taken the final step , saying that the sintis and romas do not meet one of the five criteria set up in the eu framework - namely that they do not have a permanent region they reside in .
over 500,000 sintis and romas were killed by the nazis in the 1930s and 1940s .
countries around europe still systematically persecute and discriminate against the ethnic group that many do not understand . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de efforts to integrate gypsies gather speed ambitious plans are afoot in central and eastern europe to integrate gypsies , or sinti and roma - one of the continent 's largest ethnic minorities - into mainstream society within a decade .

the islamic radical had admitted to killing filmmaker theo van gogh last november , saying he acted out of faith . the three-judge panel of the amsterdam high-security court announced the life sentence against bouyeri for the murder which the prosecution said signaled the end of innocence for the tolerant netherlands .
to show just how severe the judges believe this reading is , they have order that bouyeri be present in court as the verdict was read out - something almost unheard of in the netherlands , where suspects are not obliged to attend the reading of the verdict and it is very rare that a court orders a suspect to attend .
suspect flouts court 's authority bouyeri , a 27-year old who holds dual dutch and moroccan nationality , has made it clear he does not recognize the authority of the court .
during the trial he ordered his attorney not to present a defense .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theo van gogh was gunned down in broad daylight the slaying of van gogh , carried out in broad daylight as he cycled to work , shocked the netherlands .
it stoked ethnic tensions and sparked a wave of reprisal attacks primarily directed at the muslim community here .
the filmmaker , a distant relative of 19th century painter vincent van gogh , was also an outspoken columnist who often criticized islam and multicultural society .
together with dutch lawmaker ayaan hirsi ali , he made a short film called " submission , " linking islam to the abuse of women and causing outrage in the dutch muslim community .
after van gogh 's murder , hirsi ali went into hiding for three months because a letter threatening her and other politicians was found on the filmmaker 's body .
end of the innocence " the netherlands has lost its innocence .
our country has suddenly become a target of international terrorism , " prosecutor frits van straelen said during the trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch member of parliament ayaan hirsi ali had to go underground after van gogh 's murder bouyeri was charged with the premeditated murder of van gogh , the attempted murder of several police officers and bystanders , illegal possession of firearms , obstructing the work of hirsi ali as a member of parliament and threatening her with a terrorist act .
a life sentence carries no possibility of parole in the netherlands , but convicts can be released after receiving a royal pardon .
whether bouyeri would like a pardon from the queen is another matter .
in a dramatic final speech to the court at the end of his trial two weeks ago , he said he wanted to receive the maximum punishment and warned that he would do the same again if he were freed .
" i do not want to miss the chance to get the maximum sentence ...
i can assure you that if i am ever freed , i will do exactly the same , " he told the court .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence towards muslims , here a muslim school in flames , broke out after van gogh 's murder although he gave some insight as to why he killed van gogh , the dutch are still struggling to understand how bouyeri - who was born and raised in amsterdam - turned into radical islam .
bouyeri himself refused to comment on his transformation .
" you can set all your psychologists , psychiatrists and experts on me , but i tell you , you will never understand .
you ca n't , " he taunted the court . dw staff / afp -lrb- jdk , ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when freedom gets the death sentence the murder of a turkish woman and the applauding of the crime by some students have left berlin shaken and officials pushing for ethics class .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : educating germany germans mull sweeping education reforms germany to introduce federal school standards bad grades for german schools report lambastes german schools germany -pipe- 26.07.2005 east german school outshines competitors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when class becomes too dull , a demanding school is needed east germany discarded the socialist rule that all of its citizens were equal when it came to select schools .
only one such school remains .
could germany learn from it ? at the 27th technology students association -lrb- tsa -rrb- annual conference in chicago , illinois , the 10th graders martin and steffen do not stick out much more than the 3,500 middle and high school students who made the journey from around the usa .
the big difference between martin , steffen and six other schoolmates is their origin - they have come from leipzig , germany to show off their scientific skills at america 's largest science fair .
and it is n't martin 's first time at the tsa .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steffen and martin from leipzig 's wilhelm-ostwald-gymnasium in chicago the school they attend , the wilhelm ostwald gymnasium -lrb- wog -rrb- in leipzig in the state of saxony , is not just any run-of-the-mill high school that any student goes to after finishing primary education .
the selection criteria are daunting , the pupils only the best .
unusual for german schools , where despite the three-tiered system with the gymnasium , or university prep school , at the top , educators place a lot of value on egalitarianism .
' seediness ' of success wog , founded in 1985 , just four years before communist east germany collapsed , may have a short tradition , but it was deeply-rooted in the gdr 's system of promoting the best .
its niche was the advancement of math and natural sciences , and still possibly would be if erich honecker or egon krenz still ruled .
brigitte heink has been at the school either as a teacher or principal since 1986 .
after the fall of the berlin wall , the east german schools was transformed to mirror the west german system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin 's car entry built with lego blocks she was convinced that the school should remain dedicated to the natural sciences and took over the helm as principal in 1992 .

now people wonder if something can be learned from it .
an expert for programs for bright students , elke kaiser from the bavarian state institute for school quality and educational research , says more could be done to help the gifted .
in bavaria , only four schools in three cities have elite educational programs .
if a parent ’ s extremely bright child does n't live in or near munich , nuremberg or würzburg , which in germany 's geographically largest state is quite possible , then the smart tike can visit only a " normal " gymnasium .
kaiser feels more must be done outside of the big cities .
a variety of factors are involved .
money is one of the ´ most important - but so is envy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in a university lecture hall in tübingen : it 's never too early to visit college " if a class of eight gifted students were split off from the rest of the school , " she explained , " some parents get upset , wondering why their child isn ’ t amongst the smartest .
and then you 'll hear complaints that too much money is being spent on just a few pupils . "
brain drain there is also fear that after investing great time and money in someone with great potential , they might go to another country to study - like the us - and then possibly stay .
it 's something 18-year-old florian kraft from wog would consider .
he says german equivalents to the tsa , like " jugend forscht " -lrb- " youth does research " -rrb- , are n't respected by universities and companies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : albert einstein , probably germany 's greatest physicist " what a high school student does at ' jugend forscht ' doesn ’ t get any recognition , " kraft said .
" if i go to an american university and say ' i won this , this and this at tsa ' the response from the university is ' hello , when would you like to check in ' ? "
and this is one reason why kraft doesn ’ t participate in " jugend forscht . "
but he 's been at tsa four times .
back in leipzig , kraft feels at home at wog .
with only 500 students - other leipzig schools have easily over 1,000 - the school is small and everyone knows just about everyone else , both students and teachers alike .
to kraft , it 's family .
that family may have just been born at the right time and in the right place .
the berlin wall fell , and the east germans were reveling in the joys of freedom .
the west germans could provide money .
but now the morose financial situation of the german government may make the creation of a wog anywhere else an unachievable goal - at least in the public school system .
and martin , steffen , florian and their classmates can continue to travel to scholastic competitions around europe and the world - after receiving financial support from private and corporate sponsors . john kluempers , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the dumbing down of germany a german politician was roundly criticized recently for commenting that only the " wrong people " were having children in germany .
but he was giving voice to an uncomfortable truth about the country ’ s demographic shift .
-lrb- april 21 , 2005 -rrb- educating the elite in a recent survey of international universities , germany barely made it into the top 50 .
but for all the sting of the slap , this showing could fuel government plans to create a more elite educational system .

celebrities from the world over are walking the red carpet at the bayreuth festival .
but how do mere mortals get their hands on a coveted ticket ? the new production by swiss director christoph marthaler of " tristan and isolde " opened the 94th richard wagner festival in bayreuth .
until august 28 , some 60,000 people will have the opportunity to hear works from the master performed in the festival hall he designed himself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " tristan und isolde " those who actually managed to get tickets can count themselves extremely lucky , since they 've been sold out for quite some time now .
the demand outpaced supply this year by a factor of 10 , as usual . " unfortunately , visitors have to count on a waiting time for tickets from between eight and ten years , " said peter emmerich , spokesman for the festival . black-market boom opera lovers who either ca n't or do n't want to wait that long basically have two choices : they can work their connections , if they have any , or turn to the black market .
while the connection option is a desired one , most people who want a ticket often have to try the other road . everything these days is available on the internet and festival tickets are no exception .
but most online prices range from 310 to 1,200 euros -lrb- $ 373 to $ 1,446 -rrb- .
the us ticket seller , ticket-finder.com , is honest about the price it 's asking for a ticket to tristan ii , up to $ 2,717 : " the price is arrived at taking into consideration the costs for the ticket , taxes and the great demand for a limited supply .
that means the price can increase by up to 500 percent . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel , chancellor candidate of the christian democratic union , cdu , waves to spectators as she arrives for the opening of the wagner opera festival in bayreuth , southern germany , monday , july 25 , 2005 .
those prices are astronomical , especially when one considers that the most expensive ticket at the official outlets costs 192 euros .
this price is arrived at due to the fact that the state provides subsidies for the tickets and the organization committee .
the purpose of these public monies is to make the festival affordable for the average person . little action taken the organizers of the festival are aware of the black market problem , but they have hardly any legal room to take action against the high prices and rampant reselling .
random inspections of tickets at the entrance to performances are carried out sometimes to check that the buyer is the one using the ticket for entry to a performance , but buyers face no real consequences - despite rumors to the contrary . " the highest priority in bayreuth is and will remain the comfort and enjoyment of the festival by our visitors .
that means tickets are transferable , " said emmerich . festival fans who want legitimate , and affordable , tickets have a rocky road ahead of them : get an order form from the festival ticket office , fill it out and start hoping . " we take great pains to be fair in the distribution of tickets .
we take into consideration how long someone has been on the waiting list , " said emmerich .
" the longer the wait , the greater the chance there is of getting a ticket . " parting is such sweet sorrow exceptions , of course , prove the rule .
festival veterans report that there is actually a chance to get affordable tickets at the festival itself .
the secret is to go to the official tickets outlets and ask about tickets that have been handed back in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's possible to score this way , but lady luck has to be on your side , or you have to count on the misfortune and fairness of other wagner fans who might have waited years to get the precious tickets , but for some reason could n't use them , and handed them back in .
others choose the internet auction route .
" i was so happy , " wrote mercedes200869 , who auctioned two tickets on ebay .
" but my boyfriend ca n't come with me , my best friend is on vacation and another one ca n't come for sure because of her child .
i did n't want to go alone to an experience like this , which you do n't get offered that often in life .
especially not alone .
so after long consideration , i decided to part with my two tickets .

celebrities from the world over are walking the red carpet at the bayreuth festival .
but how do mere mortals get their hands on a coveted ticket ? the new production by swiss director christoph marthaler of " tristan and isolde " opened the 94th richard wagner festival in bayreuth .
until august 28 , some 60,000 people will have the opportunity to hear works from the master performed in the festival hall he designed himself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " tristan und isolde " those who actually managed to get tickets can count themselves extremely lucky , since they 've been sold out for quite some time now .
the demand outpaced supply this year by a factor of 10 , as usual . " unfortunately , visitors have to count on a waiting time for tickets from between eight and ten years , " said peter emmerich , spokesman for the festival . black-market boom opera lovers who either ca n't or do n't want to wait that long basically have two choices : they can work their connections , if they have any , or turn to the black market .
while the connection option is a desired one , most people who want a ticket often have to try the other road . everything these days is available on the internet and festival tickets are no exception .
but most online prices range from 310 to 1,200 euros -lrb- $ 373 to $ 1,446 -rrb- .
the us ticket seller , ticket-finder.com , is honest about the price it 's asking for a ticket to tristan ii , up to $ 2,717 : " the price is arrived at taking into consideration the costs for the ticket , taxes and the great demand for a limited supply .

those prices are astronomical , especially when one considers that the most expensive ticket at the official outlets costs 192 euros .
this price is arrived at due to the fact that the state provides subsidies for the tickets and the organization committee .
the purpose of these public monies is to make the festival affordable for the average person . little action taken the organizers of the festival are aware of the black market problem , but they have hardly any legal room to take action against the high prices and rampant reselling .
random inspections of tickets at the entrance to performances are carried out sometimes to check that the buyer is the one using the ticket for entry to a performance , but buyers face no real consequences - despite rumors to the contrary . " the highest priority in bayreuth is and will remain the comfort and enjoyment of the festival by our visitors .
that means tickets are transferable , " said emmerich . festival fans who want legitimate , and affordable , tickets have a rocky road ahead of them : get an order form from the festival ticket office , fill it out and start hoping . " we take great pains to be fair in the distribution of tickets .
we take into consideration how long someone has been on the waiting list , " said emmerich .
" the longer the wait , the greater the chance there is of getting a ticket . " parting is such sweet sorrow exceptions , of course , prove the rule .
festival veterans report that there is actually a chance to get affordable tickets at the festival itself .
the secret is to go to the official tickets outlets and ask about tickets that have been handed back in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's possible to score this way , but lady luck has to be on your side , or you have to count on the misfortune and fairness of other wagner fans who might have waited years to get the precious tickets , but for some reason could n't use them , and handed them back in .

the islamic radical had admitted to killing filmmaker theo van gogh last november , saying he acted out of faith . the three-judge panel of the amsterdam high-security court announced the life sentence against bouyeri for the murder which the prosecution said signaled the end of innocence for the tolerant netherlands .
to show just how severe the judges believe this reading is , they have order that bouyeri be present in court as the verdict was read out - something almost unheard of in the netherlands , where suspects are not obliged to attend the reading of the verdict and it is very rare that a court orders a suspect to attend .
suspect flouts court 's authority bouyeri , a 27-year old who holds dual dutch and moroccan nationality , has made it clear he does not recognize the authority of the court .
during the trial he ordered his attorney not to present a defense .

it stoked ethnic tensions and sparked a wave of reprisal attacks primarily directed at the muslim community here .
the filmmaker , a distant relative of 19th century painter vincent van gogh , was also an outspoken columnist who often criticized islam and multicultural society .
together with dutch lawmaker ayaan hirsi ali , he made a short film called " submission , " linking islam to the abuse of women and causing outrage in the dutch muslim community .
after van gogh 's murder , hirsi ali went into hiding for three months because a letter threatening her and other politicians was found on the filmmaker 's body .
end of the innocence " the netherlands has lost its innocence .
our country has suddenly become a target of international terrorism , " prosecutor frits van straelen said during the trial .

a life sentence carries no possibility of parole in the netherlands , but convicts can be released after receiving a royal pardon .
whether bouyeri would like a pardon from the queen is another matter .
in a dramatic final speech to the court at the end of his trial two weeks ago , he said he wanted to receive the maximum punishment and warned that he would do the same again if he were freed .
" i do not want to miss the chance to get the maximum sentence ...

the islamic radical had admitted to killing filmmaker theo van gogh last november , saying he acted out of faith . the three-judge panel of the amsterdam high-security court announced the life sentence against bouyeri for the murder which the prosecution said signaled the end of innocence for the tolerant netherlands .
to show just how severe the judges believe this reading is , they have order that bouyeri be present in court as the verdict was read out - something almost unheard of in the netherlands , where suspects are not obliged to attend the reading of the verdict and it is very rare that a court orders a suspect to attend .
suspect flouts court 's authority bouyeri , a 27-year old who holds dual dutch and moroccan nationality , has made it clear he does not recognize the authority of the court .
during the trial he ordered his attorney not to present a defense .

it stoked ethnic tensions and sparked a wave of reprisal attacks primarily directed at the muslim community here .
the filmmaker , a distant relative of 19th century painter vincent van gogh , was also an outspoken columnist who often criticized islam and multicultural society .
together with dutch lawmaker ayaan hirsi ali , he made a short film called " submission , " linking islam to the abuse of women and causing outrage in the dutch muslim community .
after van gogh 's murder , hirsi ali went into hiding for three months because a letter threatening her and other politicians was found on the filmmaker 's body .
end of the innocence " the netherlands has lost its innocence .

a life sentence carries no possibility of parole in the netherlands , but convicts can be released after receiving a royal pardon .
whether bouyeri would like a pardon from the queen is another matter .
in a dramatic final speech to the court at the end of his trial two weeks ago , he said he wanted to receive the maximum punishment and warned that he would do the same again if he were freed .
" i do not want to miss the chance to get the maximum sentence ...
i can assure you that if i am ever freed , i will do exactly the same , " he told the court .

" i can not comprehend that , since i was raised with a different attitude towards achievement . "

the university revolt of the 1960s which swept across west germany resulted in watered-down , less-strict educational standards .
that revolt never hit the gdr .

the big difference between martin , steffen and six other schoolmates is their origin - they have come from leipzig , germany to show off their scientific skills at america 's largest science fair .
and it is n't martin 's first time at the tsa .

the selection criteria are daunting , the pupils only the best .
unusual for german schools , where despite the three-tiered system with the gymnasium , or university prep school , at the top , educators place a lot of value on egalitarianism .

education for top kids at top speed is not the norm in germany , something heink can not understand .
" highlighting particularly good achievements by students , other than in sports , seems to have a ' seedy ' reputation in germany , " said the principal .
" i can not comprehend that , since i was raised with a different attitude towards achievement . "
achievement counts once a pupil is admitted , there is nothing normal about it .
on the school 's web site , a list of the winners and participants at various competitions is presented .

fifth-graders may be thrown into deep water when they enter wog , but they almost all can swim .
but wog is the exception .
of the 14 schools for " gifted " students that existed in the gdr in 1989 , only the leipzig school retained its concentrated program of math and science .
that may have paid off in the last pisa 2003 results that test students from the world 's industrialized countries in areas such as science , math and reading competence .

the home of some of history ’ s greatest scientists and mathematicians - alexander von humboldt , albert einstein , werner von braun - was wallowing in mediocrity .
the university revolt of the 1960s which swept across west germany resulted in watered-down , less-strict educational standards .
that revolt never hit the gdr .
now people wonder if something can be learned from it .
an expert for programs for bright students , elke kaiser from the bavarian state institute for school quality and educational research , says more could be done to help the gifted .
in bavaria , only four schools in three cities have elite educational programs .
if a parent ’ s extremely bright child does n't live in or near munich , nuremberg or würzburg , which in germany 's geographically largest state is quite possible , then the smart tike can visit only a " normal " gymnasium .
kaiser feels more must be done outside of the big cities .
a variety of factors are involved .
money is one of the ´ most important - but so is envy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in a university lecture hall in tübingen : it 's never too early to visit college " if a class of eight gifted students were split off from the rest of the school , " she explained , " some parents get upset , wondering why their child isn ’ t amongst the smartest .

brain drain there is also fear that after investing great time and money in someone with great potential , they might go to another country to study - like the us - and then possibly stay .
it 's something 18-year-old florian kraft from wog would consider .
he says german equivalents to the tsa , like " jugend forscht " -lrb- " youth does research " -rrb- , are n't respected by universities and companies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : albert einstein , probably germany 's greatest physicist " what a high school student does at ' jugend forscht ' doesn ’ t get any recognition , " kraft said .
" if i go to an american university and say ' i won this , this and this at tsa ' the response from the university is ' hello , when would you like to check in ' ? "
and this is one reason why kraft doesn ’ t participate in " jugend forscht . "
but he 's been at tsa four times .
back in leipzig , kraft feels at home at wog .
with only 500 students - other leipzig schools have easily over 1,000 - the school is small and everyone knows just about everyone else , both students and teachers alike .
to kraft , it 's family .
that family may have just been born at the right time and in the right place .
the berlin wall fell , and the east germans were reveling in the joys of freedom .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.07.2005 sintis and romas gain minority status großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not just masks : sinti and roma seek recognition in germany sintis and romas in europe have long been two ethnic groups persecuted by governments and those in the " majority " alike .
now , one german state is recognizing them as a national " minority . " rhineland-palatinate is the first state in germany to recognize as a national minority the roughly 8,000 romas and sintis who live there .
in 1997 , the federal government recognized the 50,000 danish in the north and the 60,000 sorbs who reside in the southeast as national minorities .
rhineland-palatinate 's premier , kurt beck , and the head of the state 's sintis and roma association , jacques delfeld , signed the agreement on monday .
" we want to send a signal with this agreement against the discrimination and for the rights of sinti and roma in our society , " beck said after the signing .
protection of minorities recognition of european minorities on a continent-wide basis dates back only to the eu 's framework agreement , passed in the 1990s .
germany ratified it in 1997 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roma frequently live in poverty in europe with it come certain responsibilities towards minorities .
in rhineland-palatinate , the state will promote special support for sintis and romas in kindergartens , schools and colleges .
this measure is supposed to level the playing field for the two groups in the educational system .
stereotypes perpetuated the central committee of german sintis and romas , in heidelberg , has been demanding for over a decade that an end be brought to what it believes to be discriminatory reporting against the people it represents .
this comes primarily in the form of arrest warrants and reports .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romani rose , head of the german sinti and roma organization , in front of a collection of signatures seeking recognition of the fact that they were also persecuted by the nazis police sometimes include the terms " sinti , " " roma " or even " gypsy " in their reports , which are frequently published in the media .
the central committee says the procedure helps to propagate negative stereotypes .
the new agreement in rhineland-palatinate will prohibit police from mentioning the ethnic identity of sinti or roma when publishing criminal reports in the state .
the sinti and roma languages will also be promoted .
no national recognition - yet whether berlin will take up the matter and put the recognition of the two groups on the legislative agenda remains to be seen .
so far , the government describes the sinti and roma as an " ethnic group , " which allow them some special protection .
but the federal government has not yet taken the final step , saying that the sintis and romas do not meet one of the five criteria set up in the eu framework - namely that they do not have a permanent region they reside in .
over 500,000 sintis and romas were killed by the nazis in the 1930s and 1940s .
countries around europe still systematically persecute and discriminate against the ethnic group that many do not understand . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de efforts to integrate gypsies gather speed ambitious plans are afoot in central and eastern europe to integrate gypsies , or sinti and roma - one of the continent 's largest ethnic minorities - into mainstream society within a decade .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : election 2009 economic , environmental issues top election agenda poll : most germans expect angela merkel will continue as chancellor steinmeier defends plan to create 4 million jobs by 2020 german conservatives gear up for fall elections history -pipe- 26.07.2005 a history of germany 's postwar elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have gone to the polls at least every four years since 1949 in september , germans will elect a new parliament .
today , the country can look back on a checkered history of bundestag elections since the german federal republic was founded in 1949 . west german citizens went to the polls in august 1949 .
it was the first time since the end of the weimar republic in 1933 that men and women could vote in a democratic election for a new parliament . the turnout was one many other countries could only dream of .
nearly 80 percent of eligible voters headed to the ballot boxes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad adenauer takes his oath of office on sept .
20 , 1949 from president erich koehler the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , got the best results , with 31 percent of the votes .
cdu chairman konrad adenauer was elected the nation 's first chancellor , based on a coalition of cdu / csu , free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the very conservative german party -lrb- dp -rrb- . the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who won 29.2 percent of the vote , began a 17-year period in the opposition . 1957 : " no experiments " adenauer 's policies were focused on consolidating germany 's market economy and integrating the country into the western camp .
a significant step toward this aim was germany 's entry into nato in 1955 . voters in the 1957 election confirmed the government , which had run on the slogan " no experiments . "
the cdu / csu won 50.2 percent of the votes .
it was the only time in german postwar history that a party could gain the absolute majority in parliament in federal elections . but 1957 also marked the beginning of the spd 's rise in support , which continued to 1972 . 1965 : the grand coalition the coalition partners cdu / csu and fdp won a significant victory in the 1965 federal elections .
but one year later , the partners could n't reach agreement on how to fill the impending budget gap .
the fdp resisted the union 's aimed tax increases and the coalition collapsed . this marked the beginning of a three-year grand coalition of cdu / csu and spd .
kurt-georg kiesinger -lrb- cdu -rrb- was elected chancellor .
spd chairman and former mayor of berlin willy brandt became his deputy and foreign minister . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : willy brandt 's push for relations with east germany led to his fall the 1969 elections forced the cdu / csu to retreat to the opposition for the first time in postwar german history .
the spd formed a coalition with the fdp and brandt became chancellor . 1972 : confirmation for brandt chancellor brandt emphasized domestic reforms but more importantly , he wanted to improve relations with eastern bloc countries and the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- . this controversial ostpolitik led to fierce domestic wrangling and almost to brandt 's fall in 1972 .
several mps from spd and fdp left their parties .
the cdu / csu felt its time had come and demanded a vote on a motion of no confidence . the attempt failed by an extremely narrow margin .
but the government no longer had the necessary majority in parliament .
the bundestag was dissolved and new elections were called in the fall of 1972 .
these gave the spd 45.8 percent of the vote , its best result on a federal level ever .
the spd / fdp coalition remained in power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut schmidt won a vote of no confidence in feb .
1982 but was later defeated by kohl brandt was forced to resign in 1974 following an espionage scandal .
he was replaced by his finance minister helmut schmidt , also a social democrat . 1983 : kohl comes to power although the cdu / csu faction was the strongest in parliament , the spd continued ruling with schmidt through a coalition with the fdp .
but following elections in 1980 , growing disputes with the fdp in tackling economic issues led several fdp ministers to leave schmidt 's cabinet in 1982 . schmidt attempted to continue with a minority spd-only government .
but he was forced to resign by a constructive vote of no confidence on oct .
1 , 1982 - the first in german history to be successful . the fdp joined the cdu / csu and elected helmut kohl as chancellor .
german voters confirmed this new coalition in early elections in 1983 , giving the cdu / csu 48.8 percent and the fdp 7 percent of the vote .
the spd only won 38.2 percent . in 1983 the environmentalist green party made it into parliament for the first time , winning 5.6 percent of the vote . bildunterschrift : west german chancellor helmut kohl ahead of a parliamentary vote of no confidence in december 1982 1990 : a unified german vote the first federal elections following german unification in 1990 gave the parliament a new face .
although the green party did n't make the five-percent hurdle necessary to hold seats in the bundestag , special rules for this first united german election allowed the greens ' eastern german partner buendnis 90 to have eight representatives . under these rules , the reform communist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- was also represented with 17 mps , although it had only won 2.4 percent of votes . the ruling cdu / csu saw a slight loss of votes , from 44.3 percent to 43.8 percent .
but it could continue its coalition with the fdp .
in the 1994 elections , this majority was even narrower .
the cdu / csu won just 41.4 percent of the vote . the greens , however , marched back into parliament with 7.3 percent of the vote in 1994 .
this result topped even the fdp , which dipped from 11 percent to 6.9 percent . 1998 : the beginning of spd-green power the federal elections in 1998 represented a true break in postwar german history .
for the first time ever , the change in government forced all parties of the old government into the opposition . after 16 years in power , helmut kohl had to step down .
the cdu / csu lost more than six percentage points in the election and only won 35.1 percent of the vote . " we ran to win this election and we lost , " said kohl at the time .
" it is quite clear that the social democrats won this election .
there is nothing to discuss about this result . " the spd won just under 41 percent of votes , its second best result since 1949 .
by then the greens had joined forces with the eastern buendnis 90 to become one party , with which the spd quickly formed a coalition , and social democrat gerhard schroeder was elected germany 's seventh chancellor .
bildunterschrift : after being confirmed chancellor on oct .
27 , 1998 , schroeder thanks his party colleagues , oskar lafontaine and rudolf scharping 2002 : the beginning of the end ? four years later , the comfortable spd / green majority considerably dipped , winning only a slight majority over cdu / csu and fdp in the 2002 elections .
the still positive outcome was partially attributed to the schroeder government 's successful crisis management during the 2002 flooding of the rivers elbe and oder in eastern germany . but above all , berlin 's " no " to the us-led war in iraq was a significant reason for voters to stick with schroeder . this popular backing waned , however , with the social and labor market reforms which the government introduced in spring 2003 .
the spd in particular was held responsible for the cuts in germany 's social net .
the party lost a number of state elections , including its stronghold north rhine-westphalia .
in may 2005 , the last spd-green coalition government on a state level was voted out .
on the same day chancellor schroeder called for snap elections . 2005 : the first female chancellor the election in 2005 failed to produce a clear winner .
with the spd polling 34.2 and the cdu / csu bringing home 35.2 percent , neither party had a big enough mandate to create a coalition with their preferred partners .
after a three-week battle between gerhard schroeder and christian democrat party chief angela merkel for political supremacy , their two parties agreed to form a " grand coalition " together .
merkel came out on top as the first woman to become german chancellor .
she started off on a wave of popularity that continued to grow as she launched a tour of diplomacy to germany 's traditional allies , france , britain and the united states , and brokered a european union budget deal all within months of taking over the chancellery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinmeier have ruled together but would rather not afghanistan loomed large throughout the government 's tenure , with the partners steadfast in their insistence that german soldiers remain part of the nato-led mission to stabilize the country .
the grand coalition government was also marked by the global financial crisis .
in late 2008 taxpayers shelled out 100 billion euros for the bailout of a single bank , hypo real estate , as they saw their country lurch into recession . the government has hardly been challenged by the small opposition parties in the bundestag .
rather , the grand coalition has been its own worst enemy , and opinion polls rule out a continuation .
instead , angela merkel is likely to win another term as chancellor at the helm of a cdu / csu coalition with the free-market liberal fdp .
the social democrats and their candidate for chancellor , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , will probably end up back in the role of opposition for the first time in over a decade .

today , the country can look back on a checkered history of bundestag elections since the german federal republic was founded in 1949 . west german citizens went to the polls in august 1949 .
it was the first time since the end of the weimar republic in 1933 that men and women could vote in a democratic election for a new parliament . the turnout was one many other countries could only dream of .
nearly 80 percent of eligible voters headed to the ballot boxes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad adenauer takes his oath of office on sept .
20 , 1949 from president erich koehler the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , got the best results , with 31 percent of the votes .
cdu chairman konrad adenauer was elected the nation 's first chancellor , based on a coalition of cdu / csu , free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the very conservative german party -lrb- dp -rrb- . the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who won 29.2 percent of the vote , began a 17-year period in the opposition . 1957 : " no experiments " adenauer 's policies were focused on consolidating germany 's market economy and integrating the country into the western camp .
a significant step toward this aim was germany 's entry into nato in 1955 . voters in the 1957 election confirmed the government , which had run on the slogan " no experiments . "
the cdu / csu won 50.2 percent of the votes .
it was the only time in german postwar history that a party could gain the absolute majority in parliament in federal elections . but 1957 also marked the beginning of the spd 's rise in support , which continued to 1972 . 1965 : the grand coalition the coalition partners cdu / csu and fdp won a significant victory in the 1965 federal elections .
but one year later , the partners could n't reach agreement on how to fill the impending budget gap .
the fdp resisted the union 's aimed tax increases and the coalition collapsed . this marked the beginning of a three-year grand coalition of cdu / csu and spd .
kurt-georg kiesinger -lrb- cdu -rrb- was elected chancellor .
spd chairman and former mayor of berlin willy brandt became his deputy and foreign minister . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : willy brandt 's push for relations with east germany led to his fall the 1969 elections forced the cdu / csu to retreat to the opposition for the first time in postwar german history .
the spd formed a coalition with the fdp and brandt became chancellor . 1972 : confirmation for brandt chancellor brandt emphasized domestic reforms but more importantly , he wanted to improve relations with eastern bloc countries and the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- . this controversial ostpolitik led to fierce domestic wrangling and almost to brandt 's fall in 1972 .
several mps from spd and fdp left their parties .
the cdu / csu felt its time had come and demanded a vote on a motion of no confidence . the attempt failed by an extremely narrow margin .
but the government no longer had the necessary majority in parliament .
the bundestag was dissolved and new elections were called in the fall of 1972 .
these gave the spd 45.8 percent of the vote , its best result on a federal level ever .
the spd / fdp coalition remained in power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut schmidt won a vote of no confidence in feb .
1982 but was later defeated by kohl brandt was forced to resign in 1974 following an espionage scandal .
he was replaced by his finance minister helmut schmidt , also a social democrat . 1983 : kohl comes to power although the cdu / csu faction was the strongest in parliament , the spd continued ruling with schmidt through a coalition with the fdp .
but following elections in 1980 , growing disputes with the fdp in tackling economic issues led several fdp ministers to leave schmidt 's cabinet in 1982 . schmidt attempted to continue with a minority spd-only government .
but he was forced to resign by a constructive vote of no confidence on oct .

today , the country can look back on a checkered history of bundestag elections since the german federal republic was founded in 1949 . west german citizens went to the polls in august 1949 .
it was the first time since the end of the weimar republic in 1933 that men and women could vote in a democratic election for a new parliament . the turnout was one many other countries could only dream of .
nearly 80 percent of eligible voters headed to the ballot boxes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad adenauer takes his oath of office on sept .
20 , 1949 from president erich koehler the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , got the best results , with 31 percent of the votes .
cdu chairman konrad adenauer was elected the nation 's first chancellor , based on a coalition of cdu / csu , free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the very conservative german party -lrb- dp -rrb- . the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who won 29.2 percent of the vote , began a 17-year period in the opposition . 1957 : " no experiments " adenauer 's policies were focused on consolidating germany 's market economy and integrating the country into the western camp .
a significant step toward this aim was germany 's entry into nato in 1955 . voters in the 1957 election confirmed the government , which had run on the slogan " no experiments . "
the cdu / csu won 50.2 percent of the votes .
it was the only time in german postwar history that a party could gain the absolute majority in parliament in federal elections . but 1957 also marked the beginning of the spd 's rise in support , which continued to 1972 . 1965 : the grand coalition the coalition partners cdu / csu and fdp won a significant victory in the 1965 federal elections .
but one year later , the partners could n't reach agreement on how to fill the impending budget gap .
the fdp resisted the union 's aimed tax increases and the coalition collapsed . this marked the beginning of a three-year grand coalition of cdu / csu and spd .
kurt-georg kiesinger -lrb- cdu -rrb- was elected chancellor .
spd chairman and former mayor of berlin willy brandt became his deputy and foreign minister . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : willy brandt 's push for relations with east germany led to his fall the 1969 elections forced the cdu / csu to retreat to the opposition for the first time in postwar german history .
the spd formed a coalition with the fdp and brandt became chancellor . 1972 : confirmation for brandt chancellor brandt emphasized domestic reforms but more importantly , he wanted to improve relations with eastern bloc countries and the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- . this controversial ostpolitik led to fierce domestic wrangling and almost to brandt 's fall in 1972 .
several mps from spd and fdp left their parties .
the cdu / csu felt its time had come and demanded a vote on a motion of no confidence . the attempt failed by an extremely narrow margin .
but the government no longer had the necessary majority in parliament .
the bundestag was dissolved and new elections were called in the fall of 1972 .
these gave the spd 45.8 percent of the vote , its best result on a federal level ever .
the spd / fdp coalition remained in power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut schmidt won a vote of no confidence in feb .
1982 but was later defeated by kohl brandt was forced to resign in 1974 following an espionage scandal .
he was replaced by his finance minister helmut schmidt , also a social democrat . 1983 : kohl comes to power although the cdu / csu faction was the strongest in parliament , the spd continued ruling with schmidt through a coalition with the fdp .
but following elections in 1980 , growing disputes with the fdp in tackling economic issues led several fdp ministers to leave schmidt 's cabinet in 1982 . schmidt attempted to continue with a minority spd-only government .
but he was forced to resign by a constructive vote of no confidence on oct .
1 , 1982 - the first in german history to be successful . the fdp joined the cdu / csu and elected helmut kohl as chancellor .
german voters confirmed this new coalition in early elections in 1983 , giving the cdu / csu 48.8 percent and the fdp 7 percent of the vote .
the spd only won 38.2 percent . in 1983 the environmentalist green party made it into parliament for the first time , winning 5.6 percent of the vote . bildunterschrift : west german chancellor helmut kohl ahead of a parliamentary vote of no confidence in december 1982 1990 : a unified german vote the first federal elections following german unification in 1990 gave the parliament a new face .
although the green party did n't make the five-percent hurdle necessary to hold seats in the bundestag , special rules for this first united german election allowed the greens ' eastern german partner buendnis 90 to have eight representatives . under these rules , the reform communist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- was also represented with 17 mps , although it had only won 2.4 percent of votes . the ruling cdu / csu saw a slight loss of votes , from 44.3 percent to 43.8 percent .
but it could continue its coalition with the fdp .
in the 1994 elections , this majority was even narrower .
the cdu / csu won just 41.4 percent of the vote . the greens , however , marched back into parliament with 7.3 percent of the vote in 1994 .
this result topped even the fdp , which dipped from 11 percent to 6.9 percent . 1998 : the beginning of spd-green power the federal elections in 1998 represented a true break in postwar german history .
for the first time ever , the change in government forced all parties of the old government into the opposition . after 16 years in power , helmut kohl had to step down .
the cdu / csu lost more than six percentage points in the election and only won 35.1 percent of the vote . " we ran to win this election and we lost , " said kohl at the time .
" it is quite clear that the social democrats won this election .
there is nothing to discuss about this result . " the spd won just under 41 percent of votes , its second best result since 1949 .
by then the greens had joined forces with the eastern buendnis 90 to become one party , with which the spd quickly formed a coalition , and social democrat gerhard schroeder was elected germany 's seventh chancellor .
bildunterschrift : after being confirmed chancellor on oct .
27 , 1998 , schroeder thanks his party colleagues , oskar lafontaine and rudolf scharping 2002 : the beginning of the end ? four years later , the comfortable spd / green majority considerably dipped , winning only a slight majority over cdu / csu and fdp in the 2002 elections .
the still positive outcome was partially attributed to the schroeder government 's successful crisis management during the 2002 flooding of the rivers elbe and oder in eastern germany . but above all , berlin 's " no " to the us-led war in iraq was a significant reason for voters to stick with schroeder . this popular backing waned , however , with the social and labor market reforms which the government introduced in spring 2003 .
the spd in particular was held responsible for the cuts in germany 's social net .
the party lost a number of state elections , including its stronghold north rhine-westphalia .
in may 2005 , the last spd-green coalition government on a state level was voted out .
on the same day chancellor schroeder called for snap elections . 2005 : the first female chancellor the election in 2005 failed to produce a clear winner .
with the spd polling 34.2 and the cdu / csu bringing home 35.2 percent , neither party had a big enough mandate to create a coalition with their preferred partners .
after a three-week battle between gerhard schroeder and christian democrat party chief angela merkel for political supremacy , their two parties agreed to form a " grand coalition " together .
merkel came out on top as the first woman to become german chancellor .
she started off on a wave of popularity that continued to grow as she launched a tour of diplomacy to germany 's traditional allies , france , britain and the united states , and brokered a european union budget deal all within months of taking over the chancellery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinmeier have ruled together but would rather not afghanistan loomed large throughout the government 's tenure , with the partners steadfast in their insistence that german soldiers remain part of the nato-led mission to stabilize the country .
the grand coalition government was also marked by the global financial crisis .
in late 2008 taxpayers shelled out 100 billion euros for the bailout of a single bank , hypo real estate , as they saw their country lurch into recession . the government has hardly been challenged by the small opposition parties in the bundestag .
rather , the grand coalition has been its own worst enemy , and opinion polls rule out a continuation .
instead , angela merkel is likely to win another term as chancellor at the helm of a cdu / csu coalition with the free-market liberal fdp .
the social democrats and their candidate for chancellor , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , will probably end up back in the role of opposition for the first time in over a decade .

now , one german state is recognizing them as a national " minority . " rhineland-palatinate is the first state in germany to recognize as a national minority the roughly 8,000 romas and sintis who live there .
in 1997 , the federal government recognized the 50,000 danish in the north and the 60,000 sorbs who reside in the southeast as national minorities .
rhineland-palatinate 's premier , kurt beck , and the head of the state 's sintis and roma association , jacques delfeld , signed the agreement on monday .
" we want to send a signal with this agreement against the discrimination and for the rights of sinti and roma in our society , " beck said after the signing .
protection of minorities recognition of european minorities on a continent-wide basis dates back only to the eu 's framework agreement , passed in the 1990s .
germany ratified it in 1997 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roma frequently live in poverty in europe with it come certain responsibilities towards minorities .
in rhineland-palatinate , the state will promote special support for sintis and romas in kindergartens , schools and colleges .
this measure is supposed to level the playing field for the two groups in the educational system .
stereotypes perpetuated the central committee of german sintis and romas , in heidelberg , has been demanding for over a decade that an end be brought to what it believes to be discriminatory reporting against the people it represents .
this comes primarily in the form of arrest warrants and reports .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romani rose , head of the german sinti and roma organization , in front of a collection of signatures seeking recognition of the fact that they were also persecuted by the nazis police sometimes include the terms " sinti , " " roma " or even " gypsy " in their reports , which are frequently published in the media .
the central committee says the procedure helps to propagate negative stereotypes .
the new agreement in rhineland-palatinate will prohibit police from mentioning the ethnic identity of sinti or roma when publishing criminal reports in the state .
the sinti and roma languages will also be promoted .
no national recognition - yet whether berlin will take up the matter and put the recognition of the two groups on the legislative agenda remains to be seen .
so far , the government describes the sinti and roma as an " ethnic group , " which allow them some special protection .
but the federal government has not yet taken the final step , saying that the sintis and romas do not meet one of the five criteria set up in the eu framework - namely that they do not have a permanent region they reside in .
over 500,000 sintis and romas were killed by the nazis in the 1930s and 1940s .
countries around europe still systematically persecute and discriminate against the ethnic group that many do not understand . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de efforts to integrate gypsies gather speed ambitious plans are afoot in central and eastern europe to integrate gypsies , or sinti and roma - one of the continent 's largest ethnic minorities - into mainstream society within a decade .

education for top kids at top speed is not the norm in germany , something heink can not understand .

" i can not comprehend that , since i was raised with a different attitude towards achievement . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin 's car entry built with lego blocks she was convinced that the school should remain dedicated to the natural sciences and took over the helm as principal in 1992 .
education for top kids at top speed is not the norm in germany , something heink can not understand .
" highlighting particularly good achievements by students , other than in sports , seems to have a ' seedy ' reputation in germany , " said the principal .
" i can not comprehend that , since i was raised with a different attitude towards achievement . "
achievement counts once a pupil is admitted , there is nothing normal about it .
on the school 's web site , a list of the winners and participants at various competitions is presented .
not only do math , chemistry and physics events turn up , but also chess and marathon .
one course in the curriculum is boomerang , not just throwing one , but learning just what makes the australian weapon fly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pisa results have not only forced school students to pull out their hair chicago does n't seem so exotic compared to istanbul , jakarta or taiwan , all locations where the students have proved their skills over the past 12 months .
fifth-graders may be thrown into deep water when they enter wog , but they almost all can swim .
but wog is the exception .
of the 14 schools for " gifted " students that existed in the gdr in 1989 , only the leipzig school retained its concentrated program of math and science .
that may have paid off in the last pisa 2003 results that test students from the world 's industrialized countries in areas such as science , math and reading competence .
saxony , in germany 's east , broke the stronghold of the southern states , finishing second only behind bavaria and far above the international pisa averages in mathematical and science competence .
thuringia and saxony-anhalt also have left their western german cousins far behind .
" i am certain that the traditional attitudes and demands of the school play a not so insignificant role -lrb- in the pisa results -rrb- , " heink believes .
gifted programs rare in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' jugend forscht ' -lrb- ' youth does research ' -rrb- allows german middle and high school students to show off their science and technical skills the shock of the first pisa results in 2000 still sits deep in germany .
the home of some of history ’ s greatest scientists and mathematicians - alexander von humboldt , albert einstein , werner von braun - was wallowing in mediocrity .
the university revolt of the 1960s which swept across west germany resulted in watered-down , less-strict educational standards .
that revolt never hit the gdr .
now people wonder if something can be learned from it .
an expert for programs for bright students , elke kaiser from the bavarian state institute for school quality and educational research , says more could be done to help the gifted .
in bavaria , only four schools in three cities have elite educational programs .
if a parent ’ s extremely bright child does n't live in or near munich , nuremberg or würzburg , which in germany 's geographically largest state is quite possible , then the smart tike can visit only a " normal " gymnasium .
kaiser feels more must be done outside of the big cities .
a variety of factors are involved .
money is one of the ´ most important - but so is envy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in a university lecture hall in tübingen : it 's never too early to visit college " if a class of eight gifted students were split off from the rest of the school , " she explained , " some parents get upset , wondering why their child isn ’ t amongst the smartest .
and then you 'll hear complaints that too much money is being spent on just a few pupils . "
brain drain there is also fear that after investing great time and money in someone with great potential , they might go to another country to study - like the us - and then possibly stay .
it 's something 18-year-old florian kraft from wog would consider .
he says german equivalents to the tsa , like " jugend forscht " -lrb- " youth does research " -rrb- , are n't respected by universities and companies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : albert einstein , probably germany 's greatest physicist " what a high school student does at ' jugend forscht ' doesn ’ t get any recognition , " kraft said .
" if i go to an american university and say ' i won this , this and this at tsa ' the response from the university is ' hello , when would you like to check in ' ? "
and this is one reason why kraft doesn ’ t participate in " jugend forscht . "
but he 's been at tsa four times .
back in leipzig , kraft feels at home at wog .
with only 500 students - other leipzig schools have easily over 1,000 - the school is small and everyone knows just about everyone else , both students and teachers alike .
to kraft , it 's family .
that family may have just been born at the right time and in the right place .
the berlin wall fell , and the east germans were reveling in the joys of freedom .
the west germans could provide money .
but now the morose financial situation of the german government may make the creation of a wog anywhere else an unachievable goal - at least in the public school system .
and martin , steffen , florian and their classmates can continue to travel to scholastic competitions around europe and the world - after receiving financial support from private and corporate sponsors . john kluempers , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the dumbing down of germany a german politician was roundly criticized recently for commenting that only the " wrong people " were having children in germany .

" this is a legal necessity for turkey .
we have to make our position clear , in written form , " the eu diplomat told reuters , saying the declaration would be issued " at an appropriate time " . cyprus became a member of the european union last year despite the failure of the un-brokered peace plan to reunite the divided mediterranean island , which turkish cypriots backed but greek cypriots vetoed . turkey and greece have been at loggerheads over cyprus since the former invaded the island in 1974 in response to a coup in nicosia engineered by greece 's then-ruling military junta .
turkey still has some 35,000 troops deployed in the north of the island . cyprus issue not a condition , eu says in the eu statement , the diplomat added that the bloc had not made it a condition for opening negotiations that ankara recognizes cyprus before the talks start .
he said the eu would have to consider the form and content of any political declaration turkey might make on the subject . turkey 's proposed accession is a disputed topic in some quarters of the eu despite the decision last month by the bloc 's 25 leaders which reaffirmed their decision to begin talks with the country , with the goal of membership .
poll shows widespread opposition a european commission survey published last week indicated 52 percent of eu citizens oppose turkish accession and only 35 percent support it .
the poll suggested 80 percent of austrians , 74 percent of germans and 70 percent of french were against admitting the mainly muslim nation of 70 million citizens . however , the turkish bid for membership continues despite the opposition , domestic problems with terrorism and a faltering democracy and human rights program .
in october last year , the european commission concluded that ankara had sufficiently met the eu 's criteria on democracy , human and minority rights and the rule of law to begin membership talks , despite protests from a number of european politicians to the contrary . turkey slowly ticking off eu conditions turkey was set a number of conditions to comply with before negotiations could begin , including several packages of legal reforms , which were introduced by ankara in april . the eu has said accession will take at least a decade and negotiations are an open-ended process whose outcome can not be guaranteed in advance . the 25-nation bloc must agree a negotiating mandate unanimously for talks to start .
the executive eu commission put forward a proposal in june , but cyprus and austria have sought amendments while france has reserved its position . erdogan to meet turkey bid supporter blair on the same day that the customs union protocol is signed , turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan will meet british prime minister tony blair , current holder of the rotating six-month eu presidency , in london .
britain has championed turkey 's bid , highlighting the strategic value of embracing a large muslim democracy and nato ally . wednesday 's blair-erdogan talks are expected to cover eu issues including cyprus and the customs protocol , as well as the fight against terrorism . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey resilient despite europe 's crisis turkey 's hopes of eu accession remain high despite the rejection of the eu constitution by france and the netherlands and a potential swing to the right in ankara 's key supporter germany .

celebrities from the world over are walking the red carpet at the bayreuth festival .
but how do mere mortals get their hands on a coveted ticket ? the new production by swiss director christoph marthaler of " tristan and isolde " opened the 94th richard wagner festival in bayreuth .
until august 28 , some 60,000 people will have the opportunity to hear works from the master performed in the festival hall he designed himself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " tristan und isolde " those who actually managed to get tickets can count themselves extremely lucky , since they 've been sold out for quite some time now .
the demand outpaced supply this year by a factor of 10 , as usual . " unfortunately , visitors have to count on a waiting time for tickets from between eight and ten years , " said peter emmerich , spokesman for the festival . black-market boom opera lovers who either ca n't or do n't want to wait that long basically have two choices : they can work their connections , if they have any , or turn to the black market .
while the connection option is a desired one , most people who want a ticket often have to try the other road . everything these days is available on the internet and festival tickets are no exception .
but most online prices range from 310 to 1,200 euros -lrb- $ 373 to $ 1,446 -rrb- .
the us ticket seller , ticket-finder.com , is honest about the price it 's asking for a ticket to tristan ii , up to $ 2,717 : " the price is arrived at taking into consideration the costs for the ticket , taxes and the great demand for a limited supply .
that means the price can increase by up to 500 percent .

those prices are astronomical , especially when one considers that the most expensive ticket at the official outlets costs 192 euros .
this price is arrived at due to the fact that the state provides subsidies for the tickets and the organization committee .
the purpose of these public monies is to make the festival affordable for the average person . little action taken the organizers of the festival are aware of the black market problem , but they have hardly any legal room to take action against the high prices and rampant reselling .
random inspections of tickets at the entrance to performances are carried out sometimes to check that the buyer is the one using the ticket for entry to a performance , but buyers face no real consequences - despite rumors to the contrary . " the highest priority in bayreuth is and will remain the comfort and enjoyment of the festival by our visitors .
that means tickets are transferable , " said emmerich . festival fans who want legitimate , and affordable , tickets have a rocky road ahead of them : get an order form from the festival ticket office , fill it out and start hoping . " we take great pains to be fair in the distribution of tickets .
we take into consideration how long someone has been on the waiting list , " said emmerich .
" the longer the wait , the greater the chance there is of getting a ticket . " parting is such sweet sorrow exceptions , of course , prove the rule .
festival veterans report that there is actually a chance to get affordable tickets at the festival itself .
the secret is to go to the official tickets outlets and ask about tickets that have been handed back in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's possible to score this way , but lady luck has to be on your side , or you have to count on the misfortune and fairness of other wagner fans who might have waited years to get the precious tickets , but for some reason could n't use them , and handed them back in .

now , one german state is recognizing them as a national " minority . " rhineland-palatinate is the first state in germany to recognize as a national minority the roughly 8,000 romas and sintis who live there .
in 1997 , the federal government recognized the 50,000 danish in the north and the 60,000 sorbs who reside in the southeast as national minorities .
rhineland-palatinate 's premier , kurt beck , and the head of the state 's sintis and roma association , jacques delfeld , signed the agreement on monday .
" we want to send a signal with this agreement against the discrimination and for the rights of sinti and roma in our society , " beck said after the signing .
protection of minorities recognition of european minorities on a continent-wide basis dates back only to the eu 's framework agreement , passed in the 1990s .
germany ratified it in 1997 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roma frequently live in poverty in europe with it come certain responsibilities towards minorities .
in rhineland-palatinate , the state will promote special support for sintis and romas in kindergartens , schools and colleges .
this measure is supposed to level the playing field for the two groups in the educational system .
stereotypes perpetuated the central committee of german sintis and romas , in heidelberg , has been demanding for over a decade that an end be brought to what it believes to be discriminatory reporting against the people it represents .
this comes primarily in the form of arrest warrants and reports .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romani rose , head of the german sinti and roma organization , in front of a collection of signatures seeking recognition of the fact that they were also persecuted by the nazis police sometimes include the terms " sinti , " " roma " or even " gypsy " in their reports , which are frequently published in the media .
the central committee says the procedure helps to propagate negative stereotypes .
the new agreement in rhineland-palatinate will prohibit police from mentioning the ethnic identity of sinti or roma when publishing criminal reports in the state .
the sinti and roma languages will also be promoted .
no national recognition - yet whether berlin will take up the matter and put the recognition of the two groups on the legislative agenda remains to be seen .
so far , the government describes the sinti and roma as an " ethnic group , " which allow them some special protection .
but the federal government has not yet taken the final step , saying that the sintis and romas do not meet one of the five criteria set up in the eu framework - namely that they do not have a permanent region they reside in .
over 500,000 sintis and romas were killed by the nazis in the 1930s and 1940s .
countries around europe still systematically persecute and discriminate against the ethnic group that many do not understand . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de efforts to integrate gypsies gather speed ambitious plans are afoot in central and eastern europe to integrate gypsies , or sinti and roma - one of the continent 's largest ethnic minorities - into mainstream society within a decade .

the islamic radical had admitted to killing filmmaker theo van gogh last november , saying he acted out of faith . the three-judge panel of the amsterdam high-security court announced the life sentence against bouyeri for the murder which the prosecution said signaled the end of innocence for the tolerant netherlands .
to show just how severe the judges believe this reading is , they have order that bouyeri be present in court as the verdict was read out - something almost unheard of in the netherlands , where suspects are not obliged to attend the reading of the verdict and it is very rare that a court orders a suspect to attend .

a life sentence carries no possibility of parole in the netherlands , but convicts can be released after receiving a royal pardon .
whether bouyeri would like a pardon from the queen is another matter .
in a dramatic final speech to the court at the end of his trial two weeks ago , he said he wanted to receive the maximum punishment and warned that he would do the same again if he were freed .

the islamic radical had admitted to killing filmmaker theo van gogh last november , saying he acted out of faith . the three-judge panel of the amsterdam high-security court announced the life sentence against bouyeri for the murder which the prosecution said signaled the end of innocence for the tolerant netherlands .
to show just how severe the judges believe this reading is , they have order that bouyeri be present in court as the verdict was read out - something almost unheard of in the netherlands , where suspects are not obliged to attend the reading of the verdict and it is very rare that a court orders a suspect to attend .
suspect flouts court 's authority bouyeri , a 27-year old who holds dual dutch and moroccan nationality , has made it clear he does not recognize the authority of the court .
during the trial he ordered his attorney not to present a defense .

the filmmaker , a distant relative of 19th century painter vincent van gogh , was also an outspoken columnist who often criticized islam and multicultural society .
together with dutch lawmaker ayaan hirsi ali , he made a short film called " submission , " linking islam to the abuse of women and causing outrage in the dutch muslim community .
after van gogh 's murder , hirsi ali went into hiding for three months because a letter threatening her and other politicians was found on the filmmaker 's body .

a life sentence carries no possibility of parole in the netherlands , but convicts can be released after receiving a royal pardon .
whether bouyeri would like a pardon from the queen is another matter .
in a dramatic final speech to the court at the end of his trial two weeks ago , he said he wanted to receive the maximum punishment and warned that he would do the same again if he were freed .

economy set to dominate german election the world according to merkel germany 's long road to multiculturalism election 2005 -pipe- 26.07.2005 education and research großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the country 's future lies in education goethe , einstein , nietzsche - germany was once called the nation of poets and philosophers .
today , the country is faced with some of the lowest education standards in europe .
what can be done to improve the situation ? spd the spd wants spending on research and development to increase to three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- by 2010 - a third of which will be financed by the government , two thirds by industry .
it is in favor of introducing nation-wide education standards in day care centers .
the spd , which has initiated a full day school program -lrb- in germany , schools usually run till noon -rrb- , wants to give the federal states an additional four million euros to set up 10,000 more full day schools in the country . university studies will continue to be free , but only for the first degree - a plan designed to reduce the number of years many german students spend before entering the workforce .
the bafög or financial support for students from the government , will remain untouched and will be converted into a complete student loan . cdu / csu starting 2010 , the union aims to invest three percent of gdp yearly in research and development .
in addition to the already agreed so-called " initiative for excellence " - that means in addition to the 1.9 billion euros meant to promote top study courses and so-called elite universities - a further one billion euros will flow into research and development .
that will be financed by reducing subsidies elsewhere .
the universities will be allowed to impose tuition fees . the greens the greens want to raise spending on research and development to three percent of gdp by 2010 .
the party wants to introduce a free pre-school year to better prepare all children for school entry .
the greens want to abolish the three-tier school system , which streamlines kids from an early age , and focus on full day schools instead .
in the future , educators will be trained at technical colleges .
the party favors a low-interest study credit and a state-promoted " bildungssparen " - loans that are only meant to be used to finance studies .
the first university degree will be free of cost and the bafög will be improved upon .
young scientists will be entitled to flexible wage agreements . fdp the fdp aims to focus on pre-school education .
it plans on introducing nation-wide education standards for day care centers .
their quality will be guaranteed through a system of certifications .
preparing young children for school will also include conducting language tests .
the fdp also wants to reduce the age at which children enter schools to five from the current six .
educators , or at least heads of day care centers , will be trained at technical colleges -lrb- instead of the current structure which requires no higher education for day-care instructors -rrb- , thereby improving the quality of instruction . the party is in favor of tuition fees and for more autonomy and competition between different universities . the left party the newly-formed left party wants to increase spending on education and research to six percent of gdp .
the three-tier school system will be abolished , instead students will go to a common school until the 10th grade .
university education will be free of cost .
the party wants to introduce a system , whereby companies who do n't offer traineeships for young people will have to pay a penalty . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de educating germany from berlin to bonn , educators , politicians and parents have recognized they must start doing their part to improve schools .
the consequences of failure are imminent : poorly educated students are a burden to the economy while the best and brightest leave for opportunities abroad .
tuition fees face uphill battle in germany with conservatives gaining ground in german politics , the idea of free university education appears to be a thing of the past .
but , the idea of tuition fees and even study loans remains anathema to many students .

only one such school remains .
could germany learn from it ? at the 27th technology students association -lrb- tsa -rrb- annual conference in chicago , illinois , the 10th graders martin and steffen do not stick out much more than the 3,500 middle and high school students who made the journey from around the usa .
the big difference between martin , steffen and six other schoolmates is their origin - they have come from leipzig , germany to show off their scientific skills at america 's largest science fair .
and it is n't martin 's first time at the tsa .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steffen and martin from leipzig 's wilhelm-ostwald-gymnasium in chicago the school they attend , the wilhelm ostwald gymnasium -lrb- wog -rrb- in leipzig in the state of saxony , is not just any run-of-the-mill high school that any student goes to after finishing primary education .
the selection criteria are daunting , the pupils only the best .
unusual for german schools , where despite the three-tiered system with the gymnasium , or university prep school , at the top , educators place a lot of value on egalitarianism .
' seediness ' of success wog , founded in 1985 , just four years before communist east germany collapsed , may have a short tradition , but it was deeply-rooted in the gdr 's system of promoting the best .
its niche was the advancement of math and natural sciences , and still possibly would be if erich honecker or egon krenz still ruled .
brigitte heink has been at the school either as a teacher or principal since 1986 .
after the fall of the berlin wall , the east german schools was transformed to mirror the west german system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin 's car entry built with lego blocks she was convinced that the school should remain dedicated to the natural sciences and took over the helm as principal in 1992 .
education for top kids at top speed is not the norm in germany , something heink can not understand .
" highlighting particularly good achievements by students , other than in sports , seems to have a ' seedy ' reputation in germany , " said the principal .
" i can not comprehend that , since i was raised with a different attitude towards achievement . "
achievement counts once a pupil is admitted , there is nothing normal about it .
on the school 's web site , a list of the winners and participants at various competitions is presented .
not only do math , chemistry and physics events turn up , but also chess and marathon .
one course in the curriculum is boomerang , not just throwing one , but learning just what makes the australian weapon fly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pisa results have not only forced school students to pull out their hair chicago does n't seem so exotic compared to istanbul , jakarta or taiwan , all locations where the students have proved their skills over the past 12 months .
fifth-graders may be thrown into deep water when they enter wog , but they almost all can swim .
but wog is the exception .
of the 14 schools for " gifted " students that existed in the gdr in 1989 , only the leipzig school retained its concentrated program of math and science .
that may have paid off in the last pisa 2003 results that test students from the world 's industrialized countries in areas such as science , math and reading competence .
saxony , in germany 's east , broke the stronghold of the southern states , finishing second only behind bavaria and far above the international pisa averages in mathematical and science competence .
thuringia and saxony-anhalt also have left their western german cousins far behind .
" i am certain that the traditional attitudes and demands of the school play a not so insignificant role -lrb- in the pisa results -rrb- , " heink believes .
gifted programs rare in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' jugend forscht ' -lrb- ' youth does research ' -rrb- allows german middle and high school students to show off their science and technical skills the shock of the first pisa results in 2000 still sits deep in germany .
the home of some of history ’ s greatest scientists and mathematicians - alexander von humboldt , albert einstein , werner von braun - was wallowing in mediocrity .
the university revolt of the 1960s which swept across west germany resulted in watered-down , less-strict educational standards .
that revolt never hit the gdr .
now people wonder if something can be learned from it .
an expert for programs for bright students , elke kaiser from the bavarian state institute for school quality and educational research , says more could be done to help the gifted .
in bavaria , only four schools in three cities have elite educational programs .
if a parent ’ s extremely bright child does n't live in or near munich , nuremberg or würzburg , which in germany 's geographically largest state is quite possible , then the smart tike can visit only a " normal " gymnasium .
kaiser feels more must be done outside of the big cities .
a variety of factors are involved .
money is one of the ´ most important - but so is envy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in a university lecture hall in tübingen : it 's never too early to visit college " if a class of eight gifted students were split off from the rest of the school , " she explained , " some parents get upset , wondering why their child isn ’ t amongst the smartest .
and then you 'll hear complaints that too much money is being spent on just a few pupils . "
brain drain there is also fear that after investing great time and money in someone with great potential , they might go to another country to study - like the us - and then possibly stay .
it 's something 18-year-old florian kraft from wog would consider .
he says german equivalents to the tsa , like " jugend forscht " -lrb- " youth does research " -rrb- , are n't respected by universities and companies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : albert einstein , probably germany 's greatest physicist " what a high school student does at ' jugend forscht ' doesn ’ t get any recognition , " kraft said .
" if i go to an american university and say ' i won this , this and this at tsa ' the response from the university is ' hello , when would you like to check in ' ? "
and this is one reason why kraft doesn ’ t participate in " jugend forscht . "
but he 's been at tsa four times .
back in leipzig , kraft feels at home at wog .
with only 500 students - other leipzig schools have easily over 1,000 - the school is small and everyone knows just about everyone else , both students and teachers alike .
to kraft , it 's family .
that family may have just been born at the right time and in the right place .
the berlin wall fell , and the east germans were reveling in the joys of freedom .
the west germans could provide money .
but now the morose financial situation of the german government may make the creation of a wog anywhere else an unachievable goal - at least in the public school system .
and martin , steffen , florian and their classmates can continue to travel to scholastic competitions around europe and the world - after receiving financial support from private and corporate sponsors . john kluempers , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : the dumbing down of germany a german politician was roundly criticized recently for commenting that only the " wrong people " were having children in germany .

four central asian states , russia and china have urged the us to give a timeframe for withdrawal of forces used to support operations in afghanistan .
mr rumsfeld has flown to the region on an urgent mission , travelling half-way round the world at short notice .

they said the situation in afghanistan was now stabilising and the us should give a timetable for its withdrawal from the bases .

so the pentagon was caught off guard when earlier this month central asian states , backed by russia and china , issued a joint call .
they said the situation in afghanistan was now stabilising and the us should give a timetable for its withdrawal from the bases .
this change of heart appears to have been prompted by recent instability in central asia .
in the past few months , protests swept kyrgyzstan 's president from power and uzbekistan 's authorities put down an uprising in the city of andijan , killing - it is claimed - hundreds of civilians .
central asia 's governments , afraid of instability , are closing ranks .
and they have found backing from russia and china .
the result is that the us is in danger of finding itself squeezed out of central asia , its rivals seizing the moment to dislodge it from the region .

ms kelly says that the attainment gap between children from rich and poor families is not closing .
in a speech on education and social mobility , she called for greater efforts to stop children from low-income families failing in school .
" the talents of bright , but poor , children are too often being wasted . "
ms kelly 's speech to the institute for public policy research highlighted the link between family income and achievement at school - and announced efforts to give all children a more equal chance of succeeding .
' deprived ' this will include a " reading recovery " project in primary schools , where children who are struggling with literacy will receive one-to-one support to help them catch up - with the aim of tackling a persistent core of underachieving pupils . "
get this wrong and any talk of improved social justice is all too likely to be nothing more than warm words " ruth kelly , education secretary these would provide " first , second and third chances to everyone " and would seek to help the poorest children , so that success would be determined by " their own ability and efforts " rather than being " predetermined by their background " .
there will also be free books given to children under the age of four , to help foster an interest in reading and books .
the focus on raising achievement among the poorest pupils follows research from the government suggesting that they are failing to keep up with better-off classmates .
even when schools in the most deprived areas have narrowed the gap slightly on other schools , individual pupils from the poorest homes are still falling behind .
the education secretary called for early intervention to prevent children falling behind - including initiatives to promote learning in the pre-school years .
ms kelly promised " searching questions " about how the government should work towards a " society where background is not barrier to success and social mobility is a reality " .
' negative impact ' and she warned against the cycle of underachievement among poorer children , where a lack of success in primary school laid the path for failure in secondary school .
where pupils failed at 11 , they were five times less likely to achieve five gcses when they were 16 , she said .
" our ambition must be to reduce the negative impact that a disadvantaged social background may have on educational attainment at all stages , particularly the early years and school years .
" get this wrong and any talk of improved social justice is all too likely to be nothing more than warm words , " ms kelly .
speaking on bbc radio 4 's today programme , dr tessa stone , director of the sutton trust , said that when it came to a pupil 's level of achievement , the home background remained a greater influence than the school .
since coming into power , the government has stressed the importance of education in breaking down social barriers and widening opportunity .
a longstanding feature of the education system has been the wide gap between high and low achievers - with this country having one of the worst educational drop-out rates in the industrialised world .
' biggest failure ' while only about half of school pupils in england achieve the basic benchmark of five gcses - about 90 % of those who stay on beyond gcse continue into higher education .
the shadow education secretary , david cameron , said the " failure to increase social mobility has been one of the biggest education failures of the last decade " .
mr cameron put forward a five-step plan to make the education system help " those from the most disadvantaged backgrounds get to the top " .
these were to put " synthetic phonics at the heart of literacy teaching " , " allow head teachers to expel unruly pupils " , " root out political correctness in teaching and exams " , " give schools freedom to determine admissions " and " tear down the barrier between state and private education " .

ms kelly says that the attainment gap between children from rich and poor families is not closing .

" the talents of bright , but poor , children are too often being wasted . "
ms kelly 's speech to the institute for public policy research highlighted the link between family income and achievement at school - and announced efforts to give all children a more equal chance of succeeding .
' deprived ' this will include a " reading recovery " project in primary schools , where children who are struggling with literacy will receive one-to-one support to help them catch up - with the aim of tackling a persistent core of underachieving pupils .

the focus on raising achievement among the poorest pupils follows research from the government suggesting that they are failing to keep up with better-off classmates .
even when schools in the most deprived areas have narrowed the gap slightly on other schools , individual pupils from the poorest homes are still falling behind .
the education secretary called for early intervention to prevent children falling behind - including initiatives to promote learning in the pre-school years .
ms kelly promised " searching questions " about how the government should work towards a " society where background is not barrier to success and social mobility is a reality " .

the uk firm made replacement cost profits of $ 10.47bn -lrb- £ 6bn -rrb- in the first half of 2005 against $ 8.14bn last year .
the company , the world 's second biggest by market value , has also benefited from soaring global oil prices in 2005 .
bp 's said net replacement cost profit was $ 4.98bn in the three months to the end of june , up 29 % on the $ 3.87bn recorded in the same period a year ago .
" our record first half financial results could not have been delivered without the significant investments made over the last decade , " said bp chief executive lord browne .
" these are capturing the benefit of the strong trading environment . "
' new resources ' earlier this month bp said its realisations for oil products - actual sales receipts - moved in line with rising industry gains .
production was 3.5 % higher than last year , helped by its tnk-bp joint venture in russia , and new exploration in places like azerbaijan and the gulf of mexico .
the company has also recently made new discoveries in egypt and angola .
" there has to be higher spending , but i think they are doing that on the research and development front , " said elissa bayer of gerrards stockbrokers .
rising product prices have dampened margins over the past few weeks and have contributed to a weak start to the third quarter lord browne , bp chief executive check bp 's share price " they have always got to find new resources - i know they are drilling in mexico , russia and other parts of the world . "
bp 's thunder horse oil platform , one of its biggest under development , was damaged earlier in july after hurricane dennis battered the gulf of mexico .
thunder horse was set to start pumping oil later this year , and peak output was expected at 250,000 barrels a day .
the project was meant to start pumping by the end of 2005 at the latest , but this may be delayed for six months until a us coast guard inquiry is completed .
refinery blast bp also said it was paying a charge of $ 700m in respect of all fatality and personal injury compensation claims associated with the incident at its texas city refinery on 23 march .
in may , bp accepted responsibility for a " series of failures " by staff which it said led to a fatal explosion at its largest us refinery .
the blast and subsequent fire at the refinery near houston claimed 15 lives and injured 170 .
meanwhile , the firm has said it will continue with its share buyback strategy in the second half of the year , which it expects to be at least $ 6bn .
however , lord browne warned it was not certain that the second six months would be as profitable as the first half of 2005 .
" the outlook for retail margins remains uncertain with continuing crude and product price volatility , " he said .
" rising product prices have dampened margins over the past few weeks and have contributed to a weak start to the third quarter . "
bp 's shares fell 2 % to 629.5 pence as investors factored in the cost of the compensation pay-out .

in 2003 , he tried to sell the photos back to her for $ 3.5m -lrb- £ 2m -rrb- .
speaking after the verdict , ms diaz said : " i am very gratified that justice has been served . "

if she did not pay up , he said he would offer the photos for sale worldwide .
ms diaz told the court the photographer told her the buyers were going to put the pictures in magazine spreads and on buses and advertising boards .
the actress contacted the authorities , who arrested rutter after a sting operation .

a permanent injunction has been issued prohibiting rutter from distributing the picture .

rutter had told the actress he was giving her " first refusal " to buy the photos taken 11 years earlier when she was an unknown teenage model , presenting her with a forged model release form .
if she did not pay up , he said he would offer the photos for sale worldwide .
ms diaz told the court the photographer told her the buyers were going to put the pictures in magazine spreads and on buses and advertising boards .
the actress contacted the authorities , who arrested rutter after a sting operation .
injunction rutter denied in court that he had forged ms diaz 's signature on the release form .
however , he accepted the signature was probably not real .
he was charged with theft over the alleged blackmail scheme , and perjury for testifying that the signature was authentic .
ms diaz , 32 , said in court she had never signed a release form for the shoot .
a permanent injunction has been issued prohibiting rutter from distributing the picture .
rutter was taken into custody after the verdict .
he is scheduled to be sentenced on 15 september .
the district lawyer 's office is now considering the possibility of bringing conspiracy charges against agencies or individuals who orchestrate photo ambushes .
they are also looking into whether the dogged pursuit of celebrities by the paparazzi constitutes a crime .

researchers interviewed 400 people in the county last month for the study on behalf of cumbria safety cameras .
the organisation said some of the results were " pleasantly surprising " and that most people were in favour of the work it was doing .
but paul smith , from safe speed , claimed the survey was geared to produce a positive response .
the research found seven out of 10 thought the cameras were meant to encourage drivers to keep to limits , were not there to punish them and disagreed there were too many cameras in cumbria .
questioned cameras two thirds agreed that less accidents happen on roads where cameras are installed and three fifths agreed that cameras mean dangerous drivers are more likely to be caught .
cumbria safety camera spokesman kevin tea said : " while 45 % of those surveyed said that the use of cameras had made them change the way they drove , this figure rose to 58 % in the 16-24 age group , a sector we thought we may not have been getting through to .
" this age group represents a high proportion of those killed and seriously injured and we need to make them aware of their vulnerability . "
mr smith questioned the success of speed cameras in saving lives .
he said : " we have now get a nation of drivers who are more concerned with the number on their speedometer from time to time than they are with what 's going on in the road ahead .
" they are more concerned for their driving licence and the location of the next camera from what 's going on on the road ahead . "

researchers interviewed 400 people in the county last month for the study on behalf of cumbria safety cameras .
the organisation said some of the results were " pleasantly surprising " and that most people were in favour of the work it was doing .
but paul smith , from safe speed , claimed the survey was geared to produce a positive response .
the research found seven out of 10 thought the cameras were meant to encourage drivers to keep to limits , were not there to punish them and disagreed there were too many cameras in cumbria .
questioned cameras two thirds agreed that less accidents happen on roads where cameras are installed and three fifths agreed that cameras mean dangerous drivers are more likely to be caught .
cumbria safety camera spokesman kevin tea said : " while 45 % of those surveyed said that the use of cameras had made them change the way they drove , this figure rose to 58 % in the 16-24 age group , a sector we thought we may not have been getting through to .
" this age group represents a high proportion of those killed and seriously injured and we need to make them aware of their vulnerability . "
mr smith questioned the success of speed cameras in saving lives .
he said : " we have now get a nation of drivers who are more concerned with the number on their speedometer from time to time than they are with what 's going on in the road ahead .
" they are more concerned for their driving licence and the location of the next camera from what 's going on on the road ahead . "
