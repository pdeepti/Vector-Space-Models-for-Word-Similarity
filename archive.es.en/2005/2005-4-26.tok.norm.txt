the wig will make it even easier to transform herself into her alter ego , madonna .
not that the transformation is difficult .
totten bears a striking resemblance to the " material girl . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : looks like the real thing - melissa totten as madonna in " stars in concert " later , when totten performs " express yourself " dressed in a replica of the infamous jean paul gaultier-designed " cone " corset , it 's easy to forget you 're watching an impersonator . " what i 've heard people say is there are lookalikes in europe , but they 're not on the level where they 're singing live , playing instruments , dancing , and doing everything , " says totten , who has been " doing " madonna for 10 years .
" when people see our show , they 're seeing the best of what they can see . " winning formula totten is a regular in " stars in concert , " which has been running at the estrel for eight years .
producer bernhard kurz - the man credited with first bringing musicals such as " cats " and " phantom of the opera " to germany - has clearly hit on winning formula . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tom jones impersonator performing at the estrel hotel " stars " has a continually rotating line-up of six performers who each do their own set .
even repeat customers - of which there are many - can count on seeing new acts , which range from tom jones and louis armstrong to celine dion and whitney houston . but when kurz first introduced " stars , " he had no idea the show would still be going strong today . " he brought the idea for ' stars in concert ' directly from las vegas , and the aim was to have the show for one year , " said press spokeswoman mihaela djuranovic .
" it 's the kind of success no one really predicted at the beginning . " the doppelganger concept encountered a certain amount of skepticism at first , djuranovic says .
there was n't much of a tradition for such entertainment in germany , and people tended to lump it in with karaoke .
the performers are aware of this , but see it as their job to win germany over , one show at a time . " some people take it as a joke , have a laugh and say , oh , they 're just impersonators , but there are actually a lot of talented people in the business , " says grahame p. doyle , the elvis of " stars in concert . " he should know .
in the world of showbiz impersonators , being elvis is possibly the biggest challenge of all , due to the extraordinary amount of competition . " there 's a lot of elvis impersonators - maybe as many as 40,000 around the world , " says doyle .
" but if you break it down to the handful that give you goose bumps , those that truly bring respect to his character , then you can knock off about 95 percent of those people . " bildunterschrift : " jail house rock " tough audience doyle is one of the more sought-after elvis doppelgangers .
he performed the las vegas circuit for seven years before producer kurz could finally lure him to berlin .
it was a radical change , says doyle , but a welcome one . " berlin is laid back and chilled , and vegas is about getting your party on , " he says .
" there , you have to walk through casinos to get to work .
it 's a completely different atmosphere .
and because vegas is so loose , the audience responds that way too . " berlin audiences , on the other hand , are much more reserved , the performers say . " we were always told when we first came to berlin that berlin was the toughest audience in germany , " totten , alias madonna , says .
" they 're very proper , but they 're also very respectful .
i love the way people dress and come to the show , and they have great things to say afterwards , so i think they appreciate it and we appreciate them . " riding on the success of " stars " in berlin , kurz opened a second venue for the show in essen , western germany , in 2003 .
and it does n't stop there .
adapting the concept , kurz is also behind tribute shows to particular artists or groups such as the beatles , abba , and the blues brothers . in the land of goethe and wagner , it 's not intellectual , nor does it aim to be .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 26.04.2005 gloomy news again for german economy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a slight upturn , germany 's economy is dropping off again instead of building on last year 's recovery , the german economy appears to be heading downhill again .
on tuesday , the country 's top economic institutes slashed their growth forecast for 2005 . the outlook for germany 's stuttering economy has become decidedly gloomier following the decision by six leading economic institutes to halve their growth forecast for the eurozone 's biggest economy this year . the institutes slashed their 2005 growth forecast to just 0.7 percent from 1.5 percent , heralding tough times for the government , which is eager to cut unemployment and get its public finances in order ahead of the general election next year . but the institutes ' gloomy report is in line with the latest forecasts by the international monetary fund and the european commission , which are both pencilling in german growth of a meager 0.8 percent this year . " the german economy finds itself in a spot of economic weakness this spring , " the institutes said .
" the strong recovery observed in the first half of 2004 has come to a standstill . " opposition : a government of " mini-growth " in 2004 , the german economy had expanded by 1.6 percent , a substantial improvement on the previous year 's lacklustre 1.1 percent , largely thanks to the increased number of working days .
those positive calendar effects are set to be reversed this year .
in addition , global growth has slowed tangibly and the strong euro was weighing on german exports , previously the main driver of growth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exports are down due to the weak dollar and strong euro " the impulses from domestic demand remain weak and are unable to offset the easing of export growth .
so the general weak economic trend remains intact , " the institutes diagnosed . the news was met with fierce criticism from the opposition , which attacked chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government with of social democrats and greens for failing to revive the economy . " red-green remains the government of mini growth , " said rainer brüderle , the deputy leader of the market-oriented free democratic party .
" the upturn is over before it 's even begun . " weak domestic economy no improvement was in sight in domestic demand given the high level of unemployment and with growth set to remain only sluggish , no substantial improvements could be expected on the labor market in the near future , the institutes said . the jobless total , which stood at 4.381 million or 10.2 percent of the workforce in 2004 , was expected to average 4.844 million this year , equivalent to a jobless rate of 11.1 percent .
and next year , it would come down to 4.518 million or 10.4 percent , the institutes predicted . the combination of weak growth and high unemployment also signalled bad news for germany 's public finances . the institutes predicted that the german public deficit would again breach european union limits both this year and next year . " the crisis in the labor market slows our economic growth , " said axel nitschke , chief economist at the german chambers of industry and commerce , the dihk .
" the government can not let the appeal by the research institutes to fall on deaf ears . " bad news , but signs of hope the institutes said they expected the german public deficit to amount to 3.4 percent of gdp this year and 3.3 percent in 2006 , breaching the 3.0-percent limit laid down in the eu 's stability and growth pact for the fourth and fifth years running . the government had vowed to bring the deficit ratio back below 3.0 percent this year .
nevertheless , the institutes said that the current weak economic phase " will gradually be overcome during the course of the year . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high oil prices , currently a damper on the economy 's growth , are likely to recede and aid a recovery before the end of the year the effects of high oil prices would disappear and global growth was set to pick up speed again , which would be good news for exports .
low interest rates will also fuel domestic demand , adding to the momentum , according to both the institutes and the government . " impulses will come from exports , but they will also gradually feed through to the domestic economy , " economy and labor minister wolfgang clement said in a statement . in addition , the government 's labor market reforms and other structural reforms would begin to bear fruit and berlin would press ahead with further reforms in order to strengthen growth prospects in medium-to-long term .
the government 's current official growth forecast for this year stands at 1.6 percent .
but it is expected to revise it downward sharply on friday , with press reports mooting a figure of around 1.0 percent . dw staff afp / -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany backs toward the future cars , electronics and quality industrial goods have all helped make germany the world 's leading exporter .

"
" what 's at stake is something truly historic : the idea of a europe united in response to the horrors of fascism , " the german chancellor said earlier , adding he hoped that france , " the cradle of this idea , remains true to its promises " . ' non ' would have enormous consequences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : posters encourage french citizens to reject the consitution .
but the " non " camp is losing ground schröder 's visit to paris for a joint franco-german cabinet meeting gave the social democratic german chancellor a chance to help the center-right chirac woo unconvinced voters on the political left ahead of the key vote .
the constitution , which aims to simplify decision-making in the expanded eu , must be approved by all 25 eu member states .
a rejection in france would have enormous repercussions , both within the country and across the european union .
chirac - who has staked his prestige on a ' yes ' vote - warned opponents that should they triumph , they would bear rresponsibility for interrupting 50 years of european construction " .
by approving the text , france instead would be " making the choice of a europe that is more social , more independent and more powerful , " he said .
the two leaders said earlier in a statement that the constitution would " be an important step in terms of asserting europe 's weight in the international arena and reinforcing its ability to act for peace and security in the world " .
chirac and schröder highlighted the fact that the constitution marked a " major step " in the realization of the " european political project " , adding that it would reinforce " the sphere of activity of european defense " . " europe must go on the offensive " the joint franco-german cabinet meeting , focused on industrial cooperation , was intended to showcase the dynamic nature of europe 's economy and its ability to compete with the united states and emerging economic powers .
the ministers adopted four pilot projects - two on biomedical research , and two others on information technology - that will bring together business consortiums and research laboratories from the two states .
in a speech at the sorbonne , with schröder by his side , chirac said europe must " go on the offensive and make a massive commitment to innovation " . " with the emergence of major players like china and india , with the united states and japan moving forward more than ever , what 's at stake is technological supremacy in this world , " chirac said .
during their morning meeting , chirac and schröder also discussed the eu 's 2007-2013 budget and a controversial draft eu law on the liberalization of the eu services sector .
chirac told reporters that the so-called bolkestein directive on the bloc 's services sector " no longer exists " . he added that paris and berlin would work to ensure that any revised draft would not include a " country-of-origin " clause which suggests that companies could provide services throughout the eu using the laws of their own country . dw staff / afp -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crisis deepens over french eu stance even as french voters look set to torpedo the eu constitution in a referendum , luxembourg premier juncker added a new twist to the dilemma this week , saying the us hopes the french will reject the treaty .

fischer ducked and dived , but in the end he admitted a visa policy that allowed thousands of criminals into the country was his responsibility .
but there wo n't be any consequences , says wolter von tiesenhausen . the parliamentary committee grilled fischer for over 12 hours as tv cameras recorded the whole thing . everyone was able to witness how the foreign minister tried to extricate himself from the affair , how the opposition parliamentarians took pains to set traps for him and allied parliamentarians from fischer 's red-green coalition government tried to defend their man . that was interesting for a short while , and not without humor .
but stretched out over an entire day , and including many repetitions , it was rather tiresome . fischer 's understanding of democracy the result of all these efforts can be summed up quickly : the foreign minister admitted mistakes .
the granting of visas to come into the country through the so-called volmer decree -lrb- former state secretary ludwig vollmer allegedly ordered embassies to grant visas even if in doubt -rrb- took on dimensions that no one had anticipated .
that criminals were also abusing the generous german visa system , which was something the top level of the foreign office , and the minister , ignored for a long time .
the correction came too late , despite warnings from the interior minister and a few states . in his testimony , fischer tried to turn the tables and make the opposition responsible for making a scandal out of the entire process .
this method of yelling " stop thief ! " and then hiding behind the corner speaks to the skewed understanding the witness fischer has of democracy . the discovery of mistakes made by ministers belongs to the basic duties of an opposition party in a democracy .
the actual frustration is the minister 's false appraisal and that he looked the other way for so long . the good news on this point , the committee - despite all its problems as an institution that charges , defends and judges - contributed to clarification . the minister gave up his initial evasive maneuvers and admitted full responsibility .
it is now also beyond dispute that the correction -lrb- of policies -rrb- did n't happen immediately , but with too great a delay .
the minister is also responsible for that .
the consequences were that many thousands of illegal workers , prostitutes and criminals were not able to only travel to germany but to other european countries . the committee proved all of that .
but it ca n't force the minister to accept consequences .
chancellor gerhard schröder can do that , but would hardly think of breaking off the cornerstone of his coalition .
as a result , the final judgment over the ' visa affair ' wo n't come until the federal elections in 2006 . wolter von tiesenhausen -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer accepts blame in immigration probe german foreign minister joschka fischer admitted on monday that he failed to act more quickly to stop visa abuses which allowed tens of thousands of eastern europeans to flood into germany between 2000 and 2003 .

but he rounded on the opposition christian democrats , accusing them of exaggerating the scale of the problem and dismissed claims that germany had been overrun by an influx of criminals . opposition calls for fischer to stand down inevitably , the opposition renewed their call for fischer 's resignation .

" we are now past the high point of this scandal , there are no new revelations to emerge , " it said .
the conservative frankfurter allgemeine zeitung was less convinced , saying : " fischer gave it his best .
we will see if it was enough . " and die w elt , also a conservative paper , criticised what it said were all too frequent gaps in fischer 's memory .
" what fischer left out of this ' acrobatic ' recollection is what sticks in the memory - of a minister who has n't got a grip on his own department . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schroeder supports fischer all the way most of the newspapers , however , accepted that a major factor in fischer 's favor was that he has schröder 's support .
in an interview in sunday 's edition of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung the chancellor said : " the foreign minister will remain the foreign minister .

on tuesday , the country 's top economic institutes slashed their growth forecast for 2005 . the outlook for germany 's stuttering economy has become decidedly gloomier following the decision by six leading economic institutes to halve their growth forecast for the eurozone 's biggest economy this year . the institutes slashed their 2005 growth forecast to just 0.7 percent from 1.5 percent , heralding tough times for the government , which is eager to cut unemployment and get its public finances in order ahead of the general election next year . but the institutes ' gloomy report is in line with the latest forecasts by the international monetary fund and the european commission , which are both pencilling in german growth of a meager 0.8 percent this year . " the german economy finds itself in a spot of economic weakness this spring , " the institutes said .
" the strong recovery observed in the first half of 2004 has come to a standstill . " opposition : a government of " mini-growth " in 2004 , the german economy had expanded by 1.6 percent , a substantial improvement on the previous year 's lacklustre 1.1 percent , largely thanks to the increased number of working days .
those positive calendar effects are set to be reversed this year .
in addition , global growth has slowed tangibly and the strong euro was weighing on german exports , previously the main driver of growth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exports are down due to the weak dollar and strong euro " the impulses from domestic demand remain weak and are unable to offset the easing of export growth .
so the general weak economic trend remains intact , " the institutes diagnosed . the news was met with fierce criticism from the opposition , which attacked chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government with of social democrats and greens for failing to revive the economy . " red-green remains the government of mini growth , " said rainer brüderle , the deputy leader of the market-oriented free democratic party .
" the upturn is over before it 's even begun . " weak domestic economy no improvement was in sight in domestic demand given the high level of unemployment and with growth set to remain only sluggish , no substantial improvements could be expected on the labor market in the near future , the institutes said . the jobless total , which stood at 4.381 million or 10.2 percent of the workforce in 2004 , was expected to average 4.844 million this year , equivalent to a jobless rate of 11.1 percent .
and next year , it would come down to 4.518 million or 10.4 percent , the institutes predicted . the combination of weak growth and high unemployment also signalled bad news for germany 's public finances . the institutes predicted that the german public deficit would again breach european union limits both this year and next year . " the crisis in the labor market slows our economic growth , " said axel nitschke , chief economist at the german chambers of industry and commerce , the dihk .
" the government can not let the appeal by the research institutes to fall on deaf ears . " bad news , but signs of hope the institutes said they expected the german public deficit to amount to 3.4 percent of gdp this year and 3.3 percent in 2006 , breaching the 3.0-percent limit laid down in the eu 's stability and growth pact for the fourth and fifth years running . the government had vowed to bring the deficit ratio back below 3.0 percent this year .
nevertheless , the institutes said that the current weak economic phase " will gradually be overcome during the course of the year . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high oil prices , currently a damper on the economy 's growth , are likely to recede and aid a recovery before the end of the year the effects of high oil prices would disappear and global growth was set to pick up speed again , which would be good news for exports .
low interest rates will also fuel domestic demand , adding to the momentum , according to both the institutes and the government . " impulses will come from exports , but they will also gradually feed through to the domestic economy , " economy and labor minister wolfgang clement said in a statement . in addition , the government 's labor market reforms and other structural reforms would begin to bear fruit and berlin would press ahead with further reforms in order to strengthen growth prospects in medium-to-long term .

on tuesday , the country 's top economic institutes slashed their growth forecast for 2005 . the outlook for germany 's stuttering economy has become decidedly gloomier following the decision by six leading economic institutes to halve their growth forecast for the eurozone 's biggest economy this year . the institutes slashed their 2005 growth forecast to just 0.7 percent from 1.5 percent , heralding tough times for the government , which is eager to cut unemployment and get its public finances in order ahead of the general election next year . but the institutes ' gloomy report is in line with the latest forecasts by the international monetary fund and the european commission , which are both pencilling in german growth of a meager 0.8 percent this year . " the german economy finds itself in a spot of economic weakness this spring , " the institutes said .
" the strong recovery observed in the first half of 2004 has come to a standstill . " opposition : a government of " mini-growth " in 2004 , the german economy had expanded by 1.6 percent , a substantial improvement on the previous year 's lacklustre 1.1 percent , largely thanks to the increased number of working days .
those positive calendar effects are set to be reversed this year .
in addition , global growth has slowed tangibly and the strong euro was weighing on german exports , previously the main driver of growth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exports are down due to the weak dollar and strong euro " the impulses from domestic demand remain weak and are unable to offset the easing of export growth .
so the general weak economic trend remains intact , " the institutes diagnosed . the news was met with fierce criticism from the opposition , which attacked chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government with of social democrats and greens for failing to revive the economy . " red-green remains the government of mini growth , " said rainer brüderle , the deputy leader of the market-oriented free democratic party .
" the upturn is over before it 's even begun . " weak domestic economy no improvement was in sight in domestic demand given the high level of unemployment and with growth set to remain only sluggish , no substantial improvements could be expected on the labor market in the near future , the institutes said . the jobless total , which stood at 4.381 million or 10.2 percent of the workforce in 2004 , was expected to average 4.844 million this year , equivalent to a jobless rate of 11.1 percent .
and next year , it would come down to 4.518 million or 10.4 percent , the institutes predicted . the combination of weak growth and high unemployment also signalled bad news for germany 's public finances . the institutes predicted that the german public deficit would again breach european union limits both this year and next year . " the crisis in the labor market slows our economic growth , " said axel nitschke , chief economist at the german chambers of industry and commerce , the dihk .
" the government can not let the appeal by the research institutes to fall on deaf ears . " bad news , but signs of hope the institutes said they expected the german public deficit to amount to 3.4 percent of gdp this year and 3.3 percent in 2006 , breaching the 3.0-percent limit laid down in the eu 's stability and growth pact for the fourth and fifth years running . the government had vowed to bring the deficit ratio back below 3.0 percent this year .
nevertheless , the institutes said that the current weak economic phase " will gradually be overcome during the course of the year . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high oil prices , currently a damper on the economy 's growth , are likely to recede and aid a recovery before the end of the year the effects of high oil prices would disappear and global growth was set to pick up speed again , which would be good news for exports .

rather , germans are flocking to a vegas-style show featuring some of the world ’ s best doppelgangers . backstage at berlin 's estrel festival center , melissa totten toys with the platinum blonde curls on her new custom-made wig .
" just this morning , my hair was this same color , " she says , running a hand through her own hair , which has now been dyed a darker , caramel blonde .
the wig will make it even easier to transform herself into her alter ego , madonna .
not that the transformation is difficult .
totten bears a striking resemblance to the " material girl . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : looks like the real thing - melissa totten as madonna in " stars in concert " later , when totten performs " express yourself " dressed in a replica of the infamous jean paul gaultier-designed " cone " corset , it 's easy to forget you 're watching an impersonator . " what i 've heard people say is there are lookalikes in europe , but they 're not on the level where they 're singing live , playing instruments , dancing , and doing everything , " says totten , who has been " doing " madonna for 10 years .
" when people see our show , they 're seeing the best of what they can see . " winning formula totten is a regular in " stars in concert , " which has been running at the estrel for eight years .
producer bernhard kurz - the man credited with first bringing musicals such as " cats " and " phantom of the opera " to germany - has clearly hit on winning formula . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tom jones impersonator performing at the estrel hotel " stars " has a continually rotating line-up of six performers who each do their own set .
even repeat customers - of which there are many - can count on seeing new acts , which range from tom jones and louis armstrong to celine dion and whitney houston . but when kurz first introduced " stars , " he had no idea the show would still be going strong today . " he brought the idea for ' stars in concert ' directly from las vegas , and the aim was to have the show for one year , " said press spokeswoman mihaela djuranovic .
" it 's the kind of success no one really predicted at the beginning . " the doppelganger concept encountered a certain amount of skepticism at first , djuranovic says .
there was n't much of a tradition for such entertainment in germany , and people tended to lump it in with karaoke .
the performers are aware of this , but see it as their job to win germany over , one show at a time . " some people take it as a joke , have a laugh and say , oh , they 're just impersonators , but there are actually a lot of talented people in the business , " says grahame p. doyle , the elvis of " stars in concert . " he should know .
in the world of showbiz impersonators , being elvis is possibly the biggest challenge of all , due to the extraordinary amount of competition . " there 's a lot of elvis impersonators - maybe as many as 40,000 around the world , " says doyle .
" but if you break it down to the handful that give you goose bumps , those that truly bring respect to his character , then you can knock off about 95 percent of those people . " bildunterschrift : " jail house rock " tough audience doyle is one of the more sought-after elvis doppelgangers .
he performed the las vegas circuit for seven years before producer kurz could finally lure him to berlin .
it was a radical change , says doyle , but a welcome one . " berlin is laid back and chilled , and vegas is about getting your party on , " he says .
" there , you have to walk through casinos to get to work .
it 's a completely different atmosphere .
and because vegas is so loose , the audience responds that way too . " berlin audiences , on the other hand , are much more reserved , the performers say . " we were always told when we first came to berlin that berlin was the toughest audience in germany , " totten , alias madonna , says .
" they 're very proper , but they 're also very respectful .
i love the way people dress and come to the show , and they have great things to say afterwards , so i think they appreciate it and we appreciate them . " riding on the success of " stars " in berlin , kurz opened a second venue for the show in essen , western germany , in 2003 .
and it does n't stop there .
adapting the concept , kurz is also behind tribute shows to particular artists or groups such as the beatles , abba , and the blues brothers . in the land of goethe and wagner , it 's not intellectual , nor does it aim to be .

the goods are new , unused - and pirated copies of the originals . rüdiger von fritsch-scherhausen , deputy head of germany 's federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- fears that such counterfeit items will increasingly appear for sale in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " cd bootlegs , for example , from the area east of the external borders end up in large amounts on the markets , " he said .
the governments in eastern european had indeed introduced countermeasures and passed new laws based on western norms .
" but mix-ups over competency and corruption prevent application . " the european commission estimates that german business misses out on 20-30 billion euros and 70,000 jobs due to counterfeiting .
the pirated goods are made in eastern europe or asia and sold on the streets or even in legal stores after a bit of graft has changed hands .
the bnd describes it as organized crime , where the big fish escape criminal persecution because they pay high bribes . high costs in 2003 , before the eu grew from 10 to 25 states , german customs confiscated 50 million pirated items , including 41,000 copies of viagra pills and 11,000 turn-signal indicators .
fritsch-scherhausen is concerned that since eu expansion in 2004 , the german authorities wo n't succeed in confiscating as much .
" regular customs checks will cease , at the same time as the traffic in goods and of people will increase . "
the vast array of counterfeit products already available beyond the border will make it to the german market , he believes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microchip production german businesses are trying to protect themselves , too .
jürgen järnecke , security head at computer chip manufacturer infineon , keeps an eye on the situation , including internet auctions .
he said he often discovers that goods for sale under the name infineon that could n't possibly stem from his company . but copying high-tech products like computer chips or machines requires much more than just switching a labels .
pirates frequently get their hands on secret information through spying .
" we must assume that german firms are also decidedly the targets of espionage from competing firms , but also from intelligence services in other regions of the world , " said von fritsch-scherhausen .
insufficient security and it 's becoming more dangerous the more information companies save and communicate digitally .
reports surface again and again of instances of hackers successfully gaining access to the secret data of companies thought to be impregnable . von fritsch-scherhausen criticizes companies for failing to handle sensitive data with enough caution , adding that some firms are so bold as to transmit entire contracts over mobile phones .
" we could just as well use a megaphone ; it would have the same effect , " he said . despite the dangers of espionage and the enthusiasm for counterfeiting , businesses still seem to find eu expansion more useful rather than damaging .
otherwise , they would hardly be moving a growing amount of production to the new members in eastern europe . manfred götzke -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fake designer goods cost france dearly france is the world 's largest manufacturer of luxury goods ; 250,000 people are employed by the sector .

"
" what 's at stake is something truly historic : the idea of a europe united in response to the horrors of fascism , " the german chancellor said earlier , adding he hoped that france , " the cradle of this idea , remains true to its promises " . ' non ' would have enormous consequences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : posters encourage french citizens to reject the consitution .
but the " non " camp is losing ground schröder 's visit to paris for a joint franco-german cabinet meeting gave the social democratic german chancellor a chance to help the center-right chirac woo unconvinced voters on the political left ahead of the key vote .
the constitution , which aims to simplify decision-making in the expanded eu , must be approved by all 25 eu member states .
a rejection in france would have enormous repercussions , both within the country and across the european union .
chirac - who has staked his prestige on a ' yes ' vote - warned opponents that should they triumph , they would bear rresponsibility for interrupting 50 years of european construction " .
by approving the text , france instead would be " making the choice of a europe that is more social , more independent and more powerful , " he said .
the two leaders said earlier in a statement that the constitution would " be an important step in terms of asserting europe 's weight in the international arena and reinforcing its ability to act for peace and security in the world " .
chirac and schröder highlighted the fact that the constitution marked a " major step " in the realization of the " european political project " , adding that it would reinforce " the sphere of activity of european defense " . " europe must go on the offensive " the joint franco-german cabinet meeting , focused on industrial cooperation , was intended to showcase the dynamic nature of europe 's economy and its ability to compete with the united states and emerging economic powers .
the ministers adopted four pilot projects - two on biomedical research , and two others on information technology - that will bring together business consortiums and research laboratories from the two states .
in a speech at the sorbonne , with schröder by his side , chirac said europe must " go on the offensive and make a massive commitment to innovation " . " with the emergence of major players like china and india , with the united states and japan moving forward more than ever , what 's at stake is technological supremacy in this world , " chirac said .
during their morning meeting , chirac and schröder also discussed the eu 's 2007-2013 budget and a controversial draft eu law on the liberalization of the eu services sector .
chirac told reporters that the so-called bolkestein directive on the bloc 's services sector " no longer exists " . he added that paris and berlin would work to ensure that any revised draft would not include a " country-of-origin " clause which suggests that companies could provide services throughout the eu using the laws of their own country . dw staff / afp -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crisis deepens over french eu stance even as french voters look set to torpedo the eu constitution in a referendum , luxembourg premier juncker added a new twist to the dilemma this week , saying the us hopes the french will reject the treaty .

fischer ducked and dived , but in the end he admitted a visa policy that allowed thousands of criminals into the country was his responsibility .
but there wo n't be any consequences , says wolter von tiesenhausen . the parliamentary committee grilled fischer for over 12 hours as tv cameras recorded the whole thing . everyone was able to witness how the foreign minister tried to extricate himself from the affair , how the opposition parliamentarians took pains to set traps for him and allied parliamentarians from fischer 's red-green coalition government tried to defend their man . that was interesting for a short while , and not without humor .
but stretched out over an entire day , and including many repetitions , it was rather tiresome . fischer 's understanding of democracy the result of all these efforts can be summed up quickly : the foreign minister admitted mistakes .
the granting of visas to come into the country through the so-called volmer decree -lrb- former state secretary ludwig vollmer allegedly ordered embassies to grant visas even if in doubt -rrb- took on dimensions that no one had anticipated .
that criminals were also abusing the generous german visa system , which was something the top level of the foreign office , and the minister , ignored for a long time .
the correction came too late , despite warnings from the interior minister and a few states . in his testimony , fischer tried to turn the tables and make the opposition responsible for making a scandal out of the entire process .
this method of yelling " stop thief ! " and then hiding behind the corner speaks to the skewed understanding the witness fischer has of democracy . the discovery of mistakes made by ministers belongs to the basic duties of an opposition party in a democracy .
the actual frustration is the minister 's false appraisal and that he looked the other way for so long . the good news on this point , the committee - despite all its problems as an institution that charges , defends and judges - contributed to clarification . the minister gave up his initial evasive maneuvers and admitted full responsibility .
it is now also beyond dispute that the correction -lrb- of policies -rrb- did n't happen immediately , but with too great a delay .
the minister is also responsible for that .
the consequences were that many thousands of illegal workers , prostitutes and criminals were not able to only travel to germany but to other european countries . the committee proved all of that .
but it ca n't force the minister to accept consequences .
chancellor gerhard schröder can do that , but would hardly think of breaking off the cornerstone of his coalition .
as a result , the final judgment over the ' visa affair ' wo n't come until the federal elections in 2006 . wolter von tiesenhausen -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer accepts blame in immigration probe german foreign minister joschka fischer admitted on monday that he failed to act more quickly to stop visa abuses which allowed tens of thousands of eastern europeans to flood into germany between 2000 and 2003 .

this method of yelling " stop thief ! " and then hiding behind the corner speaks to the skewed understanding the witness fischer has of democracy . the discovery of mistakes made by ministers belongs to the basic duties of an opposition party in a democracy .
the actual frustration is the minister 's false appraisal and that he looked the other way for so long . the good news on this point , the committee - despite all its problems as an institution that charges , defends and judges - contributed to clarification . the minister gave up his initial evasive maneuvers and admitted full responsibility .

the minister is also responsible for that .
the consequences were that many thousands of illegal workers , prostitutes and criminals were not able to only travel to germany but to other european countries . the committee proved all of that .

" the 2006 world cup on home soil will offer him the perfect stage to join recent greats such as zinedine zidane and pavel nedved . "
ballack has scored 22 goals in 50 internationals for germany marking him out as one of the most dangerous attacking midfielders in europe . " michael is a world class player and all of us in the german national team know this , " added klinsmann .

on tuesday , the country 's top economic institutes slashed their growth forecast for 2005 . the outlook for germany 's stuttering economy has become decidedly gloomier following the decision by six leading economic institutes to halve their growth forecast for the eurozone 's biggest economy this year . the institutes slashed their 2005 growth forecast to just 0.7 percent from 1.5 percent , heralding tough times for the government , which is eager to cut unemployment and get its public finances in order ahead of the general election next year . but the institutes ' gloomy report is in line with the latest forecasts by the international monetary fund and the european commission , which are both pencilling in german growth of a meager 0.8 percent this year . " the german economy finds itself in a spot of economic weakness this spring , " the institutes said .
" the strong recovery observed in the first half of 2004 has come to a standstill . " opposition : a government of " mini-growth " in 2004 , the german economy had expanded by 1.6 percent , a substantial improvement on the previous year 's lacklustre 1.1 percent , largely thanks to the increased number of working days .
those positive calendar effects are set to be reversed this year .
in addition , global growth has slowed tangibly and the strong euro was weighing on german exports , previously the main driver of growth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exports are down due to the weak dollar and strong euro " the impulses from domestic demand remain weak and are unable to offset the easing of export growth .
so the general weak economic trend remains intact , " the institutes diagnosed . the news was met with fierce criticism from the opposition , which attacked chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government with of social democrats and greens for failing to revive the economy . " red-green remains the government of mini growth , " said rainer brüderle , the deputy leader of the market-oriented free democratic party .
" the upturn is over before it 's even begun . " weak domestic economy no improvement was in sight in domestic demand given the high level of unemployment and with growth set to remain only sluggish , no substantial improvements could be expected on the labor market in the near future , the institutes said . the jobless total , which stood at 4.381 million or 10.2 percent of the workforce in 2004 , was expected to average 4.844 million this year , equivalent to a jobless rate of 11.1 percent .
and next year , it would come down to 4.518 million or 10.4 percent , the institutes predicted . the combination of weak growth and high unemployment also signalled bad news for germany 's public finances . the institutes predicted that the german public deficit would again breach european union limits both this year and next year . " the crisis in the labor market slows our economic growth , " said axel nitschke , chief economist at the german chambers of industry and commerce , the dihk .
" the government can not let the appeal by the research institutes to fall on deaf ears . " bad news , but signs of hope the institutes said they expected the german public deficit to amount to 3.4 percent of gdp this year and 3.3 percent in 2006 , breaching the 3.0-percent limit laid down in the eu 's stability and growth pact for the fourth and fifth years running . the government had vowed to bring the deficit ratio back below 3.0 percent this year .
nevertheless , the institutes said that the current weak economic phase " will gradually be overcome during the course of the year . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high oil prices , currently a damper on the economy 's growth , are likely to recede and aid a recovery before the end of the year the effects of high oil prices would disappear and global growth was set to pick up speed again , which would be good news for exports .
low interest rates will also fuel domestic demand , adding to the momentum , according to both the institutes and the government . " impulses will come from exports , but they will also gradually feed through to the domestic economy , " economy and labor minister wolfgang clement said in a statement . in addition , the government 's labor market reforms and other structural reforms would begin to bear fruit and berlin would press ahead with further reforms in order to strengthen growth prospects in medium-to-long term .
the government 's current official growth forecast for this year stands at 1.6 percent .
but it is expected to revise it downward sharply on friday , with press reports mooting a figure of around 1.0 percent . dw staff afp / -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany backs toward the future cars , electronics and quality industrial goods have all helped make germany the world 's leading exporter .

on tuesday , the country 's top economic institutes slashed their growth forecast for 2005 . the outlook for germany 's stuttering economy has become decidedly gloomier following the decision by six leading economic institutes to halve their growth forecast for the eurozone 's biggest economy this year . the institutes slashed their 2005 growth forecast to just 0.7 percent from 1.5 percent , heralding tough times for the government , which is eager to cut unemployment and get its public finances in order ahead of the general election next year . but the institutes ' gloomy report is in line with the latest forecasts by the international monetary fund and the european commission , which are both pencilling in german growth of a meager 0.8 percent this year . " the german economy finds itself in a spot of economic weakness this spring , " the institutes said .
" the strong recovery observed in the first half of 2004 has come to a standstill . " opposition : a government of " mini-growth " in 2004 , the german economy had expanded by 1.6 percent , a substantial improvement on the previous year 's lacklustre 1.1 percent , largely thanks to the increased number of working days .
those positive calendar effects are set to be reversed this year .
in addition , global growth has slowed tangibly and the strong euro was weighing on german exports , previously the main driver of growth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exports are down due to the weak dollar and strong euro " the impulses from domestic demand remain weak and are unable to offset the easing of export growth .

" weak domestic economy no improvement was in sight in domestic demand given the high level of unemployment and with growth set to remain only sluggish , no substantial improvements could be expected on the labor market in the near future , the institutes said . the jobless total , which stood at 4.381 million or 10.2 percent of the workforce in 2004 , was expected to average 4.844 million this year , equivalent to a jobless rate of 11.1 percent .
and next year , it would come down to 4.518 million or 10.4 percent , the institutes predicted . the combination of weak growth and high unemployment also signalled bad news for germany 's public finances . the institutes predicted that the german public deficit would again breach european union limits both this year and next year .

low interest rates will also fuel domestic demand , adding to the momentum , according to both the institutes and the government . " impulses will come from exports , but they will also gradually feed through to the domestic economy , " economy and labor minister wolfgang clement said in a statement . in addition , the government 's labor market reforms and other structural reforms would begin to bear fruit and berlin would press ahead with further reforms in order to strengthen growth prospects in medium-to-long term .

" i think germany could potentially play a constructive role in helping the iraqis draft the constitution because of your federal structure , " he told reporters .

but he rounded on the opposition christian democrats , accusing them of exaggerating the scale of the problem and dismissed claims that germany had been overrun by an influx of criminals . opposition calls for fischer to stand down inevitably , the opposition renewed their call for fischer 's resignation .
eckart von klaeden , a christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- representative on the inquiry who clashed with fischer during his testimony , said : " i still believe that it would be proper for him to resign . " bildunterschrift : joschka fischer at the entrance for the hearing but olaf scholz , who represents chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in the inquiry , said fischer had shown there were no grounds for him to step down . " one thing is clear - the minister will stay in office , " scholz said .
he added that he believed fischer 's testimony would give the spd a " tailwind " ahead of a key election on may 22 in germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia . the spd are the dominant partners in the ruling coalition along with fischer 's greens .
schröder 's party has suffered a string of setbacks in state elections and , with a general election due to take place in september next year , the spd ca n't afford to lose in north rhine-westphalia , one of its traditional strongholds . divided opinion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the focus of media attention - not all of it positive the newspapers were equally divided over fischer 's performance .
the financial times deutschland said that despite a vintage performance from the charismatic minister , many questions remain unanswered . " he was quite the old joschka fischer - belligerent , lacking respect , eloquent and witty .
but his show was being played out in the wrong theater .
it was all about how far he is responsible for mass human trafficking offences and from this point of view he was n't convincing . " the centre-left süddeutsche zeitung however said the foreign minster had emerged stronger .
" we are now past the high point of this scandal , there are no new revelations to emerge , " it said .
the conservative frankfurter allgemeine zeitung was less convinced , saying : " fischer gave it his best .
we will see if it was enough . " and die w elt , also a conservative paper , criticised what it said were all too frequent gaps in fischer 's memory .
" what fischer left out of this ' acrobatic ' recollection is what sticks in the memory - of a minister who has n't got a grip on his own department . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schroeder supports fischer all the way most of the newspapers , however , accepted that a major factor in fischer 's favor was that he has schröder 's support .
in an interview in sunday 's edition of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung the chancellor said : " the foreign minister will remain the foreign minister . " the inquiry could recall fischer for further questions if necessary . afp / dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : democracy according to fischer fischer ducked and dived , but in the end he admitted a visa policy that allowed thousands of criminals into the country was his responsibility .
but there wo n't be any consequences , says wolter von tiesenhausen .
-lrb- april 26 , 2005 -rrb- fischer 's moment of truth german foreign minister joschka fischer will fight for his political life on monday when he defends his role in an immigration scandal which allegedly saw criminals flood into the country .
-lrb- april 24 , 2005 -rrb- fischer accepts blame in immigration probe german foreign minister joschka fischer admitted on monday that he failed to act more quickly to stop visa abuses which allowed tens of thousands of eastern europeans to flood into germany between 2000 and 2003 .

sobbing former students and teachers left roses at the school 's entrance before entering the renovated scene of the bloodbath .
" for many of us , it is a return that we have to work through , " former principal christiane alt said .

many of the pupils who attended the school at the time of the assault are still undergoing psychological treatment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 26.04.2005 leaders make joint appeal ahead of eu vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder is lending a hand with just over a month to go before skeptical french voters cast their ballots on the eu constitution , president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder joined forces tuesday to back the treaty . the two leaders insisted that the constitution would strengthen the european union 's influence in world affairs , and reinforce its political and economic independence vis-a-vis the united states and emerging powers like china . addressing a joint press conference , chirac said the treaty " will allow france to be stronger in europe and will strengthen europe 's position in the world " . he warned that if the ' no ' camp - which moved ahead in the polls last month - wins a may 29 referendum on the constitution , " france will find itself on the platform while the train passes us by " . in a speech later in the day at the sorbonne , schröder said : " if europe wants to make itself heard internationally , we need the european constitution . "
" what 's at stake is something truly historic : the idea of a europe united in response to the horrors of fascism , " the german chancellor said earlier , adding he hoped that france , " the cradle of this idea , remains true to its promises " . ' non ' would have enormous consequences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : posters encourage french citizens to reject the consitution .
but the " non " camp is losing ground schröder 's visit to paris for a joint franco-german cabinet meeting gave the social democratic german chancellor a chance to help the center-right chirac woo unconvinced voters on the political left ahead of the key vote .
the constitution , which aims to simplify decision-making in the expanded eu , must be approved by all 25 eu member states .
a rejection in france would have enormous repercussions , both within the country and across the european union .
chirac - who has staked his prestige on a ' yes ' vote - warned opponents that should they triumph , they would bear rresponsibility for interrupting 50 years of european construction " .
by approving the text , france instead would be " making the choice of a europe that is more social , more independent and more powerful , " he said .
the two leaders said earlier in a statement that the constitution would " be an important step in terms of asserting europe 's weight in the international arena and reinforcing its ability to act for peace and security in the world " .
chirac and schröder highlighted the fact that the constitution marked a " major step " in the realization of the " european political project " , adding that it would reinforce " the sphere of activity of european defense " . " europe must go on the offensive " the joint franco-german cabinet meeting , focused on industrial cooperation , was intended to showcase the dynamic nature of europe 's economy and its ability to compete with the united states and emerging economic powers .
the ministers adopted four pilot projects - two on biomedical research , and two others on information technology - that will bring together business consortiums and research laboratories from the two states .

chirac - who has staked his prestige on a ' yes ' vote - warned opponents that should they triumph , they would bear rresponsibility for interrupting 50 years of european construction " .
by approving the text , france instead would be " making the choice of a europe that is more social , more independent and more powerful , " he said .
the two leaders said earlier in a statement that the constitution would " be an important step in terms of asserting europe 's weight in the international arena and reinforcing its ability to act for peace and security in the world " .
chirac and schröder highlighted the fact that the constitution marked a " major step " in the realization of the " european political project " , adding that it would reinforce " the sphere of activity of european defense " . " europe must go on the offensive " the joint franco-german cabinet meeting , focused on industrial cooperation , was intended to showcase the dynamic nature of europe 's economy and its ability to compete with the united states and emerging economic powers .
the ministers adopted four pilot projects - two on biomedical research , and two others on information technology - that will bring together business consortiums and research laboratories from the two states .
in a speech at the sorbonne , with schröder by his side , chirac said europe must " go on the offensive and make a massive commitment to innovation " . " with the emergence of major players like china and india , with the united states and japan moving forward more than ever , what 's at stake is technological supremacy in this world , " chirac said .
during their morning meeting , chirac and schröder also discussed the eu 's 2007-2013 budget and a controversial draft eu law on the liberalization of the eu services sector .
chirac told reporters that the so-called bolkestein directive on the bloc 's services sector " no longer exists " . he added that paris and berlin would work to ensure that any revised draft would not include a " country-of-origin " clause which suggests that companies could provide services throughout the eu using the laws of their own country . dw staff / afp -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crisis deepens over french eu stance even as french voters look set to torpedo the eu constitution in a referendum , luxembourg premier juncker added a new twist to the dilemma this week , saying the us hopes the french will reject the treaty .

"
" what 's at stake is something truly historic : the idea of a europe united in response to the horrors of fascism , " the german chancellor said earlier , adding he hoped that france , " the cradle of this idea , remains true to its promises " . ' non ' would have enormous consequences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : posters encourage french citizens to reject the consitution .
but the " non " camp is losing ground schröder 's visit to paris for a joint franco-german cabinet meeting gave the social democratic german chancellor a chance to help the center-right chirac woo unconvinced voters on the political left ahead of the key vote .
the constitution , which aims to simplify decision-making in the expanded eu , must be approved by all 25 eu member states .

fischer ducked and dived , but in the end he admitted a visa policy that allowed thousands of criminals into the country was his responsibility .
but there wo n't be any consequences , says wolter von tiesenhausen . the parliamentary committee grilled fischer for over 12 hours as tv cameras recorded the whole thing . everyone was able to witness how the foreign minister tried to extricate himself from the affair , how the opposition parliamentarians took pains to set traps for him and allied parliamentarians from fischer 's red-green coalition government tried to defend their man . that was interesting for a short while , and not without humor .
but stretched out over an entire day , and including many repetitions , it was rather tiresome . fischer 's understanding of democracy the result of all these efforts can be summed up quickly : the foreign minister admitted mistakes .
the granting of visas to come into the country through the so-called volmer decree -lrb- former state secretary ludwig vollmer allegedly ordered embassies to grant visas even if in doubt -rrb- took on dimensions that no one had anticipated .
that criminals were also abusing the generous german visa system , which was something the top level of the foreign office , and the minister , ignored for a long time .
the correction came too late , despite warnings from the interior minister and a few states . in his testimony , fischer tried to turn the tables and make the opposition responsible for making a scandal out of the entire process .
this method of yelling " stop thief ! " and then hiding behind the corner speaks to the skewed understanding the witness fischer has of democracy . the discovery of mistakes made by ministers belongs to the basic duties of an opposition party in a democracy .
the actual frustration is the minister 's false appraisal and that he looked the other way for so long . the good news on this point , the committee - despite all its problems as an institution that charges , defends and judges - contributed to clarification . the minister gave up his initial evasive maneuvers and admitted full responsibility .
it is now also beyond dispute that the correction -lrb- of policies -rrb- did n't happen immediately , but with too great a delay .
the minister is also responsible for that .
the consequences were that many thousands of illegal workers , prostitutes and criminals were not able to only travel to germany but to other european countries . the committee proved all of that .
but it ca n't force the minister to accept consequences .
chancellor gerhard schröder can do that , but would hardly think of breaking off the cornerstone of his coalition .

fischer ducked and dived , but in the end he admitted a visa policy that allowed thousands of criminals into the country was his responsibility .
but there wo n't be any consequences , says wolter von tiesenhausen . the parliamentary committee grilled fischer for over 12 hours as tv cameras recorded the whole thing . everyone was able to witness how the foreign minister tried to extricate himself from the affair , how the opposition parliamentarians took pains to set traps for him and allied parliamentarians from fischer 's red-green coalition government tried to defend their man . that was interesting for a short while , and not without humor .
but stretched out over an entire day , and including many repetitions , it was rather tiresome . fischer 's understanding of democracy the result of all these efforts can be summed up quickly : the foreign minister admitted mistakes .

the correction came too late , despite warnings from the interior minister and a few states . in his testimony , fischer tried to turn the tables and make the opposition responsible for making a scandal out of the entire process .
this method of yelling " stop thief ! " and then hiding behind the corner speaks to the skewed understanding the witness fischer has of democracy . the discovery of mistakes made by ministers belongs to the basic duties of an opposition party in a democracy .
the actual frustration is the minister 's false appraisal and that he looked the other way for so long . the good news on this point , the committee - despite all its problems as an institution that charges , defends and judges - contributed to clarification . the minister gave up his initial evasive maneuvers and admitted full responsibility .
it is now also beyond dispute that the correction -lrb- of policies -rrb- did n't happen immediately , but with too great a delay .
the minister is also responsible for that .
the consequences were that many thousands of illegal workers , prostitutes and criminals were not able to only travel to germany but to other european countries . the committee proved all of that .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 26.04.2005 gloomy news again for german economy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a slight upturn , germany 's economy is dropping off again instead of building on last year 's recovery , the german economy appears to be heading downhill again .
on tuesday , the country 's top economic institutes slashed their growth forecast for 2005 . the outlook for germany 's stuttering economy has become decidedly gloomier following the decision by six leading economic institutes to halve their growth forecast for the eurozone 's biggest economy this year . the institutes slashed their 2005 growth forecast to just 0.7 percent from 1.5 percent , heralding tough times for the government , which is eager to cut unemployment and get its public finances in order ahead of the general election next year . but the institutes ' gloomy report is in line with the latest forecasts by the international monetary fund and the european commission , which are both pencilling in german growth of a meager 0.8 percent this year . " the german economy finds itself in a spot of economic weakness this spring , " the institutes said .
" the strong recovery observed in the first half of 2004 has come to a standstill . " opposition : a government of " mini-growth " in 2004 , the german economy had expanded by 1.6 percent , a substantial improvement on the previous year 's lacklustre 1.1 percent , largely thanks to the increased number of working days .
those positive calendar effects are set to be reversed this year .
in addition , global growth has slowed tangibly and the strong euro was weighing on german exports , previously the main driver of growth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exports are down due to the weak dollar and strong euro " the impulses from domestic demand remain weak and are unable to offset the easing of export growth .
so the general weak economic trend remains intact , " the institutes diagnosed . the news was met with fierce criticism from the opposition , which attacked chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government with of social democrats and greens for failing to revive the economy . " red-green remains the government of mini growth , " said rainer brüderle , the deputy leader of the market-oriented free democratic party .
" the upturn is over before it 's even begun . " weak domestic economy no improvement was in sight in domestic demand given the high level of unemployment and with growth set to remain only sluggish , no substantial improvements could be expected on the labor market in the near future , the institutes said . the jobless total , which stood at 4.381 million or 10.2 percent of the workforce in 2004 , was expected to average 4.844 million this year , equivalent to a jobless rate of 11.1 percent .
and next year , it would come down to 4.518 million or 10.4 percent , the institutes predicted . the combination of weak growth and high unemployment also signalled bad news for germany 's public finances . the institutes predicted that the german public deficit would again breach european union limits both this year and next year . " the crisis in the labor market slows our economic growth , " said axel nitschke , chief economist at the german chambers of industry and commerce , the dihk .
" the government can not let the appeal by the research institutes to fall on deaf ears . " bad news , but signs of hope the institutes said they expected the german public deficit to amount to 3.4 percent of gdp this year and 3.3 percent in 2006 , breaching the 3.0-percent limit laid down in the eu 's stability and growth pact for the fourth and fifth years running . the government had vowed to bring the deficit ratio back below 3.0 percent this year .
nevertheless , the institutes said that the current weak economic phase " will gradually be overcome during the course of the year . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high oil prices , currently a damper on the economy 's growth , are likely to recede and aid a recovery before the end of the year the effects of high oil prices would disappear and global growth was set to pick up speed again , which would be good news for exports .
low interest rates will also fuel domestic demand , adding to the momentum , according to both the institutes and the government . " impulses will come from exports , but they will also gradually feed through to the domestic economy , " economy and labor minister wolfgang clement said in a statement . in addition , the government 's labor market reforms and other structural reforms would begin to bear fruit and berlin would press ahead with further reforms in order to strengthen growth prospects in medium-to-long term .
the government 's current official growth forecast for this year stands at 1.6 percent .
but it is expected to revise it downward sharply on friday , with press reports mooting a figure of around 1.0 percent . dw staff afp / -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany backs toward the future cars , electronics and quality industrial goods have all helped make germany the world 's leading exporter .

on tuesday , the country 's top economic institutes slashed their growth forecast for 2005 . the outlook for germany 's stuttering economy has become decidedly gloomier following the decision by six leading economic institutes to halve their growth forecast for the eurozone 's biggest economy this year . the institutes slashed their 2005 growth forecast to just 0.7 percent from 1.5 percent , heralding tough times for the government , which is eager to cut unemployment and get its public finances in order ahead of the general election next year . but the institutes ' gloomy report is in line with the latest forecasts by the international monetary fund and the european commission , which are both pencilling in german growth of a meager 0.8 percent this year . " the german economy finds itself in a spot of economic weakness this spring , " the institutes said .
" the strong recovery observed in the first half of 2004 has come to a standstill . " opposition : a government of " mini-growth " in 2004 , the german economy had expanded by 1.6 percent , a substantial improvement on the previous year 's lacklustre 1.1 percent , largely thanks to the increased number of working days .
those positive calendar effects are set to be reversed this year .
in addition , global growth has slowed tangibly and the strong euro was weighing on german exports , previously the main driver of growth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exports are down due to the weak dollar and strong euro " the impulses from domestic demand remain weak and are unable to offset the easing of export growth .
so the general weak economic trend remains intact , " the institutes diagnosed . the news was met with fierce criticism from the opposition , which attacked chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government with of social democrats and greens for failing to revive the economy . " red-green remains the government of mini growth , " said rainer brüderle , the deputy leader of the market-oriented free democratic party .

" weak domestic economy no improvement was in sight in domestic demand given the high level of unemployment and with growth set to remain only sluggish , no substantial improvements could be expected on the labor market in the near future , the institutes said . the jobless total , which stood at 4.381 million or 10.2 percent of the workforce in 2004 , was expected to average 4.844 million this year , equivalent to a jobless rate of 11.1 percent .
and next year , it would come down to 4.518 million or 10.4 percent , the institutes predicted . the combination of weak growth and high unemployment also signalled bad news for germany 's public finances . the institutes predicted that the german public deficit would again breach european union limits both this year and next year . " the crisis in the labor market slows our economic growth , " said axel nitschke , chief economist at the german chambers of industry and commerce , the dihk .
" the government can not let the appeal by the research institutes to fall on deaf ears . " bad news , but signs of hope the institutes said they expected the german public deficit to amount to 3.4 percent of gdp this year and 3.3 percent in 2006 , breaching the 3.0-percent limit laid down in the eu 's stability and growth pact for the fourth and fifth years running . the government had vowed to bring the deficit ratio back below 3.0 percent this year .
nevertheless , the institutes said that the current weak economic phase " will gradually be overcome during the course of the year . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high oil prices , currently a damper on the economy 's growth , are likely to recede and aid a recovery before the end of the year the effects of high oil prices would disappear and global growth was set to pick up speed again , which would be good news for exports .
low interest rates will also fuel domestic demand , adding to the momentum , according to both the institutes and the government . " impulses will come from exports , but they will also gradually feed through to the domestic economy , " economy and labor minister wolfgang clement said in a statement . in addition , the government 's labor market reforms and other structural reforms would begin to bear fruit and berlin would press ahead with further reforms in order to strengthen growth prospects in medium-to-long term .
the government 's current official growth forecast for this year stands at 1.6 percent .

on tuesday , the country 's top economic institutes slashed their growth forecast for 2005 . the outlook for germany 's stuttering economy has become decidedly gloomier following the decision by six leading economic institutes to halve their growth forecast for the eurozone 's biggest economy this year . the institutes slashed their 2005 growth forecast to just 0.7 percent from 1.5 percent , heralding tough times for the government , which is eager to cut unemployment and get its public finances in order ahead of the general election next year . but the institutes ' gloomy report is in line with the latest forecasts by the international monetary fund and the european commission , which are both pencilling in german growth of a meager 0.8 percent this year . " the german economy finds itself in a spot of economic weakness this spring , " the institutes said .
" the strong recovery observed in the first half of 2004 has come to a standstill . " opposition : a government of " mini-growth " in 2004 , the german economy had expanded by 1.6 percent , a substantial improvement on the previous year 's lacklustre 1.1 percent , largely thanks to the increased number of working days .
those positive calendar effects are set to be reversed this year .
in addition , global growth has slowed tangibly and the strong euro was weighing on german exports , previously the main driver of growth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exports are down due to the weak dollar and strong euro " the impulses from domestic demand remain weak and are unable to offset the easing of export growth .
so the general weak economic trend remains intact , " the institutes diagnosed . the news was met with fierce criticism from the opposition , which attacked chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government with of social democrats and greens for failing to revive the economy . " red-green remains the government of mini growth , " said rainer brüderle , the deputy leader of the market-oriented free democratic party .
" the upturn is over before it 's even begun . " weak domestic economy no improvement was in sight in domestic demand given the high level of unemployment and with growth set to remain only sluggish , no substantial improvements could be expected on the labor market in the near future , the institutes said . the jobless total , which stood at 4.381 million or 10.2 percent of the workforce in 2004 , was expected to average 4.844 million this year , equivalent to a jobless rate of 11.1 percent .
and next year , it would come down to 4.518 million or 10.4 percent , the institutes predicted . the combination of weak growth and high unemployment also signalled bad news for germany 's public finances . the institutes predicted that the german public deficit would again breach european union limits both this year and next year . " the crisis in the labor market slows our economic growth , " said axel nitschke , chief economist at the german chambers of industry and commerce , the dihk .
" the government can not let the appeal by the research institutes to fall on deaf ears . " bad news , but signs of hope the institutes said they expected the german public deficit to amount to 3.4 percent of gdp this year and 3.3 percent in 2006 , breaching the 3.0-percent limit laid down in the eu 's stability and growth pact for the fourth and fifth years running . the government had vowed to bring the deficit ratio back below 3.0 percent this year .
nevertheless , the institutes said that the current weak economic phase " will gradually be overcome during the course of the year . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high oil prices , currently a damper on the economy 's growth , are likely to recede and aid a recovery before the end of the year the effects of high oil prices would disappear and global growth was set to pick up speed again , which would be good news for exports .
low interest rates will also fuel domestic demand , adding to the momentum , according to both the institutes and the government . " impulses will come from exports , but they will also gradually feed through to the domestic economy , " economy and labor minister wolfgang clement said in a statement . in addition , the government 's labor market reforms and other structural reforms would begin to bear fruit and berlin would press ahead with further reforms in order to strengthen growth prospects in medium-to-long term .
the government 's current official growth forecast for this year stands at 1.6 percent .

but he rounded on the opposition christian democrats , accusing them of exaggerating the scale of the problem and dismissed claims that germany had been overrun by an influx of criminals . opposition calls for fischer to stand down inevitably , the opposition renewed their call for fischer 's resignation .
eckart von klaeden , a christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- representative on the inquiry who clashed with fischer during his testimony , said : " i still believe that it would be proper for him to resign . " bildunterschrift : joschka fischer at the entrance for the hearing but olaf scholz , who represents chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in the inquiry , said fischer had shown there were no grounds for him to step down . " one thing is clear - the minister will stay in office , " scholz said .
he added that he believed fischer 's testimony would give the spd a " tailwind " ahead of a key election on may 22 in germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia . the spd are the dominant partners in the ruling coalition along with fischer 's greens .
schröder 's party has suffered a string of setbacks in state elections and , with a general election due to take place in september next year , the spd ca n't afford to lose in north rhine-westphalia , one of its traditional strongholds . divided opinion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the focus of media attention - not all of it positive the newspapers were equally divided over fischer 's performance .
the financial times deutschland said that despite a vintage performance from the charismatic minister , many questions remain unanswered . " he was quite the old joschka fischer - belligerent , lacking respect , eloquent and witty .
but his show was being played out in the wrong theater .
it was all about how far he is responsible for mass human trafficking offences and from this point of view he was n't convincing . " the centre-left süddeutsche zeitung however said the foreign minster had emerged stronger .
" we are now past the high point of this scandal , there are no new revelations to emerge , " it said .
the conservative frankfurter allgemeine zeitung was less convinced , saying : " fischer gave it his best .
we will see if it was enough . " and die w elt , also a conservative paper , criticised what it said were all too frequent gaps in fischer 's memory .
" what fischer left out of this ' acrobatic ' recollection is what sticks in the memory - of a minister who has n't got a grip on his own department . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schroeder supports fischer all the way most of the newspapers , however , accepted that a major factor in fischer 's favor was that he has schröder 's support .
in an interview in sunday 's edition of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung the chancellor said : " the foreign minister will remain the foreign minister . " the inquiry could recall fischer for further questions if necessary . afp / dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : democracy according to fischer fischer ducked and dived , but in the end he admitted a visa policy that allowed thousands of criminals into the country was his responsibility .
but there wo n't be any consequences , says wolter von tiesenhausen .

" it 's important not just because of the games but the fact that this will be the first time that we have spent a long period of time together .
on top of that , it 's in our home country , just like the world cup . " klinsmann and his coaching staff will use the confederations cup to run a critical eye over their charges with a view to assembling a tournament-savvy group ready to make a play for the big prize in 2006 .
" we will see how the team reacts to certain events , this is something different from a one-off international . " young stars will get their chance to shine the germany coach also pledged to do all what was necessary to win the confederations cup this june , even at the temporary expense of his youth policy .
klinsmann said that an experienced team would battle for the cup but young hopefuls would still get their chance to shine .
" there will be possibilities to play the younger ones , " he said , " to get a feeling whether they are ready for the world cup . " one man who is sure to feature is klinsmann 's captain , michael ballack .
the germany coach took the opportunity to pledge his support for ballack , saying that he expects the midfielder to prove critics wrong at the 2006 world cup and show he can be placed on a pedestal with the other great playmakers in world football .
klinsmann backs ballack to silence critics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich star ballack , 28 , has come in for criticism in the press and brazil 's three-time world cup winner pele recently claimed he had not made any progress over the past few seasons . " the criticism drives michael on and he will silence the doubters , " klinsmann said .
" the 2006 world cup on home soil will offer him the perfect stage to join recent greats such as zinedine zidane and pavel nedved . "
ballack has scored 22 goals in 50 internationals for germany marking him out as one of the most dangerous attacking midfielders in europe . " michael is a world class player and all of us in the german national team know this , " added klinsmann .
" he is lethal in front of goal and capable of changing the game in an instant . " vogts job row to go to a vote at dfb klinsmann refused to directly address the thorny subject of his proposed plan to give former national coach berti vogts which has turned into another row with the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- .
the plan would see vogts dislodge michael skibbe from the post of developing the country 's talent as technical director . the dfb has yet to make a formal decision on klinsmann 's latest proposed reform although there is a timetable in place for a possible vote .
" it is important that those involved stick to that timetable , " klinsmann said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's former coach berti vogts .

" it 's important not just because of the games but the fact that this will be the first time that we have spent a long period of time together .
on top of that , it 's in our home country , just like the world cup . " klinsmann and his coaching staff will use the confederations cup to run a critical eye over their charges with a view to assembling a tournament-savvy group ready to make a play for the big prize in 2006 .
" we will see how the team reacts to certain events , this is something different from a one-off international . " young stars will get their chance to shine the germany coach also pledged to do all what was necessary to win the confederations cup this june , even at the temporary expense of his youth policy .
klinsmann said that an experienced team would battle for the cup but young hopefuls would still get their chance to shine .
" there will be possibilities to play the younger ones , " he said , " to get a feeling whether they are ready for the world cup . " one man who is sure to feature is klinsmann 's captain , michael ballack .

klinsmann backs ballack to silence critics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich star ballack , 28 , has come in for criticism in the press and brazil 's three-time world cup winner pele recently claimed he had not made any progress over the past few seasons . " the criticism drives michael on and he will silence the doubters , " klinsmann said .
" the 2006 world cup on home soil will offer him the perfect stage to join recent greats such as zinedine zidane and pavel nedved . "
ballack has scored 22 goals in 50 internationals for germany marking him out as one of the most dangerous attacking midfielders in europe . " michael is a world class player and all of us in the german national team know this , " added klinsmann .
" he is lethal in front of goal and capable of changing the game in an instant . " vogts job row to go to a vote at dfb klinsmann refused to directly address the thorny subject of his proposed plan to give former national coach berti vogts which has turned into another row with the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- .
the plan would see vogts dislodge michael skibbe from the post of developing the country 's talent as technical director . the dfb has yet to make a formal decision on klinsmann 's latest proposed reform although there is a timetable in place for a possible vote .

on tuesday , the country 's top economic institutes slashed their growth forecast for 2005 . the outlook for germany 's stuttering economy has become decidedly gloomier following the decision by six leading economic institutes to halve their growth forecast for the eurozone 's biggest economy this year . the institutes slashed their 2005 growth forecast to just 0.7 percent from 1.5 percent , heralding tough times for the government , which is eager to cut unemployment and get its public finances in order ahead of the general election next year . but the institutes ' gloomy report is in line with the latest forecasts by the international monetary fund and the european commission , which are both pencilling in german growth of a meager 0.8 percent this year . " the german economy finds itself in a spot of economic weakness this spring , " the institutes said .
" the strong recovery observed in the first half of 2004 has come to a standstill . " opposition : a government of " mini-growth " in 2004 , the german economy had expanded by 1.6 percent , a substantial improvement on the previous year 's lacklustre 1.1 percent , largely thanks to the increased number of working days .
those positive calendar effects are set to be reversed this year .
in addition , global growth has slowed tangibly and the strong euro was weighing on german exports , previously the main driver of growth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exports are down due to the weak dollar and strong euro " the impulses from domestic demand remain weak and are unable to offset the easing of export growth .
so the general weak economic trend remains intact , " the institutes diagnosed . the news was met with fierce criticism from the opposition , which attacked chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government with of social democrats and greens for failing to revive the economy . " red-green remains the government of mini growth , " said rainer brüderle , the deputy leader of the market-oriented free democratic party .
" the upturn is over before it 's even begun .

on tuesday , the country 's top economic institutes slashed their growth forecast for 2005 . the outlook for germany 's stuttering economy has become decidedly gloomier following the decision by six leading economic institutes to halve their growth forecast for the eurozone 's biggest economy this year . the institutes slashed their 2005 growth forecast to just 0.7 percent from 1.5 percent , heralding tough times for the government , which is eager to cut unemployment and get its public finances in order ahead of the general election next year . but the institutes ' gloomy report is in line with the latest forecasts by the international monetary fund and the european commission , which are both pencilling in german growth of a meager 0.8 percent this year . " the german economy finds itself in a spot of economic weakness this spring , " the institutes said .
" the strong recovery observed in the first half of 2004 has come to a standstill . " opposition : a government of " mini-growth " in 2004 , the german economy had expanded by 1.6 percent , a substantial improvement on the previous year 's lacklustre 1.1 percent , largely thanks to the increased number of working days .
those positive calendar effects are set to be reversed this year .
in addition , global growth has slowed tangibly and the strong euro was weighing on german exports , previously the main driver of growth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exports are down due to the weak dollar and strong euro " the impulses from domestic demand remain weak and are unable to offset the easing of export growth .
so the general weak economic trend remains intact , " the institutes diagnosed . the news was met with fierce criticism from the opposition , which attacked chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government with of social democrats and greens for failing to revive the economy . " red-green remains the government of mini growth , " said rainer brüderle , the deputy leader of the market-oriented free democratic party .
" the upturn is over before it 's even begun . " weak domestic economy no improvement was in sight in domestic demand given the high level of unemployment and with growth set to remain only sluggish , no substantial improvements could be expected on the labor market in the near future , the institutes said . the jobless total , which stood at 4.381 million or 10.2 percent of the workforce in 2004 , was expected to average 4.844 million this year , equivalent to a jobless rate of 11.1 percent .
and next year , it would come down to 4.518 million or 10.4 percent , the institutes predicted . the combination of weak growth and high unemployment also signalled bad news for germany 's public finances . the institutes predicted that the german public deficit would again breach european union limits both this year and next year . " the crisis in the labor market slows our economic growth , " said axel nitschke , chief economist at the german chambers of industry and commerce , the dihk .
" the government can not let the appeal by the research institutes to fall on deaf ears . " bad news , but signs of hope the institutes said they expected the german public deficit to amount to 3.4 percent of gdp this year and 3.3 percent in 2006 , breaching the 3.0-percent limit laid down in the eu 's stability and growth pact for the fourth and fifth years running . the government had vowed to bring the deficit ratio back below 3.0 percent this year .
nevertheless , the institutes said that the current weak economic phase " will gradually be overcome during the course of the year . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high oil prices , currently a damper on the economy 's growth , are likely to recede and aid a recovery before the end of the year the effects of high oil prices would disappear and global growth was set to pick up speed again , which would be good news for exports .
low interest rates will also fuel domestic demand , adding to the momentum , according to both the institutes and the government . " impulses will come from exports , but they will also gradually feed through to the domestic economy , " economy and labor minister wolfgang clement said in a statement . in addition , the government 's labor market reforms and other structural reforms would begin to bear fruit and berlin would press ahead with further reforms in order to strengthen growth prospects in medium-to-long term .
the government 's current official growth forecast for this year stands at 1.6 percent .

chirac told reporters that the so-called bolkestein directive on the bloc 's services sector " no longer exists " . he added that paris and berlin would work to ensure that any revised draft would not include a " country-of-origin " clause which suggests that companies could provide services throughout the eu using the laws of their own country . dw staff / afp -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crisis deepens over french eu stance even as french voters look set to torpedo the eu constitution in a referendum , luxembourg premier juncker added a new twist to the dilemma this week , saying the us hopes the french will reject the treaty .

but the " non " camp is losing ground schröder 's visit to paris for a joint franco-german cabinet meeting gave the social democratic german chancellor a chance to help the center-right chirac woo unconvinced voters on the political left ahead of the key vote .
the constitution , which aims to simplify decision-making in the expanded eu , must be approved by all 25 eu member states .

chirac told reporters that the so-called bolkestein directive on the bloc 's services sector " no longer exists " . he added that paris and berlin would work to ensure that any revised draft would not include a " country-of-origin " clause which suggests that companies could provide services throughout the eu using the laws of their own country . dw staff / afp -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crisis deepens over french eu stance even as french voters look set to torpedo the eu constitution in a referendum , luxembourg premier juncker added a new twist to the dilemma this week , saying the us hopes the french will reject the treaty .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 26.04.2005 opinion : democracy according to fischer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : admitting mistakes , but without consequence for himself ?
fischer ducked and dived , but in the end he admitted a visa policy that allowed thousands of criminals into the country was his responsibility .
but there wo n't be any consequences , says wolter von tiesenhausen . the parliamentary committee grilled fischer for over 12 hours as tv cameras recorded the whole thing . everyone was able to witness how the foreign minister tried to extricate himself from the affair , how the opposition parliamentarians took pains to set traps for him and allied parliamentarians from fischer 's red-green coalition government tried to defend their man . that was interesting for a short while , and not without humor .
but stretched out over an entire day , and including many repetitions , it was rather tiresome . fischer 's understanding of democracy the result of all these efforts can be summed up quickly : the foreign minister admitted mistakes .
the granting of visas to come into the country through the so-called volmer decree -lrb- former state secretary ludwig vollmer allegedly ordered embassies to grant visas even if in doubt -rrb- took on dimensions that no one had anticipated .
that criminals were also abusing the generous german visa system , which was something the top level of the foreign office , and the minister , ignored for a long time .
the correction came too late , despite warnings from the interior minister and a few states . in his testimony , fischer tried to turn the tables and make the opposition responsible for making a scandal out of the entire process .
this method of yelling " stop thief ! " and then hiding behind the corner speaks to the skewed understanding the witness fischer has of democracy . the discovery of mistakes made by ministers belongs to the basic duties of an opposition party in a democracy .
the actual frustration is the minister 's false appraisal and that he looked the other way for so long . the good news on this point , the committee - despite all its problems as an institution that charges , defends and judges - contributed to clarification . the minister gave up his initial evasive maneuvers and admitted full responsibility .
it is now also beyond dispute that the correction -lrb- of policies -rrb- did n't happen immediately , but with too great a delay .
the minister is also responsible for that .
the consequences were that many thousands of illegal workers , prostitutes and criminals were not able to only travel to germany but to other european countries . the committee proved all of that .
but it ca n't force the minister to accept consequences .

fischer ducked and dived , but in the end he admitted a visa policy that allowed thousands of criminals into the country was his responsibility .
but there wo n't be any consequences , says wolter von tiesenhausen . the parliamentary committee grilled fischer for over 12 hours as tv cameras recorded the whole thing . everyone was able to witness how the foreign minister tried to extricate himself from the affair , how the opposition parliamentarians took pains to set traps for him and allied parliamentarians from fischer 's red-green coalition government tried to defend their man . that was interesting for a short while , and not without humor .
but stretched out over an entire day , and including many repetitions , it was rather tiresome . fischer 's understanding of democracy the result of all these efforts can be summed up quickly : the foreign minister admitted mistakes .
the granting of visas to come into the country through the so-called volmer decree -lrb- former state secretary ludwig vollmer allegedly ordered embassies to grant visas even if in doubt -rrb- took on dimensions that no one had anticipated .
that criminals were also abusing the generous german visa system , which was something the top level of the foreign office , and the minister , ignored for a long time .
the correction came too late , despite warnings from the interior minister and a few states . in his testimony , fischer tried to turn the tables and make the opposition responsible for making a scandal out of the entire process .
this method of yelling " stop thief ! " and then hiding behind the corner speaks to the skewed understanding the witness fischer has of democracy . the discovery of mistakes made by ministers belongs to the basic duties of an opposition party in a democracy .
the actual frustration is the minister 's false appraisal and that he looked the other way for so long . the good news on this point , the committee - despite all its problems as an institution that charges , defends and judges - contributed to clarification . the minister gave up his initial evasive maneuvers and admitted full responsibility .
it is now also beyond dispute that the correction -lrb- of policies -rrb- did n't happen immediately , but with too great a delay .
the minister is also responsible for that .
the consequences were that many thousands of illegal workers , prostitutes and criminals were not able to only travel to germany but to other european countries . the committee proved all of that .

rather , germans are flocking to a vegas-style show featuring some of the world ’ s best doppelgangers . backstage at berlin 's estrel festival center , melissa totten toys with the platinum blonde curls on her new custom-made wig .
" just this morning , my hair was this same color , " she says , running a hand through her own hair , which has now been dyed a darker , caramel blonde .
the wig will make it even easier to transform herself into her alter ego , madonna .
not that the transformation is difficult .
totten bears a striking resemblance to the " material girl . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : looks like the real thing - melissa totten as madonna in " stars in concert " later , when totten performs " express yourself " dressed in a replica of the infamous jean paul gaultier-designed " cone " corset , it 's easy to forget you 're watching an impersonator . " what i 've heard people say is there are lookalikes in europe , but they 're not on the level where they 're singing live , playing instruments , dancing , and doing everything , " says totten , who has been " doing " madonna for 10 years .
" when people see our show , they 're seeing the best of what they can see . " winning formula totten is a regular in " stars in concert , " which has been running at the estrel for eight years .
producer bernhard kurz - the man credited with first bringing musicals such as " cats " and " phantom of the opera " to germany - has clearly hit on winning formula . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tom jones impersonator performing at the estrel hotel " stars " has a continually rotating line-up of six performers who each do their own set .
even repeat customers - of which there are many - can count on seeing new acts , which range from tom jones and louis armstrong to celine dion and whitney houston . but when kurz first introduced " stars , " he had no idea the show would still be going strong today . " he brought the idea for ' stars in concert ' directly from las vegas , and the aim was to have the show for one year , " said press spokeswoman mihaela djuranovic .
" it 's the kind of success no one really predicted at the beginning . " the doppelganger concept encountered a certain amount of skepticism at first , djuranovic says .
there was n't much of a tradition for such entertainment in germany , and people tended to lump it in with karaoke .
the performers are aware of this , but see it as their job to win germany over , one show at a time . " some people take it as a joke , have a laugh and say , oh , they 're just impersonators , but there are actually a lot of talented people in the business , " says grahame p. doyle , the elvis of " stars in concert . " he should know .
in the world of showbiz impersonators , being elvis is possibly the biggest challenge of all , due to the extraordinary amount of competition . " there 's a lot of elvis impersonators - maybe as many as 40,000 around the world , " says doyle .
" but if you break it down to the handful that give you goose bumps , those that truly bring respect to his character , then you can knock off about 95 percent of those people . " bildunterschrift : " jail house rock " tough audience doyle is one of the more sought-after elvis doppelgangers .
he performed the las vegas circuit for seven years before producer kurz could finally lure him to berlin .
it was a radical change , says doyle , but a welcome one . " berlin is laid back and chilled , and vegas is about getting your party on , " he says .
" there , you have to walk through casinos to get to work .
it 's a completely different atmosphere .
and because vegas is so loose , the audience responds that way too . " berlin audiences , on the other hand , are much more reserved , the performers say . " we were always told when we first came to berlin that berlin was the toughest audience in germany , " totten , alias madonna , says .
" they 're very proper , but they 're also very respectful .
i love the way people dress and come to the show , and they have great things to say afterwards , so i think they appreciate it and we appreciate them . " riding on the success of " stars " in berlin , kurz opened a second venue for the show in essen , western germany , in 2003 .
and it does n't stop there .
adapting the concept , kurz is also behind tribute shows to particular artists or groups such as the beatles , abba , and the blues brothers . in the land of goethe and wagner , it 's not intellectual , nor does it aim to be .

the pirated goods are made in eastern europe or asia and sold on the streets or even in legal stores after a bit of graft has changed hands .
the bnd describes it as organized crime , where the big fish escape criminal persecution because they pay high bribes . high costs in 2003 , before the eu grew from 10 to 25 states , german customs confiscated 50 million pirated items , including 41,000 copies of viagra pills and 11,000 turn-signal indicators .

" we could just as well use a megaphone ; it would have the same effect , " he said . despite the dangers of espionage and the enthusiasm for counterfeiting , businesses still seem to find eu expansion more useful rather than damaging .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 26.04.2005 counterfeiting thrives in expanded eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu expansion has given pirates a boost experts fear that eu expansion has allowed more counterfeit brand products from eastern europe to make it to the germany market - despite laws meant to prevent just that . visitors to the weekly market in borsa in northern romania have the chance to buy adidas sneakers for 10 euros -lrb- $ 13 -rrb- , ck one perfume for seven euros or the newest britney spears cd for just five .
the goods are new , unused - and pirated copies of the originals . rüdiger von fritsch-scherhausen , deputy head of germany 's federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- fears that such counterfeit items will increasingly appear for sale in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " cd bootlegs , for example , from the area east of the external borders end up in large amounts on the markets , " he said .
the governments in eastern european had indeed introduced countermeasures and passed new laws based on western norms .
" but mix-ups over competency and corruption prevent application . " the european commission estimates that german business misses out on 20-30 billion euros and 70,000 jobs due to counterfeiting .
the pirated goods are made in eastern europe or asia and sold on the streets or even in legal stores after a bit of graft has changed hands .
the bnd describes it as organized crime , where the big fish escape criminal persecution because they pay high bribes . high costs in 2003 , before the eu grew from 10 to 25 states , german customs confiscated 50 million pirated items , including 41,000 copies of viagra pills and 11,000 turn-signal indicators .
fritsch-scherhausen is concerned that since eu expansion in 2004 , the german authorities wo n't succeed in confiscating as much .
" regular customs checks will cease , at the same time as the traffic in goods and of people will increase . "
the vast array of counterfeit products already available beyond the border will make it to the german market , he believes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microchip production german businesses are trying to protect themselves , too .
jürgen järnecke , security head at computer chip manufacturer infineon , keeps an eye on the situation , including internet auctions .
he said he often discovers that goods for sale under the name infineon that could n't possibly stem from his company . but copying high-tech products like computer chips or machines requires much more than just switching a labels .
pirates frequently get their hands on secret information through spying .
" we must assume that german firms are also decidedly the targets of espionage from competing firms , but also from intelligence services in other regions of the world , " said von fritsch-scherhausen .
insufficient security and it 's becoming more dangerous the more information companies save and communicate digitally .
reports surface again and again of instances of hackers successfully gaining access to the secret data of companies thought to be impregnable . von fritsch-scherhausen criticizes companies for failing to handle sensitive data with enough caution , adding that some firms are so bold as to transmit entire contracts over mobile phones .
" we could just as well use a megaphone ; it would have the same effect , " he said . despite the dangers of espionage and the enthusiasm for counterfeiting , businesses still seem to find eu expansion more useful rather than damaging .
otherwise , they would hardly be moving a growing amount of production to the new members in eastern europe . manfred götzke -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fake designer goods cost france dearly france is the world 's largest manufacturer of luxury goods ; 250,000 people are employed by the sector .

the two leaders said earlier in a statement that the constitution would " be an important step in terms of asserting europe 's weight in the international arena and reinforcing its ability to act for peace and security in the world " .

the ministers adopted four pilot projects - two on biomedical research , and two others on information technology - that will bring together business consortiums and research laboratories from the two states .

during their morning meeting , chirac and schröder also discussed the eu 's 2007-2013 budget and a controversial draft eu law on the liberalization of the eu services sector .
chirac told reporters that the so-called bolkestein directive on the bloc 's services sector " no longer exists " . he added that paris and berlin would work to ensure that any revised draft would not include a " country-of-origin " clause which suggests that companies could provide services throughout the eu using the laws of their own country . dw staff / afp -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crisis deepens over french eu stance even as french voters look set to torpedo the eu constitution in a referendum , luxembourg premier juncker added a new twist to the dilemma this week , saying the us hopes the french will reject the treaty .

" i think germany could potentially play a constructive role in helping the iraqis draft the constitution because of your federal structure , " he told reporters . " friends of mine who are working in iraq and who 've worked in the former soviet union and other very highly centralized systems have said that iraq is the most centralized system they have ever seen . " devolving iraqi power jones noted that there were elections in january for all 18 iraqi provinces , which he said would see political power devolve from baghdad for the first time since iraqi leader saddam hussein fell from power . " now for the first time in modern iraqi history , maybe for the first time ever , you have elected governments at the provincial level that are working to build themselves and of course in germany , you have the länder -lrb- federal states -rrb- , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitution could spread power throughout the country " i think that is a model which could be very useful for iraq .
obviously , it is up to the iraqi people but i would say that germany may have some expertise to provide the iraqis as they decide their permanent constitution , as to whether or not they want to continue the kind of system that saddam had or if they want to develop a more decentralized system . " west germany ratified a new basic law - drafted with us occupying forces - in 1949 aimed at eliminating the instruments that allowed the nazis to centralize power in berlin , and granting the federal states broad political scope . looming deadlines the united states would like to see the iraqi constitution written by august 15 and ratified by october 15 , with new elections held by december 15 and a new government formed by the end of the year . jones met with officials from german chancellor gerhard schröder 's office , the foreign ministry and the ministry for economic co-operation and development as part of a european tour that also took in france , italy and turkey and involved meetings with european union leaders . he said a us-eu meeting on iraq in brussels in the second half of june would focus on coordinating political and economic assistance for iraq .

" it 's important not just because of the games but the fact that this will be the first time that we have spent a long period of time together .
on top of that , it 's in our home country , just like the world cup . " klinsmann and his coaching staff will use the confederations cup to run a critical eye over their charges with a view to assembling a tournament-savvy group ready to make a play for the big prize in 2006 .
" we will see how the team reacts to certain events , this is something different from a one-off international . " young stars will get their chance to shine the germany coach also pledged to do all what was necessary to win the confederations cup this june , even at the temporary expense of his youth policy .
klinsmann said that an experienced team would battle for the cup but young hopefuls would still get their chance to shine .
" there will be possibilities to play the younger ones , " he said , " to get a feeling whether they are ready for the world cup . " one man who is sure to feature is klinsmann 's captain , michael ballack .
the germany coach took the opportunity to pledge his support for ballack , saying that he expects the midfielder to prove critics wrong at the 2006 world cup and show he can be placed on a pedestal with the other great playmakers in world football .
klinsmann backs ballack to silence critics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich star ballack , 28 , has come in for criticism in the press and brazil 's three-time world cup winner pele recently claimed he had not made any progress over the past few seasons . " the criticism drives michael on and he will silence the doubters , " klinsmann said .
" the 2006 world cup on home soil will offer him the perfect stage to join recent greats such as zinedine zidane and pavel nedved . "
ballack has scored 22 goals in 50 internationals for germany marking him out as one of the most dangerous attacking midfielders in europe . " michael is a world class player and all of us in the german national team know this , " added klinsmann .
" he is lethal in front of goal and capable of changing the game in an instant . " vogts job row to go to a vote at dfb klinsmann refused to directly address the thorny subject of his proposed plan to give former national coach berti vogts which has turned into another row with the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- .
the plan would see vogts dislodge michael skibbe from the post of developing the country 's talent as technical director . the dfb has yet to make a formal decision on klinsmann 's latest proposed reform although there is a timetable in place for a possible vote .
" it is important that those involved stick to that timetable , " klinsmann said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's former coach berti vogts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 26.04.2005 leaders make joint appeal ahead of eu vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder is lending a hand with just over a month to go before skeptical french voters cast their ballots on the eu constitution , president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder joined forces tuesday to back the treaty . the two leaders insisted that the constitution would strengthen the european union 's influence in world affairs , and reinforce its political and economic independence vis-a-vis the united states and emerging powers like china . addressing a joint press conference , chirac said the treaty " will allow france to be stronger in europe and will strengthen europe 's position in the world " . he warned that if the ' no ' camp - which moved ahead in the polls last month - wins a may 29 referendum on the constitution , " france will find itself on the platform while the train passes us by " . in a speech later in the day at the sorbonne , schröder said : " if europe wants to make itself heard internationally , we need the european constitution . "
" what 's at stake is something truly historic : the idea of a europe united in response to the horrors of fascism , " the german chancellor said earlier , adding he hoped that france , " the cradle of this idea , remains true to its promises " . ' non ' would have enormous consequences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : posters encourage french citizens to reject the consitution .
but the " non " camp is losing ground schröder 's visit to paris for a joint franco-german cabinet meeting gave the social democratic german chancellor a chance to help the center-right chirac woo unconvinced voters on the political left ahead of the key vote .
the constitution , which aims to simplify decision-making in the expanded eu , must be approved by all 25 eu member states .
a rejection in france would have enormous repercussions , both within the country and across the european union .
chirac - who has staked his prestige on a ' yes ' vote - warned opponents that should they triumph , they would bear rresponsibility for interrupting 50 years of european construction " .
by approving the text , france instead would be " making the choice of a europe that is more social , more independent and more powerful , " he said .
the two leaders said earlier in a statement that the constitution would " be an important step in terms of asserting europe 's weight in the international arena and reinforcing its ability to act for peace and security in the world " .
chirac and schröder highlighted the fact that the constitution marked a " major step " in the realization of the " european political project " , adding that it would reinforce " the sphere of activity of european defense " . " europe must go on the offensive " the joint franco-german cabinet meeting , focused on industrial cooperation , was intended to showcase the dynamic nature of europe 's economy and its ability to compete with the united states and emerging economic powers .
the ministers adopted four pilot projects - two on biomedical research , and two others on information technology - that will bring together business consortiums and research laboratories from the two states .
in a speech at the sorbonne , with schröder by his side , chirac said europe must " go on the offensive and make a massive commitment to innovation " . " with the emergence of major players like china and india , with the united states and japan moving forward more than ever , what 's at stake is technological supremacy in this world , " chirac said .
during their morning meeting , chirac and schröder also discussed the eu 's 2007-2013 budget and a controversial draft eu law on the liberalization of the eu services sector .
chirac told reporters that the so-called bolkestein directive on the bloc 's services sector " no longer exists " . he added that paris and berlin would work to ensure that any revised draft would not include a " country-of-origin " clause which suggests that companies could provide services throughout the eu using the laws of their own country . dw staff / afp -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crisis deepens over french eu stance even as french voters look set to torpedo the eu constitution in a referendum , luxembourg premier juncker added a new twist to the dilemma this week , saying the us hopes the french will reject the treaty .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 26.04.2005 opinion : democracy according to fischer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : admitting mistakes , but without consequence for himself ?
fischer ducked and dived , but in the end he admitted a visa policy that allowed thousands of criminals into the country was his responsibility .
but there wo n't be any consequences , says wolter von tiesenhausen . the parliamentary committee grilled fischer for over 12 hours as tv cameras recorded the whole thing . everyone was able to witness how the foreign minister tried to extricate himself from the affair , how the opposition parliamentarians took pains to set traps for him and allied parliamentarians from fischer 's red-green coalition government tried to defend their man . that was interesting for a short while , and not without humor .
but stretched out over an entire day , and including many repetitions , it was rather tiresome . fischer 's understanding of democracy the result of all these efforts can be summed up quickly : the foreign minister admitted mistakes .
the granting of visas to come into the country through the so-called volmer decree -lrb- former state secretary ludwig vollmer allegedly ordered embassies to grant visas even if in doubt -rrb- took on dimensions that no one had anticipated .
that criminals were also abusing the generous german visa system , which was something the top level of the foreign office , and the minister , ignored for a long time .
the correction came too late , despite warnings from the interior minister and a few states . in his testimony , fischer tried to turn the tables and make the opposition responsible for making a scandal out of the entire process .
this method of yelling " stop thief ! " and then hiding behind the corner speaks to the skewed understanding the witness fischer has of democracy . the discovery of mistakes made by ministers belongs to the basic duties of an opposition party in a democracy .
the actual frustration is the minister 's false appraisal and that he looked the other way for so long . the good news on this point , the committee - despite all its problems as an institution that charges , defends and judges - contributed to clarification . the minister gave up his initial evasive maneuvers and admitted full responsibility .
it is now also beyond dispute that the correction -lrb- of policies -rrb- did n't happen immediately , but with too great a delay .
the minister is also responsible for that .
the consequences were that many thousands of illegal workers , prostitutes and criminals were not able to only travel to germany but to other european countries . the committee proved all of that .
but it ca n't force the minister to accept consequences .

fischer ducked and dived , but in the end he admitted a visa policy that allowed thousands of criminals into the country was his responsibility .
but there wo n't be any consequences , says wolter von tiesenhausen . the parliamentary committee grilled fischer for over 12 hours as tv cameras recorded the whole thing . everyone was able to witness how the foreign minister tried to extricate himself from the affair , how the opposition parliamentarians took pains to set traps for him and allied parliamentarians from fischer 's red-green coalition government tried to defend their man . that was interesting for a short while , and not without humor .
but stretched out over an entire day , and including many repetitions , it was rather tiresome . fischer 's understanding of democracy the result of all these efforts can be summed up quickly : the foreign minister admitted mistakes .
the granting of visas to come into the country through the so-called volmer decree -lrb- former state secretary ludwig vollmer allegedly ordered embassies to grant visas even if in doubt -rrb- took on dimensions that no one had anticipated .
that criminals were also abusing the generous german visa system , which was something the top level of the foreign office , and the minister , ignored for a long time .
the correction came too late , despite warnings from the interior minister and a few states . in his testimony , fischer tried to turn the tables and make the opposition responsible for making a scandal out of the entire process .
this method of yelling " stop thief ! " and then hiding behind the corner speaks to the skewed understanding the witness fischer has of democracy . the discovery of mistakes made by ministers belongs to the basic duties of an opposition party in a democracy .
the actual frustration is the minister 's false appraisal and that he looked the other way for so long . the good news on this point , the committee - despite all its problems as an institution that charges , defends and judges - contributed to clarification . the minister gave up his initial evasive maneuvers and admitted full responsibility .
it is now also beyond dispute that the correction -lrb- of policies -rrb- did n't happen immediately , but with too great a delay .
the minister is also responsible for that .
the consequences were that many thousands of illegal workers , prostitutes and criminals were not able to only travel to germany but to other european countries . the committee proved all of that .
but it ca n't force the minister to accept consequences .
chancellor gerhard schröder can do that , but would hardly think of breaking off the cornerstone of his coalition .

" we are very anxious to see croatia start its negotiations on eu accession , but the union is clear about the need for full co-operation in the same way every other former republic in yugoslavia has co-operated , " he said . slow process he cited the eu green light given to serbia and montenegro this week to start talks on an association accord with the eu after the surrender of former yugoslav army chief nebojsa pavkovic to the international criminal tribunal for ex-yugoslavia . " the fact that pavkovic has given himself up to the tribunal in the hague is proof of the importance of the firm and consistent line taken by the eu in support of the war crimes tribunal in the hague , " said straw . sanader meanwhile acknowledged there was no immediate prospect of a breakthrough , saying the process could take weeks or even months . afp / dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german testifies in milosevic trial the marathon trial of slobodan milosevic resumed at the united nations war crimes tribunal in the hague tuesday with testimony about the 1999 killing of some 45 people in the kosovo town of racak .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 26.04.2005 opinion : democracy according to fischer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : admitting mistakes , but without consequence for himself ?
fischer ducked and dived , but in the end he admitted a visa policy that allowed thousands of criminals into the country was his responsibility .
but there wo n't be any consequences , says wolter von tiesenhausen . the parliamentary committee grilled fischer for over 12 hours as tv cameras recorded the whole thing . everyone was able to witness how the foreign minister tried to extricate himself from the affair , how the opposition parliamentarians took pains to set traps for him and allied parliamentarians from fischer 's red-green coalition government tried to defend their man . that was interesting for a short while , and not without humor .
but stretched out over an entire day , and including many repetitions , it was rather tiresome . fischer 's understanding of democracy the result of all these efforts can be summed up quickly : the foreign minister admitted mistakes .
the granting of visas to come into the country through the so-called volmer decree -lrb- former state secretary ludwig vollmer allegedly ordered embassies to grant visas even if in doubt -rrb- took on dimensions that no one had anticipated .
that criminals were also abusing the generous german visa system , which was something the top level of the foreign office , and the minister , ignored for a long time .
the correction came too late , despite warnings from the interior minister and a few states . in his testimony , fischer tried to turn the tables and make the opposition responsible for making a scandal out of the entire process .
this method of yelling " stop thief ! " and then hiding behind the corner speaks to the skewed understanding the witness fischer has of democracy . the discovery of mistakes made by ministers belongs to the basic duties of an opposition party in a democracy .
the actual frustration is the minister 's false appraisal and that he looked the other way for so long . the good news on this point , the committee - despite all its problems as an institution that charges , defends and judges - contributed to clarification . the minister gave up his initial evasive maneuvers and admitted full responsibility .
it is now also beyond dispute that the correction -lrb- of policies -rrb- did n't happen immediately , but with too great a delay .
the minister is also responsible for that .
the consequences were that many thousands of illegal workers , prostitutes and criminals were not able to only travel to germany but to other european countries . the committee proved all of that .
but it ca n't force the minister to accept consequences .
chancellor gerhard schröder can do that , but would hardly think of breaking off the cornerstone of his coalition .
as a result , the final judgment over the ' visa affair ' wo n't come until the federal elections in 2006 . wolter von tiesenhausen -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer accepts blame in immigration probe german foreign minister joschka fischer admitted on monday that he failed to act more quickly to stop visa abuses which allowed tens of thousands of eastern europeans to flood into germany between 2000 and 2003 .
-lrb- april 25 , 2005 -rrb- fischer 's moment of truth german foreign minister joschka fischer will fight for his political life on monday when he defends his role in an immigration scandal which allegedly saw criminals flood into the country .
-lrb- april 24 , 2005 -rrb- an end to superstar fischer ?
foreign minister joschka fischer has long been one of germany 's most popular politicians .
but a scandal involving the abuse of tourist visas has dented his reputation and is threatening to unravel his political future .

the germany coach took the opportunity to pledge his support for ballack , saying that he expects the midfielder to prove critics wrong at the 2006 world cup and show he can be placed on a pedestal with the other great playmakers in world football .
klinsmann backs ballack to silence critics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich star ballack , 28 , has come in for criticism in the press and brazil 's three-time world cup winner pele recently claimed he had not made any progress over the past few seasons . " the criticism drives michael on and he will silence the doubters , " klinsmann said .
" the 2006 world cup on home soil will offer him the perfect stage to join recent greats such as zinedine zidane and pavel nedved . "
ballack has scored 22 goals in 50 internationals for germany marking him out as one of the most dangerous attacking midfielders in europe . " michael is a world class player and all of us in the german national team know this , " added klinsmann .
" he is lethal in front of goal and capable of changing the game in an instant .

the plan would see vogts dislodge michael skibbe from the post of developing the country 's talent as technical director . the dfb has yet to make a formal decision on klinsmann 's latest proposed reform although there is a timetable in place for a possible vote .

"
" what 's at stake is something truly historic : the idea of a europe united in response to the horrors of fascism , " the german chancellor said earlier , adding he hoped that france , " the cradle of this idea , remains true to its promises " . ' non ' would have enormous consequences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : posters encourage french citizens to reject the consitution .
but the " non " camp is losing ground schröder 's visit to paris for a joint franco-german cabinet meeting gave the social democratic german chancellor a chance to help the center-right chirac woo unconvinced voters on the political left ahead of the key vote .
the constitution , which aims to simplify decision-making in the expanded eu , must be approved by all 25 eu member states .
a rejection in france would have enormous repercussions , both within the country and across the european union .
chirac - who has staked his prestige on a ' yes ' vote - warned opponents that should they triumph , they would bear rresponsibility for interrupting 50 years of european construction " .
by approving the text , france instead would be " making the choice of a europe that is more social , more independent and more powerful , " he said .
the two leaders said earlier in a statement that the constitution would " be an important step in terms of asserting europe 's weight in the international arena and reinforcing its ability to act for peace and security in the world " .
chirac and schröder highlighted the fact that the constitution marked a " major step " in the realization of the " european political project " , adding that it would reinforce " the sphere of activity of european defense " . " europe must go on the offensive " the joint franco-german cabinet meeting , focused on industrial cooperation , was intended to showcase the dynamic nature of europe 's economy and its ability to compete with the united states and emerging economic powers .
the ministers adopted four pilot projects - two on biomedical research , and two others on information technology - that will bring together business consortiums and research laboratories from the two states .
in a speech at the sorbonne , with schröder by his side , chirac said europe must " go on the offensive and make a massive commitment to innovation " . " with the emergence of major players like china and india , with the united states and japan moving forward more than ever , what 's at stake is technological supremacy in this world , " chirac said .
during their morning meeting , chirac and schröder also discussed the eu 's 2007-2013 budget and a controversial draft eu law on the liberalization of the eu services sector .
chirac told reporters that the so-called bolkestein directive on the bloc 's services sector " no longer exists " . he added that paris and berlin would work to ensure that any revised draft would not include a " country-of-origin " clause which suggests that companies could provide services throughout the eu using the laws of their own country . dw staff / afp -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crisis deepens over french eu stance even as french voters look set to torpedo the eu constitution in a referendum , luxembourg premier juncker added a new twist to the dilemma this week , saying the us hopes the french will reject the treaty .

" the croatian authorities are not fully co-operating with the tribunal and with the office of the prosecutor , " del ponte told journalists , adding that she believes gotovina is in the reach of the croatian authorities . cautious optimism on a more positive note , she said " it is my great hope that this can be done ... before my next report to the security council , " which is scheduled for june 13 .
she said that the croatian prime minister ivo sanader -lrb- photo -rrb- had promised to be more active in locating gotovina , adding that all information indicates he is still in croatia , but moves across into bosnia-hercegovina from time to time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatian prime minister ivo sanader the 25-member eu refused to start negotiations originally scheduled to get underway on march 17 because croatia was not doing it all it could to find gotovina . gotovina is charged by the icty over alleged war crimes against ethnic serbs at the end of the 1991-1995 serbo-croatian war .
zagreb has insisted it has no knowledge of his whereabouts . del ponte acknowledged the possibility that croatian authorities do not know his every movement .
" what i think is that prime minister sanader probably himself does n't receive all the information , " she said . full co-operation there has been some discussion over exactly what is meant by " full cooperation " , but del ponte sought to clarify the semantics on tuesday .
" there will be full cooperation when the croatian authorities will have brought gotovina to the hague or when they indicate to us the whereabouts of gotovina , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw british foreign secretary jack straw -lrb- photo -rrb- , whose country takes over the european union 's rotating presidency from july 1 , cited neighbouring serbia as a good example of the eu 's firm stance .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 26.04.2005 gloomy news again for german economy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a slight upturn , germany 's economy is dropping off again instead of building on last year 's recovery , the german economy appears to be heading downhill again .
on tuesday , the country 's top economic institutes slashed their growth forecast for 2005 . the outlook for germany 's stuttering economy has become decidedly gloomier following the decision by six leading economic institutes to halve their growth forecast for the eurozone 's biggest economy this year . the institutes slashed their 2005 growth forecast to just 0.7 percent from 1.5 percent , heralding tough times for the government , which is eager to cut unemployment and get its public finances in order ahead of the general election next year . but the institutes ' gloomy report is in line with the latest forecasts by the international monetary fund and the european commission , which are both pencilling in german growth of a meager 0.8 percent this year . " the german economy finds itself in a spot of economic weakness this spring , " the institutes said .
" the strong recovery observed in the first half of 2004 has come to a standstill . " opposition : a government of " mini-growth " in 2004 , the german economy had expanded by 1.6 percent , a substantial improvement on the previous year 's lacklustre 1.1 percent , largely thanks to the increased number of working days .
those positive calendar effects are set to be reversed this year .
in addition , global growth has slowed tangibly and the strong euro was weighing on german exports , previously the main driver of growth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exports are down due to the weak dollar and strong euro " the impulses from domestic demand remain weak and are unable to offset the easing of export growth .
so the general weak economic trend remains intact , " the institutes diagnosed . the news was met with fierce criticism from the opposition , which attacked chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government with of social democrats and greens for failing to revive the economy . " red-green remains the government of mini growth , " said rainer brüderle , the deputy leader of the market-oriented free democratic party .
" the upturn is over before it 's even begun . " weak domestic economy no improvement was in sight in domestic demand given the high level of unemployment and with growth set to remain only sluggish , no substantial improvements could be expected on the labor market in the near future , the institutes said . the jobless total , which stood at 4.381 million or 10.2 percent of the workforce in 2004 , was expected to average 4.844 million this year , equivalent to a jobless rate of 11.1 percent .
and next year , it would come down to 4.518 million or 10.4 percent , the institutes predicted . the combination of weak growth and high unemployment also signalled bad news for germany 's public finances . the institutes predicted that the german public deficit would again breach european union limits both this year and next year . " the crisis in the labor market slows our economic growth , " said axel nitschke , chief economist at the german chambers of industry and commerce , the dihk .
" the government can not let the appeal by the research institutes to fall on deaf ears . " bad news , but signs of hope the institutes said they expected the german public deficit to amount to 3.4 percent of gdp this year and 3.3 percent in 2006 , breaching the 3.0-percent limit laid down in the eu 's stability and growth pact for the fourth and fifth years running . the government had vowed to bring the deficit ratio back below 3.0 percent this year .
nevertheless , the institutes said that the current weak economic phase " will gradually be overcome during the course of the year . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high oil prices , currently a damper on the economy 's growth , are likely to recede and aid a recovery before the end of the year the effects of high oil prices would disappear and global growth was set to pick up speed again , which would be good news for exports .
low interest rates will also fuel domestic demand , adding to the momentum , according to both the institutes and the government . " impulses will come from exports , but they will also gradually feed through to the domestic economy , " economy and labor minister wolfgang clement said in a statement . in addition , the government 's labor market reforms and other structural reforms would begin to bear fruit and berlin would press ahead with further reforms in order to strengthen growth prospects in medium-to-long term .
the government 's current official growth forecast for this year stands at 1.6 percent .
but it is expected to revise it downward sharply on friday , with press reports mooting a figure of around 1.0 percent . dw staff afp / -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany backs toward the future cars , electronics and quality industrial goods have all helped make germany the world 's leading exporter .

another issue up for debate is america 's controversial nomination of paul wolfowitz as head of the world bank .

on tuesday , the country 's top economic institutes slashed their growth forecast for 2005 . the outlook for germany 's stuttering economy has become decidedly gloomier following the decision by six leading economic institutes to halve their growth forecast for the eurozone 's biggest economy this year . the institutes slashed their 2005 growth forecast to just 0.7 percent from 1.5 percent , heralding tough times for the government , which is eager to cut unemployment and get its public finances in order ahead of the general election next year . but the institutes ' gloomy report is in line with the latest forecasts by the international monetary fund and the european commission , which are both pencilling in german growth of a meager 0.8 percent this year . " the german economy finds itself in a spot of economic weakness this spring , " the institutes said .
" the strong recovery observed in the first half of 2004 has come to a standstill . " opposition : a government of " mini-growth " in 2004 , the german economy had expanded by 1.6 percent , a substantial improvement on the previous year 's lacklustre 1.1 percent , largely thanks to the increased number of working days .
those positive calendar effects are set to be reversed this year .
in addition , global growth has slowed tangibly and the strong euro was weighing on german exports , previously the main driver of growth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exports are down due to the weak dollar and strong euro " the impulses from domestic demand remain weak and are unable to offset the easing of export growth .
so the general weak economic trend remains intact , " the institutes diagnosed . the news was met with fierce criticism from the opposition , which attacked chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government with of social democrats and greens for failing to revive the economy . " red-green remains the government of mini growth , " said rainer brüderle , the deputy leader of the market-oriented free democratic party .
" the upturn is over before it 's even begun . " weak domestic economy no improvement was in sight in domestic demand given the high level of unemployment and with growth set to remain only sluggish , no substantial improvements could be expected on the labor market in the near future , the institutes said . the jobless total , which stood at 4.381 million or 10.2 percent of the workforce in 2004 , was expected to average 4.844 million this year , equivalent to a jobless rate of 11.1 percent .
and next year , it would come down to 4.518 million or 10.4 percent , the institutes predicted . the combination of weak growth and high unemployment also signalled bad news for germany 's public finances . the institutes predicted that the german public deficit would again breach european union limits both this year and next year . " the crisis in the labor market slows our economic growth , " said axel nitschke , chief economist at the german chambers of industry and commerce , the dihk .
" the government can not let the appeal by the research institutes to fall on deaf ears . " bad news , but signs of hope the institutes said they expected the german public deficit to amount to 3.4 percent of gdp this year and 3.3 percent in 2006 , breaching the 3.0-percent limit laid down in the eu 's stability and growth pact for the fourth and fifth years running . the government had vowed to bring the deficit ratio back below 3.0 percent this year .
nevertheless , the institutes said that the current weak economic phase " will gradually be overcome during the course of the year . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high oil prices , currently a damper on the economy 's growth , are likely to recede and aid a recovery before the end of the year the effects of high oil prices would disappear and global growth was set to pick up speed again , which would be good news for exports .
low interest rates will also fuel domestic demand , adding to the momentum , according to both the institutes and the government . " impulses will come from exports , but they will also gradually feed through to the domestic economy , " economy and labor minister wolfgang clement said in a statement . in addition , the government 's labor market reforms and other structural reforms would begin to bear fruit and berlin would press ahead with further reforms in order to strengthen growth prospects in medium-to-long term .
the government 's current official growth forecast for this year stands at 1.6 percent .

on tuesday , the country 's top economic institutes slashed their growth forecast for 2005 . the outlook for germany 's stuttering economy has become decidedly gloomier following the decision by six leading economic institutes to halve their growth forecast for the eurozone 's biggest economy this year . the institutes slashed their 2005 growth forecast to just 0.7 percent from 1.5 percent , heralding tough times for the government , which is eager to cut unemployment and get its public finances in order ahead of the general election next year . but the institutes ' gloomy report is in line with the latest forecasts by the international monetary fund and the european commission , which are both pencilling in german growth of a meager 0.8 percent this year . " the german economy finds itself in a spot of economic weakness this spring , " the institutes said .
" the strong recovery observed in the first half of 2004 has come to a standstill . " opposition : a government of " mini-growth " in 2004 , the german economy had expanded by 1.6 percent , a substantial improvement on the previous year 's lacklustre 1.1 percent , largely thanks to the increased number of working days .
those positive calendar effects are set to be reversed this year .
in addition , global growth has slowed tangibly and the strong euro was weighing on german exports , previously the main driver of growth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exports are down due to the weak dollar and strong euro " the impulses from domestic demand remain weak and are unable to offset the easing of export growth .
so the general weak economic trend remains intact , " the institutes diagnosed . the news was met with fierce criticism from the opposition , which attacked chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government with of social democrats and greens for failing to revive the economy . " red-green remains the government of mini growth , " said rainer brüderle , the deputy leader of the market-oriented free democratic party .
" the upturn is over before it 's even begun . " weak domestic economy no improvement was in sight in domestic demand given the high level of unemployment and with growth set to remain only sluggish , no substantial improvements could be expected on the labor market in the near future , the institutes said . the jobless total , which stood at 4.381 million or 10.2 percent of the workforce in 2004 , was expected to average 4.844 million this year , equivalent to a jobless rate of 11.1 percent .
and next year , it would come down to 4.518 million or 10.4 percent , the institutes predicted . the combination of weak growth and high unemployment also signalled bad news for germany 's public finances . the institutes predicted that the german public deficit would again breach european union limits both this year and next year . " the crisis in the labor market slows our economic growth , " said axel nitschke , chief economist at the german chambers of industry and commerce , the dihk .
" the government can not let the appeal by the research institutes to fall on deaf ears . " bad news , but signs of hope the institutes said they expected the german public deficit to amount to 3.4 percent of gdp this year and 3.3 percent in 2006 , breaching the 3.0-percent limit laid down in the eu 's stability and growth pact for the fourth and fifth years running . the government had vowed to bring the deficit ratio back below 3.0 percent this year .
nevertheless , the institutes said that the current weak economic phase " will gradually be overcome during the course of the year . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high oil prices , currently a damper on the economy 's growth , are likely to recede and aid a recovery before the end of the year the effects of high oil prices would disappear and global growth was set to pick up speed again , which would be good news for exports .
low interest rates will also fuel domestic demand , adding to the momentum , according to both the institutes and the government . " impulses will come from exports , but they will also gradually feed through to the domestic economy , " economy and labor minister wolfgang clement said in a statement . in addition , the government 's labor market reforms and other structural reforms would begin to bear fruit and berlin would press ahead with further reforms in order to strengthen growth prospects in medium-to-long term .
the government 's current official growth forecast for this year stands at 1.6 percent .
but it is expected to revise it downward sharply on friday , with press reports mooting a figure of around 1.0 percent . dw staff afp / -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany backs toward the future cars , electronics and quality industrial goods have all helped make germany the world 's leading exporter .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 26.04.2005 the great pretenders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viva las vegas in berlin berlin is home to serious culture vultures , but the city ’ s top private production isn ’ t a heavy opera or play .
rather , germans are flocking to a vegas-style show featuring some of the world ’ s best doppelgangers . backstage at berlin 's estrel festival center , melissa totten toys with the platinum blonde curls on her new custom-made wig .
" just this morning , my hair was this same color , " she says , running a hand through her own hair , which has now been dyed a darker , caramel blonde .
the wig will make it even easier to transform herself into her alter ego , madonna .
not that the transformation is difficult .
totten bears a striking resemblance to the " material girl . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : looks like the real thing - melissa totten as madonna in " stars in concert " later , when totten performs " express yourself " dressed in a replica of the infamous jean paul gaultier-designed " cone " corset , it 's easy to forget you 're watching an impersonator . " what i 've heard people say is there are lookalikes in europe , but they 're not on the level where they 're singing live , playing instruments , dancing , and doing everything , " says totten , who has been " doing " madonna for 10 years .
" when people see our show , they 're seeing the best of what they can see . " winning formula totten is a regular in " stars in concert , " which has been running at the estrel for eight years .
producer bernhard kurz - the man credited with first bringing musicals such as " cats " and " phantom of the opera " to germany - has clearly hit on winning formula . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tom jones impersonator performing at the estrel hotel " stars " has a continually rotating line-up of six performers who each do their own set .
even repeat customers - of which there are many - can count on seeing new acts , which range from tom jones and louis armstrong to celine dion and whitney houston . but when kurz first introduced " stars , " he had no idea the show would still be going strong today . " he brought the idea for ' stars in concert ' directly from las vegas , and the aim was to have the show for one year , " said press spokeswoman mihaela djuranovic .
" it 's the kind of success no one really predicted at the beginning . " the doppelganger concept encountered a certain amount of skepticism at first , djuranovic says .
there was n't much of a tradition for such entertainment in germany , and people tended to lump it in with karaoke .
the performers are aware of this , but see it as their job to win germany over , one show at a time . " some people take it as a joke , have a laugh and say , oh , they 're just impersonators , but there are actually a lot of talented people in the business , " says grahame p. doyle , the elvis of " stars in concert . " he should know .
in the world of showbiz impersonators , being elvis is possibly the biggest challenge of all , due to the extraordinary amount of competition . " there 's a lot of elvis impersonators - maybe as many as 40,000 around the world , " says doyle .
" but if you break it down to the handful that give you goose bumps , those that truly bring respect to his character , then you can knock off about 95 percent of those people . " bildunterschrift : " jail house rock " tough audience doyle is one of the more sought-after elvis doppelgangers .
he performed the las vegas circuit for seven years before producer kurz could finally lure him to berlin .
it was a radical change , says doyle , but a welcome one . " berlin is laid back and chilled , and vegas is about getting your party on , " he says .
" there , you have to walk through casinos to get to work .
it 's a completely different atmosphere .
and because vegas is so loose , the audience responds that way too . " berlin audiences , on the other hand , are much more reserved , the performers say . " we were always told when we first came to berlin that berlin was the toughest audience in germany , " totten , alias madonna , says .
" they 're very proper , but they 're also very respectful .
i love the way people dress and come to the show , and they have great things to say afterwards , so i think they appreciate it and we appreciate them . " riding on the success of " stars " in berlin , kurz opened a second venue for the show in essen , western germany , in 2003 .
and it does n't stop there .
adapting the concept , kurz is also behind tribute shows to particular artists or groups such as the beatles , abba , and the blues brothers . in the land of goethe and wagner , it 's not intellectual , nor does it aim to be .
as djuranovic says , " it 's just good entertainment .

" i think germany could potentially play a constructive role in helping the iraqis draft the constitution because of your federal structure , " he told reporters . " friends of mine who are working in iraq and who 've worked in the former soviet union and other very highly centralized systems have said that iraq is the most centralized system they have ever seen . " devolving iraqi power jones noted that there were elections in january for all 18 iraqi provinces , which he said would see political power devolve from baghdad for the first time since iraqi leader saddam hussein fell from power . " now for the first time in modern iraqi history , maybe for the first time ever , you have elected governments at the provincial level that are working to build themselves and of course in germany , you have the länder -lrb- federal states -rrb- , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitution could spread power throughout the country " i think that is a model which could be very useful for iraq .
obviously , it is up to the iraqi people but i would say that germany may have some expertise to provide the iraqis as they decide their permanent constitution , as to whether or not they want to continue the kind of system that saddam had or if they want to develop a more decentralized system . " west germany ratified a new basic law - drafted with us occupying forces - in 1949 aimed at eliminating the instruments that allowed the nazis to centralize power in berlin , and granting the federal states broad political scope . looming deadlines the united states would like to see the iraqi constitution written by august 15 and ratified by october 15 , with new elections held by december 15 and a new government formed by the end of the year . jones met with officials from german chancellor gerhard schröder 's office , the foreign ministry and the ministry for economic co-operation and development as part of a european tour that also took in france , italy and turkey and involved meetings with european union leaders . he said a us-eu meeting on iraq in brussels in the second half of june would focus on coordinating political and economic assistance for iraq .

on tuesday , the country 's top economic institutes slashed their growth forecast for 2005 . the outlook for germany 's stuttering economy has become decidedly gloomier following the decision by six leading economic institutes to halve their growth forecast for the eurozone 's biggest economy this year . the institutes slashed their 2005 growth forecast to just 0.7 percent from 1.5 percent , heralding tough times for the government , which is eager to cut unemployment and get its public finances in order ahead of the general election next year . but the institutes ' gloomy report is in line with the latest forecasts by the international monetary fund and the european commission , which are both pencilling in german growth of a meager 0.8 percent this year . " the german economy finds itself in a spot of economic weakness this spring , " the institutes said .

" opposition : a government of " mini-growth " in 2004 , the german economy had expanded by 1.6 percent , a substantial improvement on the previous year 's lacklustre 1.1 percent , largely thanks to the increased number of working days .

on tuesday , the country 's top economic institutes slashed their growth forecast for 2005 . the outlook for germany 's stuttering economy has become decidedly gloomier following the decision by six leading economic institutes to halve their growth forecast for the eurozone 's biggest economy this year . the institutes slashed their 2005 growth forecast to just 0.7 percent from 1.5 percent , heralding tough times for the government , which is eager to cut unemployment and get its public finances in order ahead of the general election next year . but the institutes ' gloomy report is in line with the latest forecasts by the international monetary fund and the european commission , which are both pencilling in german growth of a meager 0.8 percent this year . " the german economy finds itself in a spot of economic weakness this spring , " the institutes said .
" the strong recovery observed in the first half of 2004 has come to a standstill . " opposition : a government of " mini-growth " in 2004 , the german economy had expanded by 1.6 percent , a substantial improvement on the previous year 's lacklustre 1.1 percent , largely thanks to the increased number of working days .
those positive calendar effects are set to be reversed this year .
in addition , global growth has slowed tangibly and the strong euro was weighing on german exports , previously the main driver of growth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exports are down due to the weak dollar and strong euro " the impulses from domestic demand remain weak and are unable to offset the easing of export growth .
so the general weak economic trend remains intact , " the institutes diagnosed . the news was met with fierce criticism from the opposition , which attacked chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government with of social democrats and greens for failing to revive the economy . " red-green remains the government of mini growth , " said rainer brüderle , the deputy leader of the market-oriented free democratic party .
" the upturn is over before it 's even begun . " weak domestic economy no improvement was in sight in domestic demand given the high level of unemployment and with growth set to remain only sluggish , no substantial improvements could be expected on the labor market in the near future , the institutes said . the jobless total , which stood at 4.381 million or 10.2 percent of the workforce in 2004 , was expected to average 4.844 million this year , equivalent to a jobless rate of 11.1 percent .
and next year , it would come down to 4.518 million or 10.4 percent , the institutes predicted . the combination of weak growth and high unemployment also signalled bad news for germany 's public finances . the institutes predicted that the german public deficit would again breach european union limits both this year and next year . " the crisis in the labor market slows our economic growth , " said axel nitschke , chief economist at the german chambers of industry and commerce , the dihk .
" the government can not let the appeal by the research institutes to fall on deaf ears . " bad news , but signs of hope the institutes said they expected the german public deficit to amount to 3.4 percent of gdp this year and 3.3 percent in 2006 , breaching the 3.0-percent limit laid down in the eu 's stability and growth pact for the fourth and fifth years running . the government had vowed to bring the deficit ratio back below 3.0 percent this year .
nevertheless , the institutes said that the current weak economic phase " will gradually be overcome during the course of the year . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high oil prices , currently a damper on the economy 's growth , are likely to recede and aid a recovery before the end of the year the effects of high oil prices would disappear and global growth was set to pick up speed again , which would be good news for exports .
low interest rates will also fuel domestic demand , adding to the momentum , according to both the institutes and the government . " impulses will come from exports , but they will also gradually feed through to the domestic economy , " economy and labor minister wolfgang clement said in a statement . in addition , the government 's labor market reforms and other structural reforms would begin to bear fruit and berlin would press ahead with further reforms in order to strengthen growth prospects in medium-to-long term .

" it 's important not just because of the games but the fact that this will be the first time that we have spent a long period of time together .
on top of that , it 's in our home country , just like the world cup . " klinsmann and his coaching staff will use the confederations cup to run a critical eye over their charges with a view to assembling a tournament-savvy group ready to make a play for the big prize in 2006 .
" we will see how the team reacts to certain events , this is something different from a one-off international . " young stars will get their chance to shine the germany coach also pledged to do all what was necessary to win the confederations cup this june , even at the temporary expense of his youth policy .
klinsmann said that an experienced team would battle for the cup but young hopefuls would still get their chance to shine .
" there will be possibilities to play the younger ones , " he said , " to get a feeling whether they are ready for the world cup . " one man who is sure to feature is klinsmann 's captain , michael ballack .
the germany coach took the opportunity to pledge his support for ballack , saying that he expects the midfielder to prove critics wrong at the 2006 world cup and show he can be placed on a pedestal with the other great playmakers in world football .
klinsmann backs ballack to silence critics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich star ballack , 28 , has come in for criticism in the press and brazil 's three-time world cup winner pele recently claimed he had not made any progress over the past few seasons . " the criticism drives michael on and he will silence the doubters , " klinsmann said .
" the 2006 world cup on home soil will offer him the perfect stage to join recent greats such as zinedine zidane and pavel nedved . "
ballack has scored 22 goals in 50 internationals for germany marking him out as one of the most dangerous attacking midfielders in europe . " michael is a world class player and all of us in the german national team know this , " added klinsmann .
" he is lethal in front of goal and capable of changing the game in an instant . " vogts job row to go to a vote at dfb klinsmann refused to directly address the thorny subject of his proposed plan to give former national coach berti vogts which has turned into another row with the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- .
the plan would see vogts dislodge michael skibbe from the post of developing the country 's talent as technical director . the dfb has yet to make a formal decision on klinsmann 's latest proposed reform although there is a timetable in place for a possible vote .
" it is important that those involved stick to that timetable , " klinsmann said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's former coach berti vogts .
it is unlikely the dfb will let klinsmann get his way on this matter as initial reports suggest that vogts can only count on three votes on the federation 's 14-seat presidium , composed of germany 's most powerful soccer officials . klinsi favors cooperation to solve problems resolving other areas of conflict between himself and the dfb , klinsmann said , such as the number of games his players are expected to play ahead of the world cup , are " in the national interest . "
only through cooperation with the german soccer hierarchy can such problems be solved , the coach added , softening his stance marginally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : disgraced german referee robert hoyzer sport / personen / dfb / schiedsrichter / affäre highres bild : < < zum download bitte mit der rechten maustaste ' ziel -lrb- verknüpfung -rrb- speichern unter ...

the referee scandal centered on robert hoyzer -lrb- photo -rrb- and allegations of ticket fraud will not have any long term effect . " i think that there will be no lasting damage , " klinsmann concluded but warned : " but everyone knows that the impossible is also possible in football .

"
" what 's at stake is something truly historic : the idea of a europe united in response to the horrors of fascism , " the german chancellor said earlier , adding he hoped that france , " the cradle of this idea , remains true to its promises " . ' non ' would have enormous consequences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : posters encourage french citizens to reject the consitution .
but the " non " camp is losing ground schröder 's visit to paris for a joint franco-german cabinet meeting gave the social democratic german chancellor a chance to help the center-right chirac woo unconvinced voters on the political left ahead of the key vote .
the constitution , which aims to simplify decision-making in the expanded eu , must be approved by all 25 eu member states .
a rejection in france would have enormous repercussions , both within the country and across the european union .
chirac - who has staked his prestige on a ' yes ' vote - warned opponents that should they triumph , they would bear rresponsibility for interrupting 50 years of european construction " .
by approving the text , france instead would be " making the choice of a europe that is more social , more independent and more powerful , " he said .
the two leaders said earlier in a statement that the constitution would " be an important step in terms of asserting europe 's weight in the international arena and reinforcing its ability to act for peace and security in the world " .
chirac and schröder highlighted the fact that the constitution marked a " major step " in the realization of the " european political project " , adding that it would reinforce " the sphere of activity of european defense " . " europe must go on the offensive " the joint franco-german cabinet meeting , focused on industrial cooperation , was intended to showcase the dynamic nature of europe 's economy and its ability to compete with the united states and emerging economic powers .
the ministers adopted four pilot projects - two on biomedical research , and two others on information technology - that will bring together business consortiums and research laboratories from the two states .
in a speech at the sorbonne , with schröder by his side , chirac said europe must " go on the offensive and make a massive commitment to innovation " . " with the emergence of major players like china and india , with the united states and japan moving forward more than ever , what 's at stake is technological supremacy in this world , " chirac said .
during their morning meeting , chirac and schröder also discussed the eu 's 2007-2013 budget and a controversial draft eu law on the liberalization of the eu services sector .
chirac told reporters that the so-called bolkestein directive on the bloc 's services sector " no longer exists " . he added that paris and berlin would work to ensure that any revised draft would not include a " country-of-origin " clause which suggests that companies could provide services throughout the eu using the laws of their own country . dw staff / afp -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crisis deepens over french eu stance even as french voters look set to torpedo the eu constitution in a referendum , luxembourg premier juncker added a new twist to the dilemma this week , saying the us hopes the french will reject the treaty .

"
" what 's at stake is something truly historic : the idea of a europe united in response to the horrors of fascism , " the german chancellor said earlier , adding he hoped that france , " the cradle of this idea , remains true to its promises " . ' non ' would have enormous consequences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : posters encourage french citizens to reject the consitution .
but the " non " camp is losing ground schröder 's visit to paris for a joint franco-german cabinet meeting gave the social democratic german chancellor a chance to help the center-right chirac woo unconvinced voters on the political left ahead of the key vote .
the constitution , which aims to simplify decision-making in the expanded eu , must be approved by all 25 eu member states .
a rejection in france would have enormous repercussions , both within the country and across the european union .
chirac - who has staked his prestige on a ' yes ' vote - warned opponents that should they triumph , they would bear rresponsibility for interrupting 50 years of european construction " .
by approving the text , france instead would be " making the choice of a europe that is more social , more independent and more powerful , " he said .
the two leaders said earlier in a statement that the constitution would " be an important step in terms of asserting europe 's weight in the international arena and reinforcing its ability to act for peace and security in the world " .
chirac and schröder highlighted the fact that the constitution marked a " major step " in the realization of the " european political project " , adding that it would reinforce " the sphere of activity of european defense " . " europe must go on the offensive " the joint franco-german cabinet meeting , focused on industrial cooperation , was intended to showcase the dynamic nature of europe 's economy and its ability to compete with the united states and emerging economic powers .
the ministers adopted four pilot projects - two on biomedical research , and two others on information technology - that will bring together business consortiums and research laboratories from the two states .
in a speech at the sorbonne , with schröder by his side , chirac said europe must " go on the offensive and make a massive commitment to innovation " . " with the emergence of major players like china and india , with the united states and japan moving forward more than ever , what 's at stake is technological supremacy in this world , " chirac said .
during their morning meeting , chirac and schröder also discussed the eu 's 2007-2013 budget and a controversial draft eu law on the liberalization of the eu services sector .
chirac told reporters that the so-called bolkestein directive on the bloc 's services sector " no longer exists " . he added that paris and berlin would work to ensure that any revised draft would not include a " country-of-origin " clause which suggests that companies could provide services throughout the eu using the laws of their own country . dw staff / afp -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crisis deepens over french eu stance even as french voters look set to torpedo the eu constitution in a referendum , luxembourg premier juncker added a new twist to the dilemma this week , saying the us hopes the french will reject the treaty .

fischer ducked and dived , but in the end he admitted a visa policy that allowed thousands of criminals into the country was his responsibility .
but there wo n't be any consequences , says wolter von tiesenhausen . the parliamentary committee grilled fischer for over 12 hours as tv cameras recorded the whole thing . everyone was able to witness how the foreign minister tried to extricate himself from the affair , how the opposition parliamentarians took pains to set traps for him and allied parliamentarians from fischer 's red-green coalition government tried to defend their man . that was interesting for a short while , and not without humor .
but stretched out over an entire day , and including many repetitions , it was rather tiresome . fischer 's understanding of democracy the result of all these efforts can be summed up quickly : the foreign minister admitted mistakes .
the granting of visas to come into the country through the so-called volmer decree -lrb- former state secretary ludwig vollmer allegedly ordered embassies to grant visas even if in doubt -rrb- took on dimensions that no one had anticipated .
that criminals were also abusing the generous german visa system , which was something the top level of the foreign office , and the minister , ignored for a long time .
the correction came too late , despite warnings from the interior minister and a few states . in his testimony , fischer tried to turn the tables and make the opposition responsible for making a scandal out of the entire process .
this method of yelling " stop thief ! " and then hiding behind the corner speaks to the skewed understanding the witness fischer has of democracy . the discovery of mistakes made by ministers belongs to the basic duties of an opposition party in a democracy .
the actual frustration is the minister 's false appraisal and that he looked the other way for so long . the good news on this point , the committee - despite all its problems as an institution that charges , defends and judges - contributed to clarification . the minister gave up his initial evasive maneuvers and admitted full responsibility .
it is now also beyond dispute that the correction -lrb- of policies -rrb- did n't happen immediately , but with too great a delay .
the minister is also responsible for that .
the consequences were that many thousands of illegal workers , prostitutes and criminals were not able to only travel to germany but to other european countries . the committee proved all of that .
but it ca n't force the minister to accept consequences .
chancellor gerhard schröder can do that , but would hardly think of breaking off the cornerstone of his coalition .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.04.2005 berlin to help draft iraqi constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqis have voted , now they need a constitution washington is seeking german help to meet a tight timetable for writing a new iraqi constitution based on berlin 's own postwar political rebirth . following talks with officials in berlin , the us state department 's coordinator for iraq policy , richard jones , said that germany 's federal system could serve as a model for iraq .
" i think germany could potentially play a constructive role in helping the iraqis draft the constitution because of your federal structure , " he told reporters . " friends of mine who are working in iraq and who 've worked in the former soviet union and other very highly centralized systems have said that iraq is the most centralized system they have ever seen . " devolving iraqi power jones noted that there were elections in january for all 18 iraqi provinces , which he said would see political power devolve from baghdad for the first time since iraqi leader saddam hussein fell from power .

but the " non " camp is losing ground schröder 's visit to paris for a joint franco-german cabinet meeting gave the social democratic german chancellor a chance to help the center-right chirac woo unconvinced voters on the political left ahead of the key vote .
the constitution , which aims to simplify decision-making in the expanded eu , must be approved by all 25 eu member states .
a rejection in france would have enormous repercussions , both within the country and across the european union .
chirac - who has staked his prestige on a ' yes ' vote - warned opponents that should they triumph , they would bear rresponsibility for interrupting 50 years of european construction " .
by approving the text , france instead would be " making the choice of a europe that is more social , more independent and more powerful , " he said .
the two leaders said earlier in a statement that the constitution would " be an important step in terms of asserting europe 's weight in the international arena and reinforcing its ability to act for peace and security in the world " .
chirac and schröder highlighted the fact that the constitution marked a " major step " in the realization of the " european political project " , adding that it would reinforce " the sphere of activity of european defense " .

the ministers adopted four pilot projects - two on biomedical research , and two others on information technology - that will bring together business consortiums and research laboratories from the two states .
in a speech at the sorbonne , with schröder by his side , chirac said europe must " go on the offensive and make a massive commitment to innovation " . " with the emergence of major players like china and india , with the united states and japan moving forward more than ever , what 's at stake is technological supremacy in this world , " chirac said .
during their morning meeting , chirac and schröder also discussed the eu 's 2007-2013 budget and a controversial draft eu law on the liberalization of the eu services sector .
chirac told reporters that the so-called bolkestein directive on the bloc 's services sector " no longer exists " . he added that paris and berlin would work to ensure that any revised draft would not include a " country-of-origin " clause which suggests that companies could provide services throughout the eu using the laws of their own country . dw staff / afp -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crisis deepens over french eu stance even as french voters look set to torpedo the eu constitution in a referendum , luxembourg premier juncker added a new twist to the dilemma this week , saying the us hopes the french will reject the treaty .

fischer ducked and dived , but in the end he admitted a visa policy that allowed thousands of criminals into the country was his responsibility .
but there wo n't be any consequences , says wolter von tiesenhausen . the parliamentary committee grilled fischer for over 12 hours as tv cameras recorded the whole thing . everyone was able to witness how the foreign minister tried to extricate himself from the affair , how the opposition parliamentarians took pains to set traps for him and allied parliamentarians from fischer 's red-green coalition government tried to defend their man . that was interesting for a short while , and not without humor .
but stretched out over an entire day , and including many repetitions , it was rather tiresome . fischer 's understanding of democracy the result of all these efforts can be summed up quickly : the foreign minister admitted mistakes .
the granting of visas to come into the country through the so-called volmer decree -lrb- former state secretary ludwig vollmer allegedly ordered embassies to grant visas even if in doubt -rrb- took on dimensions that no one had anticipated .
that criminals were also abusing the generous german visa system , which was something the top level of the foreign office , and the minister , ignored for a long time .
the correction came too late , despite warnings from the interior minister and a few states . in his testimony , fischer tried to turn the tables and make the opposition responsible for making a scandal out of the entire process .
this method of yelling " stop thief ! " and then hiding behind the corner speaks to the skewed understanding the witness fischer has of democracy . the discovery of mistakes made by ministers belongs to the basic duties of an opposition party in a democracy .
the actual frustration is the minister 's false appraisal and that he looked the other way for so long . the good news on this point , the committee - despite all its problems as an institution that charges , defends and judges - contributed to clarification . the minister gave up his initial evasive maneuvers and admitted full responsibility .
it is now also beyond dispute that the correction -lrb- of policies -rrb- did n't happen immediately , but with too great a delay .
the minister is also responsible for that .
the consequences were that many thousands of illegal workers , prostitutes and criminals were not able to only travel to germany but to other european countries . the committee proved all of that .
but it ca n't force the minister to accept consequences .
chancellor gerhard schröder can do that , but would hardly think of breaking off the cornerstone of his coalition .
as a result , the final judgment over the ' visa affair ' wo n't come until the federal elections in 2006 . wolter von tiesenhausen -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer accepts blame in immigration probe german foreign minister joschka fischer admitted on monday that he failed to act more quickly to stop visa abuses which allowed tens of thousands of eastern europeans to flood into germany between 2000 and 2003 .

but he rounded on the opposition christian democrats , accusing them of exaggerating the scale of the problem and dismissed claims that germany had been overrun by an influx of criminals . opposition calls for fischer to stand down inevitably , the opposition renewed their call for fischer 's resignation .
eckart von klaeden , a christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- representative on the inquiry who clashed with fischer during his testimony , said : " i still believe that it would be proper for him to resign . " bildunterschrift : joschka fischer at the entrance for the hearing but olaf scholz , who represents chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in the inquiry , said fischer had shown there were no grounds for him to step down . " one thing is clear - the minister will stay in office , " scholz said .
he added that he believed fischer 's testimony would give the spd a " tailwind " ahead of a key election on may 22 in germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia . the spd are the dominant partners in the ruling coalition along with fischer 's greens .
schröder 's party has suffered a string of setbacks in state elections and , with a general election due to take place in september next year , the spd ca n't afford to lose in north rhine-westphalia , one of its traditional strongholds . divided opinion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the focus of media attention - not all of it positive the newspapers were equally divided over fischer 's performance .

" we are now past the high point of this scandal , there are no new revelations to emerge , " it said .
the conservative frankfurter allgemeine zeitung was less convinced , saying : " fischer gave it his best .
we will see if it was enough . " and die w elt , also a conservative paper , criticised what it said were all too frequent gaps in fischer 's memory .
" what fischer left out of this ' acrobatic ' recollection is what sticks in the memory - of a minister who has n't got a grip on his own department . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schroeder supports fischer all the way most of the newspapers , however , accepted that a major factor in fischer 's favor was that he has schröder 's support .
in an interview in sunday 's edition of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung the chancellor said : " the foreign minister will remain the foreign minister . " the inquiry could recall fischer for further questions if necessary . afp / dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : democracy according to fischer fischer ducked and dived , but in the end he admitted a visa policy that allowed thousands of criminals into the country was his responsibility .
but there wo n't be any consequences , says wolter von tiesenhausen .

" it 's important not just because of the games but the fact that this will be the first time that we have spent a long period of time together .
on top of that , it 's in our home country , just like the world cup . " klinsmann and his coaching staff will use the confederations cup to run a critical eye over their charges with a view to assembling a tournament-savvy group ready to make a play for the big prize in 2006 .
" we will see how the team reacts to certain events , this is something different from a one-off international . " young stars will get their chance to shine the germany coach also pledged to do all what was necessary to win the confederations cup this june , even at the temporary expense of his youth policy .
klinsmann said that an experienced team would battle for the cup but young hopefuls would still get their chance to shine .
" there will be possibilities to play the younger ones , " he said , " to get a feeling whether they are ready for the world cup . " one man who is sure to feature is klinsmann 's captain , michael ballack .
the germany coach took the opportunity to pledge his support for ballack , saying that he expects the midfielder to prove critics wrong at the 2006 world cup and show he can be placed on a pedestal with the other great playmakers in world football .
klinsmann backs ballack to silence critics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich star ballack , 28 , has come in for criticism in the press and brazil 's three-time world cup winner pele recently claimed he had not made any progress over the past few seasons . " the criticism drives michael on and he will silence the doubters , " klinsmann said .
" the 2006 world cup on home soil will offer him the perfect stage to join recent greats such as zinedine zidane and pavel nedved . "
ballack has scored 22 goals in 50 internationals for germany marking him out as one of the most dangerous attacking midfielders in europe . " michael is a world class player and all of us in the german national team know this , " added klinsmann .
" he is lethal in front of goal and capable of changing the game in an instant . " vogts job row to go to a vote at dfb klinsmann refused to directly address the thorny subject of his proposed plan to give former national coach berti vogts which has turned into another row with the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- .
the plan would see vogts dislodge michael skibbe from the post of developing the country 's talent as technical director . the dfb has yet to make a formal decision on klinsmann 's latest proposed reform although there is a timetable in place for a possible vote .
" it is important that those involved stick to that timetable , " klinsmann said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's former coach berti vogts .
it is unlikely the dfb will let klinsmann get his way on this matter as initial reports suggest that vogts can only count on three votes on the federation 's 14-seat presidium , composed of germany 's most powerful soccer officials . klinsi favors cooperation to solve problems resolving other areas of conflict between himself and the dfb , klinsmann said , such as the number of games his players are expected to play ahead of the world cup , are " in the national interest .

actor simon jones , who starred in the original tv series , talks about his involvement in both the new movie and radio version .
simon jones sporting arthur dent 's trademark dressing gown for more than a quarter of a century , simon jones has been the face - and the voice - of arthur dent , hapless hero of the hitchhiker 's guide to the galaxy .
but now the 55-year-old actor has a pretender to his throne in martin freeman , star of the new film version of douglas adams ' sci-fi novel .
if jones feels bitter , however , he hides it well , those urbane tones so familiar to tv and radio audiences betraying no flicker of resentment .
" arthur belongs to the ages , " he says .
" i just happen to be the original and the genuine one . "
besides , jones had long since given up the hope of playing arthur on the big screen .
douglas adams did n't write any more novels so i ca n't see how i can continue simon jones " one always entertained the possibility , but as i got older i realised my participation was going to be less and less , " he says .
" so i thought i would concentrate on making myself a star on broadway instead . "
for the record , jones first played dent in the original hitchhiker radio series , broadcast in 1978 .
he reprised the role on air in 1980 before starring in the tv version the following year .
in the years that followed , plans to continue the saga in either medium foundered - as did adams ' hopes of getting a movie off the ground .
' gusto ' but that changed following the author 's death in 2001 .
not only did the film finally get the go-ahead , but jones found himself back in the studio with his former cast mates recording two new radio series .
the first was broadcast last september , while the second begins on bbc radio 4 on 3 may .
jones as he appeared in the 1981 hitchhiker tv series " radio 's so kind - we all sound the same , " says jones .
" i was told my voice had dropped a semi-tone , which is the sort of thing that can only be heard by bats .
" and it was wonderful to meet old friends again and see the passage of time had not been too hard on us . "
jones ' enjoyment was augmented by the presence of numerous high-profile guest stars , from veteran comedian jackie mason and actor jonathan pryce to hollywood heart-throb christian slater .
" i do n't think he had any idea what it was about , but he plunged in with a great deal of gusto . "
the new radio series , based on adams ' final two hitchhiker books , will probably mark jones ' last outing as arthur .
the purists will no doubt be upset but this is a major motion picture simon jones " douglas did n't write any more so i ca n't see how i can continue , " he says .
" unless we find some hitherto unpublished document , and i think they 've been through his hard drives pretty thoroughly . "
but in a move that will surely appeal to adams ' army of fans , the actor makes a cameo appearance in garth jennings ' film .
" i play , rather aptly , a ghostly image , " he explains .
" it 's a good idea , " he continues .
" it 's a nod to what we 've done before and i 'm perfectly happy with it . "
' nervous ' moreover , jones says he " got on very well " with his successor martin freeman when they met towards the end of filming .
" martin said he was nervous about meeting me , though he certainly did n't seem it , " he says .
" it was very friendly - there was no eye-gouging or hair-pulling . "
martin freeman of the office plays arthur dent in the new film so what does jones make of freeman 's interpretation ?
we will have to wait for his opinion as - either through accident or design - he managed to miss last week 's world premiere .
" i was invited and intended to come but i could n't get away from new york in time , " he explains , adding : " which gets me off the hook , does n't it ? "
indeed it does , though the actor has high expectations .
" i 'm looking forward to the special effects being quite sensational , " he says .
" and as far as i know they 've fallen over backwards to respect what they imagine would be douglas 's wishes .
" the purists will no doubt be upset for one reason or another , but you have to remember this is a major motion picture that has to reach out to a wider audience , as well as satisfy the fans .
" that 's the tightrope they 're walking and i wish them the best of luck . "

bbc news -pipe- uk -pipe- uk politics -pipe- election 2005 -pipe- analysis : do we need nuclear ?
bbc news / election 2005 graphics version bbc sport home election 2005 -pipe- results -pipe- issues -pipe- weblog -pipe- have your say -pipe- england -pipe- northern ireland -pipe- scotland -pipe- wales tuesday , 26 april , 2005 , 07:27 gmt 08:27 uk analysis : do we need nuclear ?
by sarah mukherjee bbc news environment correspondent between them , the uk 's 14 nuclear power stations provide about a quarter of britain 's electricity .
however , these stations are getting old - half are due to be decommissioned between now and 2010 - and by 2023 all but sizewell b will have shut .
some environmental campaigners say the sooner the better ; the nuclear industry , they say , produces toxic waste that we are leaving as a burden to future generations and that the risk of accidents make it an unacceptable form of energy .
but , as the industry itself points out , nuclear power is almost carbon neutral .
according to government figures , carbon emissions which fell during the 1990s are now on the way up again - and as a government web site points out , nuclear generation currently reduces national carbon emissions by between 7 and 14 % .
lesser evil the nuclear industry says we simply will not be able to meet our targets for reducing our carbon emissions unless nuclear energy has a part to play - and , privately , that is a view that finds sympathetic listeners in government .
even some environmentalists share this view - although it has to be stressed that they are in a distinct minority .
they say however , that nuclear is the lesser of two evils - it 's better to leave nuclear waste , than to destroy the planet by burning so much oil and coal that we leave our children and grandchildren with runaway climate change .
the uk 's largest power firm , british energy , in a recent research paper , suggested that to meet future energy demands the government needs to consider maintaining the current level of nuclear capacity .
this would require , it said , commissioning about 10 power stations of 1000-1200mw capacity between 2010 and 2025 . "
there is no magic bullet - we need a whole portfolio of energy measures to meet our increasing demand " the government 's view is that " while nuclear is currently an important source of carbon free electricity , the current economics of nuclear power make it an unattractive option for new generating capacity and there are also important issues for nuclear waste to be resolved " .
but the possibility that new nuclear build might be needed in the future , to meet carbon reduction objectives , is not being ruled out .
the economics referred to in the quotation is the crippling cost of new nuclear power stations - estimated at about £ 10bn pounds over a period of about 20 years .
any decision to build more power stations would need some sort of financial input from the government , say industry experts , to offset this huge financial undertaking .
and even if the government agreed to this , the planning process for a new nuclear power station - with all the public opposition that would almost certainly greet such a proposal - could be lengthy to say the least .
slow take-up british energy has urged the government to consider streamlining the planning process if they decided to go ahead with new power stations - and added that there are sites where nuclear facilities are currently operating that could be used for new stations , like sizewell , dungeness and hartlepool .
but could we live without nuclear power ?
at present , less than 3 % of the uk 's electricity supply comes from renewable sources .
the government has set a target that , by 2010 , 10 % of electricity should come from renewable sources - but there are some in the industry who doubt we will hit that target .
renewables experts say that the sector could provide a significant amount of britain 's energy requirements - but admit the take-up is slow .
significant challenge " there is nothing wrong with renewable technology as such but if we look at the rate of penetration -lsb- of these new technologies -rsb- it is looking quite likely that it will not meet all our future energy requirements , " says john loughhead , executive director of the uk energy research centre .
there is no magic bullet - we need a whole portfolio of energy measures to meet our increasing demand .
for example we are looking at ways to redesign carbon burning systems to ensure that less carbon is released .

by sarah mukherjee bbc news environment correspondent between them , the uk 's 14 nuclear power stations provide about a quarter of britain 's electricity .
dungeness b will shut in 2008 however , these stations are getting old - half are due to be decommissioned between now and 2010 - and by 2023 all but sizewell b will have shut .
some environmental campaigners say the sooner the better ; the nuclear industry , they say , produces toxic waste that we are leaving as a burden to future generations and that the risk of accidents make it an unacceptable form of energy .
but , as the industry itself points out , nuclear power is almost carbon neutral .
according to government figures , carbon emissions which fell during the 1990s are now on the way up again - and as a government web site points out , nuclear generation currently reduces national carbon emissions by between 7 and 14 % .
lesser evil the nuclear industry says we simply will not be able to meet our targets for reducing our carbon emissions unless nuclear energy has a part to play - and , privately , that is a view that finds sympathetic listeners in government .
click here for the uk 's nuclear stations even some environmentalists share this view - although it has to be stressed that they are in a distinct minority .
they say however , that nuclear is the lesser of two evils - it 's better to leave nuclear waste , than to destroy the planet by burning so much oil and coal that we leave our children and grandchildren with runaway climate change .
the uk 's largest power firm , british energy , in a recent research paper , suggested that to meet future energy demands the government needs to consider maintaining the current level of nuclear capacity .
this would require , it said , commissioning about 10 power stations of 1000-1200mw capacity between 2010 and 2025 .
there is no magic bullet - we need a whole portfolio of energy measures to meet our increasing demand the government 's view is that " while nuclear is currently an important source of carbon free electricity , the current economics of nuclear power make it an unattractive option for new generating capacity and there are also important issues for nuclear waste to be resolved " .
but the possibility that new nuclear build might be needed in the future , to meet carbon reduction objectives , is not being ruled out .
the economics referred to in the quotation is the crippling cost of new nuclear power stations - estimated at about £ 10bn pounds over a period of about 20 years .
any decision to build more power stations would need some sort of financial input from the government , say industry experts , to offset this huge financial undertaking .
and even if the government agreed to this , the planning process for a new nuclear power station - with all the public opposition that would almost certainly greet such a proposal - could be lengthy to say the least .
slow take-up british energy has urged the government to consider streamlining the planning process if they decided to go ahead with new power stations - and added that there are sites where nuclear facilities are currently operating that could be used for new stations , like sizewell , dungeness and hartlepool .
but could we live without nuclear power ?
at present , less than 3 % of the uk 's electricity supply comes from renewable sources .
the government has set a target that , by 2010 , 10 % of electricity should come from renewable sources - but there are some in the industry who doubt we will hit that target .
renewables experts say that the sector could provide a significant amount of britain 's energy requirements - but admit the take-up is slow .
significant challenge " there is nothing wrong with renewable technology as such but if we look at the rate of penetration -lsb- of these new technologies -rsb- it is looking quite likely that it will not meet all our future energy requirements , " says john loughhead , executive director of the uk energy research centre .
there is no magic bullet - we need a whole portfolio of energy measures to meet our increasing demand .
for example we are looking at ways to redesign carbon burning systems to ensure that less carbon is released .
there are a whole range of renewable sources , and we can reduce demand , perhaps using new technology to increase the efficiency of the energy we use .
it is theoretically possible to do without nuclear power , but within the timescale and the practicalities of doing this , while maintaining a viable energy supply , it poses a number of significant challenges . "

the government-backed scheme has been widely resisted by the food industry , despite research suggesting shoppers would welcome the system .
the food standards agency believes the labels would make it easier for shoppers to understand labels .
but tesco says it is opting for an alternative " signposting " system .
amber ' confusion ' the supermarket said the decision followed its own pilot scheme , using the traffic light system which showed customers were confused about how to treat an amber light .
it will put the content of salt , sugar , saturated fat and calories in grams and how this relates to the recommended daily intake on its own label products .
food labelling eu laws mean nearly all ingredients must be listed until 2004 , ingredients making less than 25 % of product did not need to be on the label ' british ' can not be used to market a product only beef and some fruit and vegetables can carry country of origin markings public back ' colour coding ' can we believe what tin says ?
with obesity rising and confusing food labelling , the government is keen shoppers should know just what is in food .
the food standards agency is looking at a number of routes .
one is the " traffic light " approach using a simple green , meaning eat plenty ; amber , in moderation and red , eat sparingly .
it was proposed in the public health white paper in november 2004 and ministers had wanted to introduce the food alerts by 2006 .
the food and drink federation , which represents the industry , has just issued guidance for shoppers on how to interpret food labels .
but the pressure group , the food commission , insists consumers need one clear system and the traffic light scheme is the best option so far .
the national heart forum said it was concerns about tesco 's decision .
jane landon , associate director of the charity , said the numbers-based system chosen by tesco had already been shown by the food standards agency to be least popular with consumers .

feature by richard warry bbc news reporter tony blair might believe that a strong economy and record investment in public services are helping labour to sustain a healthy lead in the opinion polls .
forget health , education and transport , and think hair , elocution and teeth jonathan maitland but it might just be that hitherto unconsidered factors are giving him a boost .
some believe the fact that he has a fuller head of hair than his conservative counterpart may tip a few floating voters mulling over the merits of labour and the tories his way .
this might seem trivial nonsense - but there is research to back the theory that these things matter .
research from the early 1990s found that the proportion of bald men making it to elected office in the us was four times less than the number of follicularly challenged males in the population at large .
hair factor a quick survey of recent general elections in the uk reveals a similar story on this side of the pond : john major may have been grey , but he had far too much hair for neil kinnock , and william hague had youth , but not flowing locks on his side when he took on tony blair in 2001 .
the last time a bald politician was elected to number 10 was winston churchill in 1951 - and he was up against the equally receded clement attlee .
william hague : maybe he should have kept the baseball cap on not that all hair is a good thing .
the last prime minister to sport a moustache was harold macmillan in the early 1960s , and the last bearded occupant of number 10 was david lloyd george , who left office in 1922 .
new labour got wise to the importance of such trivialities before their resounding victory at the 1997 election .
the party 's image guru barbara follett ordered a cull of facial hair which included alistair darling , geoff hoon and peter mandelson among its victims .
jonathan maitland , a journalist and presenter , examines what makes politicians attractive to the electorate in his book , ' vote for . who ? ' .
he believes that as the policies of the major parties have converged in recent years , then the image of their leaders has become more and more important .
" forget health , education and transport , and think hair , elocution and teeth , " he said .
" because there is so little difference between the policies of the major parties , some people are bound to go with their instinctive reaction to the leaders .
" polls have been done , and it is clear that of the 800,000 crucial swing voters , 60 % say the most important thing for them is image . "
grooming important leonie roberts , of the federation of image consultants , agrees that the way a politician looks is more important than perhaps it should be .
peter mandelson post tache removal the key , she believes is for aspiring leaders to look as though they take a pride in their appearance - and not to chop and change their image .
" grooming is absolutely essential .
anybody who looks sweaty , smelly or unkempt is an absolute no-no , " she said .
" it 's also important for politicians to have a constant brand , as it helps to breed trust . "
ms roberts agrees that baldness can trigger a powerful reaction .
it can make people seem older than they are , she says , and is associated by some , possibly subconsciously , with illness .
historically , it has even been interpreted as a sign of an ancestral curse .
however , on a more positive note , she points out that baldness is also associated with virility , truth and wisdom .
statesmanship maitland says that image is more complex than mere physical attributes .
he believes it is vital for any aspiring prime minister to radiate a quality of statesmanship .
if a politician does n't have this , then they can forget ever achieving the highest office .
for maitland , the classic case was michael foot , trounced in the polls in the 1983 election .
" he appeared at the service of remembrance at the cenotaph looking like a scarecrow who had just had a fight with a threshing machine , " he said .
" if it was n't already over by then , it certainly was after that .
" it is sad , but inevitable , but often it just comes down to whether the voters like the cut of one 's jib . "

more than five million south africans are hiv positive .
for several years after the virus become widespread the south african government 's policy was not to make anti-retroviral drugs -lrb- arvs -rrb- available to all the people who were hiv positive .
the government was not convinced that arvs were a cost-effective way of treating hiv .
that position changed in november of 2003 when the cabinet voted to provide arvs across the board .
but critics of the government say the progress since then has been too slow .
political will ?
" they keep on moving the goalposts over the number of people receiving anti-retroviral drugs , " says diane kohler barnard , the health spokesperson for the main south african opposition party , the democratic alliance .
zackie himself is hiv-positive " they said 50,000 people would be on arvs a year ago and they are still way short of that .
there seems to be inefficiency and a lack of will to meet the targets . "
in february last year president thabo mbeki said he would make anti-retroviral drugs available in at least one hospital or clinic in each of the country 's 53 districts .
the health ministry says that it has achieved that target , 122 centres are now dispensing arvs .
almost 40,000 people are now receiving the drugs .
" in rural areas , uptake is not as fast as we would like because it 's hard to get our message across to everyone , " says sibani mgnadi , the spokesperson for the health ministry .
" uptake is faster in the more developed provinces like gauteng where it 's easier to recruit health workers and where we 've got more laboratories to check who qualifies for the drugs " .
debate anti-retroviral drugs have been shown to lengthen the lives of people who have contracted hiv .
but in south africa there 's still a heated debate about how effective they are .
nelson mandela has campaigned for more action to fight aids the government employs what it calls a broad strategy to deal with the problem .
that includes providing arvs whilst also making multi-vitamin supplements available to more than a 150,000 people with hiv .
" we 'd prefer people to use a number of different strategies to fight the virus , " says sibani mgnadi " it 's not government policy to stress the supremacy of one treatment over another in combating the virus " .
it is statements like that which have angered the government 's critics .
" it 's a dangerous and damaging policy , " says zackie achmat , chairperson of the treatment action campaign which has lobbied the government to provide arvs for a number of years .
vitamins " it 's allowed organizations to come in and make what we consider to be unsubstantiated claims about the effectiveness of vitamin supplements in hiv treatment . "
the nutrition campaign could confuse those receiving arvs over recent months a company that sells vitamin supplements based in holland , called the matthias rath foundation , has taken out adverts in south african newspapers and put posters up near hiv treatment centres stressing what it says are the dangerous side effects of arvs .
there is evidence that some people are stopping their treatment as a result .
the impact is being felt in places like the impoverished township of guguletu near cape town where one in every seven people is hiv positive .
" our clients are very confused , " hiv counselor flora tabela told me as she packed arvs into a bag before setting out on her daily round .
" i have a client who has already stopped taking the drugs , and another client says her partner is telling her to stop arvs because dr rath has come up with something better .

more than five million south africans are hiv positive .
for several years after the virus become widespread the south african government 's policy was not to make anti-retroviral drugs -lrb- arvs -rrb- available to all the people who were hiv positive .
the government was not convinced that arvs were a cost-effective way of treating hiv .
that position changed in november of 2003 when the cabinet voted to provide arvs across the board .
but critics of the government say the progress since then has been too slow .
political will ?
" they keep on moving the goalposts over the number of people receiving anti-retroviral drugs , " says diane kohler barnard , the health spokesperson for the main south african opposition party , the democratic alliance .
zackie himself is hiv-positive " they said 50,000 people would be on arvs a year ago and they are still way short of that .
there seems to be inefficiency and a lack of will to meet the targets . "
in february last year president thabo mbeki said he would make anti-retroviral drugs available in at least one hospital or clinic in each of the country 's 53 districts .
the health ministry says that it has achieved that target , 122 centres are now dispensing arvs .
almost 40,000 people are now receiving the drugs .
" in rural areas , uptake is not as fast as we would like because it 's hard to get our message across to everyone , " says sibani mgnadi , the spokesperson for the health ministry .
" uptake is faster in the more developed provinces like gauteng where it 's easier to recruit health workers and where we 've got more laboratories to check who qualifies for the drugs " .
debate anti-retroviral drugs have been shown to lengthen the lives of people who have contracted hiv .
but in south africa there 's still a heated debate about how effective they are .
nelson mandela has campaigned for more action to fight aids the government employs what it calls a broad strategy to deal with the problem .
that includes providing arvs whilst also making multi-vitamin supplements available to more than a 150,000 people with hiv .
" we 'd prefer people to use a number of different strategies to fight the virus , " says sibani mgnadi " it 's not government policy to stress the supremacy of one treatment over another in combating the virus " .
it is statements like that which have angered the government 's critics .
" it 's a dangerous and damaging policy , " says zackie achmat , chairperson of the treatment action campaign which has lobbied the government to provide arvs for a number of years .
vitamins " it 's allowed organizations to come in and make what we consider to be unsubstantiated claims about the effectiveness of vitamin supplements in hiv treatment . "
the nutrition campaign could confuse those receiving arvs over recent months a company that sells vitamin supplements based in holland , called the matthias rath foundation , has taken out adverts in south african newspapers and put posters up near hiv treatment centres stressing what it says are the dangerous side effects of arvs .
there is evidence that some people are stopping their treatment as a result .
the impact is being felt in places like the impoverished township of guguletu near cape town where one in every seven people is hiv positive .
" our clients are very confused , " hiv counselor flora tabela told me as she packed arvs into a bag before setting out on her daily round .

more than five million south africans are hiv positive .
for several years after the virus become widespread the south african government 's policy was not to make anti-retroviral drugs -lrb- arvs -rrb- available to all the people who were hiv positive .
the government was not convinced that arvs were a cost-effective way of treating hiv .
that position changed in november of 2003 when the cabinet voted to provide arvs across the board .
but critics of the government say the progress since then has been too slow .
political will ?
" they keep on moving the goalposts over the number of people receiving anti-retroviral drugs , " says diane kohler barnard , the health spokesperson for the main south african opposition party , the democratic alliance .
" they said 50,000 people would be on arvs a year ago and they are still way short of that .
there seems to be inefficiency and a lack of will to meet the targets . "
in february last year president thabo mbeki said he would make anti-retroviral drugs available in at least one hospital or clinic in each of the country 's 53 districts .
the health ministry says that it has achieved that target , 122 centres are now dispensing arvs .
almost 40,000 people are now receiving the drugs .
" in rural areas , uptake is not as fast as we would like because it 's hard to get our message across to everyone , " says sibani mgnadi , the spokesperson for the health ministry .
" uptake is faster in the more developed provinces like gauteng where it 's easier to recruit health workers and where we 've got more laboratories to check who qualifies for the drugs " .
debate anti-retroviral drugs have been shown to lengthen the lives of people who have contracted hiv .
but in south africa there 's still a heated debate about how effective they are .
the government employs what it calls a broad strategy to deal with the problem .
that includes providing arvs whilst also making multi-vitamin supplements available to more than a 150,000 people with hiv .
" we 'd prefer people to use a number of different strategies to fight the virus , " says sibani mgnadi " it 's not government policy to stress the supremacy of one treatment over another in combating the virus " .
it is statements like that which have angered the government 's critics .
" it 's a dangerous and damaging policy , " says zackie achmat , chairperson of the treatment action campaign which has lobbied the government to provide arvs for a number of years .
vitamins " it 's allowed organizations to come in and make what we consider to be unsubstantiated claims about the effectiveness of vitamin supplements in hiv treatment . "
over recent months a company that sells vitamin supplements based in holland , called the matthias rath foundation , has taken out adverts in south african newspapers and put posters up near hiv treatment centres stressing what it says are the dangerous side effects of arvs .
there is evidence that some people are stopping their treatment as a result .
the impact is being felt in places like the impoverished township of guguletu near cape town where one in every seven people is hiv positive .
" our clients are very confused , " hiv counselor flora tabela told me as she packed arvs into a bag before setting out on her daily round .
" i have a client who has already stopped taking the drugs , and another client says her partner is telling her to stop arvs because dr rath has come up with something better .
i 'm worried because people will die as a result . "
the matthias rath foundation says that far from spreading confusion it is trying to give people living with hiv / aids enough information to be able to decide what type of treatment to request .
" there are other options in delaying this disease , " says ralf langner the foundation 's spokesperson .
" anti-retroviral drugs have been shown to have side effects , and doctors seem to ignore it , one has to ask whether they 're reading the research or just accepting the spin of the pharmaceutical companies " .
there are conflicting reports about how effective vitamins are at treating people with hiv .
diet at a recent world health organization conference in durban looking at nutrition and hiv , there was much evidence put forward to suggest a healthy balanced diet can make anti-retroviral drugs more effective , but the jury is still out on whether vitamin supplements can permanently put off the onset of aids .
south africa 's health minister manto tshabalala-msimang has famously urged people to eat lots of garlic and beetroot to fight the effects of aids .
at the moment the south african health ministry says that there is no evidence that the matthias rath foundation is acting irresponsibly in south africa .
there are no reliable figures for the number of people who have stopped taking anti-retroviral drugs as a result of the foundation 's campaigns , but they are sowing major doubts in peoples ' minds and that is a worrying trend for many health workers who have worked to get arvs to the people of south africa .
opposition politicians are calling on the government to make unequivocal statements about arv and vitamin treatments .
" president mbeki and his health team need to stop dabbling with hiv dissidents , " says diane kohler barnard from the democratic alliance .
" once and for all the government needs to face up to the scale of the pandemic " .

he also suggests some changes to social security contributions and the phasing out of allowances .
the 5 % goods and services tax is planned to cover a shortfall when a zero-rate corporation tax comes in .

the big debate on how jersey 's tax structure will change is only two weeks away .
the finance and economics committee is trying to convince sceptics the plans for a goods and services tax and the phasing out of tax allowances for middle and higher earners are the right ones .
but some politicians are not convinced and claim the committee has failed to win over tax payers .
deputy southern 's alternatives include removing the earnings limit for social security contributions and introducing a slight increase to income tax for everyone .
he also claims a land tax for certain properties could add an extra £ 1m to states revenues .
but last week andrew lewis of the institute of directors said a 10 % goods and services tax would ensure income tax would not have to rise .

cardiff central tops the list of most connected constituencies with almost 40 % of homes having fast net access , finds net specialist point topic .

the researchers said the figures reveal the way that technology is accentuating differences between rich and poor .
net gains the breakdown by constituency shows wide differences in the take-up of fast net services says tim johnson , founder of point topic .
connected constituencies areas with the highest proportion of households with broadband tend to be in dense , middle-class suburbs , he said , especially those where both cable and dsl is available .
having more than one way to get broadband tends to increase numbers overall , he said .
the research found that seven out of the top 10 most connected constituencies have labour mps .
mr johnson said it was hard to read anything in to that figure because labour is the majority party and has traditionally done well in such dense , industrialised towns and suburbs .
this helped to explain why places like cardiff central and cardiff north are top of the most connected constituency charts .
towns and districts to the north of london , such as saint albans , chesham and watford were also places where broadband was widely used .
" but , " said mr johnson , " at the other end of the scale there are still geographically large areas where you ca n't get broadband at all except by satellite . "

by contrast the number of people that have signed up for broadband has rocketed from almost nothing to 7 million lines in only a few years .
mr johnson said this suggests that existing net users are upgrading their connection to get more out of it .
new users would be unlikely to sign up a fast connection straight away .
mr johnson said the figures showed a significant digital divide in the uk .
" we came out of this realising that it 's not about the geographical divide , which is a solvable problem , its the social divide that 's important . " he said .
" there are more than 40 % of homes without the internet . "
unlike many other indicators of deprivation the net was very much something people had or did n't , he said .
increasingly , said mr johnson , access to the net was important for children so they can keep up with their peers .
he added that the parties needed to find ways to change the economics of net access and genuinely widen its use within the uk .

net gains the breakdown by constituency shows wide differences in the take-up of fast net services says tim johnson , founder of point topic .
connected constituencies areas with the highest proportion of households with broadband tend to be in dense , middle-class suburbs , he said , especially those where both cable and dsl is available .
having more than one way to get broadband tends to increase numbers overall , he said .
the research found that seven out of the top 10 most connected constituencies have labour mps .
mr johnson said it was hard to read anything in to that figure because labour is the majority party and has traditionally done well in such dense , industrialised towns and suburbs .
this helped to explain why places like cardiff central and cardiff north are top of the most connected constituency charts .
towns and districts to the north of london , such as saint albans , chesham and watford were also places where broadband was widely used .
" but , " said mr johnson , " at the other end of the scale there are still geographically large areas where you ca n't get broadband at all except by satellite . "
net losers mr johnson said the significance of the results did not just lie in the fact that they exposed broad national differences in broadband take-up .
quick guide broadband they also suggest that the net is accentuating broader socio-economic differences , he said .
figures show a significant slow-down in the rate at which households adopt the internet .
by contrast the number of people that have signed up for broadband has rocketed from almost nothing to 7 million lines in only a few years .
mr johnson said this suggests that existing net users are upgrading their connection to get more out of it .
new users would be unlikely to sign up a fast connection straight away .
mr johnson said the figures showed a significant digital divide in the uk .
" we came out of this realising that it 's not about the geographical divide , which is a solvable problem , its the social divide that 's important . " he said .
" there are more than 40 % of homes without the internet . "
unlike many other indicators of deprivation the net was very much something people had or did n't , he said .
increasingly , said mr johnson , access to the net was important for children so they can keep up with their peers .
he added that the parties needed to find ways to change the economics of net access and genuinely widen its use within the uk .
