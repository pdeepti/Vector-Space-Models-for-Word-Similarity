in leading greece to the european championships , he silenced his most vociferous critics at home , and reached god status in his adopted one . otto rehhagel is promising a soccer party tonight when his greek side takes on 2002 world cup winners brazil in the newly refurbished leipzig stadium .
" we 're going to play freely and with spirit and hopefully we can do ourselves proud , " he said ahead of tonight 's premiere clash in the second group .
against world beaters like adriano , kaka , ronaldinho and the ascendent robinho , a greek side of hard-working , but unknown team players will have a difficult time of it .
after stunning the world by improbably beating france , the czech republic and then portugal to win the 2004 european championships , greece will have to prove it is better than the faltering world cup qualifying campaign it has waged so far -lrb- the greeks are in danger of missing out on the world cup , currently third behind ukraine and turkey -rrb- .
but chances are good that rehhagel will be smiling at the end of the match , no matter what the outcome .
the confederations cup tournament is a sort of victorious homecoming parade for the german coach who has been consistently passed over for the national team job in germany .
the architect of the impossible a tough defender during his playing career , rehhagel became a staunch advocate of a conservative , defense-minded playing style as a coach - to astounding success .
the 66-year-old won the german championship three times , the last with a team that a year before had played in the second division .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freedom to call all of the shots but his straight talk and controlling hand were too much for some german soccer functionaries , and his tactical style considered too throwback at a time when germany wanted to join the rest of the world in employing modern playing styles .
what did n't work for germany , worked for greece .
the country 's sports journalists have credited the national team 's amazing turnaround -lrb- they had competed in two international tournaments in as many decades , and did n't win one game -rrb- to the man from essen .
his authoritarian style was exactly what a soccer federation ruled by nepotism , corruption and petty disputes needed .
rehhagel took a team of unspectacular individual players and formed them into a singular , compact side that confounded superior sides like france and portugal with their disciplined defense and dangerous counters .
" rehhagel respects his players , " said midfielder vasilis tsiartas , in an interview with die welt newspaper .
" he knows how to deal with us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehhagel , here with striker angelos charisteas , " knows how to deal with players " underestimated , but struggling now , he 's hoping his team - largely the same one he took to portugal - will be able to repeat its success .
" they 're european champions for a reason , " said brazilian coach carlos alberto parreira .
" underestimate them at your own peril . "
more is at stake than just the cup , however .
observers say greece needs to use the tournament to find its form quickly , before missing its last chances to return to germany next year to play in the world cup . following his team 's championship win , rehhagel was offered a guarantee to compete in 2006 - as coach of the german side .
" rehhakles " as the german papers dubbed him , declined .
the reason ?

42,000 fans watched a brazilian team that after this match is the squad to beat in the tournament . brazil provided the first clear-cut victory in the confederations cup with a 3-0 victory against greece .
the first three matches were all decided by one goal but coach carlos alberto parreira 's team sent a very clear message to the seven other teams that the selecao are hungry for another international title . " the team was well-balanced , " explained parreira .
" sometimes they played too complicated but it was in order how we played . " the brazilian play was definitely in order but unlike the first three matches , it took a while for the first goal to be scored .
and how it was scored set the tone for the remainder of the match because greece got in a situation they prefer not to be in , namely attacking soccer . after 40 minutes in which otto rehhagel 's euro 2004 champs played aggressively enough to hold the brazilians in check , adriano finally broke the gordian knot .
in a moment when the greeks failed to press the inter milan striker who then pulled up from 27 meters and launched a rocket that just squeezed inside the right post past a flying greek keeper antonis nikopolildis . second-half starts off disastrously in the first half , greece missed a golden opportunity in the first half-minute .
the second-half would start with a golden opportunity for brazil .
one they didn ’ t waste . bildunterschrift : greek goalkeeper antonios nikopolidis -lrb- right -rrb- looks as a shot from brazil 's robinho -lrb- left -rrb- hits the back of the net for the 2nd goal hertha berlin 's defender gilberto raced with the ball up the left sideline , crossed it through the greek penalty box where robinho -lrb- photo -rrb- , the replacement of superstar ronaldo , was waiting to place the ball in the net .
40 seconds into the second-half , greece were beaten . at this point , brazil could toy with otto rehhagel 's side like a cat with a wounded mouse .
the selecao handed the ball over to the greeks for the next ten minutes but when the euro champs were unable to take advantage of the brazilian gift , the world champs retook control . ronaldinho had a few good opportunities .
rubinho broke free occasionally and the achilles heel of the greek defense , the right side , was used continuously as a launching pad for attacks by the yellow-clad brazilians . midway through the second-half , a series of substitutions interrupted the flow of the match but important was the entrance of olympique lyon juninho pernambucano in the 77th minute . quality goal seals greece 's fate four minutes later , juninho stepped up to take a free-kick just outside the greek penalty box .
after all , the master of the free-kick ronaldinho had been taken out of the game .
but juninho plays at a level , if not equal , then very close to last year 's footballer of the year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil was head taller all night juninho bent the direct kick over the top of the greek wall , the ball dropped 2 meters in a millisecond , and nikopolidis could only watch as the leather fell into the back of the net .
the very real and classy greek defense of 2004 was transformed into something comparable to the best myths classic greek mythology . " the brazilians were clearly better , " commented rehhagel .
" all 11 players must give 110 % to beat a brazilian team and tonight we only gave about 50 % .
that was n't enough . " so the greeks , after a series of disappointing qualifying matches for next year 's world cup in germany , are finding out that rehhagel no longer has the midas touch .
brazil , on the other hand , was convincing after last week 's bitter 3-1 defeat to argentina in buenos aires .
understandably , they would like a chance to exact revenge against their south american rivals .
but before that they have two more matches to play . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mexico yawns past japan mexico edged japan on a second-half goal in a slow-paced match that featured few highlights .

" i 'm going there with a willingness to reach an agreement , " he said , adding that his government was ready to work on a compromise as long as the result did n't lead to additional german payments that the country could not shoulder financially . " it would be wonderful if the signal from brussels would be that the eu is capable to act , " he said , referring to the 25-member bloc 's ongoing crisis as french and dutch voters rejected the proposed eu constitution and states have failed to reach a solution for the eu budget for 2007 to 2013 . british rebate unjust ? one of the main problems in the latter matter is that britain still refuses to budge on a decade-old , billion-euro rebate it was granted as the country does not profit as much from the eu 's agricultural subsidies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and blair are not getting along so well these days " the rebate has no real justification any more , " schröder said and attacked opposition leader angela merkel and his challenger in the upcoming elections for reportedly backing british prime minister tony blair on the rebate .
merkel refused to comment on this during her reply . sticking to the constitution on the question of the eu constitution , schröder said the ratification process should be continued despite the french and dutch " nos " and the british decision to postpone a referendum .
schröder said the matter should be dealt with during the austrian eu presidency in the first part of 2006 , when more states have had a chance to decide on the treaty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- left -rrb- and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan in the turkish capital ankara in february 2004 he also criticized the opposition christian democrats for again questioning membership negotiations with turkey .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from l-r german foreign minister joschka fischer , german chancellor gerhard schroeder , dutch prime minister jan-peter balkenende and austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel chat during the round table at the beginning of the two days european summit in brussels according to diplomats in brussels , all 25 member states were in agreement that the ratification process should be suspended until at least next year while they discuss the future direction of the european project .
french president jacques chirac also said he had doubts about future expansion plans of the bloc .
he called for a special summit to discuss the future direction of the union . " can the union in this new situation really expand without having the proper institutions for it ? " he asked the fellow leaders in a prepared text .
" i think we need to discuss these important questions together . " budget deadlock a deal on the eu 's 2007-2013 budget - blocked partly by britain 's refusal to surrender a hard-won rebate - would only be possible if all 25 members were ready to compromise , said schröder , who was gloomy about the prospects for an agreement . " i do n't think there will be a deal on the budget .
the differences are too big , " he said .
" i 'm not optimistic about a deal . " at the end of the first day of the meeting , his prediction looked correct , since a budget deal seemed far away .
british prime minister tony blair has thus far refused to release his grip on the uk rebate , despite a last-minute offer by the eu presidency . luxembourg 's juncker suggested freezing , not cutting the british rebate , which was worth 5.3 billion euros last year and was projected to average 7.1 billion euros annually between 2007 and 2013 .
any future reductions in the rebate would be tied to a reduction in eu agricultural aid after 2013 . but no country gave ground . farm subsidies vs. rebate britain is refusing to accept a change to its budget rebate without a rethink of eu farm subsidies that gobble up 40 percent of the entire eu budget .
the rebate , sancrosanct to britons across the political spectrum , has been in place since 1984 to compensate for the relatively small amount that britain reaps from the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn , left , gestures while speaking with british foreign secretary jack straw , center , and eu foreign policy chief javier solana foreign secretary jack straw set out britain 's stance as eu leaders voiced little hope of a breakthrough on the budget talks . " the proposals from the presidency are not acceptable to us , " straw said .
" that 's one of the reasons why there 's going to be difficulty " during the conclave , he told reporters . blair 's spokesman said the cabinet backed his refusal to give way on the rebate , secured by the iron-willed former british leader , margaret thatcher , in 1984 to compensate for the relatively small amount london received in eu farm aid . the rest of europe stepped up the pressure on blair , including germany . " there is absolutely no justification any longer for the british rebate , " the german leader said .
" britain is the sixth biggest per capita beneficiary of the eu budget but ranks far below that as a contributor . " blair , who takes over the eu presidency on july 1 , is pushing for a " fundamental debate " about the bloc 's future , including cap , which gives generous subsidies to farmers , especially those in france . upping the ante , a british spokesman said it was not essential for the summit to agree the 2007- 2013 spending plans - leaving open the prospect of it being delayed until after the upcoming british eu presidency . afp / dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " europe ca n't keep running " european leaders are gathering in brussels for a two-day summit to give the alliance new momentum .

in leading greece to the european championships , he silenced his most vociferous critics at home , and reached god status in his adopted one . otto rehhagel is promising a soccer party tonight when his greek side takes on 2002 world cup winners brazil in the newly refurbished leipzig stadium .
" we 're going to play freely and with spirit and hopefully we can do ourselves proud , " he said ahead of tonight 's premiere clash in the second group .
against world beaters like adriano , kaka , ronaldinho and the ascendent robinho , a greek side of hard-working , but unknown team players will have a difficult time of it .
after stunning the world by improbably beating france , the czech republic and then portugal to win the 2004 european championships , greece will have to prove it is better than the faltering world cup qualifying campaign it has waged so far -lrb- the greeks are in danger of missing out on the world cup , currently third behind ukraine and turkey -rrb- .
but chances are good that rehhagel will be smiling at the end of the match , no matter what the outcome .
the confederations cup tournament is a sort of victorious homecoming parade for the german coach who has been consistently passed over for the national team job in germany .
the architect of the impossible a tough defender during his playing career , rehhagel became a staunch advocate of a conservative , defense-minded playing style as a coach - to astounding success .
the 66-year-old won the german championship three times , the last with a team that a year before had played in the second division .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freedom to call all of the shots but his straight talk and controlling hand were too much for some german soccer functionaries , and his tactical style considered too throwback at a time when germany wanted to join the rest of the world in employing modern playing styles .
what did n't work for germany , worked for greece .
the country 's sports journalists have credited the national team 's amazing turnaround -lrb- they had competed in two international tournaments in as many decades , and did n't win one game -rrb- to the man from essen .
his authoritarian style was exactly what a soccer federation ruled by nepotism , corruption and petty disputes needed .
rehhagel took a team of unspectacular individual players and formed them into a singular , compact side that confounded superior sides like france and portugal with their disciplined defense and dangerous counters .
" rehhagel respects his players , " said midfielder vasilis tsiartas , in an interview with die welt newspaper .
" he knows how to deal with us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehhagel , here with striker angelos charisteas , " knows how to deal with players " underestimated , but struggling now , he 's hoping his team - largely the same one he took to portugal - will be able to repeat its success .
" they 're european champions for a reason , " said brazilian coach carlos alberto parreira .
" underestimate them at your own peril . "
more is at stake than just the cup , however .
observers say greece needs to use the tournament to find its form quickly , before missing its last chances to return to germany next year to play in the world cup . following his team 's championship win , rehhagel was offered a guarantee to compete in 2006 - as coach of the german side .
" rehhakles " as the german papers dubbed him , declined .
the reason ?
he said he wanted to finish what he started . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de coaches wrapped up in mini world cup even though only eight teams are invited , the confederations cup , little brother to the world cup 's 32 teams , is a big enough title to keep brazilian players from being able to enjoy the summer holidays . -lrb- may 12 , 2005 -rrb- dfb struggles to find coach after rehhagel spurn with otto rehhagel declining the german football association ’ s -lrb- dfb -rrb- offer to make him national coach , only two candidates remain for the top job : guus hiddink and lothas matthäus – and even they are long shots .
-lrb- july 20 , 2004 -rrb- king otto rules greece once again greece , the sensation of the european soccer championships , has one man to thank for their success .

" i 'm going there with a willingness to reach an agreement , " he said , adding that his government was ready to work on a compromise as long as the result did n't lead to additional german payments that the country could not shoulder financially . " it would be wonderful if the signal from brussels would be that the eu is capable to act , " he said , referring to the 25-member bloc 's ongoing crisis as french and dutch voters rejected the proposed eu constitution and states have failed to reach a solution for the eu budget for 2007 to 2013 . british rebate unjust ? one of the main problems in the latter matter is that britain still refuses to budge on a decade-old , billion-euro rebate it was granted as the country does not profit as much from the eu 's agricultural subsidies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and blair are not getting along so well these days " the rebate has no real justification any more , " schröder said and attacked opposition leader angela merkel and his challenger in the upcoming elections for reportedly backing british prime minister tony blair on the rebate .
merkel refused to comment on this during her reply . sticking to the constitution on the question of the eu constitution , schröder said the ratification process should be continued despite the french and dutch " nos " and the british decision to postpone a referendum .
schröder said the matter should be dealt with during the austrian eu presidency in the first part of 2006 , when more states have had a chance to decide on the treaty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- left -rrb- and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan in the turkish capital ankara in february 2004 he also criticized the opposition christian democrats for again questioning membership negotiations with turkey .

but who actually owns the marketing rights to this much-loved motif ? you name it , he 's been on it .
with bath mats , lampshades , vases , key-rings , t-shirts , mouse mats and coffee cups to choose from , you have n't been to berlin if you have n't brought home a souvenir emblazoned with the portly little figure with the trademark bowler hat . the " ampelmännchen " is an industry unto himself , and enjoys the privileged status of being one of the sole features of communist east germany to have survived the end of the iron curtain with his popularity unscathed . in the 1990s , he found himself at the heart of a full-blown rescue campaign when he was faced with possible extinction .
the figure first designed by karl peglau in 1961 had come to symbolize " ostalgie " - the revival of the east german aesthetic as cool kitsch - and when the reunited germany tried replacing him with a slimmed-down western version in 1997 , his fans rallied and saved him from certain death . an east-west stand-off his winning streak has shown no signs of letting up , and the 16-centimeter figure has become so profitable that he 's now at the heart of yet another dispute - one that some have seen as another east-west stand-off . two entrepreneurs from saxony and former west berlin took their fight over the marketing rights to the ampelmännchen to a leipzig court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim roßberg engineer joachim roßberg -lrb- photo -rrb- from zwickau , whose claim to the logo is that he was the only manufacturer of traffic lights in the former east germany , was being sued by designer markus heckhausen , who began incorporating the figure into products in 1995 .

coach ricardo la volpe 's side will have to play more convincingly to advance . when jose fonseca climbed up to head in a cross and give his side a 2-1 lead over japan , the breath of relief from the mexican bench was almost audible . after playing a back-and-forth game for most of the first half and failing to solve the smaller japanese defense , fonseca 's score off of a gonzalo pineda pass in the 64th minute sent mexico off to a first match victory . up until that point , mexico had few opportunities after evening the score late in the first half .
though controlling the match at the beginning , la volpe 's side had a tough time breaking through the japanese defense . counter brings relief the small crowd of 21,000 in hanover 's stadium had something to cheer about early on as japan responded quickly on a counter .
akira kaji got free down the right side of the field and passed in to a streaking atsushi yanagisawa .
the midfielder was marked by mexico 's ricardo osorio , who actually deflected the ball into his own net after it skipped through yanagisawa 's legs .
the 1-0 lead was a surprise , but not without credit to the resilient japanese side .
mexico responded by not really responding at all .
the midfield continued having a tough time breaking down the defense , preferring to build up their attack slowly , rather than unsettling the japanese defenders with quick passes . mexico roars back mexican striker jared borgetti had a golden opportunity robbed by some good goalkeeping when his close range header was blocked off by japan 's small , but nimble goalie yoshikatsu kawaguchi . kawaguchi looked his size , though , on the goal that evened it up .
midfielder zinha sprung free on the left side of the penalty box and bent a nice shot into the upper right hand corner of the net that a diving kawaguchi was helpless to defend . slow to start in the second half , mexico finally found the key to the japanese defense that until then would not unlock .
the size difference between fonseca and his markers attracted the attention of pineda , who lofted a nice cross to him in the center , which the midfielder had no problem putting away . japan 's desperation attempts in the final phase of the game were easily shut down by mexico , which had finally found its footing .

" i 'm going there with a willingness to reach an agreement , " he said , adding that his government was ready to work on a compromise as long as the result did n't lead to additional german payments that the country could not shoulder financially . " it would be wonderful if the signal from brussels would be that the eu is capable to act , " he said , referring to the 25-member bloc 's ongoing crisis as french and dutch voters rejected the proposed eu constitution and states have failed to reach a solution for the eu budget for 2007 to 2013 . british rebate unjust ? one of the main problems in the latter matter is that britain still refuses to budge on a decade-old , billion-euro rebate it was granted as the country does not profit as much from the eu 's agricultural subsidies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and blair are not getting along so well these days " the rebate has no real justification any more , " schröder said and attacked opposition leader angela merkel and his challenger in the upcoming elections for reportedly backing british prime minister tony blair on the rebate .
merkel refused to comment on this during her reply . sticking to the constitution on the question of the eu constitution , schröder said the ratification process should be continued despite the french and dutch " nos " and the british decision to postpone a referendum .
schröder said the matter should be dealt with during the austrian eu presidency in the first part of 2006 , when more states have had a chance to decide on the treaty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- left -rrb- and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan in the turkish capital ankara in february 2004 he also criticized the opposition christian democrats for again questioning membership negotiations with turkey .
the opposition rejects turkish membership and has instead called for a " privileged partnership . " germany 's ratification of the constitution was halted wednesday after president horst köhler decided to wait with signing the document as a legal complaint against the constitution is still pending before germany 's highest court .

" i 'm going there with a willingness to reach an agreement , " he said , adding that his government was ready to work on a compromise as long as the result did n't lead to additional german payments that the country could not shoulder financially . " it would be wonderful if the signal from brussels would be that the eu is capable to act , " he said , referring to the 25-member bloc 's ongoing crisis as french and dutch voters rejected the proposed eu constitution and states have failed to reach a solution for the eu budget for 2007 to 2013 . british rebate unjust ? one of the main problems in the latter matter is that britain still refuses to budge on a decade-old , billion-euro rebate it was granted as the country does not profit as much from the eu 's agricultural subsidies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and blair are not getting along so well these days " the rebate has no real justification any more , " schröder said and attacked opposition leader angela merkel and his challenger in the upcoming elections for reportedly backing british prime minister tony blair on the rebate .
merkel refused to comment on this during her reply . sticking to the constitution on the question of the eu constitution , schröder said the ratification process should be continued despite the french and dutch " nos " and the british decision to postpone a referendum .
schröder said the matter should be dealt with during the austrian eu presidency in the first part of 2006 , when more states have had a chance to decide on the treaty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- left -rrb- and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan in the turkish capital ankara in february 2004 he also criticized the opposition christian democrats for again questioning membership negotiations with turkey .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : crisis in brussels a quick guide to the eu summit meet the eu 's deficit sinners eu 's billions to flow to familiar shores eu attempts to untie budget tangles europe -pipe- 16.06.2005 " europe ca n't keep running " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how embattled is europe really ?
european leaders are gathering in brussels for a two-day summit to give the alliance new momentum .
but can the eu extricate itself from its constitutional tangle ?
dw-world.de talked to commissioner viviane reding . the european union 's mid-year summit takes place against the backdrop of the french and dutch rejection of the constitution and the looming battle over the 2007-2013 budget .
dw-world interviewed viviane reding , eu commissioner for infomation society and media about what 's in stake for the future of the 25-member bloc . dw-world : commission president barroso has called for a period of reflection with regard to ratification of the constitution , what does that actually mean for the constitution ? reding : that means that the constitution is still alive and it is important that it is alive because it has been agreed upon by the political forces of all member states united in the convention , which means this agreement should be the basis for future discussions , but in the referenda procedures we saw that people were not informed about the content of the constitution and very often voted on the problems they have with europe or the problems they have with their governments .
so we think it will be very worthwhile to have a second look at this constitution and to present it to the public in a better way . how long might that take ? that will take as long as it takes until the time is right for a decision .
one can not foresee that ; it could be very short or it could also take several months . how is it possible to regain the faith of the people with regard to the european project ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viviane reding , eu commissioner for information society and media i have been listening to the citizens carefully during the last years , not only during the referenda period , and they have some problems with the way europe is being built .
the constitution was an answer to this problem , but people did n't understand it was a solution to their criticism .
so this is the message we have to bring across . is there a general level of fatigue among europeans when it comes to being members of a union ? i do n't think so .
when you see the figures , although the constitution was rejected by 55 percent of the french people , 70 percent of french people feel european and they want the european union .
they have a problem with the way this eu is developing .
it is also a fact that in the last 10 years the development of this union has been running at such a pace that nobody has been able to follow it - with the big enlargement and several reforms of the institutions .
i believe it is going too quickly for the normal people . how are you going to slow that down ? that is exactly why the president has said we have to calm down for a moment , we have to reflect , we have to explain that the criticism and the problems raised need a solution , and we have to explain how this solution is going to come about .
we can not keep running and running and running , and i think most of all , we must not continue enlarging europe without discussing this with our populations .
the last enlargement was not conceptualized by our citizens . so what does it mean for those countries lining up to join the union ? i think that they will need more time to join the eu than they probably thought in the beginning .
there is no timeframe in mind , this will be discussed according to the merits and the evolution of the different countries but i really feel very strongly that we have first to conceptualize and understand the implications of the last enlargement before we can go to further enlargement . what could have been done differently in order to make the last enlargement more successful ? information .
i have always been astonished at how well the citizens of the 10 new countries were informed about the europe of the 15 , and i was always shocked to see how little the citizens of the europe of 15 knew about the 10 newcomers .
it is not enough to have a big welcoming party , you have to explain the advantages and the dangers to the people , to explain what is being done in order to secure a smooth transition from ten to 15 , and now we are seeing the results .
many of our people have not understood the value and the advantages of enlargement and they are afraid of the pitfalls .
and all this is happening because nobody has ever taken the responsibility of explaining the enlargement to the citizens of the 15 countries . what would you say to those euroskeptics who are trumpeting that the eu is beginning to crumble ? that is wishful thinking and absolutely removed from reality .
europe is a reality and it has been since the world war ii .
even those who have a problem with european institutions today do n't have a problem with europe .
in a globalized world , the only way you can survive and keep your industry and economy strong , is by joining forces .
to have individual countries fighting monster constructions like india or like china would be absolutely ridiculous . would you then reject the idea that there is a will among individual states for a greater degree of sovereignty ? the national states gave up part of their sovereignty in order to share it with others and become more efficient .
foreign trade is one example where one commissioner is negotiating for the 25 .
could you imagine what would happen if the 25 were to negotiate individually ?
they would n't go anywhere .
it is important that we join forces where we need to , in order that each of us becomes more efficient .
there are many other levels of politics , such as taxation , where national states have kept their sovereignty , so it is also very difficult for the people to understand who is doing what in europe , and i do n't think that has been sufficiently explained .
the crux of the matter is that the new constitution sorted this division of labour out in a very very clear way , and it is a pity that this answer to the fears of the people now has to be postponed . what do you hope will be achieved at the summit over the next two days ? i hope they will keep a cool head and make wise decisions .
one should not panic in the face of a problem , but sit down in a quiet way , reflect , and find the appropriate solutions .
there is no use now in running .
i think we have to calm down and think about it , discuss it and then decide on the next steps .
i am sure there are going to be next steps to be taken , europe is going to advance , it is going to do so at a different pace as foreseen in the recent past , but it has no other choice than to move on .

" i 'm going there with a willingness to reach an agreement , " he said , adding that his government was ready to work on a compromise as long as the result did n't lead to additional german payments that the country could not shoulder financially . " it would be wonderful if the signal from brussels would be that the eu is capable to act , " he said , referring to the 25-member bloc 's ongoing crisis as french and dutch voters rejected the proposed eu constitution and states have failed to reach a solution for the eu budget for 2007 to 2013 . british rebate unjust ? one of the main problems in the latter matter is that britain still refuses to budge on a decade-old , billion-euro rebate it was granted as the country does not profit as much from the eu 's agricultural subsidies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and blair are not getting along so well these days " the rebate has no real justification any more , " schröder said and attacked opposition leader angela merkel and his challenger in the upcoming elections for reportedly backing british prime minister tony blair on the rebate .
merkel refused to comment on this during her reply . sticking to the constitution on the question of the eu constitution , schröder said the ratification process should be continued despite the french and dutch " nos " and the british decision to postpone a referendum .
schröder said the matter should be dealt with during the austrian eu presidency in the first part of 2006 , when more states have had a chance to decide on the treaty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- left -rrb- and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan in the turkish capital ankara in february 2004 he also criticized the opposition christian democrats for again questioning membership negotiations with turkey .

but who actually owns the marketing rights to this much-loved motif ? you name it , he 's been on it .
with bath mats , lampshades , vases , key-rings , t-shirts , mouse mats and coffee cups to choose from , you have n't been to berlin if you have n't brought home a souvenir emblazoned with the portly little figure with the trademark bowler hat . the " ampelmännchen " is an industry unto himself , and enjoys the privileged status of being one of the sole features of communist east germany to have survived the end of the iron curtain with his popularity unscathed . in the 1990s , he found himself at the heart of a full-blown rescue campaign when he was faced with possible extinction .
the figure first designed by karl peglau in 1961 had come to symbolize " ostalgie " - the revival of the east german aesthetic as cool kitsch - and when the reunited germany tried replacing him with a slimmed-down western version in 1997 , his fans rallied and saved him from certain death . an east-west stand-off his winning streak has shown no signs of letting up , and the 16-centimeter figure has become so profitable that he 's now at the heart of yet another dispute - one that some have seen as another east-west stand-off . two entrepreneurs from saxony and former west berlin took their fight over the marketing rights to the ampelmännchen to a leipzig court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim roßberg engineer joachim roßberg -lrb- photo -rrb- from zwickau , whose claim to the logo is that he was the only manufacturer of traffic lights in the former east germany , was being sued by designer markus heckhausen , who began incorporating the figure into products in 1995 .
he now sells over forty items , and told the court that he made 2 million euros last year with his ampelmännchen souvenirs . heckhausen - one of the initiators of the " save the amplemännchen " campaign ten years ago - argued that roßberg , who markets just six ampelmännchen products , was failing to make full use of his marketing rights .
legally , if no use of marketing rights is made for five years , the rights can be cancelled .
but roßberg insisted his business makes a tidy 50,000 euros a year . amicable agreement this week , the court proposed the rivals flesh out an amicable solution to the problem - and the unusual love triangle now seems to have a way of surviving . " money wo n't be changing hands , " said roßberg .
instead , he and heckhausen have decided to share and trade certain rights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus heckhausen " according to our agreement , we will simply exchange certain rights to the ampelmann and the newer ampelwoman , " heckhausen explained . roßberg will therefore continue to sell his best-known product , a liquor emblazoned with the logo - despite heckhausen 's scornful remark that " traffic regulations and alcohol are hardly compatible . " but despite such little squabbles , heckhausen is convinced the compromise will work .

european leaders are gathering in brussels for a two-day summit to give the alliance new momentum .
but can the eu extricate itself from its constitutional tangle ?
dw-world.de talked to commissioner viviane reding . the european union 's mid-year summit takes place against the backdrop of the french and dutch rejection of the constitution and the looming battle over the 2007-2013 budget .
dw-world interviewed viviane reding , eu commissioner for infomation society and media about what 's in stake for the future of the 25-member bloc . dw-world : commission president barroso has called for a period of reflection with regard to ratification of the constitution , what does that actually mean for the constitution ? reding : that means that the constitution is still alive and it is important that it is alive because it has been agreed upon by the political forces of all member states united in the convention , which means this agreement should be the basis for future discussions , but in the referenda procedures we saw that people were not informed about the content of the constitution and very often voted on the problems they have with europe or the problems they have with their governments .
so we think it will be very worthwhile to have a second look at this constitution and to present it to the public in a better way . how long might that take ? that will take as long as it takes until the time is right for a decision .
one can not foresee that ; it could be very short or it could also take several months . how is it possible to regain the faith of the people with regard to the european project ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viviane reding , eu commissioner for information society and media i have been listening to the citizens carefully during the last years , not only during the referenda period , and they have some problems with the way europe is being built .
the constitution was an answer to this problem , but people did n't understand it was a solution to their criticism .
so this is the message we have to bring across . is there a general level of fatigue among europeans when it comes to being members of a union ? i do n't think so .
when you see the figures , although the constitution was rejected by 55 percent of the french people , 70 percent of french people feel european and they want the european union .
they have a problem with the way this eu is developing .
it is also a fact that in the last 10 years the development of this union has been running at such a pace that nobody has been able to follow it - with the big enlargement and several reforms of the institutions .
i believe it is going too quickly for the normal people . how are you going to slow that down ? that is exactly why the president has said we have to calm down for a moment , we have to reflect , we have to explain that the criticism and the problems raised need a solution , and we have to explain how this solution is going to come about .
we can not keep running and running and running , and i think most of all , we must not continue enlarging europe without discussing this with our populations .
the last enlargement was not conceptualized by our citizens . so what does it mean for those countries lining up to join the union ? i think that they will need more time to join the eu than they probably thought in the beginning .
there is no timeframe in mind , this will be discussed according to the merits and the evolution of the different countries but i really feel very strongly that we have first to conceptualize and understand the implications of the last enlargement before we can go to further enlargement . what could have been done differently in order to make the last enlargement more successful ? information .
i have always been astonished at how well the citizens of the 10 new countries were informed about the europe of the 15 , and i was always shocked to see how little the citizens of the europe of 15 knew about the 10 newcomers .

europe is a reality and it has been since the world war ii .

european leaders are gathering in brussels for a two-day summit to give the alliance new momentum .
but can the eu extricate itself from its constitutional tangle ?
dw-world.de talked to commissioner viviane reding . the european union 's mid-year summit takes place against the backdrop of the french and dutch rejection of the constitution and the looming battle over the 2007-2013 budget .
dw-world interviewed viviane reding , eu commissioner for infomation society and media about what 's in stake for the future of the 25-member bloc . dw-world : commission president barroso has called for a period of reflection with regard to ratification of the constitution , what does that actually mean for the constitution ? reding : that means that the constitution is still alive and it is important that it is alive because it has been agreed upon by the political forces of all member states united in the convention , which means this agreement should be the basis for future discussions , but in the referenda procedures we saw that people were not informed about the content of the constitution and very often voted on the problems they have with europe or the problems they have with their governments .
so we think it will be very worthwhile to have a second look at this constitution and to present it to the public in a better way . how long might that take ? that will take as long as it takes until the time is right for a decision .
one can not foresee that ; it could be very short or it could also take several months . how is it possible to regain the faith of the people with regard to the european project ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viviane reding , eu commissioner for information society and media i have been listening to the citizens carefully during the last years , not only during the referenda period , and they have some problems with the way europe is being built .
the constitution was an answer to this problem , but people did n't understand it was a solution to their criticism .
so this is the message we have to bring across . is there a general level of fatigue among europeans when it comes to being members of a union ? i do n't think so .
when you see the figures , although the constitution was rejected by 55 percent of the french people , 70 percent of french people feel european and they want the european union .
they have a problem with the way this eu is developing .
it is also a fact that in the last 10 years the development of this union has been running at such a pace that nobody has been able to follow it - with the big enlargement and several reforms of the institutions .
i believe it is going too quickly for the normal people . how are you going to slow that down ? that is exactly why the president has said we have to calm down for a moment , we have to reflect , we have to explain that the criticism and the problems raised need a solution , and we have to explain how this solution is going to come about .
we can not keep running and running and running , and i think most of all , we must not continue enlarging europe without discussing this with our populations .
the last enlargement was not conceptualized by our citizens . so what does it mean for those countries lining up to join the union ? i think that they will need more time to join the eu than they probably thought in the beginning .
there is no timeframe in mind , this will be discussed according to the merits and the evolution of the different countries but i really feel very strongly that we have first to conceptualize and understand the implications of the last enlargement before we can go to further enlargement . what could have been done differently in order to make the last enlargement more successful ? information .
i have always been astonished at how well the citizens of the 10 new countries were informed about the europe of the 15 , and i was always shocked to see how little the citizens of the europe of 15 knew about the 10 newcomers .
it is not enough to have a big welcoming party , you have to explain the advantages and the dangers to the people , to explain what is being done in order to secure a smooth transition from ten to 15 , and now we are seeing the results .
many of our people have not understood the value and the advantages of enlargement and they are afraid of the pitfalls .
and all this is happening because nobody has ever taken the responsibility of explaining the enlargement to the citizens of the 15 countries . what would you say to those euroskeptics who are trumpeting that the eu is beginning to crumble ? that is wishful thinking and absolutely removed from reality .
europe is a reality and it has been since the world war ii .
even those who have a problem with european institutions today do n't have a problem with europe .
in a globalized world , the only way you can survive and keep your industry and economy strong , is by joining forces .
to have individual countries fighting monster constructions like india or like china would be absolutely ridiculous . would you then reject the idea that there is a will among individual states for a greater degree of sovereignty ? the national states gave up part of their sovereignty in order to share it with others and become more efficient .
foreign trade is one example where one commissioner is negotiating for the 25 .
could you imagine what would happen if the 25 were to negotiate individually ?
they would n't go anywhere .
it is important that we join forces where we need to , in order that each of us becomes more efficient .
there are many other levels of politics , such as taxation , where national states have kept their sovereignty , so it is also very difficult for the people to understand who is doing what in europe , and i do n't think that has been sufficiently explained .
the crux of the matter is that the new constitution sorted this division of labour out in a very very clear way , and it is a pity that this answer to the fears of the people now has to be postponed . what do you hope will be achieved at the summit over the next two days ? i hope they will keep a cool head and make wise decisions .
one should not panic in the face of a problem , but sit down in a quiet way , reflect , and find the appropriate solutions .
there is no use now in running .
i think we have to calm down and think about it , discuss it and then decide on the next steps .
i am sure there are going to be next steps to be taken , europe is going to advance , it is going to do so at a different pace as foreseen in the recent past , but it has no other choice than to move on .
the world around it is advancing , so if europe does not keep pace , it will be at a disadvantage to the rest of the world . tamsin walker interviewed viviane reding send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de can britain save europe ?

coach ricardo la volpe 's side will have to play more convincingly to advance . when jose fonseca climbed up to head in a cross and give his side a 2-1 lead over japan , the breath of relief from the mexican bench was almost audible . after playing a back-and-forth game for most of the first half and failing to solve the smaller japanese defense , fonseca 's score off of a gonzalo pineda pass in the 64th minute sent mexico off to a first match victory . up until that point , mexico had few opportunities after evening the score late in the first half .
though controlling the match at the beginning , la volpe 's side had a tough time breaking through the japanese defense . counter brings relief the small crowd of 21,000 in hanover 's stadium had something to cheer about early on as japan responded quickly on a counter .
akira kaji got free down the right side of the field and passed in to a streaking atsushi yanagisawa .
the midfielder was marked by mexico 's ricardo osorio , who actually deflected the ball into his own net after it skipped through yanagisawa 's legs .
the 1-0 lead was a surprise , but not without credit to the resilient japanese side .
mexico responded by not really responding at all .
the midfield continued having a tough time breaking down the defense , preferring to build up their attack slowly , rather than unsettling the japanese defenders with quick passes . mexico roars back mexican striker jared borgetti had a golden opportunity robbed by some good goalkeeping when his close range header was blocked off by japan 's small , but nimble goalie yoshikatsu kawaguchi . kawaguchi looked his size , though , on the goal that evened it up .
midfielder zinha sprung free on the left side of the penalty box and bent a nice shot into the upper right hand corner of the net that a diving kawaguchi was helpless to defend . slow to start in the second half , mexico finally found the key to the japanese defense that until then would not unlock .
the size difference between fonseca and his markers attracted the attention of pineda , who lofted a nice cross to him in the center , which the midfielder had no problem putting away . japan 's desperation attempts in the final phase of the game were easily shut down by mexico , which had finally found its footing .

european leaders are gathering in brussels for a two-day summit to give the alliance new momentum .
but can the eu extricate itself from its constitutional tangle ?
dw-world.de talked to commissioner viviane reding . the european union 's mid-year summit takes place against the backdrop of the french and dutch rejection of the constitution and the looming battle over the 2007-2013 budget .
dw-world interviewed viviane reding , eu commissioner for infomation society and media about what 's in stake for the future of the 25-member bloc . dw-world : commission president barroso has called for a period of reflection with regard to ratification of the constitution , what does that actually mean for the constitution ? reding : that means that the constitution is still alive and it is important that it is alive because it has been agreed upon by the political forces of all member states united in the convention , which means this agreement should be the basis for future discussions , but in the referenda procedures we saw that people were not informed about the content of the constitution and very often voted on the problems they have with europe or the problems they have with their governments .
so we think it will be very worthwhile to have a second look at this constitution and to present it to the public in a better way . how long might that take ? that will take as long as it takes until the time is right for a decision .
one can not foresee that ; it could be very short or it could also take several months . how is it possible to regain the faith of the people with regard to the european project ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viviane reding , eu commissioner for information society and media i have been listening to the citizens carefully during the last years , not only during the referenda period , and they have some problems with the way europe is being built .
the constitution was an answer to this problem , but people did n't understand it was a solution to their criticism .
so this is the message we have to bring across . is there a general level of fatigue among europeans when it comes to being members of a union ? i do n't think so .
when you see the figures , although the constitution was rejected by 55 percent of the french people , 70 percent of french people feel european and they want the european union .
they have a problem with the way this eu is developing .
it is also a fact that in the last 10 years the development of this union has been running at such a pace that nobody has been able to follow it - with the big enlargement and several reforms of the institutions .
i believe it is going too quickly for the normal people . how are you going to slow that down ? that is exactly why the president has said we have to calm down for a moment , we have to reflect , we have to explain that the criticism and the problems raised need a solution , and we have to explain how this solution is going to come about .
we can not keep running and running and running , and i think most of all , we must not continue enlarging europe without discussing this with our populations .
the last enlargement was not conceptualized by our citizens . so what does it mean for those countries lining up to join the union ? i think that they will need more time to join the eu than they probably thought in the beginning .
there is no timeframe in mind , this will be discussed according to the merits and the evolution of the different countries but i really feel very strongly that we have first to conceptualize and understand the implications of the last enlargement before we can go to further enlargement . what could have been done differently in order to make the last enlargement more successful ? information .
i have always been astonished at how well the citizens of the 10 new countries were informed about the europe of the 15 , and i was always shocked to see how little the citizens of the europe of 15 knew about the 10 newcomers .
it is not enough to have a big welcoming party , you have to explain the advantages and the dangers to the people , to explain what is being done in order to secure a smooth transition from ten to 15 , and now we are seeing the results .
many of our people have not understood the value and the advantages of enlargement and they are afraid of the pitfalls .
and all this is happening because nobody has ever taken the responsibility of explaining the enlargement to the citizens of the 15 countries . what would you say to those euroskeptics who are trumpeting that the eu is beginning to crumble ? that is wishful thinking and absolutely removed from reality .
europe is a reality and it has been since the world war ii .
even those who have a problem with european institutions today do n't have a problem with europe .
in a globalized world , the only way you can survive and keep your industry and economy strong , is by joining forces .
to have individual countries fighting monster constructions like india or like china would be absolutely ridiculous . would you then reject the idea that there is a will among individual states for a greater degree of sovereignty ? the national states gave up part of their sovereignty in order to share it with others and become more efficient .
foreign trade is one example where one commissioner is negotiating for the 25 .
could you imagine what would happen if the 25 were to negotiate individually ?
they would n't go anywhere .
it is important that we join forces where we need to , in order that each of us becomes more efficient .
there are many other levels of politics , such as taxation , where national states have kept their sovereignty , so it is also very difficult for the people to understand who is doing what in europe , and i do n't think that has been sufficiently explained .
the crux of the matter is that the new constitution sorted this division of labour out in a very very clear way , and it is a pity that this answer to the fears of the people now has to be postponed . what do you hope will be achieved at the summit over the next two days ? i hope they will keep a cool head and make wise decisions .
one should not panic in the face of a problem , but sit down in a quiet way , reflect , and find the appropriate solutions .
there is no use now in running .
i think we have to calm down and think about it , discuss it and then decide on the next steps .
i am sure there are going to be next steps to be taken , europe is going to advance , it is going to do so at a different pace as foreseen in the recent past , but it has no other choice than to move on .
the world around it is advancing , so if europe does not keep pace , it will be at a disadvantage to the rest of the world . tamsin walker interviewed viviane reding send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de can britain save europe ?

the first three matches were all decided by one goal but coach carlos alberto parreira 's team sent a very clear message to the seven other teams that the selecao are hungry for another international title . " the team was well-balanced , " explained parreira .
" sometimes they played too complicated but it was in order how we played . " the brazilian play was definitely in order but unlike the first three matches , it took a while for the first goal to be scored .
and how it was scored set the tone for the remainder of the match because greece got in a situation they prefer not to be in , namely attacking soccer . after 40 minutes in which otto rehhagel 's euro 2004 champs played aggressively enough to hold the brazilians in check , adriano finally broke the gordian knot .

42,000 fans watched a brazilian team that after this match is the squad to beat in the tournament . brazil provided the first clear-cut victory in the confederations cup with a 3-0 victory against greece .
the first three matches were all decided by one goal but coach carlos alberto parreira 's team sent a very clear message to the seven other teams that the selecao are hungry for another international title . " the team was well-balanced , " explained parreira .
" sometimes they played too complicated but it was in order how we played . " the brazilian play was definitely in order but unlike the first three matches , it took a while for the first goal to be scored .
and how it was scored set the tone for the remainder of the match because greece got in a situation they prefer not to be in , namely attacking soccer . after 40 minutes in which otto rehhagel 's euro 2004 champs played aggressively enough to hold the brazilians in check , adriano finally broke the gordian knot .
in a moment when the greeks failed to press the inter milan striker who then pulled up from 27 meters and launched a rocket that just squeezed inside the right post past a flying greek keeper antonis nikopolildis . second-half starts off disastrously in the first half , greece missed a golden opportunity in the first half-minute .
the second-half would start with a golden opportunity for brazil .
one they didn ’ t waste . bildunterschrift : greek goalkeeper antonios nikopolidis -lrb- right -rrb- looks as a shot from brazil 's robinho -lrb- left -rrb- hits the back of the net for the 2nd goal hertha berlin 's defender gilberto raced with the ball up the left sideline , crossed it through the greek penalty box where robinho -lrb- photo -rrb- , the replacement of superstar ronaldo , was waiting to place the ball in the net .
40 seconds into the second-half , greece were beaten . at this point , brazil could toy with otto rehhagel 's side like a cat with a wounded mouse .
the selecao handed the ball over to the greeks for the next ten minutes but when the euro champs were unable to take advantage of the brazilian gift , the world champs retook control . ronaldinho had a few good opportunities .
rubinho broke free occasionally and the achilles heel of the greek defense , the right side , was used continuously as a launching pad for attacks by the yellow-clad brazilians . midway through the second-half , a series of substitutions interrupted the flow of the match but important was the entrance of olympique lyon juninho pernambucano in the 77th minute . quality goal seals greece 's fate four minutes later , juninho stepped up to take a free-kick just outside the greek penalty box .
after all , the master of the free-kick ronaldinho had been taken out of the game .
but juninho plays at a level , if not equal , then very close to last year 's footballer of the year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil was head taller all night juninho bent the direct kick over the top of the greek wall , the ball dropped 2 meters in a millisecond , and nikopolidis could only watch as the leather fell into the back of the net .
the very real and classy greek defense of 2004 was transformed into something comparable to the best myths classic greek mythology . " the brazilians were clearly better , " commented rehhagel .
" all 11 players must give 110 % to beat a brazilian team and tonight we only gave about 50 % .
that was n't enough . " so the greeks , after a series of disappointing qualifying matches for next year 's world cup in germany , are finding out that rehhagel no longer has the midas touch .

european leaders are gathering in brussels for a two-day summit to give the alliance new momentum .
but can the eu extricate itself from its constitutional tangle ?
dw-world.de talked to commissioner viviane reding . the european union 's mid-year summit takes place against the backdrop of the french and dutch rejection of the constitution and the looming battle over the 2007-2013 budget .
dw-world interviewed viviane reding , eu commissioner for infomation society and media about what 's in stake for the future of the 25-member bloc . dw-world : commission president barroso has called for a period of reflection with regard to ratification of the constitution , what does that actually mean for the constitution ? reding : that means that the constitution is still alive and it is important that it is alive because it has been agreed upon by the political forces of all member states united in the convention , which means this agreement should be the basis for future discussions , but in the referenda procedures we saw that people were not informed about the content of the constitution and very often voted on the problems they have with europe or the problems they have with their governments .
so we think it will be very worthwhile to have a second look at this constitution and to present it to the public in a better way . how long might that take ? that will take as long as it takes until the time is right for a decision .
one can not foresee that ; it could be very short or it could also take several months . how is it possible to regain the faith of the people with regard to the european project ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viviane reding , eu commissioner for information society and media i have been listening to the citizens carefully during the last years , not only during the referenda period , and they have some problems with the way europe is being built .
the constitution was an answer to this problem , but people did n't understand it was a solution to their criticism .
so this is the message we have to bring across . is there a general level of fatigue among europeans when it comes to being members of a union ? i do n't think so .
when you see the figures , although the constitution was rejected by 55 percent of the french people , 70 percent of french people feel european and they want the european union .
they have a problem with the way this eu is developing .
it is also a fact that in the last 10 years the development of this union has been running at such a pace that nobody has been able to follow it - with the big enlargement and several reforms of the institutions .
i believe it is going too quickly for the normal people . how are you going to slow that down ? that is exactly why the president has said we have to calm down for a moment , we have to reflect , we have to explain that the criticism and the problems raised need a solution , and we have to explain how this solution is going to come about .
we can not keep running and running and running , and i think most of all , we must not continue enlarging europe without discussing this with our populations .
the last enlargement was not conceptualized by our citizens . so what does it mean for those countries lining up to join the union ? i think that they will need more time to join the eu than they probably thought in the beginning .
there is no timeframe in mind , this will be discussed according to the merits and the evolution of the different countries but i really feel very strongly that we have first to conceptualize and understand the implications of the last enlargement before we can go to further enlargement . what could have been done differently in order to make the last enlargement more successful ? information .
i have always been astonished at how well the citizens of the 10 new countries were informed about the europe of the 15 , and i was always shocked to see how little the citizens of the europe of 15 knew about the 10 newcomers .
it is not enough to have a big welcoming party , you have to explain the advantages and the dangers to the people , to explain what is being done in order to secure a smooth transition from ten to 15 , and now we are seeing the results .
many of our people have not understood the value and the advantages of enlargement and they are afraid of the pitfalls .
and all this is happening because nobody has ever taken the responsibility of explaining the enlargement to the citizens of the 15 countries . what would you say to those euroskeptics who are trumpeting that the eu is beginning to crumble ? that is wishful thinking and absolutely removed from reality .
europe is a reality and it has been since the world war ii .
even those who have a problem with european institutions today do n't have a problem with europe .
in a globalized world , the only way you can survive and keep your industry and economy strong , is by joining forces .
to have individual countries fighting monster constructions like india or like china would be absolutely ridiculous . would you then reject the idea that there is a will among individual states for a greater degree of sovereignty ? the national states gave up part of their sovereignty in order to share it with others and become more efficient .
foreign trade is one example where one commissioner is negotiating for the 25 .
could you imagine what would happen if the 25 were to negotiate individually ?
they would n't go anywhere .
it is important that we join forces where we need to , in order that each of us becomes more efficient .
there are many other levels of politics , such as taxation , where national states have kept their sovereignty , so it is also very difficult for the people to understand who is doing what in europe , and i do n't think that has been sufficiently explained .
the crux of the matter is that the new constitution sorted this division of labour out in a very very clear way , and it is a pity that this answer to the fears of the people now has to be postponed . what do you hope will be achieved at the summit over the next two days ? i hope they will keep a cool head and make wise decisions .
one should not panic in the face of a problem , but sit down in a quiet way , reflect , and find the appropriate solutions .
there is no use now in running .
i think we have to calm down and think about it , discuss it and then decide on the next steps .
i am sure there are going to be next steps to be taken , europe is going to advance , it is going to do so at a different pace as foreseen in the recent past , but it has no other choice than to move on .
the world around it is advancing , so if europe does not keep pace , it will be at a disadvantage to the rest of the world . tamsin walker interviewed viviane reding send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de can britain save europe ?

european leaders are gathering in brussels for a two-day summit to give the alliance new momentum .
but can the eu extricate itself from its constitutional tangle ?
dw-world.de talked to commissioner viviane reding . the european union 's mid-year summit takes place against the backdrop of the french and dutch rejection of the constitution and the looming battle over the 2007-2013 budget .
dw-world interviewed viviane reding , eu commissioner for infomation society and media about what 's in stake for the future of the 25-member bloc . dw-world : commission president barroso has called for a period of reflection with regard to ratification of the constitution , what does that actually mean for the constitution ? reding : that means that the constitution is still alive and it is important that it is alive because it has been agreed upon by the political forces of all member states united in the convention , which means this agreement should be the basis for future discussions , but in the referenda procedures we saw that people were not informed about the content of the constitution and very often voted on the problems they have with europe or the problems they have with their governments .
so we think it will be very worthwhile to have a second look at this constitution and to present it to the public in a better way . how long might that take ? that will take as long as it takes until the time is right for a decision .
one can not foresee that ; it could be very short or it could also take several months . how is it possible to regain the faith of the people with regard to the european project ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viviane reding , eu commissioner for information society and media i have been listening to the citizens carefully during the last years , not only during the referenda period , and they have some problems with the way europe is being built .
the constitution was an answer to this problem , but people did n't understand it was a solution to their criticism .
so this is the message we have to bring across . is there a general level of fatigue among europeans when it comes to being members of a union ? i do n't think so .
when you see the figures , although the constitution was rejected by 55 percent of the french people , 70 percent of french people feel european and they want the european union .
they have a problem with the way this eu is developing .
it is also a fact that in the last 10 years the development of this union has been running at such a pace that nobody has been able to follow it - with the big enlargement and several reforms of the institutions .
i believe it is going too quickly for the normal people . how are you going to slow that down ? that is exactly why the president has said we have to calm down for a moment , we have to reflect , we have to explain that the criticism and the problems raised need a solution , and we have to explain how this solution is going to come about .
we can not keep running and running and running , and i think most of all , we must not continue enlarging europe without discussing this with our populations .
the last enlargement was not conceptualized by our citizens . so what does it mean for those countries lining up to join the union ? i think that they will need more time to join the eu than they probably thought in the beginning .
there is no timeframe in mind , this will be discussed according to the merits and the evolution of the different countries but i really feel very strongly that we have first to conceptualize and understand the implications of the last enlargement before we can go to further enlargement . what could have been done differently in order to make the last enlargement more successful ? information .
i have always been astonished at how well the citizens of the 10 new countries were informed about the europe of the 15 , and i was always shocked to see how little the citizens of the europe of 15 knew about the 10 newcomers .
it is not enough to have a big welcoming party , you have to explain the advantages and the dangers to the people , to explain what is being done in order to secure a smooth transition from ten to 15 , and now we are seeing the results .
many of our people have not understood the value and the advantages of enlargement and they are afraid of the pitfalls .
and all this is happening because nobody has ever taken the responsibility of explaining the enlargement to the citizens of the 15 countries . what would you say to those euroskeptics who are trumpeting that the eu is beginning to crumble ? that is wishful thinking and absolutely removed from reality .
europe is a reality and it has been since the world war ii .
even those who have a problem with european institutions today do n't have a problem with europe .
in a globalized world , the only way you can survive and keep your industry and economy strong , is by joining forces .
to have individual countries fighting monster constructions like india or like china would be absolutely ridiculous . would you then reject the idea that there is a will among individual states for a greater degree of sovereignty ? the national states gave up part of their sovereignty in order to share it with others and become more efficient .
foreign trade is one example where one commissioner is negotiating for the 25 .
could you imagine what would happen if the 25 were to negotiate individually ?
they would n't go anywhere .
it is important that we join forces where we need to , in order that each of us becomes more efficient .
there are many other levels of politics , such as taxation , where national states have kept their sovereignty , so it is also very difficult for the people to understand who is doing what in europe , and i do n't think that has been sufficiently explained .
the crux of the matter is that the new constitution sorted this division of labour out in a very very clear way , and it is a pity that this answer to the fears of the people now has to be postponed . what do you hope will be achieved at the summit over the next two days ? i hope they will keep a cool head and make wise decisions .
one should not panic in the face of a problem , but sit down in a quiet way , reflect , and find the appropriate solutions .
there is no use now in running .
i think we have to calm down and think about it , discuss it and then decide on the next steps .
i am sure there are going to be next steps to be taken , europe is going to advance , it is going to do so at a different pace as foreseen in the recent past , but it has no other choice than to move on .

in leading greece to the european championships , he silenced his most vociferous critics at home , and reached god status in his adopted one . otto rehhagel is promising a soccer party tonight when his greek side takes on 2002 world cup winners brazil in the newly refurbished leipzig stadium .
" we 're going to play freely and with spirit and hopefully we can do ourselves proud , " he said ahead of tonight 's premiere clash in the second group .
against world beaters like adriano , kaka , ronaldinho and the ascendent robinho , a greek side of hard-working , but unknown team players will have a difficult time of it .
after stunning the world by improbably beating france , the czech republic and then portugal to win the 2004 european championships , greece will have to prove it is better than the faltering world cup qualifying campaign it has waged so far -lrb- the greeks are in danger of missing out on the world cup , currently third behind ukraine and turkey -rrb- .
but chances are good that rehhagel will be smiling at the end of the match , no matter what the outcome .
the confederations cup tournament is a sort of victorious homecoming parade for the german coach who has been consistently passed over for the national team job in germany .
the architect of the impossible a tough defender during his playing career , rehhagel became a staunch advocate of a conservative , defense-minded playing style as a coach - to astounding success .

his authoritarian style was exactly what a soccer federation ruled by nepotism , corruption and petty disputes needed .
rehhagel took a team of unspectacular individual players and formed them into a singular , compact side that confounded superior sides like france and portugal with their disciplined defense and dangerous counters .
" rehhagel respects his players , " said midfielder vasilis tsiartas , in an interview with die welt newspaper .

in leading greece to the european championships , he silenced his most vociferous critics at home , and reached god status in his adopted one . otto rehhagel is promising a soccer party tonight when his greek side takes on 2002 world cup winners brazil in the newly refurbished leipzig stadium .
" we 're going to play freely and with spirit and hopefully we can do ourselves proud , " he said ahead of tonight 's premiere clash in the second group .
against world beaters like adriano , kaka , ronaldinho and the ascendent robinho , a greek side of hard-working , but unknown team players will have a difficult time of it .
after stunning the world by improbably beating france , the czech republic and then portugal to win the 2004 european championships , greece will have to prove it is better than the faltering world cup qualifying campaign it has waged so far -lrb- the greeks are in danger of missing out on the world cup , currently third behind ukraine and turkey -rrb- .
but chances are good that rehhagel will be smiling at the end of the match , no matter what the outcome .
the confederations cup tournament is a sort of victorious homecoming parade for the german coach who has been consistently passed over for the national team job in germany .
the architect of the impossible a tough defender during his playing career , rehhagel became a staunch advocate of a conservative , defense-minded playing style as a coach - to astounding success .
the 66-year-old won the german championship three times , the last with a team that a year before had played in the second division .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freedom to call all of the shots but his straight talk and controlling hand were too much for some german soccer functionaries , and his tactical style considered too throwback at a time when germany wanted to join the rest of the world in employing modern playing styles .

the country 's sports journalists have credited the national team 's amazing turnaround -lrb- they had competed in two international tournaments in as many decades , and did n't win one game -rrb- to the man from essen .
his authoritarian style was exactly what a soccer federation ruled by nepotism , corruption and petty disputes needed .
rehhagel took a team of unspectacular individual players and formed them into a singular , compact side that confounded superior sides like france and portugal with their disciplined defense and dangerous counters .
" rehhagel respects his players , " said midfielder vasilis tsiartas , in an interview with die welt newspaper .
" he knows how to deal with us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehhagel , here with striker angelos charisteas , " knows how to deal with players " underestimated , but struggling now , he 's hoping his team - largely the same one he took to portugal - will be able to repeat its success .
" they 're european champions for a reason , " said brazilian coach carlos alberto parreira .
" underestimate them at your own peril . "
more is at stake than just the cup , however .
observers say greece needs to use the tournament to find its form quickly , before missing its last chances to return to germany next year to play in the world cup . following his team 's championship win , rehhagel was offered a guarantee to compete in 2006 - as coach of the german side .

" i 'm going there with a willingness to reach an agreement , " he said , adding that his government was ready to work on a compromise as long as the result did n't lead to additional german payments that the country could not shoulder financially . " it would be wonderful if the signal from brussels would be that the eu is capable to act , " he said , referring to the 25-member bloc 's ongoing crisis as french and dutch voters rejected the proposed eu constitution and states have failed to reach a solution for the eu budget for 2007 to 2013 . british rebate unjust ? one of the main problems in the latter matter is that britain still refuses to budge on a decade-old , billion-euro rebate it was granted as the country does not profit as much from the eu 's agricultural subsidies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and blair are not getting along so well these days " the rebate has no real justification any more , " schröder said and attacked opposition leader angela merkel and his challenger in the upcoming elections for reportedly backing british prime minister tony blair on the rebate .
merkel refused to comment on this during her reply . sticking to the constitution on the question of the eu constitution , schröder said the ratification process should be continued despite the french and dutch " nos " and the british decision to postpone a referendum .
schröder said the matter should be dealt with during the austrian eu presidency in the first part of 2006 , when more states have had a chance to decide on the treaty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- left -rrb- and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan in the turkish capital ankara in february 2004 he also criticized the opposition christian democrats for again questioning membership negotiations with turkey .

but who actually owns the marketing rights to this much-loved motif ? you name it , he 's been on it .
with bath mats , lampshades , vases , key-rings , t-shirts , mouse mats and coffee cups to choose from , you have n't been to berlin if you have n't brought home a souvenir emblazoned with the portly little figure with the trademark bowler hat . the " ampelmännchen " is an industry unto himself , and enjoys the privileged status of being one of the sole features of communist east germany to have survived the end of the iron curtain with his popularity unscathed . in the 1990s , he found himself at the heart of a full-blown rescue campaign when he was faced with possible extinction .
the figure first designed by karl peglau in 1961 had come to symbolize " ostalgie " - the revival of the east german aesthetic as cool kitsch - and when the reunited germany tried replacing him with a slimmed-down western version in 1997 , his fans rallied and saved him from certain death . an east-west stand-off his winning streak has shown no signs of letting up , and the 16-centimeter figure has become so profitable that he 's now at the heart of yet another dispute - one that some have seen as another east-west stand-off . two entrepreneurs from saxony and former west berlin took their fight over the marketing rights to the ampelmännchen to a leipzig court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim roßberg engineer joachim roßberg -lrb- photo -rrb- from zwickau , whose claim to the logo is that he was the only manufacturer of traffic lights in the former east germany , was being sued by designer markus heckhausen , who began incorporating the figure into products in 1995 .
he now sells over forty items , and told the court that he made 2 million euros last year with his ampelmännchen souvenirs . heckhausen - one of the initiators of the " save the amplemännchen " campaign ten years ago - argued that roßberg , who markets just six ampelmännchen products , was failing to make full use of his marketing rights .
legally , if no use of marketing rights is made for five years , the rights can be cancelled .
but roßberg insisted his business makes a tidy 50,000 euros a year . amicable agreement this week , the court proposed the rivals flesh out an amicable solution to the problem - and the unusual love triangle now seems to have a way of surviving . " money wo n't be changing hands , " said roßberg .
instead , he and heckhausen have decided to share and trade certain rights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus heckhausen " according to our agreement , we will simply exchange certain rights to the ampelmann and the newer ampelwoman , " heckhausen explained . roßberg will therefore continue to sell his best-known product , a liquor emblazoned with the logo - despite heckhausen 's scornful remark that " traffic regulations and alcohol are hardly compatible . " but despite such little squabbles , heckhausen is convinced the compromise will work .
" once again , the ampelmännchen has proved to be a positive symbol of reunification , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de touring east germany without the oppression thirteen years after the collapse of communist east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- , kitschy nostalgia for a lost culture still lives on in berlin .

in a survey conducted in 2004 by the criminological research institute of lower saxony -lrb- kfn -rrb- , a representative sample of 2,000 people were asked about their perceptions of crime trends in the previous 10 years .
in almost all categories of crime , respondents grossly overestimated crime rates in germany . while car theft rates actually shrank by 70.5 percent , people surveyed estimated they had increased by 47 percent .
when it came to serious crimes such as murder , the discrepancies grew .
the average estimate was that the murder rate had gone up 27 percent , when in fact it had fallen by 40.8 percent .
sexual murders dropped by 37.5 percent between 1993 and 2003 , but the public estimated that they had increased by a full 260 percent .

experts say the media plays a large role in this disconnect between reality and perception . the numbers are encouraging .
between 1993 and 2003 , the number of murders fell by 40.8 percent and domestic burglaries fell by 45.7 percent .
all in all , crime in general dropped by 2.6 percent during the 10-year period and today , germany is considered one of the industrialized world 's safer countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but among the german populace , the mental picture of the nation 's crime rate is markedly different .
in a survey conducted in 2004 by the criminological research institute of lower saxony -lrb- kfn -rrb- , a representative sample of 2,000 people were asked about their perceptions of crime trends in the previous 10 years .
in almost all categories of crime , respondents grossly overestimated crime rates in germany . while car theft rates actually shrank by 70.5 percent , people surveyed estimated they had increased by 47 percent .
when it came to serious crimes such as murder , the discrepancies grew .
the average estimate was that the murder rate had gone up 27 percent , when in fact it had fallen by 40.8 percent .
sexual murders dropped by 37.5 percent between 1993 and 2003 , but the public estimated that they had increased by a full 260 percent . " the public perception is very different from what we see from the police statistics , " said matthias kleimann , a researcher at kfn who helped author a study of crime perception versus reality , of which the survey was a part . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : such trends have been seen in other western countries as well .
in the uk , a survey in 2003 showed 38 percent of britons thought crime rates had gone up strongly in the previous two years , while only four percent thought they had decreased over that time .
in fact , crime rates there had fallen by around two percent . in the united states , the story is similar .
while crime has fallen fairly consistently since 1991 , the perception is the opposite , as evidenced by the multiplication of gated communities across the nation and the booming business done by one growth industry , home security . what 's to blame ? while the jury is still out on the exact reasons for this disconnect between the real and perceived crime story , experts from several countries where the phenomenon can be seen are pointing their fingers at the media and the style , and amount , of its crime reporting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ look at what kind of news pieces make it into a newscast , the negative stories .
the newsroom theory is most definitely ' bad news is good news ' , " said kleimann . crime for many media outlets , particularly television , is very good news since it is often inexpensive to cover and , at the same time , a big draw for viewers . " you have to look at the way a lot of tv presents crime stories .
they are at the same time highly emotional and affect people directly , " he said .
" when a child disappears , it interests everyone and it often leads the newscast . " he points out that the trend has been noticeable since the mid 1980s , when commercial television networks first became fixtures on the german media landscape .
unlike their public rivals , the commercial networks have ratings to worry about .
like their american counterparts , they have adopted the " if it bleeds , it leads " news philosophy at the expense of drier stories on topics like unemployment or government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the result is a sensational smorgasbord of harrowing crime stories that has skewed the perception of the average viewer . one study showed that in the us , there was a slight decrease in the number of serious crimes over the period 1991 to 1995 .
an analysis of the evening news broadcast by all major television stations , on the other hand , showed the number of televised reports of spectacular violent crimes increased fourfold . real-world effects while those perceptions and heightened fear may have little to do with the world outside the tv , they do have an effect on society , particularly the justice system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " during the last decade , attitudes towards punishment in different western european countries have become significantly harsher , " according to helmut kury of the max planck institute of criminal and international law .
he said that can be traced to the perception of " increasing crime " in general , and the public 's desire that " something be done " about a problem that people fear is skyrocketing . in fact , experts say that the false perception of crime is the phenomenon that is more likely to quickly spiral out of control . often added to the mix are politicians who look to exploit those fears for their own gain by taking tough-on-crime stances , winning votes by promising to build more prisons and pass tougher sentencing laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the researchers at kfn , that will do little to help cut an already fairly low crime rate in germany and threatens to draw resources away from youth and educational centers that criminologists say are more effective preventive measures against future criminality .
" in the us there has been a great increase in tougher sentencing laws and a huge increase in the numbers of prisons built , " said kfn 's kleimann .
" in germany , my fear is that we ’ re beginning to go down that road as well .

merkel refused to comment on this during her reply . sticking to the constitution on the question of the eu constitution , schröder said the ratification process should be continued despite the french and dutch " nos " and the british decision to postpone a referendum .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : crisis in brussels a quick guide to the eu summit meet the eu 's deficit sinners eu 's billions to flow to familiar shores eu attempts to untie budget tangles europe -pipe- 16.06.2005 " europe ca n't keep running " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how embattled is europe really ?
european leaders are gathering in brussels for a two-day summit to give the alliance new momentum .
but can the eu extricate itself from its constitutional tangle ?
dw-world.de talked to commissioner viviane reding . the european union 's mid-year summit takes place against the backdrop of the french and dutch rejection of the constitution and the looming battle over the 2007-2013 budget .
dw-world interviewed viviane reding , eu commissioner for infomation society and media about what 's in stake for the future of the 25-member bloc . dw-world : commission president barroso has called for a period of reflection with regard to ratification of the constitution , what does that actually mean for the constitution ? reding : that means that the constitution is still alive and it is important that it is alive because it has been agreed upon by the political forces of all member states united in the convention , which means this agreement should be the basis for future discussions , but in the referenda procedures we saw that people were not informed about the content of the constitution and very often voted on the problems they have with europe or the problems they have with their governments .
so we think it will be very worthwhile to have a second look at this constitution and to present it to the public in a better way . how long might that take ? that will take as long as it takes until the time is right for a decision .
one can not foresee that ; it could be very short or it could also take several months . how is it possible to regain the faith of the people with regard to the european project ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viviane reding , eu commissioner for information society and media i have been listening to the citizens carefully during the last years , not only during the referenda period , and they have some problems with the way europe is being built .
the constitution was an answer to this problem , but people did n't understand it was a solution to their criticism .
so this is the message we have to bring across . is there a general level of fatigue among europeans when it comes to being members of a union ? i do n't think so .
when you see the figures , although the constitution was rejected by 55 percent of the french people , 70 percent of french people feel european and they want the european union .
they have a problem with the way this eu is developing .
it is also a fact that in the last 10 years the development of this union has been running at such a pace that nobody has been able to follow it - with the big enlargement and several reforms of the institutions .
i believe it is going too quickly for the normal people . how are you going to slow that down ? that is exactly why the president has said we have to calm down for a moment , we have to reflect , we have to explain that the criticism and the problems raised need a solution , and we have to explain how this solution is going to come about .
we can not keep running and running and running , and i think most of all , we must not continue enlarging europe without discussing this with our populations .
the last enlargement was not conceptualized by our citizens . so what does it mean for those countries lining up to join the union ? i think that they will need more time to join the eu than they probably thought in the beginning .
there is no timeframe in mind , this will be discussed according to the merits and the evolution of the different countries but i really feel very strongly that we have first to conceptualize and understand the implications of the last enlargement before we can go to further enlargement . what could have been done differently in order to make the last enlargement more successful ? information .
i have always been astonished at how well the citizens of the 10 new countries were informed about the europe of the 15 , and i was always shocked to see how little the citizens of the europe of 15 knew about the 10 newcomers .
it is not enough to have a big welcoming party , you have to explain the advantages and the dangers to the people , to explain what is being done in order to secure a smooth transition from ten to 15 , and now we are seeing the results .
many of our people have not understood the value and the advantages of enlargement and they are afraid of the pitfalls .
and all this is happening because nobody has ever taken the responsibility of explaining the enlargement to the citizens of the 15 countries . what would you say to those euroskeptics who are trumpeting that the eu is beginning to crumble ? that is wishful thinking and absolutely removed from reality .
europe is a reality and it has been since the world war ii .
even those who have a problem with european institutions today do n't have a problem with europe .
in a globalized world , the only way you can survive and keep your industry and economy strong , is by joining forces .
to have individual countries fighting monster constructions like india or like china would be absolutely ridiculous . would you then reject the idea that there is a will among individual states for a greater degree of sovereignty ? the national states gave up part of their sovereignty in order to share it with others and become more efficient .
foreign trade is one example where one commissioner is negotiating for the 25 .
could you imagine what would happen if the 25 were to negotiate individually ?
they would n't go anywhere .
it is important that we join forces where we need to , in order that each of us becomes more efficient .
there are many other levels of politics , such as taxation , where national states have kept their sovereignty , so it is also very difficult for the people to understand who is doing what in europe , and i do n't think that has been sufficiently explained .
the crux of the matter is that the new constitution sorted this division of labour out in a very very clear way , and it is a pity that this answer to the fears of the people now has to be postponed . what do you hope will be achieved at the summit over the next two days ? i hope they will keep a cool head and make wise decisions .
one should not panic in the face of a problem , but sit down in a quiet way , reflect , and find the appropriate solutions .
there is no use now in running .
i think we have to calm down and think about it , discuss it and then decide on the next steps .
i am sure there are going to be next steps to be taken , europe is going to advance , it is going to do so at a different pace as foreseen in the recent past , but it has no other choice than to move on .
the world around it is advancing , so if europe does not keep pace , it will be at a disadvantage to the rest of the world . tamsin walker interviewed viviane reding send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de can britain save europe ?

european leaders are gathering in brussels for a two-day summit to give the alliance new momentum .
but can the eu extricate itself from its constitutional tangle ?
dw-world.de talked to commissioner viviane reding . the european union 's mid-year summit takes place against the backdrop of the french and dutch rejection of the constitution and the looming battle over the 2007-2013 budget .
dw-world interviewed viviane reding , eu commissioner for infomation society and media about what 's in stake for the future of the 25-member bloc . dw-world : commission president barroso has called for a period of reflection with regard to ratification of the constitution , what does that actually mean for the constitution ? reding : that means that the constitution is still alive and it is important that it is alive because it has been agreed upon by the political forces of all member states united in the convention , which means this agreement should be the basis for future discussions , but in the referenda procedures we saw that people were not informed about the content of the constitution and very often voted on the problems they have with europe or the problems they have with their governments .
so we think it will be very worthwhile to have a second look at this constitution and to present it to the public in a better way . how long might that take ? that will take as long as it takes until the time is right for a decision .
one can not foresee that ; it could be very short or it could also take several months . how is it possible to regain the faith of the people with regard to the european project ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viviane reding , eu commissioner for information society and media i have been listening to the citizens carefully during the last years , not only during the referenda period , and they have some problems with the way europe is being built .
the constitution was an answer to this problem , but people did n't understand it was a solution to their criticism .
so this is the message we have to bring across . is there a general level of fatigue among europeans when it comes to being members of a union ? i do n't think so .
when you see the figures , although the constitution was rejected by 55 percent of the french people , 70 percent of french people feel european and they want the european union .
they have a problem with the way this eu is developing .
it is also a fact that in the last 10 years the development of this union has been running at such a pace that nobody has been able to follow it - with the big enlargement and several reforms of the institutions .
i believe it is going too quickly for the normal people . how are you going to slow that down ? that is exactly why the president has said we have to calm down for a moment , we have to reflect , we have to explain that the criticism and the problems raised need a solution , and we have to explain how this solution is going to come about .
we can not keep running and running and running , and i think most of all , we must not continue enlarging europe without discussing this with our populations .
the last enlargement was not conceptualized by our citizens . so what does it mean for those countries lining up to join the union ? i think that they will need more time to join the eu than they probably thought in the beginning .
there is no timeframe in mind , this will be discussed according to the merits and the evolution of the different countries but i really feel very strongly that we have first to conceptualize and understand the implications of the last enlargement before we can go to further enlargement . what could have been done differently in order to make the last enlargement more successful ? information .
i have always been astonished at how well the citizens of the 10 new countries were informed about the europe of the 15 , and i was always shocked to see how little the citizens of the europe of 15 knew about the 10 newcomers .
it is not enough to have a big welcoming party , you have to explain the advantages and the dangers to the people , to explain what is being done in order to secure a smooth transition from ten to 15 , and now we are seeing the results .
many of our people have not understood the value and the advantages of enlargement and they are afraid of the pitfalls .
and all this is happening because nobody has ever taken the responsibility of explaining the enlargement to the citizens of the 15 countries . what would you say to those euroskeptics who are trumpeting that the eu is beginning to crumble ? that is wishful thinking and absolutely removed from reality .
europe is a reality and it has been since the world war ii .
even those who have a problem with european institutions today do n't have a problem with europe .
in a globalized world , the only way you can survive and keep your industry and economy strong , is by joining forces .
to have individual countries fighting monster constructions like india or like china would be absolutely ridiculous . would you then reject the idea that there is a will among individual states for a greater degree of sovereignty ? the national states gave up part of their sovereignty in order to share it with others and become more efficient .
foreign trade is one example where one commissioner is negotiating for the 25 .
could you imagine what would happen if the 25 were to negotiate individually ?
they would n't go anywhere .
it is important that we join forces where we need to , in order that each of us becomes more efficient .
there are many other levels of politics , such as taxation , where national states have kept their sovereignty , so it is also very difficult for the people to understand who is doing what in europe , and i do n't think that has been sufficiently explained .
the crux of the matter is that the new constitution sorted this division of labour out in a very very clear way , and it is a pity that this answer to the fears of the people now has to be postponed . what do you hope will be achieved at the summit over the next two days ? i hope they will keep a cool head and make wise decisions .
one should not panic in the face of a problem , but sit down in a quiet way , reflect , and find the appropriate solutions .
there is no use now in running .
i think we have to calm down and think about it , discuss it and then decide on the next steps .
i am sure there are going to be next steps to be taken , europe is going to advance , it is going to do so at a different pace as foreseen in the recent past , but it has no other choice than to move on .
the world around it is advancing , so if europe does not keep pace , it will be at a disadvantage to the rest of the world . tamsin walker interviewed viviane reding send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de can britain save europe ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 16.06.2005 brazil show otto who 's king großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek coach otto rehhagel was dethroned by brazil , 3-0 brazil opens the confederations cup with a dominating 3-0 victory over otto rehhagel 's european champs greece .
42,000 fans watched a brazilian team that after this match is the squad to beat in the tournament . brazil provided the first clear-cut victory in the confederations cup with a 3-0 victory against greece .
the first three matches were all decided by one goal but coach carlos alberto parreira 's team sent a very clear message to the seven other teams that the selecao are hungry for another international title . " the team was well-balanced , " explained parreira .
" sometimes they played too complicated but it was in order how we played . " the brazilian play was definitely in order but unlike the first three matches , it took a while for the first goal to be scored .
and how it was scored set the tone for the remainder of the match because greece got in a situation they prefer not to be in , namely attacking soccer . after 40 minutes in which otto rehhagel 's euro 2004 champs played aggressively enough to hold the brazilians in check , adriano finally broke the gordian knot .
in a moment when the greeks failed to press the inter milan striker who then pulled up from 27 meters and launched a rocket that just squeezed inside the right post past a flying greek keeper antonis nikopolildis . second-half starts off disastrously in the first half , greece missed a golden opportunity in the first half-minute .
the second-half would start with a golden opportunity for brazil .
one they didn ’ t waste . bildunterschrift : greek goalkeeper antonios nikopolidis -lrb- right -rrb- looks as a shot from brazil 's robinho -lrb- left -rrb- hits the back of the net for the 2nd goal hertha berlin 's defender gilberto raced with the ball up the left sideline , crossed it through the greek penalty box where robinho -lrb- photo -rrb- , the replacement of superstar ronaldo , was waiting to place the ball in the net .
40 seconds into the second-half , greece were beaten . at this point , brazil could toy with otto rehhagel 's side like a cat with a wounded mouse .
the selecao handed the ball over to the greeks for the next ten minutes but when the euro champs were unable to take advantage of the brazilian gift , the world champs retook control . ronaldinho had a few good opportunities .
rubinho broke free occasionally and the achilles heel of the greek defense , the right side , was used continuously as a launching pad for attacks by the yellow-clad brazilians . midway through the second-half , a series of substitutions interrupted the flow of the match but important was the entrance of olympique lyon juninho pernambucano in the 77th minute . quality goal seals greece 's fate four minutes later , juninho stepped up to take a free-kick just outside the greek penalty box .
after all , the master of the free-kick ronaldinho had been taken out of the game .
but juninho plays at a level , if not equal , then very close to last year 's footballer of the year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil was head taller all night juninho bent the direct kick over the top of the greek wall , the ball dropped 2 meters in a millisecond , and nikopolidis could only watch as the leather fell into the back of the net .
the very real and classy greek defense of 2004 was transformed into something comparable to the best myths classic greek mythology . " the brazilians were clearly better , " commented rehhagel .
" all 11 players must give 110 % to beat a brazilian team and tonight we only gave about 50 % .
that was n't enough . " so the greeks , after a series of disappointing qualifying matches for next year 's world cup in germany , are finding out that rehhagel no longer has the midas touch .
brazil , on the other hand , was convincing after last week 's bitter 3-1 defeat to argentina in buenos aires .
understandably , they would like a chance to exact revenge against their south american rivals .
but before that they have two more matches to play . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mexico yawns past japan mexico edged japan on a second-half goal in a slow-paced match that featured few highlights .

to have individual countries fighting monster constructions like india or like china would be absolutely ridiculous . would you then reject the idea that there is a will among individual states for a greater degree of sovereignty ? the national states gave up part of their sovereignty in order to share it with others and become more efficient .
foreign trade is one example where one commissioner is negotiating for the 25 .
could you imagine what would happen if the 25 were to negotiate individually ?
they would n't go anywhere .
it is important that we join forces where we need to , in order that each of us becomes more efficient .
there are many other levels of politics , such as taxation , where national states have kept their sovereignty , so it is also very difficult for the people to understand who is doing what in europe , and i do n't think that has been sufficiently explained .
the crux of the matter is that the new constitution sorted this division of labour out in a very very clear way , and it is a pity that this answer to the fears of the people now has to be postponed . what do you hope will be achieved at the summit over the next two days ? i hope they will keep a cool head and make wise decisions .
one should not panic in the face of a problem , but sit down in a quiet way , reflect , and find the appropriate solutions .
there is no use now in running .
i think we have to calm down and think about it , discuss it and then decide on the next steps .
i am sure there are going to be next steps to be taken , europe is going to advance , it is going to do so at a different pace as foreseen in the recent past , but it has no other choice than to move on .
the world around it is advancing , so if europe does not keep pace , it will be at a disadvantage to the rest of the world . tamsin walker interviewed viviane reding send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de can britain save europe ?

the figure first designed by karl peglau in 1961 had come to symbolize " ostalgie " - the revival of the east german aesthetic as cool kitsch - and when the reunited germany tried replacing him with a slimmed-down western version in 1997 , his fans rallied and saved him from certain death . an east-west stand-off his winning streak has shown no signs of letting up , and the 16-centimeter figure has become so profitable that he 's now at the heart of yet another dispute - one that some have seen as another east-west stand-off . two entrepreneurs from saxony and former west berlin took their fight over the marketing rights to the ampelmännchen to a leipzig court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim roßberg engineer joachim roßberg -lrb- photo -rrb- from zwickau , whose claim to the logo is that he was the only manufacturer of traffic lights in the former east germany , was being sued by designer markus heckhausen , who began incorporating the figure into products in 1995 .
he now sells over forty items , and told the court that he made 2 million euros last year with his ampelmännchen souvenirs . heckhausen - one of the initiators of the " save the amplemännchen " campaign ten years ago - argued that roßberg , who markets just six ampelmännchen products , was failing to make full use of his marketing rights .
legally , if no use of marketing rights is made for five years , the rights can be cancelled .
but roßberg insisted his business makes a tidy 50,000 euros a year . amicable agreement this week , the court proposed the rivals flesh out an amicable solution to the problem - and the unusual love triangle now seems to have a way of surviving . " money wo n't be changing hands , " said roßberg .
instead , he and heckhausen have decided to share and trade certain rights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus heckhausen " according to our agreement , we will simply exchange certain rights to the ampelmann and the newer ampelwoman , " heckhausen explained . roßberg will therefore continue to sell his best-known product , a liquor emblazoned with the logo - despite heckhausen 's scornful remark that " traffic regulations and alcohol are hardly compatible .

coach ricardo la volpe 's side will have to play more convincingly to advance . when jose fonseca climbed up to head in a cross and give his side a 2-1 lead over japan , the breath of relief from the mexican bench was almost audible . after playing a back-and-forth game for most of the first half and failing to solve the smaller japanese defense , fonseca 's score off of a gonzalo pineda pass in the 64th minute sent mexico off to a first match victory . up until that point , mexico had few opportunities after evening the score late in the first half .
though controlling the match at the beginning , la volpe 's side had a tough time breaking through the japanese defense . counter brings relief the small crowd of 21,000 in hanover 's stadium had something to cheer about early on as japan responded quickly on a counter .
akira kaji got free down the right side of the field and passed in to a streaking atsushi yanagisawa .
the midfielder was marked by mexico 's ricardo osorio , who actually deflected the ball into his own net after it skipped through yanagisawa 's legs .
the 1-0 lead was a surprise , but not without credit to the resilient japanese side .
mexico responded by not really responding at all .
the midfield continued having a tough time breaking down the defense , preferring to build up their attack slowly , rather than unsettling the japanese defenders with quick passes . mexico roars back mexican striker jared borgetti had a golden opportunity robbed by some good goalkeeping when his close range header was blocked off by japan 's small , but nimble goalie yoshikatsu kawaguchi . kawaguchi looked his size , though , on the goal that evened it up .
midfielder zinha sprung free on the left side of the penalty box and bent a nice shot into the upper right hand corner of the net that a diving kawaguchi was helpless to defend . slow to start in the second half , mexico finally found the key to the japanese defense that until then would not unlock .
the size difference between fonseca and his markers attracted the attention of pineda , who lofted a nice cross to him in the center , which the midfielder had no problem putting away . japan 's desperation attempts in the final phase of the game were easily shut down by mexico , which had finally found its footing .

coach ricardo la volpe 's side will have to play more convincingly to advance . when jose fonseca climbed up to head in a cross and give his side a 2-1 lead over japan , the breath of relief from the mexican bench was almost audible . after playing a back-and-forth game for most of the first half and failing to solve the smaller japanese defense , fonseca 's score off of a gonzalo pineda pass in the 64th minute sent mexico off to a first match victory . up until that point , mexico had few opportunities after evening the score late in the first half .
though controlling the match at the beginning , la volpe 's side had a tough time breaking through the japanese defense . counter brings relief the small crowd of 21,000 in hanover 's stadium had something to cheer about early on as japan responded quickly on a counter .
akira kaji got free down the right side of the field and passed in to a streaking atsushi yanagisawa .
the midfielder was marked by mexico 's ricardo osorio , who actually deflected the ball into his own net after it skipped through yanagisawa 's legs .
the 1-0 lead was a surprise , but not without credit to the resilient japanese side .
mexico responded by not really responding at all .
the midfield continued having a tough time breaking down the defense , preferring to build up their attack slowly , rather than unsettling the japanese defenders with quick passes . mexico roars back mexican striker jared borgetti had a golden opportunity robbed by some good goalkeeping when his close range header was blocked off by japan 's small , but nimble goalie yoshikatsu kawaguchi . kawaguchi looked his size , though , on the goal that evened it up .
midfielder zinha sprung free on the left side of the penalty box and bent a nice shot into the upper right hand corner of the net that a diving kawaguchi was helpless to defend . slow to start in the second half , mexico finally found the key to the japanese defense that until then would not unlock .
the size difference between fonseca and his markers attracted the attention of pineda , who lofted a nice cross to him in the center , which the midfielder had no problem putting away . japan 's desperation attempts in the final phase of the game were easily shut down by mexico , which had finally found its footing .

but who actually owns the marketing rights to this much-loved motif ? you name it , he 's been on it .
with bath mats , lampshades , vases , key-rings , t-shirts , mouse mats and coffee cups to choose from , you have n't been to berlin if you have n't brought home a souvenir emblazoned with the portly little figure with the trademark bowler hat . the " ampelmännchen " is an industry unto himself , and enjoys the privileged status of being one of the sole features of communist east germany to have survived the end of the iron curtain with his popularity unscathed . in the 1990s , he found himself at the heart of a full-blown rescue campaign when he was faced with possible extinction .
the figure first designed by karl peglau in 1961 had come to symbolize " ostalgie " - the revival of the east german aesthetic as cool kitsch - and when the reunited germany tried replacing him with a slimmed-down western version in 1997 , his fans rallied and saved him from certain death . an east-west stand-off his winning streak has shown no signs of letting up , and the 16-centimeter figure has become so profitable that he 's now at the heart of yet another dispute - one that some have seen as another east-west stand-off . two entrepreneurs from saxony and former west berlin took their fight over the marketing rights to the ampelmännchen to a leipzig court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim roßberg engineer joachim roßberg -lrb- photo -rrb- from zwickau , whose claim to the logo is that he was the only manufacturer of traffic lights in the former east germany , was being sued by designer markus heckhausen , who began incorporating the figure into products in 1995 .
he now sells over forty items , and told the court that he made 2 million euros last year with his ampelmännchen souvenirs . heckhausen - one of the initiators of the " save the amplemännchen " campaign ten years ago - argued that roßberg , who markets just six ampelmännchen products , was failing to make full use of his marketing rights .
legally , if no use of marketing rights is made for five years , the rights can be cancelled .
but roßberg insisted his business makes a tidy 50,000 euros a year . amicable agreement this week , the court proposed the rivals flesh out an amicable solution to the problem - and the unusual love triangle now seems to have a way of surviving . " money wo n't be changing hands , " said roßberg .
instead , he and heckhausen have decided to share and trade certain rights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus heckhausen " according to our agreement , we will simply exchange certain rights to the ampelmann and the newer ampelwoman , " heckhausen explained . roßberg will therefore continue to sell his best-known product , a liquor emblazoned with the logo - despite heckhausen 's scornful remark that " traffic regulations and alcohol are hardly compatible . " but despite such little squabbles , heckhausen is convinced the compromise will work .
" once again , the ampelmännchen has proved to be a positive symbol of reunification , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de touring east germany without the oppression thirteen years after the collapse of communist east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- , kitschy nostalgia for a lost culture still lives on in berlin .

coach ricardo la volpe 's side will have to play more convincingly to advance . when jose fonseca climbed up to head in a cross and give his side a 2-1 lead over japan , the breath of relief from the mexican bench was almost audible . after playing a back-and-forth game for most of the first half and failing to solve the smaller japanese defense , fonseca 's score off of a gonzalo pineda pass in the 64th minute sent mexico off to a first match victory . up until that point , mexico had few opportunities after evening the score late in the first half .
though controlling the match at the beginning , la volpe 's side had a tough time breaking through the japanese defense . counter brings relief the small crowd of 21,000 in hanover 's stadium had something to cheer about early on as japan responded quickly on a counter .
akira kaji got free down the right side of the field and passed in to a streaking atsushi yanagisawa .
the midfielder was marked by mexico 's ricardo osorio , who actually deflected the ball into his own net after it skipped through yanagisawa 's legs .
the 1-0 lead was a surprise , but not without credit to the resilient japanese side .
mexico responded by not really responding at all .

coach ricardo la volpe 's side will have to play more convincingly to advance . when jose fonseca climbed up to head in a cross and give his side a 2-1 lead over japan , the breath of relief from the mexican bench was almost audible . after playing a back-and-forth game for most of the first half and failing to solve the smaller japanese defense , fonseca 's score off of a gonzalo pineda pass in the 64th minute sent mexico off to a first match victory . up until that point , mexico had few opportunities after evening the score late in the first half .
though controlling the match at the beginning , la volpe 's side had a tough time breaking through the japanese defense . counter brings relief the small crowd of 21,000 in hanover 's stadium had something to cheer about early on as japan responded quickly on a counter .
akira kaji got free down the right side of the field and passed in to a streaking atsushi yanagisawa .
the midfielder was marked by mexico 's ricardo osorio , who actually deflected the ball into his own net after it skipped through yanagisawa 's legs .
the 1-0 lead was a surprise , but not without credit to the resilient japanese side .
mexico responded by not really responding at all .
the midfield continued having a tough time breaking down the defense , preferring to build up their attack slowly , rather than unsettling the japanese defenders with quick passes . mexico roars back mexican striker jared borgetti had a golden opportunity robbed by some good goalkeeping when his close range header was blocked off by japan 's small , but nimble goalie yoshikatsu kawaguchi . kawaguchi looked his size , though , on the goal that evened it up .

against world beaters like adriano , kaka , ronaldinho and the ascendent robinho , a greek side of hard-working , but unknown team players will have a difficult time of it .

his authoritarian style was exactly what a soccer federation ruled by nepotism , corruption and petty disputes needed .
rehhagel took a team of unspectacular individual players and formed them into a singular , compact side that confounded superior sides like france and portugal with their disciplined defense and dangerous counters .

42,000 fans watched a brazilian team that after this match is the squad to beat in the tournament . brazil provided the first clear-cut victory in the confederations cup with a 3-0 victory against greece .
the first three matches were all decided by one goal but coach carlos alberto parreira 's team sent a very clear message to the seven other teams that the selecao are hungry for another international title . " the team was well-balanced , " explained parreira .
" sometimes they played too complicated but it was in order how we played . " the brazilian play was definitely in order but unlike the first three matches , it took a while for the first goal to be scored .
and how it was scored set the tone for the remainder of the match because greece got in a situation they prefer not to be in , namely attacking soccer . after 40 minutes in which otto rehhagel 's euro 2004 champs played aggressively enough to hold the brazilians in check , adriano finally broke the gordian knot .
in a moment when the greeks failed to press the inter milan striker who then pulled up from 27 meters and launched a rocket that just squeezed inside the right post past a flying greek keeper antonis nikopolildis . second-half starts off disastrously in the first half , greece missed a golden opportunity in the first half-minute .
the second-half would start with a golden opportunity for brazil .
one they didn ’ t waste . bildunterschrift : greek goalkeeper antonios nikopolidis -lrb- right -rrb- looks as a shot from brazil 's robinho -lrb- left -rrb- hits the back of the net for the 2nd goal hertha berlin 's defender gilberto raced with the ball up the left sideline , crossed it through the greek penalty box where robinho -lrb- photo -rrb- , the replacement of superstar ronaldo , was waiting to place the ball in the net .
40 seconds into the second-half , greece were beaten . at this point , brazil could toy with otto rehhagel 's side like a cat with a wounded mouse .
the selecao handed the ball over to the greeks for the next ten minutes but when the euro champs were unable to take advantage of the brazilian gift , the world champs retook control . ronaldinho had a few good opportunities .
rubinho broke free occasionally and the achilles heel of the greek defense , the right side , was used continuously as a launching pad for attacks by the yellow-clad brazilians . midway through the second-half , a series of substitutions interrupted the flow of the match but important was the entrance of olympique lyon juninho pernambucano in the 77th minute . quality goal seals greece 's fate four minutes later , juninho stepped up to take a free-kick just outside the greek penalty box .
after all , the master of the free-kick ronaldinho had been taken out of the game .
but juninho plays at a level , if not equal , then very close to last year 's footballer of the year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil was head taller all night juninho bent the direct kick over the top of the greek wall , the ball dropped 2 meters in a millisecond , and nikopolidis could only watch as the leather fell into the back of the net .
the very real and classy greek defense of 2004 was transformed into something comparable to the best myths classic greek mythology . " the brazilians were clearly better , " commented rehhagel .
" all 11 players must give 110 % to beat a brazilian team and tonight we only gave about 50 % .
that was n't enough . " so the greeks , after a series of disappointing qualifying matches for next year 's world cup in germany , are finding out that rehhagel no longer has the midas touch .
brazil , on the other hand , was convincing after last week 's bitter 3-1 defeat to argentina in buenos aires .
understandably , they would like a chance to exact revenge against their south american rivals .
but before that they have two more matches to play . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mexico yawns past japan mexico edged japan on a second-half goal in a slow-paced match that featured few highlights .

42,000 fans watched a brazilian team that after this match is the squad to beat in the tournament . brazil provided the first clear-cut victory in the confederations cup with a 3-0 victory against greece .
the first three matches were all decided by one goal but coach carlos alberto parreira 's team sent a very clear message to the seven other teams that the selecao are hungry for another international title . " the team was well-balanced , " explained parreira .
" sometimes they played too complicated but it was in order how we played . " the brazilian play was definitely in order but unlike the first three matches , it took a while for the first goal to be scored .
and how it was scored set the tone for the remainder of the match because greece got in a situation they prefer not to be in , namely attacking soccer . after 40 minutes in which otto rehhagel 's euro 2004 champs played aggressively enough to hold the brazilians in check , adriano finally broke the gordian knot .
in a moment when the greeks failed to press the inter milan striker who then pulled up from 27 meters and launched a rocket that just squeezed inside the right post past a flying greek keeper antonis nikopolildis . second-half starts off disastrously in the first half , greece missed a golden opportunity in the first half-minute .
the second-half would start with a golden opportunity for brazil .
one they didn ’ t waste . bildunterschrift : greek goalkeeper antonios nikopolidis -lrb- right -rrb- looks as a shot from brazil 's robinho -lrb- left -rrb- hits the back of the net for the 2nd goal hertha berlin 's defender gilberto raced with the ball up the left sideline , crossed it through the greek penalty box where robinho -lrb- photo -rrb- , the replacement of superstar ronaldo , was waiting to place the ball in the net .
40 seconds into the second-half , greece were beaten . at this point , brazil could toy with otto rehhagel 's side like a cat with a wounded mouse .
the selecao handed the ball over to the greeks for the next ten minutes but when the euro champs were unable to take advantage of the brazilian gift , the world champs retook control . ronaldinho had a few good opportunities .
rubinho broke free occasionally and the achilles heel of the greek defense , the right side , was used continuously as a launching pad for attacks by the yellow-clad brazilians . midway through the second-half , a series of substitutions interrupted the flow of the match but important was the entrance of olympique lyon juninho pernambucano in the 77th minute . quality goal seals greece 's fate four minutes later , juninho stepped up to take a free-kick just outside the greek penalty box .
after all , the master of the free-kick ronaldinho had been taken out of the game .
but juninho plays at a level , if not equal , then very close to last year 's footballer of the year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil was head taller all night juninho bent the direct kick over the top of the greek wall , the ball dropped 2 meters in a millisecond , and nikopolidis could only watch as the leather fell into the back of the net .
the very real and classy greek defense of 2004 was transformed into something comparable to the best myths classic greek mythology . " the brazilians were clearly better , " commented rehhagel .
" all 11 players must give 110 % to beat a brazilian team and tonight we only gave about 50 % .
that was n't enough . " so the greeks , after a series of disappointing qualifying matches for next year 's world cup in germany , are finding out that rehhagel no longer has the midas touch .
brazil , on the other hand , was convincing after last week 's bitter 3-1 defeat to argentina in buenos aires .
understandably , they would like a chance to exact revenge against their south american rivals .

" i 'm going there with a willingness to reach an agreement , " he said , adding that his government was ready to work on a compromise as long as the result did n't lead to additional german payments that the country could not shoulder financially .

french president jacques chirac also said he had doubts about future expansion plans of the bloc .
he called for a special summit to discuss the future direction of the union . " can the union in this new situation really expand without having the proper institutions for it ? " he asked the fellow leaders in a prepared text .
" i think we need to discuss these important questions together .

the differences are too big , " he said .
" i 'm not optimistic about a deal . " at the end of the first day of the meeting , his prediction looked correct , since a budget deal seemed far away .
british prime minister tony blair has thus far refused to release his grip on the uk rebate , despite a last-minute offer by the eu presidency . luxembourg 's juncker suggested freezing , not cutting the british rebate , which was worth 5.3 billion euros last year and was projected to average 7.1 billion euros annually between 2007 and 2013 .

" there is absolutely no justification any longer for the british rebate , " the german leader said .
" britain is the sixth biggest per capita beneficiary of the eu budget but ranks far below that as a contributor .

to say ' the constitution is dead ' also discredits the german ' yes ' on the constitution , " said german chancellor gerhard schröder . but , at a pre-summit meeting outside brussels , " a vast majority " of conservative leaders favored suspending ratification of the charter , said european people 's party parliamentary chief hans-gert pöttering . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder , left , meets with luxembourg prime minister jean claude juncker luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , who holds the eu 's presidency , and eu commision chief jose barroso both " proposed suspending the process , " said pöttering . dutch europe minister atzo nicolai ruled out a new referendum on the spurned constitution , saying : " it is dead in the netherlands , this treaty . " the treaty must be ratified by every eu member to become effective , prompting swedish prime minister göran persson to question the use of carrying on as scheduled with a vote in his own country . " i want a clear message from france and the netherlands about how they will deal with their ' no ' votes .
-lrb- if -rrb- there is no clear message , i think we will also have a delay , " persson said .
danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen echoed the comments .
" we ca n't put the treaty to a vote in denmark if the text will afterwards be changed .
it does n't make sense .
it is a clear perequisite for continuing the process that we get this clarification , " he said .
quo vadis , europa ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from l-r german foreign minister joschka fischer , german chancellor gerhard schroeder , dutch prime minister jan-peter balkenende and austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel chat during the round table at the beginning of the two days european summit in brussels according to diplomats in brussels , all 25 member states were in agreement that the ratification process should be suspended until at least next year while they discuss the future direction of the european project .
french president jacques chirac also said he had doubts about future expansion plans of the bloc .
he called for a special summit to discuss the future direction of the union . " can the union in this new situation really expand without having the proper institutions for it ? " he asked the fellow leaders in a prepared text .
" i think we need to discuss these important questions together . " budget deadlock a deal on the eu 's 2007-2013 budget - blocked partly by britain 's refusal to surrender a hard-won rebate - would only be possible if all 25 members were ready to compromise , said schröder , who was gloomy about the prospects for an agreement . " i do n't think there will be a deal on the budget .
the differences are too big , " he said .
" i 'm not optimistic about a deal . " at the end of the first day of the meeting , his prediction looked correct , since a budget deal seemed far away .
british prime minister tony blair has thus far refused to release his grip on the uk rebate , despite a last-minute offer by the eu presidency . luxembourg 's juncker suggested freezing , not cutting the british rebate , which was worth 5.3 billion euros last year and was projected to average 7.1 billion euros annually between 2007 and 2013 .
any future reductions in the rebate would be tied to a reduction in eu agricultural aid after 2013 . but no country gave ground . farm subsidies vs. rebate britain is refusing to accept a change to its budget rebate without a rethink of eu farm subsidies that gobble up 40 percent of the entire eu budget .
the rebate , sancrosanct to britons across the political spectrum , has been in place since 1984 to compensate for the relatively small amount that britain reaps from the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn , left , gestures while speaking with british foreign secretary jack straw , center , and eu foreign policy chief javier solana foreign secretary jack straw set out britain 's stance as eu leaders voiced little hope of a breakthrough on the budget talks . " the proposals from the presidency are not acceptable to us , " straw said .
" that 's one of the reasons why there 's going to be difficulty " during the conclave , he told reporters . blair 's spokesman said the cabinet backed his refusal to give way on the rebate , secured by the iron-willed former british leader , margaret thatcher , in 1984 to compensate for the relatively small amount london received in eu farm aid . the rest of europe stepped up the pressure on blair , including germany . " there is absolutely no justification any longer for the british rebate , " the german leader said .
" britain is the sixth biggest per capita beneficiary of the eu budget but ranks far below that as a contributor . " blair , who takes over the eu presidency on july 1 , is pushing for a " fundamental debate " about the bloc 's future , including cap , which gives generous subsidies to farmers , especially those in france . upping the ante , a british spokesman said it was not essential for the summit to agree the 2007- 2013 spending plans - leaving open the prospect of it being delayed until after the upcoming british eu presidency . afp / dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " europe ca n't keep running " european leaders are gathering in brussels for a two-day summit to give the alliance new momentum .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : crisis in brussels a quick guide to the eu summit meet the eu 's deficit sinners eu 's billions to flow to familiar shores eu attempts to untie budget tangles europe -pipe- 16.06.2005 " europe ca n't keep running " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how embattled is europe really ?
european leaders are gathering in brussels for a two-day summit to give the alliance new momentum .
but can the eu extricate itself from its constitutional tangle ?
dw-world.de talked to commissioner viviane reding . the european union 's mid-year summit takes place against the backdrop of the french and dutch rejection of the constitution and the looming battle over the 2007-2013 budget .
dw-world interviewed viviane reding , eu commissioner for infomation society and media about what 's in stake for the future of the 25-member bloc . dw-world : commission president barroso has called for a period of reflection with regard to ratification of the constitution , what does that actually mean for the constitution ? reding : that means that the constitution is still alive and it is important that it is alive because it has been agreed upon by the political forces of all member states united in the convention , which means this agreement should be the basis for future discussions , but in the referenda procedures we saw that people were not informed about the content of the constitution and very often voted on the problems they have with europe or the problems they have with their governments .
so we think it will be very worthwhile to have a second look at this constitution and to present it to the public in a better way . how long might that take ? that will take as long as it takes until the time is right for a decision .
one can not foresee that ; it could be very short or it could also take several months . how is it possible to regain the faith of the people with regard to the european project ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viviane reding , eu commissioner for information society and media i have been listening to the citizens carefully during the last years , not only during the referenda period , and they have some problems with the way europe is being built .
the constitution was an answer to this problem , but people did n't understand it was a solution to their criticism .
so this is the message we have to bring across . is there a general level of fatigue among europeans when it comes to being members of a union ? i do n't think so .
when you see the figures , although the constitution was rejected by 55 percent of the french people , 70 percent of french people feel european and they want the european union .
they have a problem with the way this eu is developing .
it is also a fact that in the last 10 years the development of this union has been running at such a pace that nobody has been able to follow it - with the big enlargement and several reforms of the institutions .
i believe it is going too quickly for the normal people . how are you going to slow that down ? that is exactly why the president has said we have to calm down for a moment , we have to reflect , we have to explain that the criticism and the problems raised need a solution , and we have to explain how this solution is going to come about .
we can not keep running and running and running , and i think most of all , we must not continue enlarging europe without discussing this with our populations .
the last enlargement was not conceptualized by our citizens . so what does it mean for those countries lining up to join the union ? i think that they will need more time to join the eu than they probably thought in the beginning .
there is no timeframe in mind , this will be discussed according to the merits and the evolution of the different countries but i really feel very strongly that we have first to conceptualize and understand the implications of the last enlargement before we can go to further enlargement . what could have been done differently in order to make the last enlargement more successful ? information .
i have always been astonished at how well the citizens of the 10 new countries were informed about the europe of the 15 , and i was always shocked to see how little the citizens of the europe of 15 knew about the 10 newcomers .
it is not enough to have a big welcoming party , you have to explain the advantages and the dangers to the people , to explain what is being done in order to secure a smooth transition from ten to 15 , and now we are seeing the results .
many of our people have not understood the value and the advantages of enlargement and they are afraid of the pitfalls .
and all this is happening because nobody has ever taken the responsibility of explaining the enlargement to the citizens of the 15 countries . what would you say to those euroskeptics who are trumpeting that the eu is beginning to crumble ? that is wishful thinking and absolutely removed from reality .
europe is a reality and it has been since the world war ii .
even those who have a problem with european institutions today do n't have a problem with europe .
in a globalized world , the only way you can survive and keep your industry and economy strong , is by joining forces .
to have individual countries fighting monster constructions like india or like china would be absolutely ridiculous . would you then reject the idea that there is a will among individual states for a greater degree of sovereignty ? the national states gave up part of their sovereignty in order to share it with others and become more efficient .
foreign trade is one example where one commissioner is negotiating for the 25 .
could you imagine what would happen if the 25 were to negotiate individually ?
they would n't go anywhere .
it is important that we join forces where we need to , in order that each of us becomes more efficient .
there are many other levels of politics , such as taxation , where national states have kept their sovereignty , so it is also very difficult for the people to understand who is doing what in europe , and i do n't think that has been sufficiently explained .
the crux of the matter is that the new constitution sorted this division of labour out in a very very clear way , and it is a pity that this answer to the fears of the people now has to be postponed . what do you hope will be achieved at the summit over the next two days ? i hope they will keep a cool head and make wise decisions .
one should not panic in the face of a problem , but sit down in a quiet way , reflect , and find the appropriate solutions .
there is no use now in running .
i think we have to calm down and think about it , discuss it and then decide on the next steps .
i am sure there are going to be next steps to be taken , europe is going to advance , it is going to do so at a different pace as foreseen in the recent past , but it has no other choice than to move on .
the world around it is advancing , so if europe does not keep pace , it will be at a disadvantage to the rest of the world . tamsin walker interviewed viviane reding send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de can britain save europe ?

european leaders are gathering in brussels for a two-day summit to give the alliance new momentum .
but can the eu extricate itself from its constitutional tangle ?
dw-world.de talked to commissioner viviane reding . the european union 's mid-year summit takes place against the backdrop of the french and dutch rejection of the constitution and the looming battle over the 2007-2013 budget .
dw-world interviewed viviane reding , eu commissioner for infomation society and media about what 's in stake for the future of the 25-member bloc . dw-world : commission president barroso has called for a period of reflection with regard to ratification of the constitution , what does that actually mean for the constitution ? reding : that means that the constitution is still alive and it is important that it is alive because it has been agreed upon by the political forces of all member states united in the convention , which means this agreement should be the basis for future discussions , but in the referenda procedures we saw that people were not informed about the content of the constitution and very often voted on the problems they have with europe or the problems they have with their governments .
so we think it will be very worthwhile to have a second look at this constitution and to present it to the public in a better way . how long might that take ? that will take as long as it takes until the time is right for a decision .
one can not foresee that ; it could be very short or it could also take several months . how is it possible to regain the faith of the people with regard to the european project ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viviane reding , eu commissioner for information society and media i have been listening to the citizens carefully during the last years , not only during the referenda period , and they have some problems with the way europe is being built .
the constitution was an answer to this problem , but people did n't understand it was a solution to their criticism .
so this is the message we have to bring across . is there a general level of fatigue among europeans when it comes to being members of a union ? i do n't think so .
when you see the figures , although the constitution was rejected by 55 percent of the french people , 70 percent of french people feel european and they want the european union .
they have a problem with the way this eu is developing .
it is also a fact that in the last 10 years the development of this union has been running at such a pace that nobody has been able to follow it - with the big enlargement and several reforms of the institutions .
i believe it is going too quickly for the normal people . how are you going to slow that down ? that is exactly why the president has said we have to calm down for a moment , we have to reflect , we have to explain that the criticism and the problems raised need a solution , and we have to explain how this solution is going to come about .
we can not keep running and running and running , and i think most of all , we must not continue enlarging europe without discussing this with our populations .
the last enlargement was not conceptualized by our citizens . so what does it mean for those countries lining up to join the union ? i think that they will need more time to join the eu than they probably thought in the beginning .
there is no timeframe in mind , this will be discussed according to the merits and the evolution of the different countries but i really feel very strongly that we have first to conceptualize and understand the implications of the last enlargement before we can go to further enlargement . what could have been done differently in order to make the last enlargement more successful ? information .
i have always been astonished at how well the citizens of the 10 new countries were informed about the europe of the 15 , and i was always shocked to see how little the citizens of the europe of 15 knew about the 10 newcomers .
it is not enough to have a big welcoming party , you have to explain the advantages and the dangers to the people , to explain what is being done in order to secure a smooth transition from ten to 15 , and now we are seeing the results .
many of our people have not understood the value and the advantages of enlargement and they are afraid of the pitfalls .
and all this is happening because nobody has ever taken the responsibility of explaining the enlargement to the citizens of the 15 countries . what would you say to those euroskeptics who are trumpeting that the eu is beginning to crumble ? that is wishful thinking and absolutely removed from reality .
europe is a reality and it has been since the world war ii .
even those who have a problem with european institutions today do n't have a problem with europe .
in a globalized world , the only way you can survive and keep your industry and economy strong , is by joining forces .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 16.06.2005 brazil show otto who 's king großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek coach otto rehhagel was dethroned by brazil , 3-0 brazil opens the confederations cup with a dominating 3-0 victory over otto rehhagel 's european champs greece .
42,000 fans watched a brazilian team that after this match is the squad to beat in the tournament . brazil provided the first clear-cut victory in the confederations cup with a 3-0 victory against greece .
the first three matches were all decided by one goal but coach carlos alberto parreira 's team sent a very clear message to the seven other teams that the selecao are hungry for another international title . " the team was well-balanced , " explained parreira .
" sometimes they played too complicated but it was in order how we played . " the brazilian play was definitely in order but unlike the first three matches , it took a while for the first goal to be scored .
and how it was scored set the tone for the remainder of the match because greece got in a situation they prefer not to be in , namely attacking soccer . after 40 minutes in which otto rehhagel 's euro 2004 champs played aggressively enough to hold the brazilians in check , adriano finally broke the gordian knot .
in a moment when the greeks failed to press the inter milan striker who then pulled up from 27 meters and launched a rocket that just squeezed inside the right post past a flying greek keeper antonis nikopolildis . second-half starts off disastrously in the first half , greece missed a golden opportunity in the first half-minute .
the second-half would start with a golden opportunity for brazil .
one they didn ’ t waste . bildunterschrift : greek goalkeeper antonios nikopolidis -lrb- right -rrb- looks as a shot from brazil 's robinho -lrb- left -rrb- hits the back of the net for the 2nd goal hertha berlin 's defender gilberto raced with the ball up the left sideline , crossed it through the greek penalty box where robinho -lrb- photo -rrb- , the replacement of superstar ronaldo , was waiting to place the ball in the net .
40 seconds into the second-half , greece were beaten . at this point , brazil could toy with otto rehhagel 's side like a cat with a wounded mouse .
the selecao handed the ball over to the greeks for the next ten minutes but when the euro champs were unable to take advantage of the brazilian gift , the world champs retook control . ronaldinho had a few good opportunities .
rubinho broke free occasionally and the achilles heel of the greek defense , the right side , was used continuously as a launching pad for attacks by the yellow-clad brazilians . midway through the second-half , a series of substitutions interrupted the flow of the match but important was the entrance of olympique lyon juninho pernambucano in the 77th minute . quality goal seals greece 's fate four minutes later , juninho stepped up to take a free-kick just outside the greek penalty box .
after all , the master of the free-kick ronaldinho had been taken out of the game .
but juninho plays at a level , if not equal , then very close to last year 's footballer of the year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil was head taller all night juninho bent the direct kick over the top of the greek wall , the ball dropped 2 meters in a millisecond , and nikopolidis could only watch as the leather fell into the back of the net .
the very real and classy greek defense of 2004 was transformed into something comparable to the best myths classic greek mythology . " the brazilians were clearly better , " commented rehhagel .
" all 11 players must give 110 % to beat a brazilian team and tonight we only gave about 50 % .
that was n't enough . " so the greeks , after a series of disappointing qualifying matches for next year 's world cup in germany , are finding out that rehhagel no longer has the midas touch .
brazil , on the other hand , was convincing after last week 's bitter 3-1 defeat to argentina in buenos aires .
understandably , they would like a chance to exact revenge against their south american rivals .
but before that they have two more matches to play . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mexico yawns past japan mexico edged japan on a second-half goal in a slow-paced match that featured few highlights .

42,000 fans watched a brazilian team that after this match is the squad to beat in the tournament . brazil provided the first clear-cut victory in the confederations cup with a 3-0 victory against greece .
the first three matches were all decided by one goal but coach carlos alberto parreira 's team sent a very clear message to the seven other teams that the selecao are hungry for another international title . " the team was well-balanced , " explained parreira .
" sometimes they played too complicated but it was in order how we played . " the brazilian play was definitely in order but unlike the first three matches , it took a while for the first goal to be scored .
and how it was scored set the tone for the remainder of the match because greece got in a situation they prefer not to be in , namely attacking soccer . after 40 minutes in which otto rehhagel 's euro 2004 champs played aggressively enough to hold the brazilians in check , adriano finally broke the gordian knot .
in a moment when the greeks failed to press the inter milan striker who then pulled up from 27 meters and launched a rocket that just squeezed inside the right post past a flying greek keeper antonis nikopolildis . second-half starts off disastrously in the first half , greece missed a golden opportunity in the first half-minute .
the second-half would start with a golden opportunity for brazil .
one they didn ’ t waste . bildunterschrift : greek goalkeeper antonios nikopolidis -lrb- right -rrb- looks as a shot from brazil 's robinho -lrb- left -rrb- hits the back of the net for the 2nd goal hertha berlin 's defender gilberto raced with the ball up the left sideline , crossed it through the greek penalty box where robinho -lrb- photo -rrb- , the replacement of superstar ronaldo , was waiting to place the ball in the net .
40 seconds into the second-half , greece were beaten . at this point , brazil could toy with otto rehhagel 's side like a cat with a wounded mouse .
the selecao handed the ball over to the greeks for the next ten minutes but when the euro champs were unable to take advantage of the brazilian gift , the world champs retook control . ronaldinho had a few good opportunities .
rubinho broke free occasionally and the achilles heel of the greek defense , the right side , was used continuously as a launching pad for attacks by the yellow-clad brazilians . midway through the second-half , a series of substitutions interrupted the flow of the match but important was the entrance of olympique lyon juninho pernambucano in the 77th minute . quality goal seals greece 's fate four minutes later , juninho stepped up to take a free-kick just outside the greek penalty box .
after all , the master of the free-kick ronaldinho had been taken out of the game .
but juninho plays at a level , if not equal , then very close to last year 's footballer of the year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil was head taller all night juninho bent the direct kick over the top of the greek wall , the ball dropped 2 meters in a millisecond , and nikopolidis could only watch as the leather fell into the back of the net .
the very real and classy greek defense of 2004 was transformed into something comparable to the best myths classic greek mythology . " the brazilians were clearly better , " commented rehhagel .
" all 11 players must give 110 % to beat a brazilian team and tonight we only gave about 50 % .
that was n't enough . " so the greeks , after a series of disappointing qualifying matches for next year 's world cup in germany , are finding out that rehhagel no longer has the midas touch .
brazil , on the other hand , was convincing after last week 's bitter 3-1 defeat to argentina in buenos aires .

they agreed to suspend the ratification of the eu constitution . going into the crisis meeting in brussels , germany still clung to hope for the 25-member bloc 's planned charter , already ratified by its parliament .
" the constitutional treaty will be part of the eu 's future .
to say ' the constitution is dead ' also discredits the german ' yes ' on the constitution , " said german chancellor gerhard schröder . but , at a pre-summit meeting outside brussels , " a vast majority " of conservative leaders favored suspending ratification of the charter , said european people 's party parliamentary chief hans-gert pöttering . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder , left , meets with luxembourg prime minister jean claude juncker luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , who holds the eu 's presidency , and eu commision chief jose barroso both " proposed suspending the process , " said pöttering . dutch europe minister atzo nicolai ruled out a new referendum on the spurned constitution , saying : " it is dead in the netherlands , this treaty . " the treaty must be ratified by every eu member to become effective , prompting swedish prime minister göran persson to question the use of carrying on as scheduled with a vote in his own country . " i want a clear message from france and the netherlands about how they will deal with their ' no ' votes .
-lrb- if -rrb- there is no clear message , i think we will also have a delay , " persson said .
danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen echoed the comments .
" we ca n't put the treaty to a vote in denmark if the text will afterwards be changed .
it does n't make sense .
it is a clear perequisite for continuing the process that we get this clarification , " he said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from l-r german foreign minister joschka fischer , german chancellor gerhard schroeder , dutch prime minister jan-peter balkenende and austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel chat during the round table at the beginning of the two days european summit in brussels according to diplomats in brussels , all 25 member states were in agreement that the ratification process should be suspended until at least next year while they discuss the future direction of the european project .
french president jacques chirac also said he had doubts about future expansion plans of the bloc .
he called for a special summit to discuss the future direction of the union . " can the union in this new situation really expand without having the proper institutions for it ? " he asked the fellow leaders in a prepared text .
" i think we need to discuss these important questions together . " budget deadlock a deal on the eu 's 2007-2013 budget - blocked partly by britain 's refusal to surrender a hard-won rebate - would only be possible if all 25 members were ready to compromise , said schröder , who was gloomy about the prospects for an agreement . " i do n't think there will be a deal on the budget .
the differences are too big , " he said .
" i 'm not optimistic about a deal . " at the end of the first day of the meeting , his prediction looked correct , since a budget deal seemed far away .
british prime minister tony blair has thus far refused to release his grip on the uk rebate , despite a last-minute offer by the eu presidency . luxembourg 's juncker suggested freezing , not cutting the british rebate , which was worth 5.3 billion euros last year and was projected to average 7.1 billion euros annually between 2007 and 2013 .
any future reductions in the rebate would be tied to a reduction in eu agricultural aid after 2013 . but no country gave ground . farm subsidies vs. rebate britain is refusing to accept a change to its budget rebate without a rethink of eu farm subsidies that gobble up 40 percent of the entire eu budget .
the rebate , sancrosanct to britons across the political spectrum , has been in place since 1984 to compensate for the relatively small amount that britain reaps from the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn , left , gestures while speaking with british foreign secretary jack straw , center , and eu foreign policy chief javier solana foreign secretary jack straw set out britain 's stance as eu leaders voiced little hope of a breakthrough on the budget talks . " the proposals from the presidency are not acceptable to us , " straw said .
" that 's one of the reasons why there 's going to be difficulty " during the conclave , he told reporters . blair 's spokesman said the cabinet backed his refusal to give way on the rebate , secured by the iron-willed former british leader , margaret thatcher , in 1984 to compensate for the relatively small amount london received in eu farm aid . the rest of europe stepped up the pressure on blair , including germany . " there is absolutely no justification any longer for the british rebate , " the german leader said .
" britain is the sixth biggest per capita beneficiary of the eu budget but ranks far below that as a contributor . " blair , who takes over the eu presidency on july 1 , is pushing for a " fundamental debate " about the bloc 's future , including cap , which gives generous subsidies to farmers , especially those in france . upping the ante , a british spokesman said it was not essential for the summit to agree the 2007- 2013 spending plans - leaving open the prospect of it being delayed until after the upcoming british eu presidency . afp / dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " europe ca n't keep running " european leaders are gathering in brussels for a two-day summit to give the alliance new momentum .

the 1-0 lead was a surprise , but not without credit to the resilient japanese side .

midfielder zinha sprung free on the left side of the penalty box and bent a nice shot into the upper right hand corner of the net that a diving kawaguchi was helpless to defend . slow to start in the second half , mexico finally found the key to the japanese defense that until then would not unlock .
the size difference between fonseca and his markers attracted the attention of pineda , who lofted a nice cross to him in the center , which the midfielder had no problem putting away . japan 's desperation attempts in the final phase of the game were easily shut down by mexico , which had finally found its footing .

42,000 fans watched a brazilian team that after this match is the squad to beat in the tournament . brazil provided the first clear-cut victory in the confederations cup with a 3-0 victory against greece .
the first three matches were all decided by one goal but coach carlos alberto parreira 's team sent a very clear message to the seven other teams that the selecao are hungry for another international title . " the team was well-balanced , " explained parreira .
" sometimes they played too complicated but it was in order how we played . " the brazilian play was definitely in order but unlike the first three matches , it took a while for the first goal to be scored .
and how it was scored set the tone for the remainder of the match because greece got in a situation they prefer not to be in , namely attacking soccer . after 40 minutes in which otto rehhagel 's euro 2004 champs played aggressively enough to hold the brazilians in check , adriano finally broke the gordian knot .
in a moment when the greeks failed to press the inter milan striker who then pulled up from 27 meters and launched a rocket that just squeezed inside the right post past a flying greek keeper antonis nikopolildis . second-half starts off disastrously in the first half , greece missed a golden opportunity in the first half-minute .
the second-half would start with a golden opportunity for brazil .
one they didn ’ t waste . bildunterschrift : greek goalkeeper antonios nikopolidis -lrb- right -rrb- looks as a shot from brazil 's robinho -lrb- left -rrb- hits the back of the net for the 2nd goal hertha berlin 's defender gilberto raced with the ball up the left sideline , crossed it through the greek penalty box where robinho -lrb- photo -rrb- , the replacement of superstar ronaldo , was waiting to place the ball in the net .
40 seconds into the second-half , greece were beaten . at this point , brazil could toy with otto rehhagel 's side like a cat with a wounded mouse .
the selecao handed the ball over to the greeks for the next ten minutes but when the euro champs were unable to take advantage of the brazilian gift , the world champs retook control . ronaldinho had a few good opportunities .
rubinho broke free occasionally and the achilles heel of the greek defense , the right side , was used continuously as a launching pad for attacks by the yellow-clad brazilians . midway through the second-half , a series of substitutions interrupted the flow of the match but important was the entrance of olympique lyon juninho pernambucano in the 77th minute . quality goal seals greece 's fate four minutes later , juninho stepped up to take a free-kick just outside the greek penalty box .
after all , the master of the free-kick ronaldinho had been taken out of the game .
but juninho plays at a level , if not equal , then very close to last year 's footballer of the year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil was head taller all night juninho bent the direct kick over the top of the greek wall , the ball dropped 2 meters in a millisecond , and nikopolidis could only watch as the leather fell into the back of the net .
the very real and classy greek defense of 2004 was transformed into something comparable to the best myths classic greek mythology . " the brazilians were clearly better , " commented rehhagel .
" all 11 players must give 110 % to beat a brazilian team and tonight we only gave about 50 % .
that was n't enough . " so the greeks , after a series of disappointing qualifying matches for next year 's world cup in germany , are finding out that rehhagel no longer has the midas touch .
brazil , on the other hand , was convincing after last week 's bitter 3-1 defeat to argentina in buenos aires .

in leading greece to the european championships , he silenced his most vociferous critics at home , and reached god status in his adopted one . otto rehhagel is promising a soccer party tonight when his greek side takes on 2002 world cup winners brazil in the newly refurbished leipzig stadium .
" we 're going to play freely and with spirit and hopefully we can do ourselves proud , " he said ahead of tonight 's premiere clash in the second group .
against world beaters like adriano , kaka , ronaldinho and the ascendent robinho , a greek side of hard-working , but unknown team players will have a difficult time of it .
after stunning the world by improbably beating france , the czech republic and then portugal to win the 2004 european championships , greece will have to prove it is better than the faltering world cup qualifying campaign it has waged so far -lrb- the greeks are in danger of missing out on the world cup , currently third behind ukraine and turkey -rrb- .
but chances are good that rehhagel will be smiling at the end of the match , no matter what the outcome .
the confederations cup tournament is a sort of victorious homecoming parade for the german coach who has been consistently passed over for the national team job in germany .
the architect of the impossible a tough defender during his playing career , rehhagel became a staunch advocate of a conservative , defense-minded playing style as a coach - to astounding success .
the 66-year-old won the german championship three times , the last with a team that a year before had played in the second division .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freedom to call all of the shots but his straight talk and controlling hand were too much for some german soccer functionaries , and his tactical style considered too throwback at a time when germany wanted to join the rest of the world in employing modern playing styles .
what did n't work for germany , worked for greece .
the country 's sports journalists have credited the national team 's amazing turnaround -lrb- they had competed in two international tournaments in as many decades , and did n't win one game -rrb- to the man from essen .
his authoritarian style was exactly what a soccer federation ruled by nepotism , corruption and petty disputes needed .
rehhagel took a team of unspectacular individual players and formed them into a singular , compact side that confounded superior sides like france and portugal with their disciplined defense and dangerous counters .
" rehhagel respects his players , " said midfielder vasilis tsiartas , in an interview with die welt newspaper .
" he knows how to deal with us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehhagel , here with striker angelos charisteas , " knows how to deal with players " underestimated , but struggling now , he 's hoping his team - largely the same one he took to portugal - will be able to repeat its success .
" they 're european champions for a reason , " said brazilian coach carlos alberto parreira .
" underestimate them at your own peril . "
more is at stake than just the cup , however .
observers say greece needs to use the tournament to find its form quickly , before missing its last chances to return to germany next year to play in the world cup . following his team 's championship win , rehhagel was offered a guarantee to compete in 2006 - as coach of the german side .
" rehhakles " as the german papers dubbed him , declined .

they agreed to suspend the ratification of the eu constitution . going into the crisis meeting in brussels , germany still clung to hope for the 25-member bloc 's planned charter , already ratified by its parliament .
" the constitutional treaty will be part of the eu 's future .
to say ' the constitution is dead ' also discredits the german ' yes ' on the constitution , " said german chancellor gerhard schröder . but , at a pre-summit meeting outside brussels , " a vast majority " of conservative leaders favored suspending ratification of the charter , said european people 's party parliamentary chief hans-gert pöttering . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder , left , meets with luxembourg prime minister jean claude juncker luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , who holds the eu 's presidency , and eu commision chief jose barroso both " proposed suspending the process , " said pöttering . dutch europe minister atzo nicolai ruled out a new referendum on the spurned constitution , saying : " it is dead in the netherlands , this treaty . " the treaty must be ratified by every eu member to become effective , prompting swedish prime minister göran persson to question the use of carrying on as scheduled with a vote in his own country . " i want a clear message from france and the netherlands about how they will deal with their ' no ' votes .
-lrb- if -rrb- there is no clear message , i think we will also have a delay , " persson said .
danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen echoed the comments .
" we ca n't put the treaty to a vote in denmark if the text will afterwards be changed .
it does n't make sense .
it is a clear perequisite for continuing the process that we get this clarification , " he said .
quo vadis , europa ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from l-r german foreign minister joschka fischer , german chancellor gerhard schroeder , dutch prime minister jan-peter balkenende and austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel chat during the round table at the beginning of the two days european summit in brussels according to diplomats in brussels , all 25 member states were in agreement that the ratification process should be suspended until at least next year while they discuss the future direction of the european project .
french president jacques chirac also said he had doubts about future expansion plans of the bloc .
he called for a special summit to discuss the future direction of the union . " can the union in this new situation really expand without having the proper institutions for it ? " he asked the fellow leaders in a prepared text .
" i think we need to discuss these important questions together . " budget deadlock a deal on the eu 's 2007-2013 budget - blocked partly by britain 's refusal to surrender a hard-won rebate - would only be possible if all 25 members were ready to compromise , said schröder , who was gloomy about the prospects for an agreement . " i do n't think there will be a deal on the budget .
the differences are too big , " he said .
" i 'm not optimistic about a deal . " at the end of the first day of the meeting , his prediction looked correct , since a budget deal seemed far away .
british prime minister tony blair has thus far refused to release his grip on the uk rebate , despite a last-minute offer by the eu presidency . luxembourg 's juncker suggested freezing , not cutting the british rebate , which was worth 5.3 billion euros last year and was projected to average 7.1 billion euros annually between 2007 and 2013 .
any future reductions in the rebate would be tied to a reduction in eu agricultural aid after 2013 . but no country gave ground . farm subsidies vs. rebate britain is refusing to accept a change to its budget rebate without a rethink of eu farm subsidies that gobble up 40 percent of the entire eu budget .
the rebate , sancrosanct to britons across the political spectrum , has been in place since 1984 to compensate for the relatively small amount that britain reaps from the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn , left , gestures while speaking with british foreign secretary jack straw , center , and eu foreign policy chief javier solana foreign secretary jack straw set out britain 's stance as eu leaders voiced little hope of a breakthrough on the budget talks . " the proposals from the presidency are not acceptable to us , " straw said .
" that 's one of the reasons why there 's going to be difficulty " during the conclave , he told reporters . blair 's spokesman said the cabinet backed his refusal to give way on the rebate , secured by the iron-willed former british leader , margaret thatcher , in 1984 to compensate for the relatively small amount london received in eu farm aid . the rest of europe stepped up the pressure on blair , including germany . " there is absolutely no justification any longer for the british rebate , " the german leader said .
" britain is the sixth biggest per capita beneficiary of the eu budget but ranks far below that as a contributor . " blair , who takes over the eu presidency on july 1 , is pushing for a " fundamental debate " about the bloc 's future , including cap , which gives generous subsidies to farmers , especially those in france . upping the ante , a british spokesman said it was not essential for the summit to agree the 2007- 2013 spending plans - leaving open the prospect of it being delayed until after the upcoming british eu presidency . afp / dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " europe ca n't keep running " european leaders are gathering in brussels for a two-day summit to give the alliance new momentum .

" i 'm going there with a willingness to reach an agreement , " he said , adding that his government was ready to work on a compromise as long as the result did n't lead to additional german payments that the country could not shoulder financially . " it would be wonderful if the signal from brussels would be that the eu is capable to act , " he said , referring to the 25-member bloc 's ongoing crisis as french and dutch voters rejected the proposed eu constitution and states have failed to reach a solution for the eu budget for 2007 to 2013 . british rebate unjust ? one of the main problems in the latter matter is that britain still refuses to budge on a decade-old , billion-euro rebate it was granted as the country does not profit as much from the eu 's agricultural subsidies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and blair are not getting along so well these days " the rebate has no real justification any more , " schröder said and attacked opposition leader angela merkel and his challenger in the upcoming elections for reportedly backing british prime minister tony blair on the rebate .
merkel refused to comment on this during her reply . sticking to the constitution on the question of the eu constitution , schröder said the ratification process should be continued despite the french and dutch " nos " and the british decision to postpone a referendum .
schröder said the matter should be dealt with during the austrian eu presidency in the first part of 2006 , when more states have had a chance to decide on the treaty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- left -rrb- and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan in the turkish capital ankara in february 2004 he also criticized the opposition christian democrats for again questioning membership negotiations with turkey .

european leaders are gathering in brussels for a two-day summit to give the alliance new momentum .
but can the eu extricate itself from its constitutional tangle ?
dw-world.de talked to commissioner viviane reding . the european union 's mid-year summit takes place against the backdrop of the french and dutch rejection of the constitution and the looming battle over the 2007-2013 budget .
dw-world interviewed viviane reding , eu commissioner for infomation society and media about what 's in stake for the future of the 25-member bloc . dw-world : commission president barroso has called for a period of reflection with regard to ratification of the constitution , what does that actually mean for the constitution ? reding : that means that the constitution is still alive and it is important that it is alive because it has been agreed upon by the political forces of all member states united in the convention , which means this agreement should be the basis for future discussions , but in the referenda procedures we saw that people were not informed about the content of the constitution and very often voted on the problems they have with europe or the problems they have with their governments .
so we think it will be very worthwhile to have a second look at this constitution and to present it to the public in a better way . how long might that take ? that will take as long as it takes until the time is right for a decision .
one can not foresee that ; it could be very short or it could also take several months . how is it possible to regain the faith of the people with regard to the european project ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viviane reding , eu commissioner for information society and media i have been listening to the citizens carefully during the last years , not only during the referenda period , and they have some problems with the way europe is being built .
the constitution was an answer to this problem , but people did n't understand it was a solution to their criticism .
so this is the message we have to bring across . is there a general level of fatigue among europeans when it comes to being members of a union ? i do n't think so .
when you see the figures , although the constitution was rejected by 55 percent of the french people , 70 percent of french people feel european and they want the european union .
they have a problem with the way this eu is developing .
it is also a fact that in the last 10 years the development of this union has been running at such a pace that nobody has been able to follow it - with the big enlargement and several reforms of the institutions .
i believe it is going too quickly for the normal people . how are you going to slow that down ? that is exactly why the president has said we have to calm down for a moment , we have to reflect , we have to explain that the criticism and the problems raised need a solution , and we have to explain how this solution is going to come about .
we can not keep running and running and running , and i think most of all , we must not continue enlarging europe without discussing this with our populations .
the last enlargement was not conceptualized by our citizens . so what does it mean for those countries lining up to join the union ? i think that they will need more time to join the eu than they probably thought in the beginning .
there is no timeframe in mind , this will be discussed according to the merits and the evolution of the different countries but i really feel very strongly that we have first to conceptualize and understand the implications of the last enlargement before we can go to further enlargement . what could have been done differently in order to make the last enlargement more successful ? information .
i have always been astonished at how well the citizens of the 10 new countries were informed about the europe of the 15 , and i was always shocked to see how little the citizens of the europe of 15 knew about the 10 newcomers .
it is not enough to have a big welcoming party , you have to explain the advantages and the dangers to the people , to explain what is being done in order to secure a smooth transition from ten to 15 , and now we are seeing the results .
many of our people have not understood the value and the advantages of enlargement and they are afraid of the pitfalls .
and all this is happening because nobody has ever taken the responsibility of explaining the enlargement to the citizens of the 15 countries . what would you say to those euroskeptics who are trumpeting that the eu is beginning to crumble ? that is wishful thinking and absolutely removed from reality .
europe is a reality and it has been since the world war ii .
even those who have a problem with european institutions today do n't have a problem with europe .
in a globalized world , the only way you can survive and keep your industry and economy strong , is by joining forces .
to have individual countries fighting monster constructions like india or like china would be absolutely ridiculous . would you then reject the idea that there is a will among individual states for a greater degree of sovereignty ? the national states gave up part of their sovereignty in order to share it with others and become more efficient .
foreign trade is one example where one commissioner is negotiating for the 25 .
could you imagine what would happen if the 25 were to negotiate individually ?
they would n't go anywhere .
it is important that we join forces where we need to , in order that each of us becomes more efficient .
there are many other levels of politics , such as taxation , where national states have kept their sovereignty , so it is also very difficult for the people to understand who is doing what in europe , and i do n't think that has been sufficiently explained .
the crux of the matter is that the new constitution sorted this division of labour out in a very very clear way , and it is a pity that this answer to the fears of the people now has to be postponed . what do you hope will be achieved at the summit over the next two days ? i hope they will keep a cool head and make wise decisions .
one should not panic in the face of a problem , but sit down in a quiet way , reflect , and find the appropriate solutions .
there is no use now in running .
i think we have to calm down and think about it , discuss it and then decide on the next steps .
i am sure there are going to be next steps to be taken , europe is going to advance , it is going to do so at a different pace as foreseen in the recent past , but it has no other choice than to move on .
the world around it is advancing , so if europe does not keep pace , it will be at a disadvantage to the rest of the world . tamsin walker interviewed viviane reding send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de can britain save europe ?

they agreed to suspend the ratification of the eu constitution . going into the crisis meeting in brussels , germany still clung to hope for the 25-member bloc 's planned charter , already ratified by its parliament .
" the constitutional treaty will be part of the eu 's future .

quo vadis , europa ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from l-r german foreign minister joschka fischer , german chancellor gerhard schroeder , dutch prime minister jan-peter balkenende and austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel chat during the round table at the beginning of the two days european summit in brussels according to diplomats in brussels , all 25 member states were in agreement that the ratification process should be suspended until at least next year while they discuss the future direction of the european project .
french president jacques chirac also said he had doubts about future expansion plans of the bloc .
he called for a special summit to discuss the future direction of the union . " can the union in this new situation really expand without having the proper institutions for it ? " he asked the fellow leaders in a prepared text .
" i think we need to discuss these important questions together . " budget deadlock a deal on the eu 's 2007-2013 budget - blocked partly by britain 's refusal to surrender a hard-won rebate - would only be possible if all 25 members were ready to compromise , said schröder , who was gloomy about the prospects for an agreement . " i do n't think there will be a deal on the budget .
the differences are too big , " he said .
" i 'm not optimistic about a deal . " at the end of the first day of the meeting , his prediction looked correct , since a budget deal seemed far away .
british prime minister tony blair has thus far refused to release his grip on the uk rebate , despite a last-minute offer by the eu presidency . luxembourg 's juncker suggested freezing , not cutting the british rebate , which was worth 5.3 billion euros last year and was projected to average 7.1 billion euros annually between 2007 and 2013 .
any future reductions in the rebate would be tied to a reduction in eu agricultural aid after 2013 . but no country gave ground . farm subsidies vs. rebate britain is refusing to accept a change to its budget rebate without a rethink of eu farm subsidies that gobble up 40 percent of the entire eu budget .
the rebate , sancrosanct to britons across the political spectrum , has been in place since 1984 to compensate for the relatively small amount that britain reaps from the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn , left , gestures while speaking with british foreign secretary jack straw , center , and eu foreign policy chief javier solana foreign secretary jack straw set out britain 's stance as eu leaders voiced little hope of a breakthrough on the budget talks . " the proposals from the presidency are not acceptable to us , " straw said .
" that 's one of the reasons why there 's going to be difficulty " during the conclave , he told reporters . blair 's spokesman said the cabinet backed his refusal to give way on the rebate , secured by the iron-willed former british leader , margaret thatcher , in 1984 to compensate for the relatively small amount london received in eu farm aid . the rest of europe stepped up the pressure on blair , including germany . " there is absolutely no justification any longer for the british rebate , " the german leader said .
" britain is the sixth biggest per capita beneficiary of the eu budget but ranks far below that as a contributor . " blair , who takes over the eu presidency on july 1 , is pushing for a " fundamental debate " about the bloc 's future , including cap , which gives generous subsidies to farmers , especially those in france . upping the ante , a british spokesman said it was not essential for the summit to agree the 2007- 2013 spending plans - leaving open the prospect of it being delayed until after the upcoming british eu presidency . afp / dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " europe ca n't keep running " european leaders are gathering in brussels for a two-day summit to give the alliance new momentum .

" budget deadlock a deal on the eu 's 2007-2013 budget - blocked partly by britain 's refusal to surrender a hard-won rebate - would only be possible if all 25 members were ready to compromise , said schröder , who was gloomy about the prospects for an agreement . " i do n't think there will be a deal on the budget .
the differences are too big , " he said .
" i 'm not optimistic about a deal . " at the end of the first day of the meeting , his prediction looked correct , since a budget deal seemed far away .
british prime minister tony blair has thus far refused to release his grip on the uk rebate , despite a last-minute offer by the eu presidency . luxembourg 's juncker suggested freezing , not cutting the british rebate , which was worth 5.3 billion euros last year and was projected to average 7.1 billion euros annually between 2007 and 2013 .
any future reductions in the rebate would be tied to a reduction in eu agricultural aid after 2013 . but no country gave ground . farm subsidies vs. rebate britain is refusing to accept a change to its budget rebate without a rethink of eu farm subsidies that gobble up 40 percent of the entire eu budget .
the rebate , sancrosanct to britons across the political spectrum , has been in place since 1984 to compensate for the relatively small amount that britain reaps from the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn , left , gestures while speaking with british foreign secretary jack straw , center , and eu foreign policy chief javier solana foreign secretary jack straw set out britain 's stance as eu leaders voiced little hope of a breakthrough on the budget talks . " the proposals from the presidency are not acceptable to us , " straw said .
" that 's one of the reasons why there 's going to be difficulty " during the conclave , he told reporters . blair 's spokesman said the cabinet backed his refusal to give way on the rebate , secured by the iron-willed former british leader , margaret thatcher , in 1984 to compensate for the relatively small amount london received in eu farm aid . the rest of europe stepped up the pressure on blair , including germany . " there is absolutely no justification any longer for the british rebate , " the german leader said .
" britain is the sixth biggest per capita beneficiary of the eu budget but ranks far below that as a contributor . " blair , who takes over the eu presidency on july 1 , is pushing for a " fundamental debate " about the bloc 's future , including cap , which gives generous subsidies to farmers , especially those in france . upping the ante , a british spokesman said it was not essential for the summit to agree the 2007- 2013 spending plans - leaving open the prospect of it being delayed until after the upcoming british eu presidency . afp / dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " europe ca n't keep running " european leaders are gathering in brussels for a two-day summit to give the alliance new momentum .

in leading greece to the european championships , he silenced his most vociferous critics at home , and reached god status in his adopted one . otto rehhagel is promising a soccer party tonight when his greek side takes on 2002 world cup winners brazil in the newly refurbished leipzig stadium .
" we 're going to play freely and with spirit and hopefully we can do ourselves proud , " he said ahead of tonight 's premiere clash in the second group .
against world beaters like adriano , kaka , ronaldinho and the ascendent robinho , a greek side of hard-working , but unknown team players will have a difficult time of it .
after stunning the world by improbably beating france , the czech republic and then portugal to win the 2004 european championships , greece will have to prove it is better than the faltering world cup qualifying campaign it has waged so far -lrb- the greeks are in danger of missing out on the world cup , currently third behind ukraine and turkey -rrb- .
but chances are good that rehhagel will be smiling at the end of the match , no matter what the outcome .
the confederations cup tournament is a sort of victorious homecoming parade for the german coach who has been consistently passed over for the national team job in germany .
the architect of the impossible a tough defender during his playing career , rehhagel became a staunch advocate of a conservative , defense-minded playing style as a coach - to astounding success .
the 66-year-old won the german championship three times , the last with a team that a year before had played in the second division .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freedom to call all of the shots but his straight talk and controlling hand were too much for some german soccer functionaries , and his tactical style considered too throwback at a time when germany wanted to join the rest of the world in employing modern playing styles .
what did n't work for germany , worked for greece .
the country 's sports journalists have credited the national team 's amazing turnaround -lrb- they had competed in two international tournaments in as many decades , and did n't win one game -rrb- to the man from essen .
his authoritarian style was exactly what a soccer federation ruled by nepotism , corruption and petty disputes needed .
rehhagel took a team of unspectacular individual players and formed them into a singular , compact side that confounded superior sides like france and portugal with their disciplined defense and dangerous counters .
" rehhagel respects his players , " said midfielder vasilis tsiartas , in an interview with die welt newspaper .
" he knows how to deal with us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehhagel , here with striker angelos charisteas , " knows how to deal with players " underestimated , but struggling now , he 's hoping his team - largely the same one he took to portugal - will be able to repeat its success .
" they 're european champions for a reason , " said brazilian coach carlos alberto parreira .
" underestimate them at your own peril . "
more is at stake than just the cup , however .
observers say greece needs to use the tournament to find its form quickly , before missing its last chances to return to germany next year to play in the world cup . following his team 's championship win , rehhagel was offered a guarantee to compete in 2006 - as coach of the german side .
" rehhakles " as the german papers dubbed him , declined .
the reason ?
he said he wanted to finish what he started . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de coaches wrapped up in mini world cup even though only eight teams are invited , the confederations cup , little brother to the world cup 's 32 teams , is a big enough title to keep brazilian players from being able to enjoy the summer holidays . -lrb- may 12 , 2005 -rrb- dfb struggles to find coach after rehhagel spurn with otto rehhagel declining the german football association ’ s -lrb- dfb -rrb- offer to make him national coach , only two candidates remain for the top job : guus hiddink and lothas matthäus – and even they are long shots .

to say ' the constitution is dead ' also discredits the german ' yes ' on the constitution , " said german chancellor gerhard schröder . but , at a pre-summit meeting outside brussels , " a vast majority " of conservative leaders favored suspending ratification of the charter , said european people 's party parliamentary chief hans-gert pöttering . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder , left , meets with luxembourg prime minister jean claude juncker luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , who holds the eu 's presidency , and eu commision chief jose barroso both " proposed suspending the process , " said pöttering . dutch europe minister atzo nicolai ruled out a new referendum on the spurned constitution , saying : " it is dead in the netherlands , this treaty . " the treaty must be ratified by every eu member to become effective , prompting swedish prime minister göran persson to question the use of carrying on as scheduled with a vote in his own country . " i want a clear message from france and the netherlands about how they will deal with their ' no ' votes .
-lrb- if -rrb- there is no clear message , i think we will also have a delay , " persson said .
danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen echoed the comments .
" we ca n't put the treaty to a vote in denmark if the text will afterwards be changed .
it does n't make sense .
it is a clear perequisite for continuing the process that we get this clarification , " he said .
quo vadis , europa ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from l-r german foreign minister joschka fischer , german chancellor gerhard schroeder , dutch prime minister jan-peter balkenende and austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel chat during the round table at the beginning of the two days european summit in brussels according to diplomats in brussels , all 25 member states were in agreement that the ratification process should be suspended until at least next year while they discuss the future direction of the european project .
french president jacques chirac also said he had doubts about future expansion plans of the bloc .
he called for a special summit to discuss the future direction of the union . " can the union in this new situation really expand without having the proper institutions for it ? " he asked the fellow leaders in a prepared text .
" i think we need to discuss these important questions together . " budget deadlock a deal on the eu 's 2007-2013 budget - blocked partly by britain 's refusal to surrender a hard-won rebate - would only be possible if all 25 members were ready to compromise , said schröder , who was gloomy about the prospects for an agreement . " i do n't think there will be a deal on the budget .
the differences are too big , " he said .
" i 'm not optimistic about a deal . " at the end of the first day of the meeting , his prediction looked correct , since a budget deal seemed far away .
british prime minister tony blair has thus far refused to release his grip on the uk rebate , despite a last-minute offer by the eu presidency . luxembourg 's juncker suggested freezing , not cutting the british rebate , which was worth 5.3 billion euros last year and was projected to average 7.1 billion euros annually between 2007 and 2013 .
any future reductions in the rebate would be tied to a reduction in eu agricultural aid after 2013 . but no country gave ground . farm subsidies vs. rebate britain is refusing to accept a change to its budget rebate without a rethink of eu farm subsidies that gobble up 40 percent of the entire eu budget .
the rebate , sancrosanct to britons across the political spectrum , has been in place since 1984 to compensate for the relatively small amount that britain reaps from the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn , left , gestures while speaking with british foreign secretary jack straw , center , and eu foreign policy chief javier solana foreign secretary jack straw set out britain 's stance as eu leaders voiced little hope of a breakthrough on the budget talks . " the proposals from the presidency are not acceptable to us , " straw said .
" that 's one of the reasons why there 's going to be difficulty " during the conclave , he told reporters . blair 's spokesman said the cabinet backed his refusal to give way on the rebate , secured by the iron-willed former british leader , margaret thatcher , in 1984 to compensate for the relatively small amount london received in eu farm aid . the rest of europe stepped up the pressure on blair , including germany . " there is absolutely no justification any longer for the british rebate , " the german leader said .
" britain is the sixth biggest per capita beneficiary of the eu budget but ranks far below that as a contributor . " blair , who takes over the eu presidency on july 1 , is pushing for a " fundamental debate " about the bloc 's future , including cap , which gives generous subsidies to farmers , especially those in france . upping the ante , a british spokesman said it was not essential for the summit to agree the 2007- 2013 spending plans - leaving open the prospect of it being delayed until after the upcoming british eu presidency . afp / dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " europe ca n't keep running " european leaders are gathering in brussels for a two-day summit to give the alliance new momentum .

in leading greece to the european championships , he silenced his most vociferous critics at home , and reached god status in his adopted one . otto rehhagel is promising a soccer party tonight when his greek side takes on 2002 world cup winners brazil in the newly refurbished leipzig stadium .
" we 're going to play freely and with spirit and hopefully we can do ourselves proud , " he said ahead of tonight 's premiere clash in the second group .
against world beaters like adriano , kaka , ronaldinho and the ascendent robinho , a greek side of hard-working , but unknown team players will have a difficult time of it .
after stunning the world by improbably beating france , the czech republic and then portugal to win the 2004 european championships , greece will have to prove it is better than the faltering world cup qualifying campaign it has waged so far -lrb- the greeks are in danger of missing out on the world cup , currently third behind ukraine and turkey -rrb- .
but chances are good that rehhagel will be smiling at the end of the match , no matter what the outcome .
the confederations cup tournament is a sort of victorious homecoming parade for the german coach who has been consistently passed over for the national team job in germany .
the architect of the impossible a tough defender during his playing career , rehhagel became a staunch advocate of a conservative , defense-minded playing style as a coach - to astounding success .
the 66-year-old won the german championship three times , the last with a team that a year before had played in the second division .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freedom to call all of the shots but his straight talk and controlling hand were too much for some german soccer functionaries , and his tactical style considered too throwback at a time when germany wanted to join the rest of the world in employing modern playing styles .
what did n't work for germany , worked for greece .
the country 's sports journalists have credited the national team 's amazing turnaround -lrb- they had competed in two international tournaments in as many decades , and did n't win one game -rrb- to the man from essen .
his authoritarian style was exactly what a soccer federation ruled by nepotism , corruption and petty disputes needed .
rehhagel took a team of unspectacular individual players and formed them into a singular , compact side that confounded superior sides like france and portugal with their disciplined defense and dangerous counters .
" rehhagel respects his players , " said midfielder vasilis tsiartas , in an interview with die welt newspaper .
" he knows how to deal with us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehhagel , here with striker angelos charisteas , " knows how to deal with players " underestimated , but struggling now , he 's hoping his team - largely the same one he took to portugal - will be able to repeat its success .
" they 're european champions for a reason , " said brazilian coach carlos alberto parreira .
" underestimate them at your own peril . "
more is at stake than just the cup , however .
observers say greece needs to use the tournament to find its form quickly , before missing its last chances to return to germany next year to play in the world cup . following his team 's championship win , rehhagel was offered a guarantee to compete in 2006 - as coach of the german side .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : crisis in brussels a quick guide to the eu summit meet the eu 's deficit sinners eu 's billions to flow to familiar shores eu attempts to untie budget tangles europe -pipe- 16.06.2005 " europe ca n't keep running " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how embattled is europe really ?
european leaders are gathering in brussels for a two-day summit to give the alliance new momentum .
but can the eu extricate itself from its constitutional tangle ?
dw-world.de talked to commissioner viviane reding . the european union 's mid-year summit takes place against the backdrop of the french and dutch rejection of the constitution and the looming battle over the 2007-2013 budget .
dw-world interviewed viviane reding , eu commissioner for infomation society and media about what 's in stake for the future of the 25-member bloc . dw-world : commission president barroso has called for a period of reflection with regard to ratification of the constitution , what does that actually mean for the constitution ? reding : that means that the constitution is still alive and it is important that it is alive because it has been agreed upon by the political forces of all member states united in the convention , which means this agreement should be the basis for future discussions , but in the referenda procedures we saw that people were not informed about the content of the constitution and very often voted on the problems they have with europe or the problems they have with their governments .
so we think it will be very worthwhile to have a second look at this constitution and to present it to the public in a better way . how long might that take ? that will take as long as it takes until the time is right for a decision .
one can not foresee that ; it could be very short or it could also take several months . how is it possible to regain the faith of the people with regard to the european project ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viviane reding , eu commissioner for information society and media i have been listening to the citizens carefully during the last years , not only during the referenda period , and they have some problems with the way europe is being built .
the constitution was an answer to this problem , but people did n't understand it was a solution to their criticism .
so this is the message we have to bring across . is there a general level of fatigue among europeans when it comes to being members of a union ? i do n't think so .
when you see the figures , although the constitution was rejected by 55 percent of the french people , 70 percent of french people feel european and they want the european union .
they have a problem with the way this eu is developing .
it is also a fact that in the last 10 years the development of this union has been running at such a pace that nobody has been able to follow it - with the big enlargement and several reforms of the institutions .
i believe it is going too quickly for the normal people . how are you going to slow that down ? that is exactly why the president has said we have to calm down for a moment , we have to reflect , we have to explain that the criticism and the problems raised need a solution , and we have to explain how this solution is going to come about .
we can not keep running and running and running , and i think most of all , we must not continue enlarging europe without discussing this with our populations .
the last enlargement was not conceptualized by our citizens . so what does it mean for those countries lining up to join the union ? i think that they will need more time to join the eu than they probably thought in the beginning .
there is no timeframe in mind , this will be discussed according to the merits and the evolution of the different countries but i really feel very strongly that we have first to conceptualize and understand the implications of the last enlargement before we can go to further enlargement . what could have been done differently in order to make the last enlargement more successful ? information .
i have always been astonished at how well the citizens of the 10 new countries were informed about the europe of the 15 , and i was always shocked to see how little the citizens of the europe of 15 knew about the 10 newcomers .
it is not enough to have a big welcoming party , you have to explain the advantages and the dangers to the people , to explain what is being done in order to secure a smooth transition from ten to 15 , and now we are seeing the results .
many of our people have not understood the value and the advantages of enlargement and they are afraid of the pitfalls .
and all this is happening because nobody has ever taken the responsibility of explaining the enlargement to the citizens of the 15 countries . what would you say to those euroskeptics who are trumpeting that the eu is beginning to crumble ? that is wishful thinking and absolutely removed from reality .
europe is a reality and it has been since the world war ii .
even those who have a problem with european institutions today do n't have a problem with europe .
in a globalized world , the only way you can survive and keep your industry and economy strong , is by joining forces .
to have individual countries fighting monster constructions like india or like china would be absolutely ridiculous . would you then reject the idea that there is a will among individual states for a greater degree of sovereignty ? the national states gave up part of their sovereignty in order to share it with others and become more efficient .
foreign trade is one example where one commissioner is negotiating for the 25 .
could you imagine what would happen if the 25 were to negotiate individually ?
they would n't go anywhere .
it is important that we join forces where we need to , in order that each of us becomes more efficient .
there are many other levels of politics , such as taxation , where national states have kept their sovereignty , so it is also very difficult for the people to understand who is doing what in europe , and i do n't think that has been sufficiently explained .
the crux of the matter is that the new constitution sorted this division of labour out in a very very clear way , and it is a pity that this answer to the fears of the people now has to be postponed . what do you hope will be achieved at the summit over the next two days ? i hope they will keep a cool head and make wise decisions .
one should not panic in the face of a problem , but sit down in a quiet way , reflect , and find the appropriate solutions .
there is no use now in running .
i think we have to calm down and think about it , discuss it and then decide on the next steps .
i am sure there are going to be next steps to be taken , europe is going to advance , it is going to do so at a different pace as foreseen in the recent past , but it has no other choice than to move on .
the world around it is advancing , so if europe does not keep pace , it will be at a disadvantage to the rest of the world . tamsin walker interviewed viviane reding send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de can britain save europe ?

european leaders are gathering in brussels for a two-day summit to give the alliance new momentum .
but can the eu extricate itself from its constitutional tangle ?
dw-world.de talked to commissioner viviane reding . the european union 's mid-year summit takes place against the backdrop of the french and dutch rejection of the constitution and the looming battle over the 2007-2013 budget .
dw-world interviewed viviane reding , eu commissioner for infomation society and media about what 's in stake for the future of the 25-member bloc . dw-world : commission president barroso has called for a period of reflection with regard to ratification of the constitution , what does that actually mean for the constitution ? reding : that means that the constitution is still alive and it is important that it is alive because it has been agreed upon by the political forces of all member states united in the convention , which means this agreement should be the basis for future discussions , but in the referenda procedures we saw that people were not informed about the content of the constitution and very often voted on the problems they have with europe or the problems they have with their governments .
so we think it will be very worthwhile to have a second look at this constitution and to present it to the public in a better way . how long might that take ? that will take as long as it takes until the time is right for a decision .
one can not foresee that ; it could be very short or it could also take several months . how is it possible to regain the faith of the people with regard to the european project ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viviane reding , eu commissioner for information society and media i have been listening to the citizens carefully during the last years , not only during the referenda period , and they have some problems with the way europe is being built .
the constitution was an answer to this problem , but people did n't understand it was a solution to their criticism .
so this is the message we have to bring across . is there a general level of fatigue among europeans when it comes to being members of a union ? i do n't think so .
when you see the figures , although the constitution was rejected by 55 percent of the french people , 70 percent of french people feel european and they want the european union .
they have a problem with the way this eu is developing .
it is also a fact that in the last 10 years the development of this union has been running at such a pace that nobody has been able to follow it - with the big enlargement and several reforms of the institutions .
i believe it is going too quickly for the normal people . how are you going to slow that down ? that is exactly why the president has said we have to calm down for a moment , we have to reflect , we have to explain that the criticism and the problems raised need a solution , and we have to explain how this solution is going to come about .
we can not keep running and running and running , and i think most of all , we must not continue enlarging europe without discussing this with our populations .
the last enlargement was not conceptualized by our citizens . so what does it mean for those countries lining up to join the union ? i think that they will need more time to join the eu than they probably thought in the beginning .
there is no timeframe in mind , this will be discussed according to the merits and the evolution of the different countries but i really feel very strongly that we have first to conceptualize and understand the implications of the last enlargement before we can go to further enlargement . what could have been done differently in order to make the last enlargement more successful ? information .
i have always been astonished at how well the citizens of the 10 new countries were informed about the europe of the 15 , and i was always shocked to see how little the citizens of the europe of 15 knew about the 10 newcomers .
it is not enough to have a big welcoming party , you have to explain the advantages and the dangers to the people , to explain what is being done in order to secure a smooth transition from ten to 15 , and now we are seeing the results .
many of our people have not understood the value and the advantages of enlargement and they are afraid of the pitfalls .
and all this is happening because nobody has ever taken the responsibility of explaining the enlargement to the citizens of the 15 countries . what would you say to those euroskeptics who are trumpeting that the eu is beginning to crumble ? that is wishful thinking and absolutely removed from reality .
europe is a reality and it has been since the world war ii .
even those who have a problem with european institutions today do n't have a problem with europe .
in a globalized world , the only way you can survive and keep your industry and economy strong , is by joining forces .
to have individual countries fighting monster constructions like india or like china would be absolutely ridiculous . would you then reject the idea that there is a will among individual states for a greater degree of sovereignty ? the national states gave up part of their sovereignty in order to share it with others and become more efficient .
foreign trade is one example where one commissioner is negotiating for the 25 .
could you imagine what would happen if the 25 were to negotiate individually ?
they would n't go anywhere .
it is important that we join forces where we need to , in order that each of us becomes more efficient .
there are many other levels of politics , such as taxation , where national states have kept their sovereignty , so it is also very difficult for the people to understand who is doing what in europe , and i do n't think that has been sufficiently explained .
the crux of the matter is that the new constitution sorted this division of labour out in a very very clear way , and it is a pity that this answer to the fears of the people now has to be postponed . what do you hope will be achieved at the summit over the next two days ? i hope they will keep a cool head and make wise decisions .
one should not panic in the face of a problem , but sit down in a quiet way , reflect , and find the appropriate solutions .
there is no use now in running .
i think we have to calm down and think about it , discuss it and then decide on the next steps .
i am sure there are going to be next steps to be taken , europe is going to advance , it is going to do so at a different pace as foreseen in the recent past , but it has no other choice than to move on .
the world around it is advancing , so if europe does not keep pace , it will be at a disadvantage to the rest of the world . tamsin walker interviewed viviane reding send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de can britain save europe ?

but who actually owns the marketing rights to this much-loved motif ? you name it , he 's been on it .
with bath mats , lampshades , vases , key-rings , t-shirts , mouse mats and coffee cups to choose from , you have n't been to berlin if you have n't brought home a souvenir emblazoned with the portly little figure with the trademark bowler hat . the " ampelmännchen " is an industry unto himself , and enjoys the privileged status of being one of the sole features of communist east germany to have survived the end of the iron curtain with his popularity unscathed . in the 1990s , he found himself at the heart of a full-blown rescue campaign when he was faced with possible extinction .
the figure first designed by karl peglau in 1961 had come to symbolize " ostalgie " - the revival of the east german aesthetic as cool kitsch - and when the reunited germany tried replacing him with a slimmed-down western version in 1997 , his fans rallied and saved him from certain death . an east-west stand-off his winning streak has shown no signs of letting up , and the 16-centimeter figure has become so profitable that he 's now at the heart of yet another dispute - one that some have seen as another east-west stand-off . two entrepreneurs from saxony and former west berlin took their fight over the marketing rights to the ampelmännchen to a leipzig court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim roßberg engineer joachim roßberg -lrb- photo -rrb- from zwickau , whose claim to the logo is that he was the only manufacturer of traffic lights in the former east germany , was being sued by designer markus heckhausen , who began incorporating the figure into products in 1995 .
he now sells over forty items , and told the court that he made 2 million euros last year with his ampelmännchen souvenirs . heckhausen - one of the initiators of the " save the amplemännchen " campaign ten years ago - argued that roßberg , who markets just six ampelmännchen products , was failing to make full use of his marketing rights .
legally , if no use of marketing rights is made for five years , the rights can be cancelled .
but roßberg insisted his business makes a tidy 50,000 euros a year . amicable agreement this week , the court proposed the rivals flesh out an amicable solution to the problem - and the unusual love triangle now seems to have a way of surviving . " money wo n't be changing hands , " said roßberg .
instead , he and heckhausen have decided to share and trade certain rights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus heckhausen " according to our agreement , we will simply exchange certain rights to the ampelmann and the newer ampelwoman , " heckhausen explained . roßberg will therefore continue to sell his best-known product , a liquor emblazoned with the logo - despite heckhausen 's scornful remark that " traffic regulations and alcohol are hardly compatible . " but despite such little squabbles , heckhausen is convinced the compromise will work .
" once again , the ampelmännchen has proved to be a positive symbol of reunification , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de touring east germany without the oppression thirteen years after the collapse of communist east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- , kitschy nostalgia for a lost culture still lives on in berlin .

coach ricardo la volpe 's side will have to play more convincingly to advance . when jose fonseca climbed up to head in a cross and give his side a 2-1 lead over japan , the breath of relief from the mexican bench was almost audible . after playing a back-and-forth game for most of the first half and failing to solve the smaller japanese defense , fonseca 's score off of a gonzalo pineda pass in the 64th minute sent mexico off to a first match victory . up until that point , mexico had few opportunities after evening the score late in the first half .

" i 'm going there with a willingness to reach an agreement , " he said , adding that his government was ready to work on a compromise as long as the result did n't lead to additional german payments that the country could not shoulder financially . " it would be wonderful if the signal from brussels would be that the eu is capable to act , " he said , referring to the 25-member bloc 's ongoing crisis as french and dutch voters rejected the proposed eu constitution and states have failed to reach a solution for the eu budget for 2007 to 2013 . british rebate unjust ? one of the main problems in the latter matter is that britain still refuses to budge on a decade-old , billion-euro rebate it was granted as the country does not profit as much from the eu 's agricultural subsidies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and blair are not getting along so well these days " the rebate has no real justification any more , " schröder said and attacked opposition leader angela merkel and his challenger in the upcoming elections for reportedly backing british prime minister tony blair on the rebate .
merkel refused to comment on this during her reply . sticking to the constitution on the question of the eu constitution , schröder said the ratification process should be continued despite the french and dutch " nos " and the british decision to postpone a referendum .
schröder said the matter should be dealt with during the austrian eu presidency in the first part of 2006 , when more states have had a chance to decide on the treaty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- left -rrb- and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan in the turkish capital ankara in february 2004 he also criticized the opposition christian democrats for again questioning membership negotiations with turkey .

experts say the media plays a large role in this disconnect between reality and perception . the numbers are encouraging .
between 1993 and 2003 , the number of murders fell by 40.8 percent and domestic burglaries fell by 45.7 percent .
all in all , crime in general dropped by 2.6 percent during the 10-year period and today , germany is considered one of the industrialized world 's safer countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but among the german populace , the mental picture of the nation 's crime rate is markedly different .
in a survey conducted in 2004 by the criminological research institute of lower saxony -lrb- kfn -rrb- , a representative sample of 2,000 people were asked about their perceptions of crime trends in the previous 10 years .
in almost all categories of crime , respondents grossly overestimated crime rates in germany . while car theft rates actually shrank by 70.5 percent , people surveyed estimated they had increased by 47 percent .
when it came to serious crimes such as murder , the discrepancies grew .
the average estimate was that the murder rate had gone up 27 percent , when in fact it had fallen by 40.8 percent .
sexual murders dropped by 37.5 percent between 1993 and 2003 , but the public estimated that they had increased by a full 260 percent . " the public perception is very different from what we see from the police statistics , " said matthias kleimann , a researcher at kfn who helped author a study of crime perception versus reality , of which the survey was a part . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : such trends have been seen in other western countries as well .
in the uk , a survey in 2003 showed 38 percent of britons thought crime rates had gone up strongly in the previous two years , while only four percent thought they had decreased over that time .
in fact , crime rates there had fallen by around two percent . in the united states , the story is similar .
while crime has fallen fairly consistently since 1991 , the perception is the opposite , as evidenced by the multiplication of gated communities across the nation and the booming business done by one growth industry , home security . what 's to blame ? while the jury is still out on the exact reasons for this disconnect between the real and perceived crime story , experts from several countries where the phenomenon can be seen are pointing their fingers at the media and the style , and amount , of its crime reporting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ look at what kind of news pieces make it into a newscast , the negative stories .
the newsroom theory is most definitely ' bad news is good news ' , " said kleimann . crime for many media outlets , particularly television , is very good news since it is often inexpensive to cover and , at the same time , a big draw for viewers . " you have to look at the way a lot of tv presents crime stories .
they are at the same time highly emotional and affect people directly , " he said .
" when a child disappears , it interests everyone and it often leads the newscast . " he points out that the trend has been noticeable since the mid 1980s , when commercial television networks first became fixtures on the german media landscape .
unlike their public rivals , the commercial networks have ratings to worry about .
like their american counterparts , they have adopted the " if it bleeds , it leads " news philosophy at the expense of drier stories on topics like unemployment or government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the result is a sensational smorgasbord of harrowing crime stories that has skewed the perception of the average viewer . one study showed that in the us , there was a slight decrease in the number of serious crimes over the period 1991 to 1995 .
an analysis of the evening news broadcast by all major television stations , on the other hand , showed the number of televised reports of spectacular violent crimes increased fourfold . real-world effects while those perceptions and heightened fear may have little to do with the world outside the tv , they do have an effect on society , particularly the justice system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " during the last decade , attitudes towards punishment in different western european countries have become significantly harsher , " according to helmut kury of the max planck institute of criminal and international law .
he said that can be traced to the perception of " increasing crime " in general , and the public 's desire that " something be done " about a problem that people fear is skyrocketing . in fact , experts say that the false perception of crime is the phenomenon that is more likely to quickly spiral out of control . often added to the mix are politicians who look to exploit those fears for their own gain by taking tough-on-crime stances , winning votes by promising to build more prisons and pass tougher sentencing laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the researchers at kfn , that will do little to help cut an already fairly low crime rate in germany and threatens to draw resources away from youth and educational centers that criminologists say are more effective preventive measures against future criminality .
" in the us there has been a great increase in tougher sentencing laws and a huge increase in the numbers of prisons built , " said kfn 's kleimann .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.06.2005 safer streets , growing fear großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : false perceptions about crime have people demanding more jails statistics show that violent crime rates have been dropping over the past decade in germany , but fear of crime is rising .
experts say the media plays a large role in this disconnect between reality and perception . the numbers are encouraging .
between 1993 and 2003 , the number of murders fell by 40.8 percent and domestic burglaries fell by 45.7 percent .
all in all , crime in general dropped by 2.6 percent during the 10-year period and today , germany is considered one of the industrialized world 's safer countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but among the german populace , the mental picture of the nation 's crime rate is markedly different .
in a survey conducted in 2004 by the criminological research institute of lower saxony -lrb- kfn -rrb- , a representative sample of 2,000 people were asked about their perceptions of crime trends in the previous 10 years .
in almost all categories of crime , respondents grossly overestimated crime rates in germany . while car theft rates actually shrank by 70.5 percent , people surveyed estimated they had increased by 47 percent .
when it came to serious crimes such as murder , the discrepancies grew .
the average estimate was that the murder rate had gone up 27 percent , when in fact it had fallen by 40.8 percent .
sexual murders dropped by 37.5 percent between 1993 and 2003 , but the public estimated that they had increased by a full 260 percent . " the public perception is very different from what we see from the police statistics , " said matthias kleimann , a researcher at kfn who helped author a study of crime perception versus reality , of which the survey was a part . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : such trends have been seen in other western countries as well .
in the uk , a survey in 2003 showed 38 percent of britons thought crime rates had gone up strongly in the previous two years , while only four percent thought they had decreased over that time .
in fact , crime rates there had fallen by around two percent . in the united states , the story is similar .
while crime has fallen fairly consistently since 1991 , the perception is the opposite , as evidenced by the multiplication of gated communities across the nation and the booming business done by one growth industry , home security . what 's to blame ? while the jury is still out on the exact reasons for this disconnect between the real and perceived crime story , experts from several countries where the phenomenon can be seen are pointing their fingers at the media and the style , and amount , of its crime reporting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ look at what kind of news pieces make it into a newscast , the negative stories .
the newsroom theory is most definitely ' bad news is good news ' , " said kleimann . crime for many media outlets , particularly television , is very good news since it is often inexpensive to cover and , at the same time , a big draw for viewers . " you have to look at the way a lot of tv presents crime stories .
they are at the same time highly emotional and affect people directly , " he said .
" when a child disappears , it interests everyone and it often leads the newscast . " he points out that the trend has been noticeable since the mid 1980s , when commercial television networks first became fixtures on the german media landscape .
unlike their public rivals , the commercial networks have ratings to worry about .
like their american counterparts , they have adopted the " if it bleeds , it leads " news philosophy at the expense of drier stories on topics like unemployment or government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the result is a sensational smorgasbord of harrowing crime stories that has skewed the perception of the average viewer . one study showed that in the us , there was a slight decrease in the number of serious crimes over the period 1991 to 1995 .

42,000 fans watched a brazilian team that after this match is the squad to beat in the tournament . brazil provided the first clear-cut victory in the confederations cup with a 3-0 victory against greece .
the first three matches were all decided by one goal but coach carlos alberto parreira 's team sent a very clear message to the seven other teams that the selecao are hungry for another international title . " the team was well-balanced , " explained parreira .
" sometimes they played too complicated but it was in order how we played . " the brazilian play was definitely in order but unlike the first three matches , it took a while for the first goal to be scored .
and how it was scored set the tone for the remainder of the match because greece got in a situation they prefer not to be in , namely attacking soccer . after 40 minutes in which otto rehhagel 's euro 2004 champs played aggressively enough to hold the brazilians in check , adriano finally broke the gordian knot .
in a moment when the greeks failed to press the inter milan striker who then pulled up from 27 meters and launched a rocket that just squeezed inside the right post past a flying greek keeper antonis nikopolildis . second-half starts off disastrously in the first half , greece missed a golden opportunity in the first half-minute .
the second-half would start with a golden opportunity for brazil .
one they didn ’ t waste . bildunterschrift : greek goalkeeper antonios nikopolidis -lrb- right -rrb- looks as a shot from brazil 's robinho -lrb- left -rrb- hits the back of the net for the 2nd goal hertha berlin 's defender gilberto raced with the ball up the left sideline , crossed it through the greek penalty box where robinho -lrb- photo -rrb- , the replacement of superstar ronaldo , was waiting to place the ball in the net .
40 seconds into the second-half , greece were beaten . at this point , brazil could toy with otto rehhagel 's side like a cat with a wounded mouse .
the selecao handed the ball over to the greeks for the next ten minutes but when the euro champs were unable to take advantage of the brazilian gift , the world champs retook control . ronaldinho had a few good opportunities .
rubinho broke free occasionally and the achilles heel of the greek defense , the right side , was used continuously as a launching pad for attacks by the yellow-clad brazilians . midway through the second-half , a series of substitutions interrupted the flow of the match but important was the entrance of olympique lyon juninho pernambucano in the 77th minute . quality goal seals greece 's fate four minutes later , juninho stepped up to take a free-kick just outside the greek penalty box .
after all , the master of the free-kick ronaldinho had been taken out of the game .
but juninho plays at a level , if not equal , then very close to last year 's footballer of the year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil was head taller all night juninho bent the direct kick over the top of the greek wall , the ball dropped 2 meters in a millisecond , and nikopolidis could only watch as the leather fell into the back of the net .
the very real and classy greek defense of 2004 was transformed into something comparable to the best myths classic greek mythology . " the brazilians were clearly better , " commented rehhagel .
" all 11 players must give 110 % to beat a brazilian team and tonight we only gave about 50 % .
that was n't enough . " so the greeks , after a series of disappointing qualifying matches for next year 's world cup in germany , are finding out that rehhagel no longer has the midas touch .
brazil , on the other hand , was convincing after last week 's bitter 3-1 defeat to argentina in buenos aires .
understandably , they would like a chance to exact revenge against their south american rivals .
but before that they have two more matches to play . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mexico yawns past japan mexico edged japan on a second-half goal in a slow-paced match that featured few highlights .

" i 'm going there with a willingness to reach an agreement , " he said , adding that his government was ready to work on a compromise as long as the result did n't lead to additional german payments that the country could not shoulder financially . " it would be wonderful if the signal from brussels would be that the eu is capable to act , " he said , referring to the 25-member bloc 's ongoing crisis as french and dutch voters rejected the proposed eu constitution and states have failed to reach a solution for the eu budget for 2007 to 2013 . british rebate unjust ? one of the main problems in the latter matter is that britain still refuses to budge on a decade-old , billion-euro rebate it was granted as the country does not profit as much from the eu 's agricultural subsidies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and blair are not getting along so well these days " the rebate has no real justification any more , " schröder said and attacked opposition leader angela merkel and his challenger in the upcoming elections for reportedly backing british prime minister tony blair on the rebate .
merkel refused to comment on this during her reply . sticking to the constitution on the question of the eu constitution , schröder said the ratification process should be continued despite the french and dutch " nos " and the british decision to postpone a referendum .
schröder said the matter should be dealt with during the austrian eu presidency in the first part of 2006 , when more states have had a chance to decide on the treaty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- left -rrb- and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan in the turkish capital ankara in february 2004 he also criticized the opposition christian democrats for again questioning membership negotiations with turkey .
the opposition rejects turkish membership and has instead called for a " privileged partnership . " germany 's ratification of the constitution was halted wednesday after president horst köhler decided to wait with signing the document as a legal complaint against the constitution is still pending before germany 's highest court .

but who actually owns the marketing rights to this much-loved motif ? you name it , he 's been on it .
with bath mats , lampshades , vases , key-rings , t-shirts , mouse mats and coffee cups to choose from , you have n't been to berlin if you have n't brought home a souvenir emblazoned with the portly little figure with the trademark bowler hat . the " ampelmännchen " is an industry unto himself , and enjoys the privileged status of being one of the sole features of communist east germany to have survived the end of the iron curtain with his popularity unscathed . in the 1990s , he found himself at the heart of a full-blown rescue campaign when he was faced with possible extinction .
the figure first designed by karl peglau in 1961 had come to symbolize " ostalgie " - the revival of the east german aesthetic as cool kitsch - and when the reunited germany tried replacing him with a slimmed-down western version in 1997 , his fans rallied and saved him from certain death . an east-west stand-off his winning streak has shown no signs of letting up , and the 16-centimeter figure has become so profitable that he 's now at the heart of yet another dispute - one that some have seen as another east-west stand-off . two entrepreneurs from saxony and former west berlin took their fight over the marketing rights to the ampelmännchen to a leipzig court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim roßberg engineer joachim roßberg -lrb- photo -rrb- from zwickau , whose claim to the logo is that he was the only manufacturer of traffic lights in the former east germany , was being sued by designer markus heckhausen , who began incorporating the figure into products in 1995 .
he now sells over forty items , and told the court that he made 2 million euros last year with his ampelmännchen souvenirs . heckhausen - one of the initiators of the " save the amplemännchen " campaign ten years ago - argued that roßberg , who markets just six ampelmännchen products , was failing to make full use of his marketing rights .
legally , if no use of marketing rights is made for five years , the rights can be cancelled .
but roßberg insisted his business makes a tidy 50,000 euros a year . amicable agreement this week , the court proposed the rivals flesh out an amicable solution to the problem - and the unusual love triangle now seems to have a way of surviving . " money wo n't be changing hands , " said roßberg .
instead , he and heckhausen have decided to share and trade certain rights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus heckhausen " according to our agreement , we will simply exchange certain rights to the ampelmann and the newer ampelwoman , " heckhausen explained . roßberg will therefore continue to sell his best-known product , a liquor emblazoned with the logo - despite heckhausen 's scornful remark that " traffic regulations and alcohol are hardly compatible . " but despite such little squabbles , heckhausen is convinced the compromise will work .
" once again , the ampelmännchen has proved to be a positive symbol of reunification , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de touring east germany without the oppression thirteen years after the collapse of communist east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- , kitschy nostalgia for a lost culture still lives on in berlin .

in leading greece to the european championships , he silenced his most vociferous critics at home , and reached god status in his adopted one . otto rehhagel is promising a soccer party tonight when his greek side takes on 2002 world cup winners brazil in the newly refurbished leipzig stadium .
" we 're going to play freely and with spirit and hopefully we can do ourselves proud , " he said ahead of tonight 's premiere clash in the second group .
against world beaters like adriano , kaka , ronaldinho and the ascendent robinho , a greek side of hard-working , but unknown team players will have a difficult time of it .
after stunning the world by improbably beating france , the czech republic and then portugal to win the 2004 european championships , greece will have to prove it is better than the faltering world cup qualifying campaign it has waged so far -lrb- the greeks are in danger of missing out on the world cup , currently third behind ukraine and turkey -rrb- .
but chances are good that rehhagel will be smiling at the end of the match , no matter what the outcome .
the confederations cup tournament is a sort of victorious homecoming parade for the german coach who has been consistently passed over for the national team job in germany .
the architect of the impossible a tough defender during his playing career , rehhagel became a staunch advocate of a conservative , defense-minded playing style as a coach - to astounding success .
the 66-year-old won the german championship three times , the last with a team that a year before had played in the second division .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freedom to call all of the shots but his straight talk and controlling hand were too much for some german soccer functionaries , and his tactical style considered too throwback at a time when germany wanted to join the rest of the world in employing modern playing styles .
what did n't work for germany , worked for greece .
the country 's sports journalists have credited the national team 's amazing turnaround -lrb- they had competed in two international tournaments in as many decades , and did n't win one game -rrb- to the man from essen .
his authoritarian style was exactly what a soccer federation ruled by nepotism , corruption and petty disputes needed .
rehhagel took a team of unspectacular individual players and formed them into a singular , compact side that confounded superior sides like france and portugal with their disciplined defense and dangerous counters .
" rehhagel respects his players , " said midfielder vasilis tsiartas , in an interview with die welt newspaper .
" he knows how to deal with us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehhagel , here with striker angelos charisteas , " knows how to deal with players " underestimated , but struggling now , he 's hoping his team - largely the same one he took to portugal - will be able to repeat its success .
" they 're european champions for a reason , " said brazilian coach carlos alberto parreira .
" underestimate them at your own peril . "
more is at stake than just the cup , however .
observers say greece needs to use the tournament to find its form quickly , before missing its last chances to return to germany next year to play in the world cup . following his team 's championship win , rehhagel was offered a guarantee to compete in 2006 - as coach of the german side .
" rehhakles " as the german papers dubbed him , declined .
the reason ?
he said he wanted to finish what he started . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de coaches wrapped up in mini world cup even though only eight teams are invited , the confederations cup , little brother to the world cup 's 32 teams , is a big enough title to keep brazilian players from being able to enjoy the summer holidays . -lrb- may 12 , 2005 -rrb- dfb struggles to find coach after rehhagel spurn with otto rehhagel declining the german football association ’ s -lrb- dfb -rrb- offer to make him national coach , only two candidates remain for the top job : guus hiddink and lothas matthäus – and even they are long shots .

in leading greece to the european championships , he silenced his most vociferous critics at home , and reached god status in his adopted one . otto rehhagel is promising a soccer party tonight when his greek side takes on 2002 world cup winners brazil in the newly refurbished leipzig stadium .
" we 're going to play freely and with spirit and hopefully we can do ourselves proud , " he said ahead of tonight 's premiere clash in the second group .
against world beaters like adriano , kaka , ronaldinho and the ascendent robinho , a greek side of hard-working , but unknown team players will have a difficult time of it .
after stunning the world by improbably beating france , the czech republic and then portugal to win the 2004 european championships , greece will have to prove it is better than the faltering world cup qualifying campaign it has waged so far -lrb- the greeks are in danger of missing out on the world cup , currently third behind ukraine and turkey -rrb- .
but chances are good that rehhagel will be smiling at the end of the match , no matter what the outcome .
the confederations cup tournament is a sort of victorious homecoming parade for the german coach who has been consistently passed over for the national team job in germany .
the architect of the impossible a tough defender during his playing career , rehhagel became a staunch advocate of a conservative , defense-minded playing style as a coach - to astounding success .

his authoritarian style was exactly what a soccer federation ruled by nepotism , corruption and petty disputes needed .
rehhagel took a team of unspectacular individual players and formed them into a singular , compact side that confounded superior sides like france and portugal with their disciplined defense and dangerous counters .

they agreed to suspend the ratification of the eu constitution . going into the crisis meeting in brussels , germany still clung to hope for the 25-member bloc 's planned charter , already ratified by its parliament .
" the constitutional treaty will be part of the eu 's future .
to say ' the constitution is dead ' also discredits the german ' yes ' on the constitution , " said german chancellor gerhard schröder . but , at a pre-summit meeting outside brussels , " a vast majority " of conservative leaders favored suspending ratification of the charter , said european people 's party parliamentary chief hans-gert pöttering . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder , left , meets with luxembourg prime minister jean claude juncker luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , who holds the eu 's presidency , and eu commision chief jose barroso both " proposed suspending the process , " said pöttering . dutch europe minister atzo nicolai ruled out a new referendum on the spurned constitution , saying : " it is dead in the netherlands , this treaty . " the treaty must be ratified by every eu member to become effective , prompting swedish prime minister göran persson to question the use of carrying on as scheduled with a vote in his own country . " i want a clear message from france and the netherlands about how they will deal with their ' no ' votes .
-lrb- if -rrb- there is no clear message , i think we will also have a delay , " persson said .
danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen echoed the comments .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from l-r german foreign minister joschka fischer , german chancellor gerhard schroeder , dutch prime minister jan-peter balkenende and austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel chat during the round table at the beginning of the two days european summit in brussels according to diplomats in brussels , all 25 member states were in agreement that the ratification process should be suspended until at least next year while they discuss the future direction of the european project .
french president jacques chirac also said he had doubts about future expansion plans of the bloc .
he called for a special summit to discuss the future direction of the union . " can the union in this new situation really expand without having the proper institutions for it ? " he asked the fellow leaders in a prepared text .
" i think we need to discuss these important questions together . " budget deadlock a deal on the eu 's 2007-2013 budget - blocked partly by britain 's refusal to surrender a hard-won rebate - would only be possible if all 25 members were ready to compromise , said schröder , who was gloomy about the prospects for an agreement . " i do n't think there will be a deal on the budget .
the differences are too big , " he said .
" i 'm not optimistic about a deal . " at the end of the first day of the meeting , his prediction looked correct , since a budget deal seemed far away .
british prime minister tony blair has thus far refused to release his grip on the uk rebate , despite a last-minute offer by the eu presidency . luxembourg 's juncker suggested freezing , not cutting the british rebate , which was worth 5.3 billion euros last year and was projected to average 7.1 billion euros annually between 2007 and 2013 .
any future reductions in the rebate would be tied to a reduction in eu agricultural aid after 2013 . but no country gave ground . farm subsidies vs. rebate britain is refusing to accept a change to its budget rebate without a rethink of eu farm subsidies that gobble up 40 percent of the entire eu budget .
the rebate , sancrosanct to britons across the political spectrum , has been in place since 1984 to compensate for the relatively small amount that britain reaps from the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn , left , gestures while speaking with british foreign secretary jack straw , center , and eu foreign policy chief javier solana foreign secretary jack straw set out britain 's stance as eu leaders voiced little hope of a breakthrough on the budget talks . " the proposals from the presidency are not acceptable to us , " straw said .
" that 's one of the reasons why there 's going to be difficulty " during the conclave , he told reporters . blair 's spokesman said the cabinet backed his refusal to give way on the rebate , secured by the iron-willed former british leader , margaret thatcher , in 1984 to compensate for the relatively small amount london received in eu farm aid . the rest of europe stepped up the pressure on blair , including germany . " there is absolutely no justification any longer for the british rebate , " the german leader said .
" britain is the sixth biggest per capita beneficiary of the eu budget but ranks far below that as a contributor . " blair , who takes over the eu presidency on july 1 , is pushing for a " fundamental debate " about the bloc 's future , including cap , which gives generous subsidies to farmers , especially those in france . upping the ante , a british spokesman said it was not essential for the summit to agree the 2007- 2013 spending plans - leaving open the prospect of it being delayed until after the upcoming british eu presidency . afp / dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " europe ca n't keep running " european leaders are gathering in brussels for a two-day summit to give the alliance new momentum .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 16.06.2005 brazil show otto who 's king großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek coach otto rehhagel was dethroned by brazil , 3-0 brazil opens the confederations cup with a dominating 3-0 victory over otto rehhagel 's european champs greece .
42,000 fans watched a brazilian team that after this match is the squad to beat in the tournament . brazil provided the first clear-cut victory in the confederations cup with a 3-0 victory against greece .
the first three matches were all decided by one goal but coach carlos alberto parreira 's team sent a very clear message to the seven other teams that the selecao are hungry for another international title . " the team was well-balanced , " explained parreira .
" sometimes they played too complicated but it was in order how we played . " the brazilian play was definitely in order but unlike the first three matches , it took a while for the first goal to be scored .
and how it was scored set the tone for the remainder of the match because greece got in a situation they prefer not to be in , namely attacking soccer . after 40 minutes in which otto rehhagel 's euro 2004 champs played aggressively enough to hold the brazilians in check , adriano finally broke the gordian knot .
in a moment when the greeks failed to press the inter milan striker who then pulled up from 27 meters and launched a rocket that just squeezed inside the right post past a flying greek keeper antonis nikopolildis . second-half starts off disastrously in the first half , greece missed a golden opportunity in the first half-minute .
the second-half would start with a golden opportunity for brazil .
one they didn ’ t waste . bildunterschrift : greek goalkeeper antonios nikopolidis -lrb- right -rrb- looks as a shot from brazil 's robinho -lrb- left -rrb- hits the back of the net for the 2nd goal hertha berlin 's defender gilberto raced with the ball up the left sideline , crossed it through the greek penalty box where robinho -lrb- photo -rrb- , the replacement of superstar ronaldo , was waiting to place the ball in the net .
40 seconds into the second-half , greece were beaten . at this point , brazil could toy with otto rehhagel 's side like a cat with a wounded mouse .
the selecao handed the ball over to the greeks for the next ten minutes but when the euro champs were unable to take advantage of the brazilian gift , the world champs retook control . ronaldinho had a few good opportunities .
rubinho broke free occasionally and the achilles heel of the greek defense , the right side , was used continuously as a launching pad for attacks by the yellow-clad brazilians . midway through the second-half , a series of substitutions interrupted the flow of the match but important was the entrance of olympique lyon juninho pernambucano in the 77th minute . quality goal seals greece 's fate four minutes later , juninho stepped up to take a free-kick just outside the greek penalty box .
after all , the master of the free-kick ronaldinho had been taken out of the game .
but juninho plays at a level , if not equal , then very close to last year 's footballer of the year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil was head taller all night juninho bent the direct kick over the top of the greek wall , the ball dropped 2 meters in a millisecond , and nikopolidis could only watch as the leather fell into the back of the net .
the very real and classy greek defense of 2004 was transformed into something comparable to the best myths classic greek mythology . " the brazilians were clearly better , " commented rehhagel .
" all 11 players must give 110 % to beat a brazilian team and tonight we only gave about 50 % .
that was n't enough . " so the greeks , after a series of disappointing qualifying matches for next year 's world cup in germany , are finding out that rehhagel no longer has the midas touch .
brazil , on the other hand , was convincing after last week 's bitter 3-1 defeat to argentina in buenos aires .
understandably , they would like a chance to exact revenge against their south american rivals .
but before that they have two more matches to play . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mexico yawns past japan mexico edged japan on a second-half goal in a slow-paced match that featured few highlights .

coach ricardo la volpe 's side will have to play more convincingly to advance . when jose fonseca climbed up to head in a cross and give his side a 2-1 lead over japan , the breath of relief from the mexican bench was almost audible . after playing a back-and-forth game for most of the first half and failing to solve the smaller japanese defense , fonseca 's score off of a gonzalo pineda pass in the 64th minute sent mexico off to a first match victory . up until that point , mexico had few opportunities after evening the score late in the first half .
though controlling the match at the beginning , la volpe 's side had a tough time breaking through the japanese defense . counter brings relief the small crowd of 21,000 in hanover 's stadium had something to cheer about early on as japan responded quickly on a counter .
akira kaji got free down the right side of the field and passed in to a streaking atsushi yanagisawa .
the midfielder was marked by mexico 's ricardo osorio , who actually deflected the ball into his own net after it skipped through yanagisawa 's legs .
the 1-0 lead was a surprise , but not without credit to the resilient japanese side .
mexico responded by not really responding at all .
the midfield continued having a tough time breaking down the defense , preferring to build up their attack slowly , rather than unsettling the japanese defenders with quick passes . mexico roars back mexican striker jared borgetti had a golden opportunity robbed by some good goalkeeping when his close range header was blocked off by japan 's small , but nimble goalie yoshikatsu kawaguchi . kawaguchi looked his size , though , on the goal that evened it up .
midfielder zinha sprung free on the left side of the penalty box and bent a nice shot into the upper right hand corner of the net that a diving kawaguchi was helpless to defend . slow to start in the second half , mexico finally found the key to the japanese defense that until then would not unlock .
the size difference between fonseca and his markers attracted the attention of pineda , who lofted a nice cross to him in the center , which the midfielder had no problem putting away . japan 's desperation attempts in the final phase of the game were easily shut down by mexico , which had finally found its footing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.06.2005 safer streets , growing fear großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : false perceptions about crime have people demanding more jails statistics show that violent crime rates have been dropping over the past decade in germany , but fear of crime is rising .
experts say the media plays a large role in this disconnect between reality and perception . the numbers are encouraging .
between 1993 and 2003 , the number of murders fell by 40.8 percent and domestic burglaries fell by 45.7 percent .
all in all , crime in general dropped by 2.6 percent during the 10-year period and today , germany is considered one of the industrialized world 's safer countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but among the german populace , the mental picture of the nation 's crime rate is markedly different .
in a survey conducted in 2004 by the criminological research institute of lower saxony -lrb- kfn -rrb- , a representative sample of 2,000 people were asked about their perceptions of crime trends in the previous 10 years .
in almost all categories of crime , respondents grossly overestimated crime rates in germany . while car theft rates actually shrank by 70.5 percent , people surveyed estimated they had increased by 47 percent .
when it came to serious crimes such as murder , the discrepancies grew .
the average estimate was that the murder rate had gone up 27 percent , when in fact it had fallen by 40.8 percent .
sexual murders dropped by 37.5 percent between 1993 and 2003 , but the public estimated that they had increased by a full 260 percent . " the public perception is very different from what we see from the police statistics , " said matthias kleimann , a researcher at kfn who helped author a study of crime perception versus reality , of which the survey was a part . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : such trends have been seen in other western countries as well .
in the uk , a survey in 2003 showed 38 percent of britons thought crime rates had gone up strongly in the previous two years , while only four percent thought they had decreased over that time .
in fact , crime rates there had fallen by around two percent . in the united states , the story is similar .
while crime has fallen fairly consistently since 1991 , the perception is the opposite , as evidenced by the multiplication of gated communities across the nation and the booming business done by one growth industry , home security . what 's to blame ? while the jury is still out on the exact reasons for this disconnect between the real and perceived crime story , experts from several countries where the phenomenon can be seen are pointing their fingers at the media and the style , and amount , of its crime reporting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ look at what kind of news pieces make it into a newscast , the negative stories .
the newsroom theory is most definitely ' bad news is good news ' , " said kleimann . crime for many media outlets , particularly television , is very good news since it is often inexpensive to cover and , at the same time , a big draw for viewers . " you have to look at the way a lot of tv presents crime stories .
they are at the same time highly emotional and affect people directly , " he said .
" when a child disappears , it interests everyone and it often leads the newscast . " he points out that the trend has been noticeable since the mid 1980s , when commercial television networks first became fixtures on the german media landscape .
unlike their public rivals , the commercial networks have ratings to worry about .
like their american counterparts , they have adopted the " if it bleeds , it leads " news philosophy at the expense of drier stories on topics like unemployment or government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the result is a sensational smorgasbord of harrowing crime stories that has skewed the perception of the average viewer . one study showed that in the us , there was a slight decrease in the number of serious crimes over the period 1991 to 1995 .
an analysis of the evening news broadcast by all major television stations , on the other hand , showed the number of televised reports of spectacular violent crimes increased fourfold . real-world effects while those perceptions and heightened fear may have little to do with the world outside the tv , they do have an effect on society , particularly the justice system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " during the last decade , attitudes towards punishment in different western european countries have become significantly harsher , " according to helmut kury of the max planck institute of criminal and international law .
he said that can be traced to the perception of " increasing crime " in general , and the public 's desire that " something be done " about a problem that people fear is skyrocketing . in fact , experts say that the false perception of crime is the phenomenon that is more likely to quickly spiral out of control . often added to the mix are politicians who look to exploit those fears for their own gain by taking tough-on-crime stances , winning votes by promising to build more prisons and pass tougher sentencing laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the researchers at kfn , that will do little to help cut an already fairly low crime rate in germany and threatens to draw resources away from youth and educational centers that criminologists say are more effective preventive measures against future criminality .
" in the us there has been a great increase in tougher sentencing laws and a huge increase in the numbers of prisons built , " said kfn 's kleimann .

experts say the media plays a large role in this disconnect between reality and perception . the numbers are encouraging .
between 1993 and 2003 , the number of murders fell by 40.8 percent and domestic burglaries fell by 45.7 percent .
all in all , crime in general dropped by 2.6 percent during the 10-year period and today , germany is considered one of the industrialized world 's safer countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but among the german populace , the mental picture of the nation 's crime rate is markedly different .
in a survey conducted in 2004 by the criminological research institute of lower saxony -lrb- kfn -rrb- , a representative sample of 2,000 people were asked about their perceptions of crime trends in the previous 10 years .
in almost all categories of crime , respondents grossly overestimated crime rates in germany . while car theft rates actually shrank by 70.5 percent , people surveyed estimated they had increased by 47 percent .
when it came to serious crimes such as murder , the discrepancies grew .
the average estimate was that the murder rate had gone up 27 percent , when in fact it had fallen by 40.8 percent .
sexual murders dropped by 37.5 percent between 1993 and 2003 , but the public estimated that they had increased by a full 260 percent .

in the uk , a survey in 2003 showed 38 percent of britons thought crime rates had gone up strongly in the previous two years , while only four percent thought they had decreased over that time .
in fact , crime rates there had fallen by around two percent . in the united states , the story is similar .

coach ricardo la volpe 's side will have to play more convincingly to advance . when jose fonseca climbed up to head in a cross and give his side a 2-1 lead over japan , the breath of relief from the mexican bench was almost audible . after playing a back-and-forth game for most of the first half and failing to solve the smaller japanese defense , fonseca 's score off of a gonzalo pineda pass in the 64th minute sent mexico off to a first match victory . up until that point , mexico had few opportunities after evening the score late in the first half .
though controlling the match at the beginning , la volpe 's side had a tough time breaking through the japanese defense . counter brings relief the small crowd of 21,000 in hanover 's stadium had something to cheer about early on as japan responded quickly on a counter .
akira kaji got free down the right side of the field and passed in to a streaking atsushi yanagisawa .
the midfielder was marked by mexico 's ricardo osorio , who actually deflected the ball into his own net after it skipped through yanagisawa 's legs .
the 1-0 lead was a surprise , but not without credit to the resilient japanese side .
mexico responded by not really responding at all .
the midfield continued having a tough time breaking down the defense , preferring to build up their attack slowly , rather than unsettling the japanese defenders with quick passes . mexico roars back mexican striker jared borgetti had a golden opportunity robbed by some good goalkeeping when his close range header was blocked off by japan 's small , but nimble goalie yoshikatsu kawaguchi . kawaguchi looked his size , though , on the goal that evened it up .
midfielder zinha sprung free on the left side of the penalty box and bent a nice shot into the upper right hand corner of the net that a diving kawaguchi was helpless to defend . slow to start in the second half , mexico finally found the key to the japanese defense that until then would not unlock .
the size difference between fonseca and his markers attracted the attention of pineda , who lofted a nice cross to him in the center , which the midfielder had no problem putting away . japan 's desperation attempts in the final phase of the game were easily shut down by mexico , which had finally found its footing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.06.2005 safer streets , growing fear großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : false perceptions about crime have people demanding more jails statistics show that violent crime rates have been dropping over the past decade in germany , but fear of crime is rising .
experts say the media plays a large role in this disconnect between reality and perception . the numbers are encouraging .
between 1993 and 2003 , the number of murders fell by 40.8 percent and domestic burglaries fell by 45.7 percent .
all in all , crime in general dropped by 2.6 percent during the 10-year period and today , germany is considered one of the industrialized world 's safer countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but among the german populace , the mental picture of the nation 's crime rate is markedly different .
in a survey conducted in 2004 by the criminological research institute of lower saxony -lrb- kfn -rrb- , a representative sample of 2,000 people were asked about their perceptions of crime trends in the previous 10 years .
in almost all categories of crime , respondents grossly overestimated crime rates in germany . while car theft rates actually shrank by 70.5 percent , people surveyed estimated they had increased by 47 percent .
when it came to serious crimes such as murder , the discrepancies grew .
the average estimate was that the murder rate had gone up 27 percent , when in fact it had fallen by 40.8 percent .
sexual murders dropped by 37.5 percent between 1993 and 2003 , but the public estimated that they had increased by a full 260 percent . " the public perception is very different from what we see from the police statistics , " said matthias kleimann , a researcher at kfn who helped author a study of crime perception versus reality , of which the survey was a part . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : such trends have been seen in other western countries as well .
in the uk , a survey in 2003 showed 38 percent of britons thought crime rates had gone up strongly in the previous two years , while only four percent thought they had decreased over that time .
in fact , crime rates there had fallen by around two percent . in the united states , the story is similar .
while crime has fallen fairly consistently since 1991 , the perception is the opposite , as evidenced by the multiplication of gated communities across the nation and the booming business done by one growth industry , home security . what 's to blame ? while the jury is still out on the exact reasons for this disconnect between the real and perceived crime story , experts from several countries where the phenomenon can be seen are pointing their fingers at the media and the style , and amount , of its crime reporting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ look at what kind of news pieces make it into a newscast , the negative stories .
the newsroom theory is most definitely ' bad news is good news ' , " said kleimann . crime for many media outlets , particularly television , is very good news since it is often inexpensive to cover and , at the same time , a big draw for viewers . " you have to look at the way a lot of tv presents crime stories .
they are at the same time highly emotional and affect people directly , " he said .
" when a child disappears , it interests everyone and it often leads the newscast . " he points out that the trend has been noticeable since the mid 1980s , when commercial television networks first became fixtures on the german media landscape .
unlike their public rivals , the commercial networks have ratings to worry about .
like their american counterparts , they have adopted the " if it bleeds , it leads " news philosophy at the expense of drier stories on topics like unemployment or government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the result is a sensational smorgasbord of harrowing crime stories that has skewed the perception of the average viewer . one study showed that in the us , there was a slight decrease in the number of serious crimes over the period 1991 to 1995 .
an analysis of the evening news broadcast by all major television stations , on the other hand , showed the number of televised reports of spectacular violent crimes increased fourfold . real-world effects while those perceptions and heightened fear may have little to do with the world outside the tv , they do have an effect on society , particularly the justice system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " during the last decade , attitudes towards punishment in different western european countries have become significantly harsher , " according to helmut kury of the max planck institute of criminal and international law .
he said that can be traced to the perception of " increasing crime " in general , and the public 's desire that " something be done " about a problem that people fear is skyrocketing . in fact , experts say that the false perception of crime is the phenomenon that is more likely to quickly spiral out of control . often added to the mix are politicians who look to exploit those fears for their own gain by taking tough-on-crime stances , winning votes by promising to build more prisons and pass tougher sentencing laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the researchers at kfn , that will do little to help cut an already fairly low crime rate in germany and threatens to draw resources away from youth and educational centers that criminologists say are more effective preventive measures against future criminality .
" in the us there has been a great increase in tougher sentencing laws and a huge increase in the numbers of prisons built , " said kfn 's kleimann .

all in all , crime in general dropped by 2.6 percent during the 10-year period and today , germany is considered one of the industrialized world 's safer countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but among the german populace , the mental picture of the nation 's crime rate is markedly different .
in a survey conducted in 2004 by the criminological research institute of lower saxony -lrb- kfn -rrb- , a representative sample of 2,000 people were asked about their perceptions of crime trends in the previous 10 years .
in almost all categories of crime , respondents grossly overestimated crime rates in germany . while car theft rates actually shrank by 70.5 percent , people surveyed estimated they had increased by 47 percent .
when it came to serious crimes such as murder , the discrepancies grew .
the average estimate was that the murder rate had gone up 27 percent , when in fact it had fallen by 40.8 percent .
sexual murders dropped by 37.5 percent between 1993 and 2003 , but the public estimated that they had increased by a full 260 percent . " the public perception is very different from what we see from the police statistics , " said matthias kleimann , a researcher at kfn who helped author a study of crime perception versus reality , of which the survey was a part . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : such trends have been seen in other western countries as well .
in the uk , a survey in 2003 showed 38 percent of britons thought crime rates had gone up strongly in the previous two years , while only four percent thought they had decreased over that time .
in fact , crime rates there had fallen by around two percent . in the united states , the story is similar .
while crime has fallen fairly consistently since 1991 , the perception is the opposite , as evidenced by the multiplication of gated communities across the nation and the booming business done by one growth industry , home security . what 's to blame ? while the jury is still out on the exact reasons for this disconnect between the real and perceived crime story , experts from several countries where the phenomenon can be seen are pointing their fingers at the media and the style , and amount , of its crime reporting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ look at what kind of news pieces make it into a newscast , the negative stories .
the newsroom theory is most definitely ' bad news is good news ' , " said kleimann . crime for many media outlets , particularly television , is very good news since it is often inexpensive to cover and , at the same time , a big draw for viewers . " you have to look at the way a lot of tv presents crime stories .
they are at the same time highly emotional and affect people directly , " he said .
" when a child disappears , it interests everyone and it often leads the newscast . " he points out that the trend has been noticeable since the mid 1980s , when commercial television networks first became fixtures on the german media landscape .
unlike their public rivals , the commercial networks have ratings to worry about .
like their american counterparts , they have adopted the " if it bleeds , it leads " news philosophy at the expense of drier stories on topics like unemployment or government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the result is a sensational smorgasbord of harrowing crime stories that has skewed the perception of the average viewer . one study showed that in the us , there was a slight decrease in the number of serious crimes over the period 1991 to 1995 .
an analysis of the evening news broadcast by all major television stations , on the other hand , showed the number of televised reports of spectacular violent crimes increased fourfold . real-world effects while those perceptions and heightened fear may have little to do with the world outside the tv , they do have an effect on society , particularly the justice system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " during the last decade , attitudes towards punishment in different western european countries have become significantly harsher , " according to helmut kury of the max planck institute of criminal and international law .
he said that can be traced to the perception of " increasing crime " in general , and the public 's desire that " something be done " about a problem that people fear is skyrocketing . in fact , experts say that the false perception of crime is the phenomenon that is more likely to quickly spiral out of control . often added to the mix are politicians who look to exploit those fears for their own gain by taking tough-on-crime stances , winning votes by promising to build more prisons and pass tougher sentencing laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the researchers at kfn , that will do little to help cut an already fairly low crime rate in germany and threatens to draw resources away from youth and educational centers that criminologists say are more effective preventive measures against future criminality .
" in the us there has been a great increase in tougher sentencing laws and a huge increase in the numbers of prisons built , " said kfn 's kleimann .
" in germany , my fear is that we ’ re beginning to go down that road as well .

42,000 fans watched a brazilian team that after this match is the squad to beat in the tournament . brazil provided the first clear-cut victory in the confederations cup with a 3-0 victory against greece .
the first three matches were all decided by one goal but coach carlos alberto parreira 's team sent a very clear message to the seven other teams that the selecao are hungry for another international title . " the team was well-balanced , " explained parreira .
" sometimes they played too complicated but it was in order how we played . " the brazilian play was definitely in order but unlike the first three matches , it took a while for the first goal to be scored .
and how it was scored set the tone for the remainder of the match because greece got in a situation they prefer not to be in , namely attacking soccer . after 40 minutes in which otto rehhagel 's euro 2004 champs played aggressively enough to hold the brazilians in check , adriano finally broke the gordian knot .
in a moment when the greeks failed to press the inter milan striker who then pulled up from 27 meters and launched a rocket that just squeezed inside the right post past a flying greek keeper antonis nikopolildis . second-half starts off disastrously in the first half , greece missed a golden opportunity in the first half-minute .
the second-half would start with a golden opportunity for brazil .
one they didn ’ t waste . bildunterschrift : greek goalkeeper antonios nikopolidis -lrb- right -rrb- looks as a shot from brazil 's robinho -lrb- left -rrb- hits the back of the net for the 2nd goal hertha berlin 's defender gilberto raced with the ball up the left sideline , crossed it through the greek penalty box where robinho -lrb- photo -rrb- , the replacement of superstar ronaldo , was waiting to place the ball in the net .
40 seconds into the second-half , greece were beaten . at this point , brazil could toy with otto rehhagel 's side like a cat with a wounded mouse .
the selecao handed the ball over to the greeks for the next ten minutes but when the euro champs were unable to take advantage of the brazilian gift , the world champs retook control . ronaldinho had a few good opportunities .
rubinho broke free occasionally and the achilles heel of the greek defense , the right side , was used continuously as a launching pad for attacks by the yellow-clad brazilians . midway through the second-half , a series of substitutions interrupted the flow of the match but important was the entrance of olympique lyon juninho pernambucano in the 77th minute . quality goal seals greece 's fate four minutes later , juninho stepped up to take a free-kick just outside the greek penalty box .
after all , the master of the free-kick ronaldinho had been taken out of the game .
but juninho plays at a level , if not equal , then very close to last year 's footballer of the year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil was head taller all night juninho bent the direct kick over the top of the greek wall , the ball dropped 2 meters in a millisecond , and nikopolidis could only watch as the leather fell into the back of the net .
the very real and classy greek defense of 2004 was transformed into something comparable to the best myths classic greek mythology . " the brazilians were clearly better , " commented rehhagel .
" all 11 players must give 110 % to beat a brazilian team and tonight we only gave about 50 % .
that was n't enough . " so the greeks , after a series of disappointing qualifying matches for next year 's world cup in germany , are finding out that rehhagel no longer has the midas touch .
brazil , on the other hand , was convincing after last week 's bitter 3-1 defeat to argentina in buenos aires .

42,000 fans watched a brazilian team that after this match is the squad to beat in the tournament . brazil provided the first clear-cut victory in the confederations cup with a 3-0 victory against greece .
the first three matches were all decided by one goal but coach carlos alberto parreira 's team sent a very clear message to the seven other teams that the selecao are hungry for another international title . " the team was well-balanced , " explained parreira .
" sometimes they played too complicated but it was in order how we played . " the brazilian play was definitely in order but unlike the first three matches , it took a while for the first goal to be scored .
and how it was scored set the tone for the remainder of the match because greece got in a situation they prefer not to be in , namely attacking soccer . after 40 minutes in which otto rehhagel 's euro 2004 champs played aggressively enough to hold the brazilians in check , adriano finally broke the gordian knot .
in a moment when the greeks failed to press the inter milan striker who then pulled up from 27 meters and launched a rocket that just squeezed inside the right post past a flying greek keeper antonis nikopolildis . second-half starts off disastrously in the first half , greece missed a golden opportunity in the first half-minute .
the second-half would start with a golden opportunity for brazil .

with bath mats , lampshades , vases , key-rings , t-shirts , mouse mats and coffee cups to choose from , you have n't been to berlin if you have n't brought home a souvenir emblazoned with the portly little figure with the trademark bowler hat . the " ampelmännchen " is an industry unto himself , and enjoys the privileged status of being one of the sole features of communist east germany to have survived the end of the iron curtain with his popularity unscathed . in the 1990s , he found himself at the heart of a full-blown rescue campaign when he was faced with possible extinction .
the figure first designed by karl peglau in 1961 had come to symbolize " ostalgie " - the revival of the east german aesthetic as cool kitsch - and when the reunited germany tried replacing him with a slimmed-down western version in 1997 , his fans rallied and saved him from certain death . an east-west stand-off his winning streak has shown no signs of letting up , and the 16-centimeter figure has become so profitable that he 's now at the heart of yet another dispute - one that some have seen as another east-west stand-off . two entrepreneurs from saxony and former west berlin took their fight over the marketing rights to the ampelmännchen to a leipzig court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim roßberg engineer joachim roßberg -lrb- photo -rrb- from zwickau , whose claim to the logo is that he was the only manufacturer of traffic lights in the former east germany , was being sued by designer markus heckhausen , who began incorporating the figure into products in 1995 .
he now sells over forty items , and told the court that he made 2 million euros last year with his ampelmännchen souvenirs . heckhausen - one of the initiators of the " save the amplemännchen " campaign ten years ago - argued that roßberg , who markets just six ampelmännchen products , was failing to make full use of his marketing rights .
legally , if no use of marketing rights is made for five years , the rights can be cancelled .
but roßberg insisted his business makes a tidy 50,000 euros a year . amicable agreement this week , the court proposed the rivals flesh out an amicable solution to the problem - and the unusual love triangle now seems to have a way of surviving . " money wo n't be changing hands , " said roßberg .
instead , he and heckhausen have decided to share and trade certain rights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus heckhausen " according to our agreement , we will simply exchange certain rights to the ampelmann and the newer ampelwoman , " heckhausen explained . roßberg will therefore continue to sell his best-known product , a liquor emblazoned with the logo - despite heckhausen 's scornful remark that " traffic regulations and alcohol are hardly compatible . " but despite such little squabbles , heckhausen is convinced the compromise will work .
" once again , the ampelmännchen has proved to be a positive symbol of reunification , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de touring east germany without the oppression thirteen years after the collapse of communist east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- , kitschy nostalgia for a lost culture still lives on in berlin .

european leaders are gathering in brussels for a two-day summit to give the alliance new momentum .
but can the eu extricate itself from its constitutional tangle ?
dw-world.de talked to commissioner viviane reding . the european union 's mid-year summit takes place against the backdrop of the french and dutch rejection of the constitution and the looming battle over the 2007-2013 budget .
dw-world interviewed viviane reding , eu commissioner for infomation society and media about what 's in stake for the future of the 25-member bloc . dw-world : commission president barroso has called for a period of reflection with regard to ratification of the constitution , what does that actually mean for the constitution ? reding : that means that the constitution is still alive and it is important that it is alive because it has been agreed upon by the political forces of all member states united in the convention , which means this agreement should be the basis for future discussions , but in the referenda procedures we saw that people were not informed about the content of the constitution and very often voted on the problems they have with europe or the problems they have with their governments .
so we think it will be very worthwhile to have a second look at this constitution and to present it to the public in a better way . how long might that take ? that will take as long as it takes until the time is right for a decision .
one can not foresee that ; it could be very short or it could also take several months . how is it possible to regain the faith of the people with regard to the european project ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viviane reding , eu commissioner for information society and media i have been listening to the citizens carefully during the last years , not only during the referenda period , and they have some problems with the way europe is being built .
the constitution was an answer to this problem , but people did n't understand it was a solution to their criticism .
so this is the message we have to bring across . is there a general level of fatigue among europeans when it comes to being members of a union ? i do n't think so .
when you see the figures , although the constitution was rejected by 55 percent of the french people , 70 percent of french people feel european and they want the european union .
they have a problem with the way this eu is developing .
it is also a fact that in the last 10 years the development of this union has been running at such a pace that nobody has been able to follow it - with the big enlargement and several reforms of the institutions .
i believe it is going too quickly for the normal people . how are you going to slow that down ? that is exactly why the president has said we have to calm down for a moment , we have to reflect , we have to explain that the criticism and the problems raised need a solution , and we have to explain how this solution is going to come about .
we can not keep running and running and running , and i think most of all , we must not continue enlarging europe without discussing this with our populations .
the last enlargement was not conceptualized by our citizens . so what does it mean for those countries lining up to join the union ? i think that they will need more time to join the eu than they probably thought in the beginning .
there is no timeframe in mind , this will be discussed according to the merits and the evolution of the different countries but i really feel very strongly that we have first to conceptualize and understand the implications of the last enlargement before we can go to further enlargement . what could have been done differently in order to make the last enlargement more successful ? information .
i have always been astonished at how well the citizens of the 10 new countries were informed about the europe of the 15 , and i was always shocked to see how little the citizens of the europe of 15 knew about the 10 newcomers .
it is not enough to have a big welcoming party , you have to explain the advantages and the dangers to the people , to explain what is being done in order to secure a smooth transition from ten to 15 , and now we are seeing the results .
many of our people have not understood the value and the advantages of enlargement and they are afraid of the pitfalls .
and all this is happening because nobody has ever taken the responsibility of explaining the enlargement to the citizens of the 15 countries . what would you say to those euroskeptics who are trumpeting that the eu is beginning to crumble ? that is wishful thinking and absolutely removed from reality .
europe is a reality and it has been since the world war ii .
even those who have a problem with european institutions today do n't have a problem with europe .
in a globalized world , the only way you can survive and keep your industry and economy strong , is by joining forces .
to have individual countries fighting monster constructions like india or like china would be absolutely ridiculous . would you then reject the idea that there is a will among individual states for a greater degree of sovereignty ? the national states gave up part of their sovereignty in order to share it with others and become more efficient .
foreign trade is one example where one commissioner is negotiating for the 25 .
could you imagine what would happen if the 25 were to negotiate individually ?
they would n't go anywhere .
it is important that we join forces where we need to , in order that each of us becomes more efficient .
there are many other levels of politics , such as taxation , where national states have kept their sovereignty , so it is also very difficult for the people to understand who is doing what in europe , and i do n't think that has been sufficiently explained .
the crux of the matter is that the new constitution sorted this division of labour out in a very very clear way , and it is a pity that this answer to the fears of the people now has to be postponed . what do you hope will be achieved at the summit over the next two days ? i hope they will keep a cool head and make wise decisions .
one should not panic in the face of a problem , but sit down in a quiet way , reflect , and find the appropriate solutions .
there is no use now in running .
i think we have to calm down and think about it , discuss it and then decide on the next steps .
i am sure there are going to be next steps to be taken , europe is going to advance , it is going to do so at a different pace as foreseen in the recent past , but it has no other choice than to move on .
the world around it is advancing , so if europe does not keep pace , it will be at a disadvantage to the rest of the world . tamsin walker interviewed viviane reding send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de can britain save europe ?

european leaders are gathering in brussels for a two-day summit to give the alliance new momentum .
but can the eu extricate itself from its constitutional tangle ?
dw-world.de talked to commissioner viviane reding . the european union 's mid-year summit takes place against the backdrop of the french and dutch rejection of the constitution and the looming battle over the 2007-2013 budget .
dw-world interviewed viviane reding , eu commissioner for infomation society and media about what 's in stake for the future of the 25-member bloc . dw-world : commission president barroso has called for a period of reflection with regard to ratification of the constitution , what does that actually mean for the constitution ? reding : that means that the constitution is still alive and it is important that it is alive because it has been agreed upon by the political forces of all member states united in the convention , which means this agreement should be the basis for future discussions , but in the referenda procedures we saw that people were not informed about the content of the constitution and very often voted on the problems they have with europe or the problems they have with their governments .
so we think it will be very worthwhile to have a second look at this constitution and to present it to the public in a better way . how long might that take ? that will take as long as it takes until the time is right for a decision .
one can not foresee that ; it could be very short or it could also take several months . how is it possible to regain the faith of the people with regard to the european project ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viviane reding , eu commissioner for information society and media i have been listening to the citizens carefully during the last years , not only during the referenda period , and they have some problems with the way europe is being built .
the constitution was an answer to this problem , but people did n't understand it was a solution to their criticism .
so this is the message we have to bring across . is there a general level of fatigue among europeans when it comes to being members of a union ? i do n't think so .
when you see the figures , although the constitution was rejected by 55 percent of the french people , 70 percent of french people feel european and they want the european union .
they have a problem with the way this eu is developing .
it is also a fact that in the last 10 years the development of this union has been running at such a pace that nobody has been able to follow it - with the big enlargement and several reforms of the institutions .
i believe it is going too quickly for the normal people . how are you going to slow that down ? that is exactly why the president has said we have to calm down for a moment , we have to reflect , we have to explain that the criticism and the problems raised need a solution , and we have to explain how this solution is going to come about .
we can not keep running and running and running , and i think most of all , we must not continue enlarging europe without discussing this with our populations .
the last enlargement was not conceptualized by our citizens . so what does it mean for those countries lining up to join the union ? i think that they will need more time to join the eu than they probably thought in the beginning .
there is no timeframe in mind , this will be discussed according to the merits and the evolution of the different countries but i really feel very strongly that we have first to conceptualize and understand the implications of the last enlargement before we can go to further enlargement . what could have been done differently in order to make the last enlargement more successful ? information .
i have always been astonished at how well the citizens of the 10 new countries were informed about the europe of the 15 , and i was always shocked to see how little the citizens of the europe of 15 knew about the 10 newcomers .
it is not enough to have a big welcoming party , you have to explain the advantages and the dangers to the people , to explain what is being done in order to secure a smooth transition from ten to 15 , and now we are seeing the results .
many of our people have not understood the value and the advantages of enlargement and they are afraid of the pitfalls .
and all this is happening because nobody has ever taken the responsibility of explaining the enlargement to the citizens of the 15 countries . what would you say to those euroskeptics who are trumpeting that the eu is beginning to crumble ? that is wishful thinking and absolutely removed from reality .
europe is a reality and it has been since the world war ii .
even those who have a problem with european institutions today do n't have a problem with europe .
in a globalized world , the only way you can survive and keep your industry and economy strong , is by joining forces .
to have individual countries fighting monster constructions like india or like china would be absolutely ridiculous . would you then reject the idea that there is a will among individual states for a greater degree of sovereignty ? the national states gave up part of their sovereignty in order to share it with others and become more efficient .
foreign trade is one example where one commissioner is negotiating for the 25 .
could you imagine what would happen if the 25 were to negotiate individually ?
they would n't go anywhere .
it is important that we join forces where we need to , in order that each of us becomes more efficient .
there are many other levels of politics , such as taxation , where national states have kept their sovereignty , so it is also very difficult for the people to understand who is doing what in europe , and i do n't think that has been sufficiently explained .
the crux of the matter is that the new constitution sorted this division of labour out in a very very clear way , and it is a pity that this answer to the fears of the people now has to be postponed . what do you hope will be achieved at the summit over the next two days ? i hope they will keep a cool head and make wise decisions .
one should not panic in the face of a problem , but sit down in a quiet way , reflect , and find the appropriate solutions .
there is no use now in running .
i think we have to calm down and think about it , discuss it and then decide on the next steps .
i am sure there are going to be next steps to be taken , europe is going to advance , it is going to do so at a different pace as foreseen in the recent past , but it has no other choice than to move on .
the world around it is advancing , so if europe does not keep pace , it will be at a disadvantage to the rest of the world . tamsin walker interviewed viviane reding send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de can britain save europe ?

experts say the media plays a large role in this disconnect between reality and perception . the numbers are encouraging .
between 1993 and 2003 , the number of murders fell by 40.8 percent and domestic burglaries fell by 45.7 percent .

in a survey conducted in 2004 by the criminological research institute of lower saxony -lrb- kfn -rrb- , a representative sample of 2,000 people were asked about their perceptions of crime trends in the previous 10 years .
in almost all categories of crime , respondents grossly overestimated crime rates in germany . while car theft rates actually shrank by 70.5 percent , people surveyed estimated they had increased by 47 percent .
when it came to serious crimes such as murder , the discrepancies grew .
the average estimate was that the murder rate had gone up 27 percent , when in fact it had fallen by 40.8 percent .
sexual murders dropped by 37.5 percent between 1993 and 2003 , but the public estimated that they had increased by a full 260 percent .

experts say the media plays a large role in this disconnect between reality and perception . the numbers are encouraging .
between 1993 and 2003 , the number of murders fell by 40.8 percent and domestic burglaries fell by 45.7 percent .
all in all , crime in general dropped by 2.6 percent during the 10-year period and today , germany is considered one of the industrialized world 's safer countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but among the german populace , the mental picture of the nation 's crime rate is markedly different .
in a survey conducted in 2004 by the criminological research institute of lower saxony -lrb- kfn -rrb- , a representative sample of 2,000 people were asked about their perceptions of crime trends in the previous 10 years .
in almost all categories of crime , respondents grossly overestimated crime rates in germany . while car theft rates actually shrank by 70.5 percent , people surveyed estimated they had increased by 47 percent .
when it came to serious crimes such as murder , the discrepancies grew .
the average estimate was that the murder rate had gone up 27 percent , when in fact it had fallen by 40.8 percent .
sexual murders dropped by 37.5 percent between 1993 and 2003 , but the public estimated that they had increased by a full 260 percent . " the public perception is very different from what we see from the police statistics , " said matthias kleimann , a researcher at kfn who helped author a study of crime perception versus reality , of which the survey was a part . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : such trends have been seen in other western countries as well .
in the uk , a survey in 2003 showed 38 percent of britons thought crime rates had gone up strongly in the previous two years , while only four percent thought they had decreased over that time .
in fact , crime rates there had fallen by around two percent . in the united states , the story is similar .
while crime has fallen fairly consistently since 1991 , the perception is the opposite , as evidenced by the multiplication of gated communities across the nation and the booming business done by one growth industry , home security . what 's to blame ? while the jury is still out on the exact reasons for this disconnect between the real and perceived crime story , experts from several countries where the phenomenon can be seen are pointing their fingers at the media and the style , and amount , of its crime reporting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ look at what kind of news pieces make it into a newscast , the negative stories .
the newsroom theory is most definitely ' bad news is good news ' , " said kleimann . crime for many media outlets , particularly television , is very good news since it is often inexpensive to cover and , at the same time , a big draw for viewers . " you have to look at the way a lot of tv presents crime stories .
they are at the same time highly emotional and affect people directly , " he said .
" when a child disappears , it interests everyone and it often leads the newscast . " he points out that the trend has been noticeable since the mid 1980s , when commercial television networks first became fixtures on the german media landscape .
unlike their public rivals , the commercial networks have ratings to worry about .
like their american counterparts , they have adopted the " if it bleeds , it leads " news philosophy at the expense of drier stories on topics like unemployment or government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the result is a sensational smorgasbord of harrowing crime stories that has skewed the perception of the average viewer . one study showed that in the us , there was a slight decrease in the number of serious crimes over the period 1991 to 1995 .
an analysis of the evening news broadcast by all major television stations , on the other hand , showed the number of televised reports of spectacular violent crimes increased fourfold . real-world effects while those perceptions and heightened fear may have little to do with the world outside the tv , they do have an effect on society , particularly the justice system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " during the last decade , attitudes towards punishment in different western european countries have become significantly harsher , " according to helmut kury of the max planck institute of criminal and international law .
he said that can be traced to the perception of " increasing crime " in general , and the public 's desire that " something be done " about a problem that people fear is skyrocketing . in fact , experts say that the false perception of crime is the phenomenon that is more likely to quickly spiral out of control . often added to the mix are politicians who look to exploit those fears for their own gain by taking tough-on-crime stances , winning votes by promising to build more prisons and pass tougher sentencing laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the researchers at kfn , that will do little to help cut an already fairly low crime rate in germany and threatens to draw resources away from youth and educational centers that criminologists say are more effective preventive measures against future criminality .
" in the us there has been a great increase in tougher sentencing laws and a huge increase in the numbers of prisons built , " said kfn 's kleimann .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.06.2005 safer streets , growing fear großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : false perceptions about crime have people demanding more jails statistics show that violent crime rates have been dropping over the past decade in germany , but fear of crime is rising .
experts say the media plays a large role in this disconnect between reality and perception . the numbers are encouraging .
between 1993 and 2003 , the number of murders fell by 40.8 percent and domestic burglaries fell by 45.7 percent .
all in all , crime in general dropped by 2.6 percent during the 10-year period and today , germany is considered one of the industrialized world 's safer countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but among the german populace , the mental picture of the nation 's crime rate is markedly different .
in a survey conducted in 2004 by the criminological research institute of lower saxony -lrb- kfn -rrb- , a representative sample of 2,000 people were asked about their perceptions of crime trends in the previous 10 years .
in almost all categories of crime , respondents grossly overestimated crime rates in germany . while car theft rates actually shrank by 70.5 percent , people surveyed estimated they had increased by 47 percent .
when it came to serious crimes such as murder , the discrepancies grew .
the average estimate was that the murder rate had gone up 27 percent , when in fact it had fallen by 40.8 percent .
sexual murders dropped by 37.5 percent between 1993 and 2003 , but the public estimated that they had increased by a full 260 percent . " the public perception is very different from what we see from the police statistics , " said matthias kleimann , a researcher at kfn who helped author a study of crime perception versus reality , of which the survey was a part . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : such trends have been seen in other western countries as well .
in the uk , a survey in 2003 showed 38 percent of britons thought crime rates had gone up strongly in the previous two years , while only four percent thought they had decreased over that time .
in fact , crime rates there had fallen by around two percent . in the united states , the story is similar .
while crime has fallen fairly consistently since 1991 , the perception is the opposite , as evidenced by the multiplication of gated communities across the nation and the booming business done by one growth industry , home security . what 's to blame ? while the jury is still out on the exact reasons for this disconnect between the real and perceived crime story , experts from several countries where the phenomenon can be seen are pointing their fingers at the media and the style , and amount , of its crime reporting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ look at what kind of news pieces make it into a newscast , the negative stories .
the newsroom theory is most definitely ' bad news is good news ' , " said kleimann . crime for many media outlets , particularly television , is very good news since it is often inexpensive to cover and , at the same time , a big draw for viewers . " you have to look at the way a lot of tv presents crime stories .
they are at the same time highly emotional and affect people directly , " he said .
" when a child disappears , it interests everyone and it often leads the newscast . " he points out that the trend has been noticeable since the mid 1980s , when commercial television networks first became fixtures on the german media landscape .
unlike their public rivals , the commercial networks have ratings to worry about .
like their american counterparts , they have adopted the " if it bleeds , it leads " news philosophy at the expense of drier stories on topics like unemployment or government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the result is a sensational smorgasbord of harrowing crime stories that has skewed the perception of the average viewer . one study showed that in the us , there was a slight decrease in the number of serious crimes over the period 1991 to 1995 .
an analysis of the evening news broadcast by all major television stations , on the other hand , showed the number of televised reports of spectacular violent crimes increased fourfold . real-world effects while those perceptions and heightened fear may have little to do with the world outside the tv , they do have an effect on society , particularly the justice system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " during the last decade , attitudes towards punishment in different western european countries have become significantly harsher , " according to helmut kury of the max planck institute of criminal and international law .
he said that can be traced to the perception of " increasing crime " in general , and the public 's desire that " something be done " about a problem that people fear is skyrocketing . in fact , experts say that the false perception of crime is the phenomenon that is more likely to quickly spiral out of control . often added to the mix are politicians who look to exploit those fears for their own gain by taking tough-on-crime stances , winning votes by promising to build more prisons and pass tougher sentencing laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the researchers at kfn , that will do little to help cut an already fairly low crime rate in germany and threatens to draw resources away from youth and educational centers that criminologists say are more effective preventive measures against future criminality .
" in the us there has been a great increase in tougher sentencing laws and a huge increase in the numbers of prisons built , " said kfn 's kleimann .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.06.2005 safer streets , growing fear großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : false perceptions about crime have people demanding more jails statistics show that violent crime rates have been dropping over the past decade in germany , but fear of crime is rising .
experts say the media plays a large role in this disconnect between reality and perception . the numbers are encouraging .
between 1993 and 2003 , the number of murders fell by 40.8 percent and domestic burglaries fell by 45.7 percent .
all in all , crime in general dropped by 2.6 percent during the 10-year period and today , germany is considered one of the industrialized world 's safer countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but among the german populace , the mental picture of the nation 's crime rate is markedly different .
in a survey conducted in 2004 by the criminological research institute of lower saxony -lrb- kfn -rrb- , a representative sample of 2,000 people were asked about their perceptions of crime trends in the previous 10 years .
in almost all categories of crime , respondents grossly overestimated crime rates in germany . while car theft rates actually shrank by 70.5 percent , people surveyed estimated they had increased by 47 percent .
when it came to serious crimes such as murder , the discrepancies grew .
the average estimate was that the murder rate had gone up 27 percent , when in fact it had fallen by 40.8 percent .
sexual murders dropped by 37.5 percent between 1993 and 2003 , but the public estimated that they had increased by a full 260 percent . " the public perception is very different from what we see from the police statistics , " said matthias kleimann , a researcher at kfn who helped author a study of crime perception versus reality , of which the survey was a part . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : such trends have been seen in other western countries as well .
in the uk , a survey in 2003 showed 38 percent of britons thought crime rates had gone up strongly in the previous two years , while only four percent thought they had decreased over that time .
in fact , crime rates there had fallen by around two percent . in the united states , the story is similar .
while crime has fallen fairly consistently since 1991 , the perception is the opposite , as evidenced by the multiplication of gated communities across the nation and the booming business done by one growth industry , home security . what 's to blame ? while the jury is still out on the exact reasons for this disconnect between the real and perceived crime story , experts from several countries where the phenomenon can be seen are pointing their fingers at the media and the style , and amount , of its crime reporting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ look at what kind of news pieces make it into a newscast , the negative stories .
the newsroom theory is most definitely ' bad news is good news ' , " said kleimann . crime for many media outlets , particularly television , is very good news since it is often inexpensive to cover and , at the same time , a big draw for viewers . " you have to look at the way a lot of tv presents crime stories .
they are at the same time highly emotional and affect people directly , " he said .
" when a child disappears , it interests everyone and it often leads the newscast . " he points out that the trend has been noticeable since the mid 1980s , when commercial television networks first became fixtures on the german media landscape .
unlike their public rivals , the commercial networks have ratings to worry about .
like their american counterparts , they have adopted the " if it bleeds , it leads " news philosophy at the expense of drier stories on topics like unemployment or government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the result is a sensational smorgasbord of harrowing crime stories that has skewed the perception of the average viewer . one study showed that in the us , there was a slight decrease in the number of serious crimes over the period 1991 to 1995 .
an analysis of the evening news broadcast by all major television stations , on the other hand , showed the number of televised reports of spectacular violent crimes increased fourfold . real-world effects while those perceptions and heightened fear may have little to do with the world outside the tv , they do have an effect on society , particularly the justice system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " during the last decade , attitudes towards punishment in different western european countries have become significantly harsher , " according to helmut kury of the max planck institute of criminal and international law .
he said that can be traced to the perception of " increasing crime " in general , and the public 's desire that " something be done " about a problem that people fear is skyrocketing . in fact , experts say that the false perception of crime is the phenomenon that is more likely to quickly spiral out of control . often added to the mix are politicians who look to exploit those fears for their own gain by taking tough-on-crime stances , winning votes by promising to build more prisons and pass tougher sentencing laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the researchers at kfn , that will do little to help cut an already fairly low crime rate in germany and threatens to draw resources away from youth and educational centers that criminologists say are more effective preventive measures against future criminality .
" in the us there has been a great increase in tougher sentencing laws and a huge increase in the numbers of prisons built , " said kfn 's kleimann .
" in germany , my fear is that we ’ re beginning to go down that road as well . " kyle james , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany moves to protect stalking victims germany 's upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , has passed a bill that would provide better protection for victims of stalking .

experts say the media plays a large role in this disconnect between reality and perception . the numbers are encouraging .
between 1993 and 2003 , the number of murders fell by 40.8 percent and domestic burglaries fell by 45.7 percent .
all in all , crime in general dropped by 2.6 percent during the 10-year period and today , germany is considered one of the industrialized world 's safer countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but among the german populace , the mental picture of the nation 's crime rate is markedly different .
in a survey conducted in 2004 by the criminological research institute of lower saxony -lrb- kfn -rrb- , a representative sample of 2,000 people were asked about their perceptions of crime trends in the previous 10 years .
in almost all categories of crime , respondents grossly overestimated crime rates in germany . while car theft rates actually shrank by 70.5 percent , people surveyed estimated they had increased by 47 percent .
when it came to serious crimes such as murder , the discrepancies grew .
the average estimate was that the murder rate had gone up 27 percent , when in fact it had fallen by 40.8 percent .
sexual murders dropped by 37.5 percent between 1993 and 2003 , but the public estimated that they had increased by a full 260 percent . " the public perception is very different from what we see from the police statistics , " said matthias kleimann , a researcher at kfn who helped author a study of crime perception versus reality , of which the survey was a part . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : such trends have been seen in other western countries as well .
in the uk , a survey in 2003 showed 38 percent of britons thought crime rates had gone up strongly in the previous two years , while only four percent thought they had decreased over that time .
in fact , crime rates there had fallen by around two percent . in the united states , the story is similar .

an analysis of the evening news broadcast by all major television stations , on the other hand , showed the number of televised reports of spectacular violent crimes increased fourfold . real-world effects while those perceptions and heightened fear may have little to do with the world outside the tv , they do have an effect on society , particularly the justice system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " during the last decade , attitudes towards punishment in different western european countries have become significantly harsher , " according to helmut kury of the max planck institute of criminal and international law .

experts say the media plays a large role in this disconnect between reality and perception . the numbers are encouraging .
between 1993 and 2003 , the number of murders fell by 40.8 percent and domestic burglaries fell by 45.7 percent .
all in all , crime in general dropped by 2.6 percent during the 10-year period and today , germany is considered one of the industrialized world 's safer countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but among the german populace , the mental picture of the nation 's crime rate is markedly different .
in a survey conducted in 2004 by the criminological research institute of lower saxony -lrb- kfn -rrb- , a representative sample of 2,000 people were asked about their perceptions of crime trends in the previous 10 years .
in almost all categories of crime , respondents grossly overestimated crime rates in germany . while car theft rates actually shrank by 70.5 percent , people surveyed estimated they had increased by 47 percent .
when it came to serious crimes such as murder , the discrepancies grew .
the average estimate was that the murder rate had gone up 27 percent , when in fact it had fallen by 40.8 percent .
sexual murders dropped by 37.5 percent between 1993 and 2003 , but the public estimated that they had increased by a full 260 percent . " the public perception is very different from what we see from the police statistics , " said matthias kleimann , a researcher at kfn who helped author a study of crime perception versus reality , of which the survey was a part . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : such trends have been seen in other western countries as well .
in the uk , a survey in 2003 showed 38 percent of britons thought crime rates had gone up strongly in the previous two years , while only four percent thought they had decreased over that time .
in fact , crime rates there had fallen by around two percent . in the united states , the story is similar .
while crime has fallen fairly consistently since 1991 , the perception is the opposite , as evidenced by the multiplication of gated communities across the nation and the booming business done by one growth industry , home security . what 's to blame ? while the jury is still out on the exact reasons for this disconnect between the real and perceived crime story , experts from several countries where the phenomenon can be seen are pointing their fingers at the media and the style , and amount , of its crime reporting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ look at what kind of news pieces make it into a newscast , the negative stories .
the newsroom theory is most definitely ' bad news is good news ' , " said kleimann . crime for many media outlets , particularly television , is very good news since it is often inexpensive to cover and , at the same time , a big draw for viewers .

european leaders are gathering in brussels for a two-day summit to give the alliance new momentum .
but can the eu extricate itself from its constitutional tangle ?
dw-world.de talked to commissioner viviane reding . the european union 's mid-year summit takes place against the backdrop of the french and dutch rejection of the constitution and the looming battle over the 2007-2013 budget .
dw-world interviewed viviane reding , eu commissioner for infomation society and media about what 's in stake for the future of the 25-member bloc . dw-world : commission president barroso has called for a period of reflection with regard to ratification of the constitution , what does that actually mean for the constitution ? reding : that means that the constitution is still alive and it is important that it is alive because it has been agreed upon by the political forces of all member states united in the convention , which means this agreement should be the basis for future discussions , but in the referenda procedures we saw that people were not informed about the content of the constitution and very often voted on the problems they have with europe or the problems they have with their governments .
so we think it will be very worthwhile to have a second look at this constitution and to present it to the public in a better way . how long might that take ? that will take as long as it takes until the time is right for a decision .
one can not foresee that ; it could be very short or it could also take several months . how is it possible to regain the faith of the people with regard to the european project ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viviane reding , eu commissioner for information society and media i have been listening to the citizens carefully during the last years , not only during the referenda period , and they have some problems with the way europe is being built .
the constitution was an answer to this problem , but people did n't understand it was a solution to their criticism .
so this is the message we have to bring across . is there a general level of fatigue among europeans when it comes to being members of a union ? i do n't think so .
when you see the figures , although the constitution was rejected by 55 percent of the french people , 70 percent of french people feel european and they want the european union .
they have a problem with the way this eu is developing .
it is also a fact that in the last 10 years the development of this union has been running at such a pace that nobody has been able to follow it - with the big enlargement and several reforms of the institutions .
i believe it is going too quickly for the normal people . how are you going to slow that down ? that is exactly why the president has said we have to calm down for a moment , we have to reflect , we have to explain that the criticism and the problems raised need a solution , and we have to explain how this solution is going to come about .
we can not keep running and running and running , and i think most of all , we must not continue enlarging europe without discussing this with our populations .
the last enlargement was not conceptualized by our citizens . so what does it mean for those countries lining up to join the union ? i think that they will need more time to join the eu than they probably thought in the beginning .
there is no timeframe in mind , this will be discussed according to the merits and the evolution of the different countries but i really feel very strongly that we have first to conceptualize and understand the implications of the last enlargement before we can go to further enlargement . what could have been done differently in order to make the last enlargement more successful ? information .
i have always been astonished at how well the citizens of the 10 new countries were informed about the europe of the 15 , and i was always shocked to see how little the citizens of the europe of 15 knew about the 10 newcomers .
it is not enough to have a big welcoming party , you have to explain the advantages and the dangers to the people , to explain what is being done in order to secure a smooth transition from ten to 15 , and now we are seeing the results .
many of our people have not understood the value and the advantages of enlargement and they are afraid of the pitfalls .
and all this is happening because nobody has ever taken the responsibility of explaining the enlargement to the citizens of the 15 countries . what would you say to those euroskeptics who are trumpeting that the eu is beginning to crumble ? that is wishful thinking and absolutely removed from reality .
europe is a reality and it has been since the world war ii .
even those who have a problem with european institutions today do n't have a problem with europe .
in a globalized world , the only way you can survive and keep your industry and economy strong , is by joining forces .
to have individual countries fighting monster constructions like india or like china would be absolutely ridiculous . would you then reject the idea that there is a will among individual states for a greater degree of sovereignty ? the national states gave up part of their sovereignty in order to share it with others and become more efficient .
foreign trade is one example where one commissioner is negotiating for the 25 .
could you imagine what would happen if the 25 were to negotiate individually ?
they would n't go anywhere .
it is important that we join forces where we need to , in order that each of us becomes more efficient .
there are many other levels of politics , such as taxation , where national states have kept their sovereignty , so it is also very difficult for the people to understand who is doing what in europe , and i do n't think that has been sufficiently explained .
the crux of the matter is that the new constitution sorted this division of labour out in a very very clear way , and it is a pity that this answer to the fears of the people now has to be postponed . what do you hope will be achieved at the summit over the next two days ? i hope they will keep a cool head and make wise decisions .
one should not panic in the face of a problem , but sit down in a quiet way , reflect , and find the appropriate solutions .
there is no use now in running .
i think we have to calm down and think about it , discuss it and then decide on the next steps .
i am sure there are going to be next steps to be taken , europe is going to advance , it is going to do so at a different pace as foreseen in the recent past , but it has no other choice than to move on .
the world around it is advancing , so if europe does not keep pace , it will be at a disadvantage to the rest of the world . tamsin walker interviewed viviane reding send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de can britain save europe ?

there is no timeframe in mind , this will be discussed according to the merits and the evolution of the different countries but i really feel very strongly that we have first to conceptualize and understand the implications of the last enlargement before we can go to further enlargement . what could have been done differently in order to make the last enlargement more successful ? information .
i have always been astonished at how well the citizens of the 10 new countries were informed about the europe of the 15 , and i was always shocked to see how little the citizens of the europe of 15 knew about the 10 newcomers .
it is not enough to have a big welcoming party , you have to explain the advantages and the dangers to the people , to explain what is being done in order to secure a smooth transition from ten to 15 , and now we are seeing the results .
many of our people have not understood the value and the advantages of enlargement and they are afraid of the pitfalls .
and all this is happening because nobody has ever taken the responsibility of explaining the enlargement to the citizens of the 15 countries . what would you say to those euroskeptics who are trumpeting that the eu is beginning to crumble ? that is wishful thinking and absolutely removed from reality .
europe is a reality and it has been since the world war ii .
even those who have a problem with european institutions today do n't have a problem with europe .
in a globalized world , the only way you can survive and keep your industry and economy strong , is by joining forces .
to have individual countries fighting monster constructions like india or like china would be absolutely ridiculous . would you then reject the idea that there is a will among individual states for a greater degree of sovereignty ? the national states gave up part of their sovereignty in order to share it with others and become more efficient .
foreign trade is one example where one commissioner is negotiating for the 25 .
could you imagine what would happen if the 25 were to negotiate individually ?
they would n't go anywhere .
it is important that we join forces where we need to , in order that each of us becomes more efficient .
there are many other levels of politics , such as taxation , where national states have kept their sovereignty , so it is also very difficult for the people to understand who is doing what in europe , and i do n't think that has been sufficiently explained .
the crux of the matter is that the new constitution sorted this division of labour out in a very very clear way , and it is a pity that this answer to the fears of the people now has to be postponed . what do you hope will be achieved at the summit over the next two days ? i hope they will keep a cool head and make wise decisions .
one should not panic in the face of a problem , but sit down in a quiet way , reflect , and find the appropriate solutions .
there is no use now in running .
i think we have to calm down and think about it , discuss it and then decide on the next steps .
i am sure there are going to be next steps to be taken , europe is going to advance , it is going to do so at a different pace as foreseen in the recent past , but it has no other choice than to move on .

european leaders are gathering in brussels for a two-day summit to give the alliance new momentum .
but can the eu extricate itself from its constitutional tangle ?
dw-world.de talked to commissioner viviane reding . the european union 's mid-year summit takes place against the backdrop of the french and dutch rejection of the constitution and the looming battle over the 2007-2013 budget .
dw-world interviewed viviane reding , eu commissioner for infomation society and media about what 's in stake for the future of the 25-member bloc . dw-world : commission president barroso has called for a period of reflection with regard to ratification of the constitution , what does that actually mean for the constitution ? reding : that means that the constitution is still alive and it is important that it is alive because it has been agreed upon by the political forces of all member states united in the convention , which means this agreement should be the basis for future discussions , but in the referenda procedures we saw that people were not informed about the content of the constitution and very often voted on the problems they have with europe or the problems they have with their governments .
so we think it will be very worthwhile to have a second look at this constitution and to present it to the public in a better way . how long might that take ? that will take as long as it takes until the time is right for a decision .
one can not foresee that ; it could be very short or it could also take several months . how is it possible to regain the faith of the people with regard to the european project ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viviane reding , eu commissioner for information society and media i have been listening to the citizens carefully during the last years , not only during the referenda period , and they have some problems with the way europe is being built .
the constitution was an answer to this problem , but people did n't understand it was a solution to their criticism .
so this is the message we have to bring across . is there a general level of fatigue among europeans when it comes to being members of a union ? i do n't think so .
when you see the figures , although the constitution was rejected by 55 percent of the french people , 70 percent of french people feel european and they want the european union .
they have a problem with the way this eu is developing .
it is also a fact that in the last 10 years the development of this union has been running at such a pace that nobody has been able to follow it - with the big enlargement and several reforms of the institutions .
i believe it is going too quickly for the normal people . how are you going to slow that down ? that is exactly why the president has said we have to calm down for a moment , we have to reflect , we have to explain that the criticism and the problems raised need a solution , and we have to explain how this solution is going to come about .
we can not keep running and running and running , and i think most of all , we must not continue enlarging europe without discussing this with our populations .

one should not panic in the face of a problem , but sit down in a quiet way , reflect , and find the appropriate solutions .
there is no use now in running .
i think we have to calm down and think about it , discuss it and then decide on the next steps .
i am sure there are going to be next steps to be taken , europe is going to advance , it is going to do so at a different pace as foreseen in the recent past , but it has no other choice than to move on .
the world around it is advancing , so if europe does not keep pace , it will be at a disadvantage to the rest of the world . tamsin walker interviewed viviane reding send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de can britain save europe ?

but who actually owns the marketing rights to this much-loved motif ? you name it , he 's been on it .
with bath mats , lampshades , vases , key-rings , t-shirts , mouse mats and coffee cups to choose from , you have n't been to berlin if you have n't brought home a souvenir emblazoned with the portly little figure with the trademark bowler hat . the " ampelmännchen " is an industry unto himself , and enjoys the privileged status of being one of the sole features of communist east germany to have survived the end of the iron curtain with his popularity unscathed . in the 1990s , he found himself at the heart of a full-blown rescue campaign when he was faced with possible extinction .
the figure first designed by karl peglau in 1961 had come to symbolize " ostalgie " - the revival of the east german aesthetic as cool kitsch - and when the reunited germany tried replacing him with a slimmed-down western version in 1997 , his fans rallied and saved him from certain death . an east-west stand-off his winning streak has shown no signs of letting up , and the 16-centimeter figure has become so profitable that he 's now at the heart of yet another dispute - one that some have seen as another east-west stand-off . two entrepreneurs from saxony and former west berlin took their fight over the marketing rights to the ampelmännchen to a leipzig court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim roßberg engineer joachim roßberg -lrb- photo -rrb- from zwickau , whose claim to the logo is that he was the only manufacturer of traffic lights in the former east germany , was being sued by designer markus heckhausen , who began incorporating the figure into products in 1995 .

they agreed to suspend the ratification of the eu constitution . going into the crisis meeting in brussels , germany still clung to hope for the 25-member bloc 's planned charter , already ratified by its parliament .
" the constitutional treaty will be part of the eu 's future .
to say ' the constitution is dead ' also discredits the german ' yes ' on the constitution , " said german chancellor gerhard schröder . but , at a pre-summit meeting outside brussels , " a vast majority " of conservative leaders favored suspending ratification of the charter , said european people 's party parliamentary chief hans-gert pöttering . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder , left , meets with luxembourg prime minister jean claude juncker luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , who holds the eu 's presidency , and eu commision chief jose barroso both " proposed suspending the process , " said pöttering . dutch europe minister atzo nicolai ruled out a new referendum on the spurned constitution , saying : " it is dead in the netherlands , this treaty . " the treaty must be ratified by every eu member to become effective , prompting swedish prime minister göran persson to question the use of carrying on as scheduled with a vote in his own country . " i want a clear message from france and the netherlands about how they will deal with their ' no ' votes .
-lrb- if -rrb- there is no clear message , i think we will also have a delay , " persson said .
danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen echoed the comments .
" we ca n't put the treaty to a vote in denmark if the text will afterwards be changed .
it does n't make sense .
it is a clear perequisite for continuing the process that we get this clarification , " he said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from l-r german foreign minister joschka fischer , german chancellor gerhard schroeder , dutch prime minister jan-peter balkenende and austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel chat during the round table at the beginning of the two days european summit in brussels according to diplomats in brussels , all 25 member states were in agreement that the ratification process should be suspended until at least next year while they discuss the future direction of the european project .
french president jacques chirac also said he had doubts about future expansion plans of the bloc .
he called for a special summit to discuss the future direction of the union . " can the union in this new situation really expand without having the proper institutions for it ? " he asked the fellow leaders in a prepared text .
" i think we need to discuss these important questions together . " budget deadlock a deal on the eu 's 2007-2013 budget - blocked partly by britain 's refusal to surrender a hard-won rebate - would only be possible if all 25 members were ready to compromise , said schröder , who was gloomy about the prospects for an agreement . " i do n't think there will be a deal on the budget .
the differences are too big , " he said .
" i 'm not optimistic about a deal . " at the end of the first day of the meeting , his prediction looked correct , since a budget deal seemed far away .
british prime minister tony blair has thus far refused to release his grip on the uk rebate , despite a last-minute offer by the eu presidency . luxembourg 's juncker suggested freezing , not cutting the british rebate , which was worth 5.3 billion euros last year and was projected to average 7.1 billion euros annually between 2007 and 2013 .
any future reductions in the rebate would be tied to a reduction in eu agricultural aid after 2013 . but no country gave ground . farm subsidies vs. rebate britain is refusing to accept a change to its budget rebate without a rethink of eu farm subsidies that gobble up 40 percent of the entire eu budget .
the rebate , sancrosanct to britons across the political spectrum , has been in place since 1984 to compensate for the relatively small amount that britain reaps from the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn , left , gestures while speaking with british foreign secretary jack straw , center , and eu foreign policy chief javier solana foreign secretary jack straw set out britain 's stance as eu leaders voiced little hope of a breakthrough on the budget talks . " the proposals from the presidency are not acceptable to us , " straw said .
" that 's one of the reasons why there 's going to be difficulty " during the conclave , he told reporters . blair 's spokesman said the cabinet backed his refusal to give way on the rebate , secured by the iron-willed former british leader , margaret thatcher , in 1984 to compensate for the relatively small amount london received in eu farm aid . the rest of europe stepped up the pressure on blair , including germany . " there is absolutely no justification any longer for the british rebate , " the german leader said .
" britain is the sixth biggest per capita beneficiary of the eu budget but ranks far below that as a contributor . " blair , who takes over the eu presidency on july 1 , is pushing for a " fundamental debate " about the bloc 's future , including cap , which gives generous subsidies to farmers , especially those in france . upping the ante , a british spokesman said it was not essential for the summit to agree the 2007- 2013 spending plans - leaving open the prospect of it being delayed until after the upcoming british eu presidency . afp / dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " europe ca n't keep running " european leaders are gathering in brussels for a two-day summit to give the alliance new momentum .

coach ricardo la volpe 's side will have to play more convincingly to advance . when jose fonseca climbed up to head in a cross and give his side a 2-1 lead over japan , the breath of relief from the mexican bench was almost audible . after playing a back-and-forth game for most of the first half and failing to solve the smaller japanese defense , fonseca 's score off of a gonzalo pineda pass in the 64th minute sent mexico off to a first match victory . up until that point , mexico had few opportunities after evening the score late in the first half .
though controlling the match at the beginning , la volpe 's side had a tough time breaking through the japanese defense . counter brings relief the small crowd of 21,000 in hanover 's stadium had something to cheer about early on as japan responded quickly on a counter .
akira kaji got free down the right side of the field and passed in to a streaking atsushi yanagisawa .
the midfielder was marked by mexico 's ricardo osorio , who actually deflected the ball into his own net after it skipped through yanagisawa 's legs .
the 1-0 lead was a surprise , but not without credit to the resilient japanese side .
mexico responded by not really responding at all .
the midfield continued having a tough time breaking down the defense , preferring to build up their attack slowly , rather than unsettling the japanese defenders with quick passes . mexico roars back mexican striker jared borgetti had a golden opportunity robbed by some good goalkeeping when his close range header was blocked off by japan 's small , but nimble goalie yoshikatsu kawaguchi . kawaguchi looked his size , though , on the goal that evened it up .
midfielder zinha sprung free on the left side of the penalty box and bent a nice shot into the upper right hand corner of the net that a diving kawaguchi was helpless to defend . slow to start in the second half , mexico finally found the key to the japanese defense that until then would not unlock .
the size difference between fonseca and his markers attracted the attention of pineda , who lofted a nice cross to him in the center , which the midfielder had no problem putting away . japan 's desperation attempts in the final phase of the game were easily shut down by mexico , which had finally found its footing .

the midfield continued having a tough time breaking down the defense , preferring to build up their attack slowly , rather than unsettling the japanese defenders with quick passes . mexico roars back mexican striker jared borgetti had a golden opportunity robbed by some good goalkeeping when his close range header was blocked off by japan 's small , but nimble goalie yoshikatsu kawaguchi . kawaguchi looked his size , though , on the goal that evened it up .
midfielder zinha sprung free on the left side of the penalty box and bent a nice shot into the upper right hand corner of the net that a diving kawaguchi was helpless to defend . slow to start in the second half , mexico finally found the key to the japanese defense that until then would not unlock .
the size difference between fonseca and his markers attracted the attention of pineda , who lofted a nice cross to him in the center , which the midfielder had no problem putting away . japan 's desperation attempts in the final phase of the game were easily shut down by mexico , which had finally found its footing .

42,000 fans watched a brazilian team that after this match is the squad to beat in the tournament . brazil provided the first clear-cut victory in the confederations cup with a 3-0 victory against greece .
the first three matches were all decided by one goal but coach carlos alberto parreira 's team sent a very clear message to the seven other teams that the selecao are hungry for another international title . " the team was well-balanced , " explained parreira .
" sometimes they played too complicated but it was in order how we played . " the brazilian play was definitely in order but unlike the first three matches , it took a while for the first goal to be scored .
and how it was scored set the tone for the remainder of the match because greece got in a situation they prefer not to be in , namely attacking soccer . after 40 minutes in which otto rehhagel 's euro 2004 champs played aggressively enough to hold the brazilians in check , adriano finally broke the gordian knot .
in a moment when the greeks failed to press the inter milan striker who then pulled up from 27 meters and launched a rocket that just squeezed inside the right post past a flying greek keeper antonis nikopolildis . second-half starts off disastrously in the first half , greece missed a golden opportunity in the first half-minute .
the second-half would start with a golden opportunity for brazil .
one they didn ’ t waste . bildunterschrift : greek goalkeeper antonios nikopolidis -lrb- right -rrb- looks as a shot from brazil 's robinho -lrb- left -rrb- hits the back of the net for the 2nd goal hertha berlin 's defender gilberto raced with the ball up the left sideline , crossed it through the greek penalty box where robinho -lrb- photo -rrb- , the replacement of superstar ronaldo , was waiting to place the ball in the net .
40 seconds into the second-half , greece were beaten . at this point , brazil could toy with otto rehhagel 's side like a cat with a wounded mouse .
the selecao handed the ball over to the greeks for the next ten minutes but when the euro champs were unable to take advantage of the brazilian gift , the world champs retook control . ronaldinho had a few good opportunities .
rubinho broke free occasionally and the achilles heel of the greek defense , the right side , was used continuously as a launching pad for attacks by the yellow-clad brazilians . midway through the second-half , a series of substitutions interrupted the flow of the match but important was the entrance of olympique lyon juninho pernambucano in the 77th minute . quality goal seals greece 's fate four minutes later , juninho stepped up to take a free-kick just outside the greek penalty box .
after all , the master of the free-kick ronaldinho had been taken out of the game .
but juninho plays at a level , if not equal , then very close to last year 's footballer of the year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil was head taller all night juninho bent the direct kick over the top of the greek wall , the ball dropped 2 meters in a millisecond , and nikopolidis could only watch as the leather fell into the back of the net .
the very real and classy greek defense of 2004 was transformed into something comparable to the best myths classic greek mythology . " the brazilians were clearly better , " commented rehhagel .
" all 11 players must give 110 % to beat a brazilian team and tonight we only gave about 50 % .
that was n't enough . " so the greeks , after a series of disappointing qualifying matches for next year 's world cup in germany , are finding out that rehhagel no longer has the midas touch .
brazil , on the other hand , was convincing after last week 's bitter 3-1 defeat to argentina in buenos aires .

42,000 fans watched a brazilian team that after this match is the squad to beat in the tournament . brazil provided the first clear-cut victory in the confederations cup with a 3-0 victory against greece .
the first three matches were all decided by one goal but coach carlos alberto parreira 's team sent a very clear message to the seven other teams that the selecao are hungry for another international title . " the team was well-balanced , " explained parreira .
" sometimes they played too complicated but it was in order how we played . " the brazilian play was definitely in order but unlike the first three matches , it took a while for the first goal to be scored .
and how it was scored set the tone for the remainder of the match because greece got in a situation they prefer not to be in , namely attacking soccer . after 40 minutes in which otto rehhagel 's euro 2004 champs played aggressively enough to hold the brazilians in check , adriano finally broke the gordian knot .
in a moment when the greeks failed to press the inter milan striker who then pulled up from 27 meters and launched a rocket that just squeezed inside the right post past a flying greek keeper antonis nikopolildis . second-half starts off disastrously in the first half , greece missed a golden opportunity in the first half-minute .
the second-half would start with a golden opportunity for brazil .
one they didn ’ t waste . bildunterschrift : greek goalkeeper antonios nikopolidis -lrb- right -rrb- looks as a shot from brazil 's robinho -lrb- left -rrb- hits the back of the net for the 2nd goal hertha berlin 's defender gilberto raced with the ball up the left sideline , crossed it through the greek penalty box where robinho -lrb- photo -rrb- , the replacement of superstar ronaldo , was waiting to place the ball in the net .
40 seconds into the second-half , greece were beaten . at this point , brazil could toy with otto rehhagel 's side like a cat with a wounded mouse .
the selecao handed the ball over to the greeks for the next ten minutes but when the euro champs were unable to take advantage of the brazilian gift , the world champs retook control . ronaldinho had a few good opportunities .
rubinho broke free occasionally and the achilles heel of the greek defense , the right side , was used continuously as a launching pad for attacks by the yellow-clad brazilians . midway through the second-half , a series of substitutions interrupted the flow of the match but important was the entrance of olympique lyon juninho pernambucano in the 77th minute . quality goal seals greece 's fate four minutes later , juninho stepped up to take a free-kick just outside the greek penalty box .
after all , the master of the free-kick ronaldinho had been taken out of the game .
but juninho plays at a level , if not equal , then very close to last year 's footballer of the year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil was head taller all night juninho bent the direct kick over the top of the greek wall , the ball dropped 2 meters in a millisecond , and nikopolidis could only watch as the leather fell into the back of the net .
the very real and classy greek defense of 2004 was transformed into something comparable to the best myths classic greek mythology . " the brazilians were clearly better , " commented rehhagel .
" all 11 players must give 110 % to beat a brazilian team and tonight we only gave about 50 % .
that was n't enough . " so the greeks , after a series of disappointing qualifying matches for next year 's world cup in germany , are finding out that rehhagel no longer has the midas touch .
brazil , on the other hand , was convincing after last week 's bitter 3-1 defeat to argentina in buenos aires .

experts say the media plays a large role in this disconnect between reality and perception . the numbers are encouraging .
between 1993 and 2003 , the number of murders fell by 40.8 percent and domestic burglaries fell by 45.7 percent .
all in all , crime in general dropped by 2.6 percent during the 10-year period and today , germany is considered one of the industrialized world 's safer countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but among the german populace , the mental picture of the nation 's crime rate is markedly different .
in a survey conducted in 2004 by the criminological research institute of lower saxony -lrb- kfn -rrb- , a representative sample of 2,000 people were asked about their perceptions of crime trends in the previous 10 years .
in almost all categories of crime , respondents grossly overestimated crime rates in germany . while car theft rates actually shrank by 70.5 percent , people surveyed estimated they had increased by 47 percent .
when it came to serious crimes such as murder , the discrepancies grew .
the average estimate was that the murder rate had gone up 27 percent , when in fact it had fallen by 40.8 percent .
sexual murders dropped by 37.5 percent between 1993 and 2003 , but the public estimated that they had increased by a full 260 percent . " the public perception is very different from what we see from the police statistics , " said matthias kleimann , a researcher at kfn who helped author a study of crime perception versus reality , of which the survey was a part . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : such trends have been seen in other western countries as well .

in fact , crime rates there had fallen by around two percent . in the united states , the story is similar .

" you have to look at the way a lot of tv presents crime stories .
they are at the same time highly emotional and affect people directly , " he said .
" when a child disappears , it interests everyone and it often leads the newscast . " he points out that the trend has been noticeable since the mid 1980s , when commercial television networks first became fixtures on the german media landscape .

an analysis of the evening news broadcast by all major television stations , on the other hand , showed the number of televised reports of spectacular violent crimes increased fourfold . real-world effects while those perceptions and heightened fear may have little to do with the world outside the tv , they do have an effect on society , particularly the justice system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " during the last decade , attitudes towards punishment in different western european countries have become significantly harsher , " according to helmut kury of the max planck institute of criminal and international law .

" the constitutional treaty will be part of the eu 's future .
to say ' the constitution is dead ' also discredits the german ' yes ' on the constitution , " said german chancellor gerhard schröder . but , at a pre-summit meeting outside brussels , " a vast majority " of conservative leaders favored suspending ratification of the charter , said european people 's party parliamentary chief hans-gert pöttering . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder , left , meets with luxembourg prime minister jean claude juncker luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , who holds the eu 's presidency , and eu commision chief jose barroso both " proposed suspending the process , " said pöttering . dutch europe minister atzo nicolai ruled out a new referendum on the spurned constitution , saying : " it is dead in the netherlands , this treaty .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from l-r german foreign minister joschka fischer , german chancellor gerhard schroeder , dutch prime minister jan-peter balkenende and austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel chat during the round table at the beginning of the two days european summit in brussels according to diplomats in brussels , all 25 member states were in agreement that the ratification process should be suspended until at least next year while they discuss the future direction of the european project .
french president jacques chirac also said he had doubts about future expansion plans of the bloc .
he called for a special summit to discuss the future direction of the union . " can the union in this new situation really expand without having the proper institutions for it ? " he asked the fellow leaders in a prepared text .
" i think we need to discuss these important questions together . " budget deadlock a deal on the eu 's 2007-2013 budget - blocked partly by britain 's refusal to surrender a hard-won rebate - would only be possible if all 25 members were ready to compromise , said schröder , who was gloomy about the prospects for an agreement . " i do n't think there will be a deal on the budget .
the differences are too big , " he said .
" i 'm not optimistic about a deal . " at the end of the first day of the meeting , his prediction looked correct , since a budget deal seemed far away .
british prime minister tony blair has thus far refused to release his grip on the uk rebate , despite a last-minute offer by the eu presidency . luxembourg 's juncker suggested freezing , not cutting the british rebate , which was worth 5.3 billion euros last year and was projected to average 7.1 billion euros annually between 2007 and 2013 .
any future reductions in the rebate would be tied to a reduction in eu agricultural aid after 2013 . but no country gave ground . farm subsidies vs. rebate britain is refusing to accept a change to its budget rebate without a rethink of eu farm subsidies that gobble up 40 percent of the entire eu budget .

" that 's one of the reasons why there 's going to be difficulty " during the conclave , he told reporters . blair 's spokesman said the cabinet backed his refusal to give way on the rebate , secured by the iron-willed former british leader , margaret thatcher , in 1984 to compensate for the relatively small amount london received in eu farm aid . the rest of europe stepped up the pressure on blair , including germany . " there is absolutely no justification any longer for the british rebate , " the german leader said .
" britain is the sixth biggest per capita beneficiary of the eu budget but ranks far below that as a contributor .

they agreed to suspend the ratification of the eu constitution . going into the crisis meeting in brussels , germany still clung to hope for the 25-member bloc 's planned charter , already ratified by its parliament .
" the constitutional treaty will be part of the eu 's future .
to say ' the constitution is dead ' also discredits the german ' yes ' on the constitution , " said german chancellor gerhard schröder . but , at a pre-summit meeting outside brussels , " a vast majority " of conservative leaders favored suspending ratification of the charter , said european people 's party parliamentary chief hans-gert pöttering . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder , left , meets with luxembourg prime minister jean claude juncker luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , who holds the eu 's presidency , and eu commision chief jose barroso both " proposed suspending the process , " said pöttering . dutch europe minister atzo nicolai ruled out a new referendum on the spurned constitution , saying : " it is dead in the netherlands , this treaty .

42,000 fans watched a brazilian team that after this match is the squad to beat in the tournament . brazil provided the first clear-cut victory in the confederations cup with a 3-0 victory against greece .
the first three matches were all decided by one goal but coach carlos alberto parreira 's team sent a very clear message to the seven other teams that the selecao are hungry for another international title . " the team was well-balanced , " explained parreira .
" sometimes they played too complicated but it was in order how we played . " the brazilian play was definitely in order but unlike the first three matches , it took a while for the first goal to be scored .
and how it was scored set the tone for the remainder of the match because greece got in a situation they prefer not to be in , namely attacking soccer . after 40 minutes in which otto rehhagel 's euro 2004 champs played aggressively enough to hold the brazilians in check , adriano finally broke the gordian knot .
in a moment when the greeks failed to press the inter milan striker who then pulled up from 27 meters and launched a rocket that just squeezed inside the right post past a flying greek keeper antonis nikopolildis . second-half starts off disastrously in the first half , greece missed a golden opportunity in the first half-minute .
the second-half would start with a golden opportunity for brazil .
one they didn ’ t waste . bildunterschrift : greek goalkeeper antonios nikopolidis -lrb- right -rrb- looks as a shot from brazil 's robinho -lrb- left -rrb- hits the back of the net for the 2nd goal hertha berlin 's defender gilberto raced with the ball up the left sideline , crossed it through the greek penalty box where robinho -lrb- photo -rrb- , the replacement of superstar ronaldo , was waiting to place the ball in the net .
40 seconds into the second-half , greece were beaten . at this point , brazil could toy with otto rehhagel 's side like a cat with a wounded mouse .
the selecao handed the ball over to the greeks for the next ten minutes but when the euro champs were unable to take advantage of the brazilian gift , the world champs retook control . ronaldinho had a few good opportunities .
rubinho broke free occasionally and the achilles heel of the greek defense , the right side , was used continuously as a launching pad for attacks by the yellow-clad brazilians . midway through the second-half , a series of substitutions interrupted the flow of the match but important was the entrance of olympique lyon juninho pernambucano in the 77th minute . quality goal seals greece 's fate four minutes later , juninho stepped up to take a free-kick just outside the greek penalty box .
after all , the master of the free-kick ronaldinho had been taken out of the game .
but juninho plays at a level , if not equal , then very close to last year 's footballer of the year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil was head taller all night juninho bent the direct kick over the top of the greek wall , the ball dropped 2 meters in a millisecond , and nikopolidis could only watch as the leather fell into the back of the net .
the very real and classy greek defense of 2004 was transformed into something comparable to the best myths classic greek mythology . " the brazilians were clearly better , " commented rehhagel .
" all 11 players must give 110 % to beat a brazilian team and tonight we only gave about 50 % .
that was n't enough . " so the greeks , after a series of disappointing qualifying matches for next year 's world cup in germany , are finding out that rehhagel no longer has the midas touch .

40 seconds into the second-half , greece were beaten . at this point , brazil could toy with otto rehhagel 's side like a cat with a wounded mouse .

rubinho broke free occasionally and the achilles heel of the greek defense , the right side , was used continuously as a launching pad for attacks by the yellow-clad brazilians . midway through the second-half , a series of substitutions interrupted the flow of the match but important was the entrance of olympique lyon juninho pernambucano in the 77th minute . quality goal seals greece 's fate four minutes later , juninho stepped up to take a free-kick just outside the greek penalty box .

42,000 fans watched a brazilian team that after this match is the squad to beat in the tournament . brazil provided the first clear-cut victory in the confederations cup with a 3-0 victory against greece .
the first three matches were all decided by one goal but coach carlos alberto parreira 's team sent a very clear message to the seven other teams that the selecao are hungry for another international title . " the team was well-balanced , " explained parreira .
" sometimes they played too complicated but it was in order how we played . " the brazilian play was definitely in order but unlike the first three matches , it took a while for the first goal to be scored .
and how it was scored set the tone for the remainder of the match because greece got in a situation they prefer not to be in , namely attacking soccer . after 40 minutes in which otto rehhagel 's euro 2004 champs played aggressively enough to hold the brazilians in check , adriano finally broke the gordian knot .
in a moment when the greeks failed to press the inter milan striker who then pulled up from 27 meters and launched a rocket that just squeezed inside the right post past a flying greek keeper antonis nikopolildis . second-half starts off disastrously in the first half , greece missed a golden opportunity in the first half-minute .
the second-half would start with a golden opportunity for brazil .
one they didn ’ t waste . bildunterschrift : greek goalkeeper antonios nikopolidis -lrb- right -rrb- looks as a shot from brazil 's robinho -lrb- left -rrb- hits the back of the net for the 2nd goal hertha berlin 's defender gilberto raced with the ball up the left sideline , crossed it through the greek penalty box where robinho -lrb- photo -rrb- , the replacement of superstar ronaldo , was waiting to place the ball in the net .
40 seconds into the second-half , greece were beaten . at this point , brazil could toy with otto rehhagel 's side like a cat with a wounded mouse .
the selecao handed the ball over to the greeks for the next ten minutes but when the euro champs were unable to take advantage of the brazilian gift , the world champs retook control . ronaldinho had a few good opportunities .
rubinho broke free occasionally and the achilles heel of the greek defense , the right side , was used continuously as a launching pad for attacks by the yellow-clad brazilians . midway through the second-half , a series of substitutions interrupted the flow of the match but important was the entrance of olympique lyon juninho pernambucano in the 77th minute . quality goal seals greece 's fate four minutes later , juninho stepped up to take a free-kick just outside the greek penalty box .
after all , the master of the free-kick ronaldinho had been taken out of the game .
but juninho plays at a level , if not equal , then very close to last year 's footballer of the year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil was head taller all night juninho bent the direct kick over the top of the greek wall , the ball dropped 2 meters in a millisecond , and nikopolidis could only watch as the leather fell into the back of the net .
the very real and classy greek defense of 2004 was transformed into something comparable to the best myths classic greek mythology . " the brazilians were clearly better , " commented rehhagel .
" all 11 players must give 110 % to beat a brazilian team and tonight we only gave about 50 % .
that was n't enough . " so the greeks , after a series of disappointing qualifying matches for next year 's world cup in germany , are finding out that rehhagel no longer has the midas touch .
brazil , on the other hand , was convincing after last week 's bitter 3-1 defeat to argentina in buenos aires .
understandably , they would like a chance to exact revenge against their south american rivals .
but before that they have two more matches to play . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mexico yawns past japan mexico edged japan on a second-half goal in a slow-paced match that featured few highlights .

coach ricardo la volpe 's side will have to play more convincingly to advance . when jose fonseca climbed up to head in a cross and give his side a 2-1 lead over japan , the breath of relief from the mexican bench was almost audible . after playing a back-and-forth game for most of the first half and failing to solve the smaller japanese defense , fonseca 's score off of a gonzalo pineda pass in the 64th minute sent mexico off to a first match victory . up until that point , mexico had few opportunities after evening the score late in the first half .
though controlling the match at the beginning , la volpe 's side had a tough time breaking through the japanese defense . counter brings relief the small crowd of 21,000 in hanover 's stadium had something to cheer about early on as japan responded quickly on a counter .
akira kaji got free down the right side of the field and passed in to a streaking atsushi yanagisawa .
the midfielder was marked by mexico 's ricardo osorio , who actually deflected the ball into his own net after it skipped through yanagisawa 's legs .
the 1-0 lead was a surprise , but not without credit to the resilient japanese side .
mexico responded by not really responding at all .
the midfield continued having a tough time breaking down the defense , preferring to build up their attack slowly , rather than unsettling the japanese defenders with quick passes . mexico roars back mexican striker jared borgetti had a golden opportunity robbed by some good goalkeeping when his close range header was blocked off by japan 's small , but nimble goalie yoshikatsu kawaguchi . kawaguchi looked his size , though , on the goal that evened it up .
midfielder zinha sprung free on the left side of the penalty box and bent a nice shot into the upper right hand corner of the net that a diving kawaguchi was helpless to defend . slow to start in the second half , mexico finally found the key to the japanese defense that until then would not unlock .
the size difference between fonseca and his markers attracted the attention of pineda , who lofted a nice cross to him in the center , which the midfielder had no problem putting away . japan 's desperation attempts in the final phase of the game were easily shut down by mexico , which had finally found its footing .

they agreed to suspend the ratification of the eu constitution . going into the crisis meeting in brussels , germany still clung to hope for the 25-member bloc 's planned charter , already ratified by its parliament .
" the constitutional treaty will be part of the eu 's future .
to say ' the constitution is dead ' also discredits the german ' yes ' on the constitution , " said german chancellor gerhard schröder . but , at a pre-summit meeting outside brussels , " a vast majority " of conservative leaders favored suspending ratification of the charter , said european people 's party parliamentary chief hans-gert pöttering . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder , left , meets with luxembourg prime minister jean claude juncker luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , who holds the eu 's presidency , and eu commision chief jose barroso both " proposed suspending the process , " said pöttering . dutch europe minister atzo nicolai ruled out a new referendum on the spurned constitution , saying : " it is dead in the netherlands , this treaty . " the treaty must be ratified by every eu member to become effective , prompting swedish prime minister göran persson to question the use of carrying on as scheduled with a vote in his own country . " i want a clear message from france and the netherlands about how they will deal with their ' no ' votes .
-lrb- if -rrb- there is no clear message , i think we will also have a delay , " persson said .
danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen echoed the comments .
" we ca n't put the treaty to a vote in denmark if the text will afterwards be changed .
it does n't make sense .
it is a clear perequisite for continuing the process that we get this clarification , " he said .
quo vadis , europa ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from l-r german foreign minister joschka fischer , german chancellor gerhard schroeder , dutch prime minister jan-peter balkenende and austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel chat during the round table at the beginning of the two days european summit in brussels according to diplomats in brussels , all 25 member states were in agreement that the ratification process should be suspended until at least next year while they discuss the future direction of the european project .
french president jacques chirac also said he had doubts about future expansion plans of the bloc .
he called for a special summit to discuss the future direction of the union . " can the union in this new situation really expand without having the proper institutions for it ? " he asked the fellow leaders in a prepared text .
" i think we need to discuss these important questions together . " budget deadlock a deal on the eu 's 2007-2013 budget - blocked partly by britain 's refusal to surrender a hard-won rebate - would only be possible if all 25 members were ready to compromise , said schröder , who was gloomy about the prospects for an agreement . " i do n't think there will be a deal on the budget .
the differences are too big , " he said .
" i 'm not optimistic about a deal . " at the end of the first day of the meeting , his prediction looked correct , since a budget deal seemed far away .
british prime minister tony blair has thus far refused to release his grip on the uk rebate , despite a last-minute offer by the eu presidency . luxembourg 's juncker suggested freezing , not cutting the british rebate , which was worth 5.3 billion euros last year and was projected to average 7.1 billion euros annually between 2007 and 2013 .
any future reductions in the rebate would be tied to a reduction in eu agricultural aid after 2013 . but no country gave ground . farm subsidies vs. rebate britain is refusing to accept a change to its budget rebate without a rethink of eu farm subsidies that gobble up 40 percent of the entire eu budget .
the rebate , sancrosanct to britons across the political spectrum , has been in place since 1984 to compensate for the relatively small amount that britain reaps from the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn , left , gestures while speaking with british foreign secretary jack straw , center , and eu foreign policy chief javier solana foreign secretary jack straw set out britain 's stance as eu leaders voiced little hope of a breakthrough on the budget talks . " the proposals from the presidency are not acceptable to us , " straw said .
" that 's one of the reasons why there 's going to be difficulty " during the conclave , he told reporters . blair 's spokesman said the cabinet backed his refusal to give way on the rebate , secured by the iron-willed former british leader , margaret thatcher , in 1984 to compensate for the relatively small amount london received in eu farm aid . the rest of europe stepped up the pressure on blair , including germany .

they agreed to suspend the ratification of the eu constitution . going into the crisis meeting in brussels , germany still clung to hope for the 25-member bloc 's planned charter , already ratified by its parliament .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from l-r german foreign minister joschka fischer , german chancellor gerhard schroeder , dutch prime minister jan-peter balkenende and austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel chat during the round table at the beginning of the two days european summit in brussels according to diplomats in brussels , all 25 member states were in agreement that the ratification process should be suspended until at least next year while they discuss the future direction of the european project .
french president jacques chirac also said he had doubts about future expansion plans of the bloc .
he called for a special summit to discuss the future direction of the union . " can the union in this new situation really expand without having the proper institutions for it ? " he asked the fellow leaders in a prepared text .
" i think we need to discuss these important questions together . " budget deadlock a deal on the eu 's 2007-2013 budget - blocked partly by britain 's refusal to surrender a hard-won rebate - would only be possible if all 25 members were ready to compromise , said schröder , who was gloomy about the prospects for an agreement . " i do n't think there will be a deal on the budget .
the differences are too big , " he said .
" i 'm not optimistic about a deal . " at the end of the first day of the meeting , his prediction looked correct , since a budget deal seemed far away .
british prime minister tony blair has thus far refused to release his grip on the uk rebate , despite a last-minute offer by the eu presidency . luxembourg 's juncker suggested freezing , not cutting the british rebate , which was worth 5.3 billion euros last year and was projected to average 7.1 billion euros annually between 2007 and 2013 .
any future reductions in the rebate would be tied to a reduction in eu agricultural aid after 2013 . but no country gave ground . farm subsidies vs. rebate britain is refusing to accept a change to its budget rebate without a rethink of eu farm subsidies that gobble up 40 percent of the entire eu budget .
the rebate , sancrosanct to britons across the political spectrum , has been in place since 1984 to compensate for the relatively small amount that britain reaps from the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn , left , gestures while speaking with british foreign secretary jack straw , center , and eu foreign policy chief javier solana foreign secretary jack straw set out britain 's stance as eu leaders voiced little hope of a breakthrough on the budget talks . " the proposals from the presidency are not acceptable to us , " straw said .
" that 's one of the reasons why there 's going to be difficulty " during the conclave , he told reporters . blair 's spokesman said the cabinet backed his refusal to give way on the rebate , secured by the iron-willed former british leader , margaret thatcher , in 1984 to compensate for the relatively small amount london received in eu farm aid . the rest of europe stepped up the pressure on blair , including germany .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from l-r german foreign minister joschka fischer , german chancellor gerhard schroeder , dutch prime minister jan-peter balkenende and austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel chat during the round table at the beginning of the two days european summit in brussels according to diplomats in brussels , all 25 member states were in agreement that the ratification process should be suspended until at least next year while they discuss the future direction of the european project .
french president jacques chirac also said he had doubts about future expansion plans of the bloc .
he called for a special summit to discuss the future direction of the union . " can the union in this new situation really expand without having the proper institutions for it ? " he asked the fellow leaders in a prepared text .
" i think we need to discuss these important questions together . " budget deadlock a deal on the eu 's 2007-2013 budget - blocked partly by britain 's refusal to surrender a hard-won rebate - would only be possible if all 25 members were ready to compromise , said schröder , who was gloomy about the prospects for an agreement . " i do n't think there will be a deal on the budget .
the differences are too big , " he said .
" i 'm not optimistic about a deal . " at the end of the first day of the meeting , his prediction looked correct , since a budget deal seemed far away .
british prime minister tony blair has thus far refused to release his grip on the uk rebate , despite a last-minute offer by the eu presidency . luxembourg 's juncker suggested freezing , not cutting the british rebate , which was worth 5.3 billion euros last year and was projected to average 7.1 billion euros annually between 2007 and 2013 .
any future reductions in the rebate would be tied to a reduction in eu agricultural aid after 2013 . but no country gave ground . farm subsidies vs. rebate britain is refusing to accept a change to its budget rebate without a rethink of eu farm subsidies that gobble up 40 percent of the entire eu budget .
the rebate , sancrosanct to britons across the political spectrum , has been in place since 1984 to compensate for the relatively small amount that britain reaps from the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn , left , gestures while speaking with british foreign secretary jack straw , center , and eu foreign policy chief javier solana foreign secretary jack straw set out britain 's stance as eu leaders voiced little hope of a breakthrough on the budget talks . " the proposals from the presidency are not acceptable to us , " straw said .
" that 's one of the reasons why there 's going to be difficulty " during the conclave , he told reporters . blair 's spokesman said the cabinet backed his refusal to give way on the rebate , secured by the iron-willed former british leader , margaret thatcher , in 1984 to compensate for the relatively small amount london received in eu farm aid . the rest of europe stepped up the pressure on blair , including germany . " there is absolutely no justification any longer for the british rebate , " the german leader said .
" britain is the sixth biggest per capita beneficiary of the eu budget but ranks far below that as a contributor . " blair , who takes over the eu presidency on july 1 , is pushing for a " fundamental debate " about the bloc 's future , including cap , which gives generous subsidies to farmers , especially those in france . upping the ante , a british spokesman said it was not essential for the summit to agree the 2007- 2013 spending plans - leaving open the prospect of it being delayed until after the upcoming british eu presidency . afp / dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " europe ca n't keep running " european leaders are gathering in brussels for a two-day summit to give the alliance new momentum .
but can the eu extricate itself from its constitutional tangle ?

the midfield continued having a tough time breaking down the defense , preferring to build up their attack slowly , rather than unsettling the japanese defenders with quick passes . mexico roars back mexican striker jared borgetti had a golden opportunity robbed by some good goalkeeping when his close range header was blocked off by japan 's small , but nimble goalie yoshikatsu kawaguchi . kawaguchi looked his size , though , on the goal that evened it up .

they agreed to suspend the ratification of the eu constitution . going into the crisis meeting in brussels , germany still clung to hope for the 25-member bloc 's planned charter , already ratified by its parliament .
" the constitutional treaty will be part of the eu 's future .
to say ' the constitution is dead ' also discredits the german ' yes ' on the constitution , " said german chancellor gerhard schröder . but , at a pre-summit meeting outside brussels , " a vast majority " of conservative leaders favored suspending ratification of the charter , said european people 's party parliamentary chief hans-gert pöttering . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder , left , meets with luxembourg prime minister jean claude juncker luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , who holds the eu 's presidency , and eu commision chief jose barroso both " proposed suspending the process , " said pöttering . dutch europe minister atzo nicolai ruled out a new referendum on the spurned constitution , saying : " it is dead in the netherlands , this treaty . " the treaty must be ratified by every eu member to become effective , prompting swedish prime minister göran persson to question the use of carrying on as scheduled with a vote in his own country . " i want a clear message from france and the netherlands about how they will deal with their ' no ' votes .
-lrb- if -rrb- there is no clear message , i think we will also have a delay , " persson said .
danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen echoed the comments .
" we ca n't put the treaty to a vote in denmark if the text will afterwards be changed .
it does n't make sense .
it is a clear perequisite for continuing the process that we get this clarification , " he said .
quo vadis , europa ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from l-r german foreign minister joschka fischer , german chancellor gerhard schroeder , dutch prime minister jan-peter balkenende and austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel chat during the round table at the beginning of the two days european summit in brussels according to diplomats in brussels , all 25 member states were in agreement that the ratification process should be suspended until at least next year while they discuss the future direction of the european project .
french president jacques chirac also said he had doubts about future expansion plans of the bloc .
he called for a special summit to discuss the future direction of the union . " can the union in this new situation really expand without having the proper institutions for it ? " he asked the fellow leaders in a prepared text .
" i think we need to discuss these important questions together . " budget deadlock a deal on the eu 's 2007-2013 budget - blocked partly by britain 's refusal to surrender a hard-won rebate - would only be possible if all 25 members were ready to compromise , said schröder , who was gloomy about the prospects for an agreement . " i do n't think there will be a deal on the budget .
the differences are too big , " he said .
" i 'm not optimistic about a deal . " at the end of the first day of the meeting , his prediction looked correct , since a budget deal seemed far away .
british prime minister tony blair has thus far refused to release his grip on the uk rebate , despite a last-minute offer by the eu presidency . luxembourg 's juncker suggested freezing , not cutting the british rebate , which was worth 5.3 billion euros last year and was projected to average 7.1 billion euros annually between 2007 and 2013 .
any future reductions in the rebate would be tied to a reduction in eu agricultural aid after 2013 . but no country gave ground . farm subsidies vs. rebate britain is refusing to accept a change to its budget rebate without a rethink of eu farm subsidies that gobble up 40 percent of the entire eu budget .
the rebate , sancrosanct to britons across the political spectrum , has been in place since 1984 to compensate for the relatively small amount that britain reaps from the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn , left , gestures while speaking with british foreign secretary jack straw , center , and eu foreign policy chief javier solana foreign secretary jack straw set out britain 's stance as eu leaders voiced little hope of a breakthrough on the budget talks . " the proposals from the presidency are not acceptable to us , " straw said .
" that 's one of the reasons why there 's going to be difficulty " during the conclave , he told reporters . blair 's spokesman said the cabinet backed his refusal to give way on the rebate , secured by the iron-willed former british leader , margaret thatcher , in 1984 to compensate for the relatively small amount london received in eu farm aid . the rest of europe stepped up the pressure on blair , including germany . " there is absolutely no justification any longer for the british rebate , " the german leader said .
" britain is the sixth biggest per capita beneficiary of the eu budget but ranks far below that as a contributor . " blair , who takes over the eu presidency on july 1 , is pushing for a " fundamental debate " about the bloc 's future , including cap , which gives generous subsidies to farmers , especially those in france . upping the ante , a british spokesman said it was not essential for the summit to agree the 2007- 2013 spending plans - leaving open the prospect of it being delayed until after the upcoming british eu presidency . afp / dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " europe ca n't keep running " european leaders are gathering in brussels for a two-day summit to give the alliance new momentum .
but can the eu extricate itself from its constitutional tangle ?

-lrb- june 16 , 2005 -rrb- britain , france lock horns over budget not since britain 's joining of the us-led invasion of iraq has the country seemed so isolated in the eu as tony blair remains at loggerheads with france and germany over eu spending plans ahead of a crucial summit .

the senate judiciary committee heard that us treatment of those held at the prison was harming its image abroad .
it was also told by a government official that the us had the legal right to keep terror suspects in custody forever .
the issue of terror suspects has become deeply divisive in the us .
the bbc 's adam brookes reports that the atmosphere at the senate hearing was uncomfortable .
like much of the us , he says , the committee seems to be increasingly uneasy at the treatment of prisoners caught during the " war on terror " .
several senators and former president jimmy carter have called for the military prison at guantanamo bay to be closed down .
more than 500 men are being held at the facility .
many have been there for more than three years without trial .
' held in perpetuity ' democratic senator patrick leahy told the committee that guantanamo bay " is causing immeasurable damage to our reputation as a defender of democracy and a beacon of human rights around the world " .
but william barr , a former us attorney general , defended the bush administration 's decision to exempt terror suspects from the geneva convention .
" the geneva convention applies to signatory powers , " he said .
" al-qaeda has n't signed it .
they 're not covered by the geneva convention . "
democratic senator joseph biden asked the deputy associate attorney general , j michael wiggins , if suspects could be held forever at guantanamo bay because " there is no definition as to when the conflict ends " .
mr wiggins replied : " it 's our position that , legally , they can be held in perpetuity . "
our correspondent says this suggests the bush administration believes that people who pose a threat to the us may never be released from custody .

the mountain plateau of cefn croes , near aberystwyth , is home to 39 turbines , up to 328ft -lrb- 100m -rrb- high .
it has the capacity to supply 42,000 homes with electricity , which is 20 % of all onshore wind power in wales .

it added that noise from the site and the visual impact were minimal .
the welsh assembly government expects 10 % of electricity generated in wales to come from renewable sources by 2010 .
economic development minister andrew davies , who performed the opening ceremony , said : " wind power is currently the only viable option to provide the bulk of our renewable energy needs , and with excellent wind resources in wales , sensitively designed wind farms can play an important role in achieving these objectives " .

" we believe this is an example of the future of green energy production in wales , " said mr jones .
" this is the most powerful onshore wind farm in the uk and ultimately sites like cefn croes will have an impact on greenhouse gas emissions " .
he said the wind farm could not be seen off the nearby main road and the nearest property was nearly two miles away .
there are nine wind farms and 277 turbines in mid wales alone , which has led some to dub the region " europe 's windfarm capital " .
martin wright , spokesman for the cambrian mountains society and former chairman of a group opposing cefn croes , said : " cefn croes can been seen from the top of plynlimon , in fact you can see about 300 turbines from there " .
he said further plans included 180 400ft turbines above tregaron and up to 150 turbines at nant y moch , both near aberystwyth .

he said further plans included 180 400ft turbines above tregaron and up to 150 turbines at nant y moch , both near aberystwyth .
last year , the assembly government said building more onshore wind farms was the " only viable option " to meet wales ' clean energy targets .
it identified areas in north , mid and south west wales as places that could accommodate more windfarms .

according to an rnib cymru report , more than 25,000 people in wales have glaucoma and 10,000 people have lost their sight through the condition .
the rnib has urged people to have regular eye tests to prevent glaucoma .
the report , tunnel vision , which is published on thursday , reveals a lack of awareness of the condition .
' no symptoms ' joyce chatterton , director of rnib cymru , said : " it is deeply concerning that so many people are needlessly losing their sight through what is essentially a treatable condition .
" regular eye tests are vital - an eye test can save your sight .
" people need to be aware that glaucoma does not necessarily have any symptoms - up to 40 % of useful sight can be lost before a person realises anything is wrong .
" but if caught early enough glaucoma can , in nearly all cases , be successfully treated and no sight need be lost . "
according to the rnib 's report , one in five people in wales have never heard of the condition , while just 3 % knew it could have no symptoms .
the rnib estimates that 10,800 people in wales have a serious sight problem as a result of glaucoma , which is also known as tunnel vision .
cardiff pharmacist hazel baker , 56 , said she has received regular eye tests due to a family history of glaucoma .
she added : " my optician knew about my family history and was always very thorough .
free checks " he spotted changes in my eyes during a regular eye check and referred me straight to a specialist .
" i had to use eye drops for four years , which kept any glaucoma i might have had under control .
" they 're still not sure if i 've got glaucoma , but it 's reassuring to know that they 're monitoring it closely . "
the rnib 's survey also found that fewer than one in five people knew that people with glaucoma or those from groups especially at risk of the condition were eligible for free eye health checks under the welsh assembly government 's eye care initiative .
among those eligible to free checks in wales are people who have been referred by a gp and people whose family origins are afro caribbean , indian , pakistani or bangladeshi .
people aged over 40 and those with a close relative with glaucoma are considered of higher risk , while people of african origin are four times more likely to develop glaucoma .

binja fears those who killed her husband may now be her guards there is no electricity in her village so she could not identify the assailants .
nineteen people were killed and their bodies mutilated during the attack on ihembe village .
in a note addressed in broken swahili and left on a dead body , the assailants promised to come back .
the note was signed " the rastas " .
since the attack last month , ihembe 's 14,000 inhabitants have sought refuge in the bush .
some 4,000 of them are sleeping under tents on the mountains outside the town .
' hostage ' but the group which controls the camp - as well as the surrounding 500 sq km - is the democratic forces for the liberation of rwanda -lrb- fdlr -rrb- , ethnic hutu rebels accused of involvement in the 1994 genocide in neighbouring rwanda .
" those who now guard us speak kinyarwanda , the language of rwanda .
so did those who killed my husband .
i 'm scared , " whispers binja , eyeing around to make sure that the rebels are not anywhere near to eavesdrop .
" we are held hostage , " says another woman , under condition of anonymity .
the fdlr want security guarantees before returning to rwanda indeed , the rebels are not far away .
some are inside the camp , their rifles on their shoulders , while their chiefs are sipping tea outside their mud house , just in front of the camp .
the fdlr commanders maintain tight control over the camp and surrounding forest area .
a small unit is deployed every kilometre .
after 11 years in the bush , the fdlr rebels confess they are tired and wish to return home peacefully .
deadline passed in march , fdlr president ignace murwanashyaka said that his fighters would disarm and go home to form a political party by 5 may .
but the deadline passed and nothing happened .
he now says his movement is waiting for guarantees from the rwandan government that the fdlr can work as a political party there .
he accuses rwanda 's judiciary of concentrating on crimes committed by hutus during the genocide and of turning a blind eye to crimes committed by the tutsi-dominated rwandan army against hutus , both in rwanda and in the democratic republic of congo over the last 11 years .
indeed , thousands of hutus , many of them unarmed civilians , are believed to have been killed on congolese territory by the rwandan army and no justice system has looked into those alleged crimes yet .

who protects whom ?
the rebels have no shortage of ammunition , they patrol in their area and communicate with high frequency radios which they recharge on solar dishes .
" we are controlling the area to prevent any incursion by the rastas .
we are here to protect the civilian population , " says jean-marie vianney , the chief of the fdlr brigade in nindja and a deputy lieutenant of the rwandan armed forces during the 1994 genocide .
many congolese want more than food from the un peacekeepers but it is not clear who is protecting whom .
while the un - through its dr congo-based deputy representative ross mountain - threatens to resort to force to get the fdlr to disarm , the 4,000 civilians are largely seen as fdlr human shields .
shields that seem to be effective so far .
the 3,000 un troops deployed in south kivu do not make it to nindja .
their nearest base is in walungu , some 15km away .
mohamed waqar , who heads 150 un peacekeepers from pakistan in walungu , said further reinforcements were needed before any action could be taken .
he said it might take " a month plus " before such reinforcements arrived .
in the meantime , some congolese say the pakistani troops do not seem to do much .
they are reported to make some night patrols near their base .
and during the day , they improvise food distributions in walungu , the last of which almost turned into a riot as people queued up to get instant noodles , biscuits and other food items that are not part of their usual diet .
" we do n't need them to distribute these things , we need them to bring us peace , " said a woman , waving a pot of jam she had just received .

binja fears those who killed her husband may now be her guards there is no electricity in her village so she could not identify the assailants .
nineteen people were killed and their bodies mutilated during the attack on ihembe village .
in a note addressed in broken swahili and left on a dead body , the assailants promised to come back .
the note was signed " the rastas " .
since the attack last month , ihembe 's 14,000 inhabitants have sought refuge in the bush .
some 4,000 of them are sleeping under tents on the mountains outside the town .
' hostage ' but the group which controls the camp - as well as the surrounding 500 sq km - is the democratic forces for the liberation of rwanda -lrb- fdlr -rrb- , ethnic hutu rebels accused of involvement in the 1994 genocide in neighbouring rwanda .

he accuses rwanda 's judiciary of concentrating on crimes committed by hutus during the genocide and of turning a blind eye to crimes committed by the tutsi-dominated rwandan army against hutus , both in rwanda and in the democratic republic of congo over the last 11 years .
indeed , thousands of hutus , many of them unarmed civilians , are believed to have been killed on congolese territory by the rwandan army and no justice system has looked into those alleged crimes yet .

the royal society for the protection of birds -lrb- rspb -rrb- announced on thursday that the hen harriers are nesting at a nature reserve in the north pennines .
the birds are incubating eggs at a site on the rspb 's geltsdale nature reserve , which covers a large uplands area in cumbria and northumberland .
hen harriers last nested in there in 2003 , when a pair raised four young .
rspb geltsdale reserve manager dave o 'hara said : " it is great news that these magnificent birds are nesting in the north pennines .
illegal killing " the english hen harrier population is perilously low , so every nest is precious .
" to safeguard the nesting birds from disturbance , we have organised a round-the-clock protection operation and we are grateful to everyone who is putting in such long hours in all weathers to help watch over the nest . "
the charity says illegal killing is the main reason why hen harriers are absent from almost all areas of suitable moorland habitat in the north of england .
last year , only 10 pairs successfully nested in england , and those were in lancashire .
mr o 'hara urged people not to try to see the birds to avoid the risk of disturbing them .
hen harriers are fully protected by law and anyone caught disturbing , injuring or taking birds , nests or eggs can face a fine or prison .
they normally lay four to six eggs , which are incubated for about 30 days .

the royal society for the protection of birds -lrb- rspb -rrb- announced on thursday that the hen harriers are nesting at a nature reserve in the north pennines .
the birds are incubating eggs at a site on the rspb 's geltsdale nature reserve , which covers a large uplands area in cumbria and northumberland .
hen harriers last nested in there in 2003 , when a pair raised four young .
rspb geltsdale reserve manager dave o 'hara said : " it is great news that these magnificent birds are nesting in the north pennines .
illegal killing " the english hen harrier population is perilously low , so every nest is precious .
" to safeguard the nesting birds from disturbance , we have organised a round-the-clock protection operation and we are grateful to everyone who is putting in such long hours in all weathers to help watch over the nest . "
the charity says illegal killing is the main reason why hen harriers are absent from almost all areas of suitable moorland habitat in the north of england .
last year , only 10 pairs successfully nested in england , and those were in lancashire .
mr o 'hara urged people not to try to see the birds to avoid the risk of disturbing them .

the 7.2km stretch of the a470 in snowdonia has been branded the ' greenest road in britain ' and is one of 15 schemes short listed .
the dolwyddelan to pont-yr-afanc section was part of road improvements which saw modernisation of the highway in an environmentally friendly way .
it is the first time that wales has been represented at the award .
the a470 was one of 140 entries to the architecture award , which is now in its fifth year .
the national farmers ' union 's countryside magazine described the stretch of road as being the ' greenest in britain ' after an £ 18.1 million project to improve road safety and journey time reliability .
roads are essential , but they can also be beautiful richard parnaby , design commission for wales the road improvement scheme focused on environmental objectives included recycling materials , waste reduction and the reusing of excavated material .
as well as a conservation scheme for various species and habitats - it incorporates a bat hibernaculum and otter passages .
the judges said : " with a great use of local materials and representing a very soft addition to the environment , this scheme shows that roads can also be specific to their geography . "
richard parnaby , the chairman of the design commission for wales , said : " this scheme demonstrates that the principles of sound environmental design - thoughtful response to the setting , minimising energy inputs , using local materials - can work for any project .
" roads are essential , but they can also be beautiful , " he added .
the road incorporated otter passages environment minister carwyn jones agreed .
" this stretch of road is an example of how sustainable development works in practice , " he said .
" it proves that you do n't have to stop developing transport links if you take an approach which strikes a balance between the needs of road users and the environment .
" including recycled material in the development is one way of avoiding drawing on our natural resources which i would like to become standard practice in the industry . "
it is not the first time that a road has made it onto the shortlist of the award - last year 's winner was the a650 bingley relief road , in yorkshire .
at the time , the aa motoring trust said : " the a650 bingley relief road shows that there are still road schemes around that gain public support because they remove the blight of traffic and let communities get on with their lives . "
the winner of the award , which is part of the british construction industry awards , will be announced on 13 october .
the shortlist includes projects such as the boscastle flood defence system in cornwall , the tinsley viaduct strengthening project in sheffield and the home office project in london .

the 7.2km stretch of the a470 in snowdonia has been branded the ' greenest road in britain ' and is one of 15 schemes short listed .
the dolwyddelan to pont-yr-afanc section was part of road improvements which saw modernisation of the highway in an environmentally friendly way .
it is the first time that wales has been represented at the award .
the a470 was one of 140 entries to the architecture award , which is now in its fifth year .
the national farmers ' union 's countryside magazine described the stretch of road as being the ' greenest in britain ' after an £ 18.1 million project to improve road safety and journey time reliability .
roads are essential , but they can also be beautiful richard parnaby , design commission for wales the road improvement scheme focused on environmental objectives included recycling materials , waste reduction and the reusing of excavated material .
as well as a conservation scheme for various species and habitats - it incorporates a bat hibernaculum and otter passages .
the judges said : " with a great use of local materials and representing a very soft addition to the environment , this scheme shows that roads can also be specific to their geography . "
richard parnaby , the chairman of the design commission for wales , said : " this scheme demonstrates that the principles of sound environmental design - thoughtful response to the setting , minimising energy inputs , using local materials - can work for any project .
" roads are essential , but they can also be beautiful , " he added .
the road incorporated otter passages environment minister carwyn jones agreed .
" this stretch of road is an example of how sustainable development works in practice , " he said .
" it proves that you do n't have to stop developing transport links if you take an approach which strikes a balance between the needs of road users and the environment .
" including recycled material in the development is one way of avoiding drawing on our natural resources which i would like to become standard practice in the industry . "
it is not the first time that a road has made it onto the shortlist of the award - last year 's winner was the a650 bingley relief road , in yorkshire .
at the time , the aa motoring trust said : " the a650 bingley relief road shows that there are still road schemes around that gain public support because they remove the blight of traffic and let communities get on with their lives . "
the winner of the award , which is part of the british construction industry awards , will be announced on 13 october .
the shortlist includes projects such as the boscastle flood defence system in cornwall , the tinsley viaduct strengthening project in sheffield and the home office project in london .

you 'll need to be organised , because sunrise is about 0445 bst -lrb- in london -rrb- .
we want you to e-mail them to us in time for when we go on air at 0600 .
we 'll pick some of the best pictures and show them live on bbc one 's breakfast and bbc news 24 during tuesday 's programme .
and we 'll also select the top twelve from those we show on-air to go into our breakfast website picture gallery so your friends and family will be able to see your efforts .
we 're hoping that lots of our viewers take part in this , but so we can show as many of your pictures as possible , please follow the guidelines below : step one - taking your picture take a picture of sunrise on the morning of tuesday 21 june - your local paper or diary will give you the time - it 's earlier in the north of the uk , and later in the south .
it does n't have to be exactly at sunrise , you can send them up until 0830 - of course we have to stress that you should be very careful looking straight into bright sunlight .
the picture you take should be near to where you live , and should be a landscape of sunrise , although it can include people in passing or other features -lrb- see below -rrb- .
it should be taken ' wide ' rather than upright or ' deep ' - in other words , your picture should be the same shape as your tv screen so it fits when we show it on air we wo n't be looking at any pictures received before 0500 on tuesday , so please do n't be tempted to cheat step two - sending your pictures to us start sending your pictures to us from 0500 on tuesday 21 - you must follow these guidelines , this will help us turnaround as many of your pictures as possible to show on the programme the only way of getting your pictures to us is as an e-mail attachment in jpeg format , with one jpeg per email , and a maximum of two e-mails per person again , this is to allow as many people as possible a chance of getting their picture shown on-air do not send compressed files -lrb- zip -rrb- files as we can not accept them and we do n't want to waste your time aim to send us a digital image between 2 to 5mb , but in any case , we wo n't accept images larger than 10mb e-mail your image to : breakfasttv @ bbc.co.uk you can only e-mail us at that address , other bbc e-mail addresses will automatically bounce back your message , and once again we do n't want to waste your time we will only be able to show your photo if you include the following details , which will be added to our picture gallery as a permanent reminder of this event : your first and last names town or city where you live where the picture was taken and of what some words to add to our online picture gallery - between 20 and 50 will be enough in sending your picture to us you are automatically confirming that it is a picture you have taken -lrb- if you are a parent sending in for someone under 18 is fine -rrb- , and that it is your copyright .

when you send in your picture , you agree that the bbc will not be paying a fee , that this is not a competition and that there is no prize , and breakfast will have the sole right to choose which pictures we show on the programme and our website having dealt with the technical stuff , you can now think about shooting your pictures : make sure your pictures are shot this way rather than side on here 's our example of good ' sun up ' picture - remember the image must be wider horizontally than vertically so your photo fits a tv screen .
bbc news online has a whole site devoted to pictures so you may want to have a look there for some ideas - we 'll be using a picture gallery , that 's why we need the words , to tell the story of the longest day : bbc news online 's ' in pictures ' pages good luck with your assignment , the selected images will appear throughout tuesday 's programme , and via a link from the breakfast website .

the sa-80 rifle was believed to have reliability problems with the end of the cold war , successive uk governments have reduced the relative level of defence spending from 5 % of gross domestic product in the 1980s to less than 2.5 % .
as spending on health , education and social security have risen , defence spending in real terms steadily fell throughout the 1990s .
only since the attacks of 11 september 2001 in the us has this relative decline begun to stop and the defence budget stabilised in real terms .
this has led to a significant reduction in the overall size of britain 's armed forces as successive governments have sought to balance the need to maintain force numbers and force quality .
this has been exacerbated by the challenge posed by the cost of much of the new equipment that the armed forces would like to buy .
the overall result has been armed forces that in many ways are viewed as the model of modernity by many of our european partners .
overseas deployments however , complaints about the sa-80 rifle , lack of spares for equipment and even tales of british soldiers begging or trading equipment in the run up to the war in iraq have abounded .
britain 's armed forces are struggling to maintain comparability and more importantly interoperability -lrb- the ability to safely work together -rrb- with their american counterparts .
the overall result has been armed forces that in many ways are viewed as the model of modernity by many of our european partners at the same time the level of operational deployments overseas has risen sharply .
britain has sent military personnel on operations in such diverse areas as east timor , afghanistan , sierra leone , the balkans and most recently , iraq .
sustaining this deployment rate has been a challenge for the services .
for example , during operation telic , the invasion of iraq , the british army had almost 60 % of its personnel engaged in , or preparing for , operations .
and the average royal navy destroyer or frigate spends more time at sea now than its world war ii counterpart .
partly offsetting this has been the end of the requirement to counter the soviet threat .
this means that the much reduced german-based garrison now focuses on preparing for other missions , such as iraq .
in addition , there has been a significant reduction in the requirement to support the civilian authorities in northern ireland following on from the good friday accord .
very real challenge however , adding to the problem has been the need to engage in ever more complex and diverse operations .
these have included providing cover for firefighters at home , humanitarian support in bosnia , peacekeeping in cyprus , peace enforcement in kosovo , nation-building and evacuation operations in sierra leone .
and , of course , traditional war fighting and counter-insurgency in iraq and countering international terrorism from the likes of al-qaeda in afghanistan .
the government is hoping the iraq situation calms down this requires a more diverse set of capabilities and skills than were required in the past .
the result has been a shift in force requirements away from infantry units .
this explains the regiment reforms announced in december , in favour of medics , intelligence specialists , engineers and logisticians .
nevertheless , as the recent national audit report on military overstretch makes clear , the challenge remains very real .
over the last few years britain 's military forces have consistently had to sustain deployment rates higher than the ministry of defence has planned for .
this means that , while the present situation can be maintained , any further defence deployments of any size will only be able to be made at considerable risk either to that mission or to one of the other ongoing missions .
a return to the troubles in northern ireland , a strike by firefighters , or another conflict could have dangerous repercussions .
stark alternatives so what are the options ?
the simplest would appear to be increasing the defence budget to provide appropriately sized and equipped armed forces .
over the last few years britain 's military forces have consistently had to sustain deployment rates higher than the ministry of defence has planned for however , no politician or commentator appears to believe this to be realistic .
the alternatives are equally stark .
firstly , the current level of operations could be drastically downsized .
but which do you abandon - and with what results ?
secondly , the government could simply delay or cut back on the acquisition of new equipment and shift the investment to increasing personnel numbers .
areas that could go might include the new aircraft carriers , the joint strike fighter programme , the future rapid effect system or nuclear deterrent .
the problem with this solution is that it will leave the services with less capable armed forces and it will also have significant industrial implications .
it is therefore understandable that the option currently being pursued by government is to try to re-orientate the armed forces and reduce frontline forces in some areas .
at the same time , ministers are hoping that the situation in iraq and elsewhere improves sufficiently that the levels of overstretch diminish , and no major operations occur over the next few years .
only time will tell .

the sa-80 rifle was believed to have reliability problems with the end of the cold war , successive uk governments have reduced the relative level of defence spending from 5 % of gross domestic product in the 1980s to less than 2.5 % .
as spending on health , education and social security have risen , defence spending in real terms steadily fell throughout the 1990s .
only since the attacks of 11 september 2001 in the us has this relative decline begun to stop and the defence budget stabilised in real terms .
this has led to a significant reduction in the overall size of britain 's armed forces as successive governments have sought to balance the need to maintain force numbers and force quality .
this has been exacerbated by the challenge posed by the cost of much of the new equipment that the armed forces would like to buy .
the overall result has been armed forces that in many ways are viewed as the model of modernity by many of our european partners .
overseas deployments however , complaints about the sa-80 rifle , lack of spares for equipment and even tales of british soldiers begging or trading equipment in the run up to the war in iraq have abounded .
britain 's armed forces are struggling to maintain comparability and more importantly interoperability -lrb- the ability to safely work together -rrb- with their american counterparts .
the overall result has been armed forces that in many ways are viewed as the model of modernity by many of our european partners at the same time the level of operational deployments overseas has risen sharply .
britain has sent military personnel on operations in such diverse areas as east timor , afghanistan , sierra leone , the balkans and most recently , iraq .
sustaining this deployment rate has been a challenge for the services .
for example , during operation telic , the invasion of iraq , the british army had almost 60 % of its personnel engaged in , or preparing for , operations .
and the average royal navy destroyer or frigate spends more time at sea now than its world war ii counterpart .
partly offsetting this has been the end of the requirement to counter the soviet threat .
this means that the much reduced german-based garrison now focuses on preparing for other missions , such as iraq .
in addition , there has been a significant reduction in the requirement to support the civilian authorities in northern ireland following on from the good friday accord .
very real challenge however , adding to the problem has been the need to engage in ever more complex and diverse operations .
these have included providing cover for firefighters at home , humanitarian support in bosnia , peacekeeping in cyprus , peace enforcement in kosovo , nation-building and evacuation operations in sierra leone .
and , of course , traditional war fighting and counter-insurgency in iraq and countering international terrorism from the likes of al-qaeda in afghanistan .
