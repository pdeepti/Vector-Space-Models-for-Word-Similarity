the film , der untergang - the downfall , will now open in israeli cinemas in may . a highly acclaimed german film sometimes criticized for portraying adolf hitler in too positive a light is to be released in israel after viewers gave it positive feedback last week . the film , " the downfall , -lrb- der untergang -rrb- " which was nominated in 2004 for an oscar in the best foreign film category , depicts hitler 's final days in a berlin bunker and includes scenes in which the nazi dictator seems almost approachable . while the film has been a hit in europe since its release , it had problems finding a distributor in israel .
but last week , nurit shani , owner of the israeli cinema chain lev and film distributor shani , told reuters that she decided to show the movie after an audience of 1,000 invited to a preview last week approved of it by 91 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : presenting two sides " i expected a vote in favour of the movie , but i did n't imagine it would be so decisive , " shani told reuters .
" i know there are still many for whom it will be difficult to see the human side of hitler portrayed in a film .
but it would have been unfair to prevent a curious and interested audience that is willing to confront the painful subject in its own way from seeing the movie . " a brutal megalomaniac the jewish state gained its independence after the end of world war ii , in which six million jews were slaughtered according to hitler 's plan .
even 60 years later is no issue more sensitive to the nation .
for example , a few israeli officials boycotted a recent appearance of german president horst köhler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the film portrays hitler as a brutal megalomaniac , it also shows his more human side : a man who could show kindness to his staff , to animals and to his wife and a man who suffered from parkinson 's disease .
hitler committed suicide april 30 , 1945 in the bunker . " this is the first time i saw how they -lrb- the germans -rrb- suffered , how they struggled with themselves , how they saw their ' fuehrer ' as crazy , " simha siani , who voted for screening the film , told reuters . the film will open in three israeli cities may 19 , two weeks after the annual holocaust memorial day is observed . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german film aims to gatecrash oscar party hollywood hosts the 77th academy awards ceremony on sunday night .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 14.04.2005 back to belief in german schools großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian education has made a comeback in germany last week 's emotional outpouring following the pope 's death has sparked excited calls from the faithful that christianity is back ' in ' .
a trend towards christian schooling in germany might just substantiate that belief . it 's a fact that both catholic and evangelical schools in germany are flourishing .
there are almost 2,000 christian schools scattered across the country and an increasing number of children waiting patiently to be given one of the highly coveted places .
demand far outstrips supply and progressive parents are taking it upon themselves to found a new generation of denominational schools .
but is the upturn really a reflection of a born-again faith ? the answer is no , at least not exclusively .
in fact it seems to have more to do with a belief in a better education than a belief in god .
jürgen frank , head of education for the evangelical church of germany says there are three main reasons for the recent rise in enthusiasm for christian schooling . " firstly , families are generally smaller and parents want to provide their children with a good education .
secondly , they want the education their children receive to meet their individual needs , and thirdly they want a progressive , modern education system , " he said . popular values ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from incense to wine , catholic children have a lot to learn andreas verhülsdonk , an expert on religious education in the catholic church , says that parents are drawn to catholicism because they know their children will be taught values and morality . " we run a project called " compassion " in which pupils spend three weeks with homeless or sick people , " he said .
" the point is not just to help the needy but to give the children the chance to see the world through the eyes of people living on the fringes of society . " but christoph hermann , who sends his son to an evangelical school in berlin says it is simply important to make christianity a part of daily life . " i would n't consider myself particularly religious , but the christian faith was a part of my upbringing and that is what i want for my son , " hermann said . " we live in an increasingly secular society and i do n't want him to grow up seeing christianity as something fundamental because he has n't been exposed to it in an everyday kind of way . " there 's more to it than just religion that , however , is not to say that denominational schools neglect reading , writing and arithmetic .
in fact they are legally bound to provide pupils with the same curricular options as state schools , with the only difference being compulsory religious education for an average of two hours each week .
hermann believes his son is getting a good deal . " christianity is helpful in learning to understand our culture and it equips children to better understand art and history as well , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young children practice their abc and that is not all .
according to frank , children at evangelical schools in germany learn to read and write better than their state school counterparts . " a study we carried out after the publication of the pisa report revealed that the educational climate at christian schools is better than in state schools , and that the quality on offer at demoninational schools genuinely does live up to its reputation , " he said . indeed , that reputation appears to have run away with the imagination of some determined and diligent parents .
since the fall of the berlin wall , the church has given its blessing to the founding of some 70 new evangelical schools and there are 50 more would-be 's waiting in the wings .
but getting such a venture off the ground is no easy feat . " we have to clear a lot of hurdles , many of them financial , before a new school can be founded , " frank said . hurdles to new beginnings new school initiatives receive a grant from the evangelical church to see them through the first three or four years until the government starts paying an annual subsistence worth some 90 percent of the regular state school budget .
but frank says church funds are running dry . " we used to pay start-up schools some 240,000 euros -lrb- $ 309,000 -rrb- for those first few years , but now with so many waiting , we ca n't afford to do that , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children can be non-denominational and still attend a protestant school most of these projects depend very heavily on the driving parental force behind them , not only to put sponsorship or financing in place , but to find and renovate premises , to interview and hire staff , and of course to handpick the protégées . the selection criteria vary from school to school , state to state and church to church .
in the case of catholics , the emphasis is on accepting children who are being brought up within the framework of the faith , whereas the evangelical church takes a more relaxed approach to the religious background of its recruits . what they want to achieve , they say , is a good social mix . but is it illusory to think that 's really possible in schools that require tuition ?
frank says that although parents who send their children to evangelical schools are expected to pay a monthly fee of between 40 and 120 euros - based on what they earn - those who ca n't afford it are exempt without a battle .
but that said , he thinks germans should be prepared to dig deeper into their pockets for a good education . " it 's horrifying how little people are prepared to invest in learning , " he said . " they spend ten times more on entertainment than they do on education .

the film , der untergang - the downfall , will now open in israeli cinemas in may . a highly acclaimed german film sometimes criticized for portraying adolf hitler in too positive a light is to be released in israel after viewers gave it positive feedback last week . the film , " the downfall , -lrb- der untergang -rrb- " which was nominated in 2004 for an oscar in the best foreign film category , depicts hitler 's final days in a berlin bunker and includes scenes in which the nazi dictator seems almost approachable . while the film has been a hit in europe since its release , it had problems finding a distributor in israel .
but last week , nurit shani , owner of the israeli cinema chain lev and film distributor shani , told reuters that she decided to show the movie after an audience of 1,000 invited to a preview last week approved of it by 91 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : presenting two sides " i expected a vote in favour of the movie , but i did n't imagine it would be so decisive , " shani told reuters .
" i know there are still many for whom it will be difficult to see the human side of hitler portrayed in a film .
but it would have been unfair to prevent a curious and interested audience that is willing to confront the painful subject in its own way from seeing the movie . " a brutal megalomaniac the jewish state gained its independence after the end of world war ii , in which six million jews were slaughtered according to hitler 's plan .

hitler committed suicide april 30 , 1945 in the bunker . " this is the first time i saw how they -lrb- the germans -rrb- suffered , how they struggled with themselves , how they saw their ' fuehrer ' as crazy , " simha siani , who voted for screening the film , told reuters . the film will open in three israeli cities may 19 , two weeks after the annual holocaust memorial day is observed . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german film aims to gatecrash oscar party hollywood hosts the 77th academy awards ceremony on sunday night .

a trend towards christian schooling in germany might just substantiate that belief . it 's a fact that both catholic and evangelical schools in germany are flourishing .
there are almost 2,000 christian schools scattered across the country and an increasing number of children waiting patiently to be given one of the highly coveted places .
demand far outstrips supply and progressive parents are taking it upon themselves to found a new generation of denominational schools .
but is the upturn really a reflection of a born-again faith ? the answer is no , at least not exclusively .
in fact it seems to have more to do with a belief in a better education than a belief in god .
jürgen frank , head of education for the evangelical church of germany says there are three main reasons for the recent rise in enthusiasm for christian schooling . " firstly , families are generally smaller and parents want to provide their children with a good education .
secondly , they want the education their children receive to meet their individual needs , and thirdly they want a progressive , modern education system , " he said . popular values ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from incense to wine , catholic children have a lot to learn andreas verhülsdonk , an expert on religious education in the catholic church , says that parents are drawn to catholicism because they know their children will be taught values and morality . " we run a project called " compassion " in which pupils spend three weeks with homeless or sick people , " he said .
" the point is not just to help the needy but to give the children the chance to see the world through the eyes of people living on the fringes of society . " but christoph hermann , who sends his son to an evangelical school in berlin says it is simply important to make christianity a part of daily life . " i would n't consider myself particularly religious , but the christian faith was a part of my upbringing and that is what i want for my son , " hermann said . " we live in an increasingly secular society and i do n't want him to grow up seeing christianity as something fundamental because he has n't been exposed to it in an everyday kind of way . " there 's more to it than just religion that , however , is not to say that denominational schools neglect reading , writing and arithmetic .
in fact they are legally bound to provide pupils with the same curricular options as state schools , with the only difference being compulsory religious education for an average of two hours each week .
hermann believes his son is getting a good deal . " christianity is helpful in learning to understand our culture and it equips children to better understand art and history as well , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young children practice their abc and that is not all .
according to frank , children at evangelical schools in germany learn to read and write better than their state school counterparts . " a study we carried out after the publication of the pisa report revealed that the educational climate at christian schools is better than in state schools , and that the quality on offer at demoninational schools genuinely does live up to its reputation , " he said . indeed , that reputation appears to have run away with the imagination of some determined and diligent parents .
since the fall of the berlin wall , the church has given its blessing to the founding of some 70 new evangelical schools and there are 50 more would-be 's waiting in the wings .
but getting such a venture off the ground is no easy feat . " we have to clear a lot of hurdles , many of them financial , before a new school can be founded , " frank said . hurdles to new beginnings new school initiatives receive a grant from the evangelical church to see them through the first three or four years until the government starts paying an annual subsistence worth some 90 percent of the regular state school budget .
but frank says church funds are running dry . " we used to pay start-up schools some 240,000 euros -lrb- $ 309,000 -rrb- for those first few years , but now with so many waiting , we ca n't afford to do that , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children can be non-denominational and still attend a protestant school most of these projects depend very heavily on the driving parental force behind them , not only to put sponsorship or financing in place , but to find and renovate premises , to interview and hire staff , and of course to handpick the protégées . the selection criteria vary from school to school , state to state and church to church .
in the case of catholics , the emphasis is on accepting children who are being brought up within the framework of the faith , whereas the evangelical church takes a more relaxed approach to the religious background of its recruits . what they want to achieve , they say , is a good social mix . but is it illusory to think that 's really possible in schools that require tuition ?
frank says that although parents who send their children to evangelical schools are expected to pay a monthly fee of between 40 and 120 euros - based on what they earn - those who ca n't afford it are exempt without a battle .
but that said , he thinks germans should be prepared to dig deeper into their pockets for a good education . " it 's horrifying how little people are prepared to invest in learning , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 14.04.2005 back to belief in german schools großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian education has made a comeback in germany last week 's emotional outpouring following the pope 's death has sparked excited calls from the faithful that christianity is back ' in ' .
a trend towards christian schooling in germany might just substantiate that belief . it 's a fact that both catholic and evangelical schools in germany are flourishing .
there are almost 2,000 christian schools scattered across the country and an increasing number of children waiting patiently to be given one of the highly coveted places .
demand far outstrips supply and progressive parents are taking it upon themselves to found a new generation of denominational schools .
but is the upturn really a reflection of a born-again faith ? the answer is no , at least not exclusively .
in fact it seems to have more to do with a belief in a better education than a belief in god .
jürgen frank , head of education for the evangelical church of germany says there are three main reasons for the recent rise in enthusiasm for christian schooling . " firstly , families are generally smaller and parents want to provide their children with a good education .
secondly , they want the education their children receive to meet their individual needs , and thirdly they want a progressive , modern education system , " he said . popular values ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from incense to wine , catholic children have a lot to learn andreas verhülsdonk , an expert on religious education in the catholic church , says that parents are drawn to catholicism because they know their children will be taught values and morality . " we run a project called " compassion " in which pupils spend three weeks with homeless or sick people , " he said .
" the point is not just to help the needy but to give the children the chance to see the world through the eyes of people living on the fringes of society . " but christoph hermann , who sends his son to an evangelical school in berlin says it is simply important to make christianity a part of daily life . " i would n't consider myself particularly religious , but the christian faith was a part of my upbringing and that is what i want for my son , " hermann said . " we live in an increasingly secular society and i do n't want him to grow up seeing christianity as something fundamental because he has n't been exposed to it in an everyday kind of way . " there 's more to it than just religion that , however , is not to say that denominational schools neglect reading , writing and arithmetic .
in fact they are legally bound to provide pupils with the same curricular options as state schools , with the only difference being compulsory religious education for an average of two hours each week .
hermann believes his son is getting a good deal . " christianity is helpful in learning to understand our culture and it equips children to better understand art and history as well , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young children practice their abc and that is not all .
according to frank , children at evangelical schools in germany learn to read and write better than their state school counterparts . " a study we carried out after the publication of the pisa report revealed that the educational climate at christian schools is better than in state schools , and that the quality on offer at demoninational schools genuinely does live up to its reputation , " he said . indeed , that reputation appears to have run away with the imagination of some determined and diligent parents .
since the fall of the berlin wall , the church has given its blessing to the founding of some 70 new evangelical schools and there are 50 more would-be 's waiting in the wings .
but getting such a venture off the ground is no easy feat . " we have to clear a lot of hurdles , many of them financial , before a new school can be founded , " frank said . hurdles to new beginnings new school initiatives receive a grant from the evangelical church to see them through the first three or four years until the government starts paying an annual subsistence worth some 90 percent of the regular state school budget .
but frank says church funds are running dry . " we used to pay start-up schools some 240,000 euros -lrb- $ 309,000 -rrb- for those first few years , but now with so many waiting , we ca n't afford to do that , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children can be non-denominational and still attend a protestant school most of these projects depend very heavily on the driving parental force behind them , not only to put sponsorship or financing in place , but to find and renovate premises , to interview and hire staff , and of course to handpick the protégées . the selection criteria vary from school to school , state to state and church to church .
in the case of catholics , the emphasis is on accepting children who are being brought up within the framework of the faith , whereas the evangelical church takes a more relaxed approach to the religious background of its recruits . what they want to achieve , they say , is a good social mix . but is it illusory to think that 's really possible in schools that require tuition ?
frank says that although parents who send their children to evangelical schools are expected to pay a monthly fee of between 40 and 120 euros - based on what they earn - those who ca n't afford it are exempt without a battle .
but that said , he thinks germans should be prepared to dig deeper into their pockets for a good education . " it 's horrifying how little people are prepared to invest in learning , " he said . " they spend ten times more on entertainment than they do on education .

the conservative cardinal , in charge of defending church doctrine , is considered a frontrunner . la repubblica and corriere della sera , both respected italian dailies with close contacts with the vatican , say two powerful german cardinals , karl lehmann of mainz and walter kasper , who is based in rome , have lined up against their fellow german who has been the catholic church 's controversial doctrinal watchdog . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal lehmann both lehmann and kasper have had public differences with ratzinger in the past . american cardinals have also expressed reservations about a possible ratzinger pontificate , according to la repubblica .

the conservative cardinal , in charge of defending church doctrine , is considered a frontrunner . la repubblica and corriere della sera , both respected italian dailies with close contacts with the vatican , say two powerful german cardinals , karl lehmann of mainz and walter kasper , who is based in rome , have lined up against their fellow german who has been the catholic church 's controversial doctrinal watchdog . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal lehmann both lehmann and kasper have had public differences with ratzinger in the past . american cardinals have also expressed reservations about a possible ratzinger pontificate , according to la repubblica .
the paper reported that american and german cardinals are worried about ratzinger 's apparent lack of interest in matters of administration . german cardinals also have taken issue with ratzinger 's opposition to allowing lay theologians to take a leading roll in parishes that lack priests , a serious problem in germany .
the paper also said the ratzinger , the one-time archbishop of munich , had failed to address the issue of not allowing catholics who had divorced and remarried to receive communion . martini - the moderates ' man the milan-based corriere della sera reported that opponents to ratzinger were lining up behind 78-year-old carlo maria martini , who was a favorite of moderates until he resigned as milan 's archbishop in 2002 .

a voting conclave can last for several days and often produces surprising results , as did the one in 1978 which elected poland 's karol wojtyla . however , since many of the bishops in the conclave were appointed by john paul ii , himself a conservative , the traditionalist camp is strong .
italian newspapers reported that between 40 and 50 cardinals had signalled their support for ratzinger in private meetings this week . that number , though , is short of the two-thirds majority , 77 out of 115 votes , needed to win .

lessons organized by the churches would only be optional and would not free students of the obligation to attend the new ethics classes . the decision by berlin ’ s spd leadership has infuriated numerous federal politicians particularly from the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and bavaria ’ s arch-conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- . during a special parliamentary session in the federal parliament on wednesday , the cdu 's education spokespeople called berlin ’ s plan to introduce mandatory ethics lessons an aggressive assault on the christian faith in german society . the party ’ s hermann kues said the new lessons to be introduced in 2006 smacked too much of the anti-religious approach that teachers in former communist east germany preferred : a question of choice " the freedom of religion is one of our highest values , " kues said .
" i believe that the new ethics lessons as intended by berlin are not suitable to give school students a fair choice of whether to become believers or atheists .
there are references to god in our constitution or basic law , and we must not let anyone neglect values which in our society are so much based on christian faith . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang huber needless to say , the christian churches themselves have joined the critics ' chorus .
the head of germany 's protestant church council , wolfgang huber -lrb- photo -rrb- , declared that everything had to be done to prevent berlin from becoming godless . but wilhelm schmidt from the social democrat faction in the bundestag accused his political rivals of hypocrisy " no one prevents anyone from taking lessons in the religion of their choice , " schmidt complained .
" so why all the fuss now ?
none of the opponents of the berlin plan , he argued , ever complained about the fact that only a meager 20 percent of school students have taken part in voluntary lessons in christianity in the past few decades .
" and now all of a sudden you ’ re making such a fuss " , he told conservative mps . brandenburg success a template ethics lessons , which berlin is poised to make compulsory , were introduced in neighboring brandenburg as early as 1996 .
and according to the head of the region 's institute for education , jan hofmann , the subject has been a success . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students whose parent object will be in the minoroty , says jan hofmann " there ’ s only a very small group of school students whose parents categorically object to these lessons , " he said .
" and then there are those who have opted for lessons in religion offered by either the catholic or protestant church .
these children do not have to attend ethics classes .
i think that despite initial criticism our system has worked quite well and might serve as a model for other federal states . " it is possible that berlin may have to soften the compulsory status of its planned general ethics lessons , because germany ’ s conservative parties are intending to bring the issue before the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe . hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de back to belief in german schools last week 's emotional outpouring following the pope 's death has sparked excited calls from the faithful that christianity is back ' in ' .

that could soon change . on time magazine 's list of the top 100 people who have influenced the world in the past year , three germans are present .
they are n't perhaps who you 'd think .
chancellor gerhard schröder does n't get a mention , nor does foreign minister joschka fischer or any of the country 's ceos or top scientists . instead , formula one driver michael schumacher made the grade , as did cardinal ratzinger , the man some believe could become the next pope .
the third german was cornelia funke , the best-selling author of children 's books whose fantasy-filled stories are enchanting readers around the world . with a sigh he sat down behind his desk .
then , behind the door , someone whispered .
they 're probably admiring my sign , thought victor .
it was black and shiny and had gold lettering : " victor getz , detective .
investigations of any kind . "
the door knocker next to the sign was in the shape of a lion 's head with a brass ring in its mouth , which victor has just polished this morning . victor getz does n't know it yet , but on this very morning he will set out in search of two street children , prosper and bo , and perhaps while he 's at it , he will find himself .
victor is one of the central characters in cornelia funke 's book " the thief lord . " complex characters , page-turner plots her characters are often not the nicest folks .

" they just find them to be very , you know , magical and enchanting and also sophisticated . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 46-year-old has sold more than three million books in her career , winning several prestigious awards in the process .
her most well-known works , " the thief lord , " dragonrider " and " inkheart " have been translated into 20 languages .
" the thief lord " has been made into a film and will hit german cinemas this fall .

" but if it means that children in for example america are told stories by a european , then that 's something at least . " prolific author in the uk especially , funke is often described as the german response to j.k. rowling , the british superstar author of the harry potter series .
rowling , who is nine years younger than funke , is now working on her sixth harry potter book .
funke , on the other hand , has written more than 40 books in 15 years .
one of her most successful , " inkheart , " is an homage to reading and the power of the written word . on that night - when so much began and so much changed forever - one of meggie 's favorite books lay under her pillow and since the rain was n't letting her sleep , she sat up , rubbed her eyes and pulled the book out .

that could soon change . on time magazine 's list of the top 100 people who have influenced the world in the past year , three germans are present .
they are n't perhaps who you 'd think .
chancellor gerhard schröder does n't get a mention , nor does foreign minister joschka fischer or any of the country 's ceos or top scientists . instead , formula one driver michael schumacher made the grade , as did cardinal ratzinger , the man some believe could become the next pope .
the third german was cornelia funke , the best-selling author of children 's books whose fantasy-filled stories are enchanting readers around the world . with a sigh he sat down behind his desk .
then , behind the door , someone whispered .
they 're probably admiring my sign , thought victor .
it was black and shiny and had gold lettering : " victor getz , detective .
investigations of any kind . "
the door knocker next to the sign was in the shape of a lion 's head with a brass ring in its mouth , which victor has just polished this morning . victor getz does n't know it yet , but on this very morning he will set out in search of two street children , prosper and bo , and perhaps while he 's at it , he will find himself .

lessons organized by the churches would only be optional and would not free students of the obligation to attend the new ethics classes . the decision by berlin ’ s spd leadership has infuriated numerous federal politicians particularly from the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and bavaria ’ s arch-conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- . during a special parliamentary session in the federal parliament on wednesday , the cdu 's education spokespeople called berlin ’ s plan to introduce mandatory ethics lessons an aggressive assault on the christian faith in german society . the party ’ s hermann kues said the new lessons to be introduced in 2006 smacked too much of the anti-religious approach that teachers in former communist east germany preferred : a question of choice " the freedom of religion is one of our highest values , " kues said .
" i believe that the new ethics lessons as intended by berlin are not suitable to give school students a fair choice of whether to become believers or atheists .
there are references to god in our constitution or basic law , and we must not let anyone neglect values which in our society are so much based on christian faith . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang huber needless to say , the christian churches themselves have joined the critics ' chorus .
the head of germany 's protestant church council , wolfgang huber -lrb- photo -rrb- , declared that everything had to be done to prevent berlin from becoming godless . but wilhelm schmidt from the social democrat faction in the bundestag accused his political rivals of hypocrisy " no one prevents anyone from taking lessons in the religion of their choice , " schmidt complained .
" so why all the fuss now ?
none of the opponents of the berlin plan , he argued , ever complained about the fact that only a meager 20 percent of school students have taken part in voluntary lessons in christianity in the past few decades .
" and now all of a sudden you ’ re making such a fuss " , he told conservative mps . brandenburg success a template ethics lessons , which berlin is poised to make compulsory , were introduced in neighboring brandenburg as early as 1996 .
and according to the head of the region 's institute for education , jan hofmann , the subject has been a success . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students whose parent object will be in the minoroty , says jan hofmann " there ’ s only a very small group of school students whose parents categorically object to these lessons , " he said .
" and then there are those who have opted for lessons in religion offered by either the catholic or protestant church .
these children do not have to attend ethics classes .
i think that despite initial criticism our system has worked quite well and might serve as a model for other federal states .

work-life balance gets boost in germany encouraging germans to have more kids the dumbing down of germany study : men in germany are scared to start families current affairs -pipe- 14.04.2005 gerd 's family policy gets down to business großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor wants to see more germans starting families by 2020 , germany will have europe 's lowest percentage of young people .
wednesday 's conference on family policy took a close look at the economic repercussions of the declining birth rate . as germany struggles to maintain the viability of its state pension scheme amid an imminent demographic crunch caused by falling birth rates and an ageing population , chancellor gerhard schröder on wednesday renewed his commitment to encouraging families to have children and outlined new initiatives which would provide financial and job benefits to working germans who decide to start a family or expand an existing one . children are our future , " said chancellor gerhard schröder at the conference called " family - success factor for the economy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " they are our future workforce , consumers and parents .
our future , our pensions and the economic strength of our country , rests in the hands of our children . " the family challenge the number of children born in germany has fallen a dramatic 50 per cent from 1.4 million in 1964 to just 700,000 in 2005 .
as the country 's unemployment figures continue to swell , to many , the prospect of raising a family seems just too challenging .
given the nation 's nagging economic woes , women in particular see the difficulty of combining child-rearing and career as too much of a deterrent . it 's a trend germany ca n't afford to let develop . " creating good conditions for families became an economic issue a long time ago , " said schröder .
a reduced younger generation means a declining workforce , lack of innovation and ever fewer consumers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we can not allow a woman to decide against having children because she 's reluctant to have to choose between having a child or having a career , " stressed schröder .
" we can not allow a family on a normal income to decide against another child for financial reasons . in future , family policy has to create conditions which enable more people to have children . " benefits for both sides in 2003 , the government joined forces with business to form the alliance for family policy , which aimed to develop improved work-family reconciliation policies . but despite the government 's efforts to provide day care and tax relief for families , germany is still short of some 1.2 million nursery places for children under three .
schröder pledged once again to increase day care for working families . " flexible working hours and family-friendly employment policies are good , because both sides reap benefits , " he insisted . throwing out the three-year job guarantee he also said industry should do more to support employees with children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but president of the german employers association , dieter hundt , pointed out that two thirds of all firms already offer their employees flexible schedules and that business should n't be blamed for the problem .
he contended that it was the state which has to reform its policies regarding families . for now , mothers are allowed to take up to six months of paid maternity leave and unpaid leave of up to three years . " something needs to change " " as far as employers are concerned , we need to take a new look at reducing parental leave , " said hundt .
" so far , our relatively generous family support of € 150 billion has led to neither higher birth rates nor improved integration of parents within the labor market .
something needs to change . " hundt believes that parents need to return to the work faster than is currently the norm , because the german economy simply ca n't afford to forfeit qualified workers with know-how . the government largely agrees .
its latest proposal , outlined at the conference by minister for family affairs renate schmidt , would introduce a sliding scale benefit scheme dependent on income . but as schröder said wednesday , the issue is by no means purely financial .

that could soon change . on time magazine 's list of the top 100 people who have influenced the world in the past year , three germans are present .
they are n't perhaps who you 'd think .
chancellor gerhard schröder does n't get a mention , nor does foreign minister joschka fischer or any of the country 's ceos or top scientists . instead , formula one driver michael schumacher made the grade , as did cardinal ratzinger , the man some believe could become the next pope .
the third german was cornelia funke , the best-selling author of children 's books whose fantasy-filled stories are enchanting readers around the world . with a sigh he sat down behind his desk .
then , behind the door , someone whispered .
they 're probably admiring my sign , thought victor .
it was black and shiny and had gold lettering : " victor getz , detective .
investigations of any kind . "
the door knocker next to the sign was in the shape of a lion 's head with a brass ring in its mouth , which victor has just polished this morning . victor getz does n't know it yet , but on this very morning he will set out in search of two street children , prosper and bo , and perhaps while he 's at it , he will find himself .
victor is one of the central characters in cornelia funke 's book " the thief lord . " complex characters , page-turner plots her characters are often not the nicest folks .
they 're often grumpy , shifty , timid , complicated and cunning - always three dimensional and without exception , loveable .
in funke 's fantastical stories , the figures move through refreshingly unpredictable plots , which are always immensely entertaining for readers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " inkheart " " i like to show children things that i myself find incredibly wonderful , for example , venice , " she said .
" of course other things creep in that occupy one 's mind , like the unbelievable lack of compassion that exists so often between humans and animals , or humans and humans .
but i always try to bind it all in the story .
the story comes first . " the former book illustrator began writing her own books 15 years ago ; most have been bestsellers .
but her phenomenal success has been so quiet that most germans have n't yet noticed this new global writer in their midst .
it 's mostly parents for whom the name " cornelia funke " has taken on special meaning , since it so often pops up in the juvenile section of libraries or on the wish lists of their children . magical but sophisticated us-based time magazine has been more alert to her talent than her compatriots since it awarded her a place in the magazine 's top 100 list . " she has become truly international and everyone who discovers her books really loves them , " said adi ignacius , time 's executive editor .
" they just find them to be very , you know , magical and enchanting and also sophisticated . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 46-year-old has sold more than three million books in her career , winning several prestigious awards in the process .
her most well-known works , " the thief lord , " dragonrider " and " inkheart " have been translated into 20 languages .
" the thief lord " has been made into a film and will hit german cinemas this fall .
big-screen productions of " inkheart " and the girl 's series " wilde hühner " -lrb- wild chickens -rrb- are also being planned . " it 's true that right now i 'm reaching millions of children .
but i 'm not very optimistic what kind of influence i have , " funke said .
" but if it means that children in for example america are told stories by a european , then that 's something at least . " prolific author in the uk especially , funke is often described as the german response to j.k. rowling , the british superstar author of the harry potter series .
rowling , who is nine years younger than funke , is now working on her sixth harry potter book .
funke , on the other hand , has written more than 40 books in 15 years .
one of her most successful , " inkheart , " is an homage to reading and the power of the written word . on that night - when so much began and so much changed forever - one of meggie 's favorite books lay under her pillow and since the rain was n't letting her sleep , she sat up , rubbed her eyes and pulled the book out .
the page rustled promisingly as she opened it .
meggie thought that this first sound of pages was different in every book , depending on if she already knew what it was going to tell her or not . seemingly unmoved by her many literary awards and the time magazine list , cornelia funke simply goes on doing what she does best - write .
right now she 's working on a sequel to " inkheart " called " inkblood . "
like her colleague j.k. rowling on the other side of the channel , she will continue with each new book to turn both children and adults alike back to the pleasures of reading .
and that , really , is her goal . ingrid lommer -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the reluctance to read the literary world has its eyes on frankfurt this week during the world 's largest book fair .

they 're often grumpy , shifty , timid , complicated and cunning - always three dimensional and without exception , loveable .
in funke 's fantastical stories , the figures move through refreshingly unpredictable plots , which are always immensely entertaining for readers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " inkheart " " i like to show children things that i myself find incredibly wonderful , for example , venice , " she said .
" of course other things creep in that occupy one 's mind , like the unbelievable lack of compassion that exists so often between humans and animals , or humans and humans .
but i always try to bind it all in the story .
the story comes first . " the former book illustrator began writing her own books 15 years ago ; most have been bestsellers .
but her phenomenal success has been so quiet that most germans have n't yet noticed this new global writer in their midst .
it 's mostly parents for whom the name " cornelia funke " has taken on special meaning , since it so often pops up in the juvenile section of libraries or on the wish lists of their children . magical but sophisticated us-based time magazine has been more alert to her talent than her compatriots since it awarded her a place in the magazine 's top 100 list . " she has become truly international and everyone who discovers her books really loves them , " said adi ignacius , time 's executive editor .
" they just find them to be very , you know , magical and enchanting and also sophisticated . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 46-year-old has sold more than three million books in her career , winning several prestigious awards in the process .
her most well-known works , " the thief lord , " dragonrider " and " inkheart " have been translated into 20 languages .
" the thief lord " has been made into a film and will hit german cinemas this fall .
big-screen productions of " inkheart " and the girl 's series " wilde hühner " -lrb- wild chickens -rrb- are also being planned . " it 's true that right now i 'm reaching millions of children .
but i 'm not very optimistic what kind of influence i have , " funke said .
" but if it means that children in for example america are told stories by a european , then that 's something at least . " prolific author in the uk especially , funke is often described as the german response to j.k. rowling , the british superstar author of the harry potter series .
rowling , who is nine years younger than funke , is now working on her sixth harry potter book .
funke , on the other hand , has written more than 40 books in 15 years .
one of her most successful , " inkheart , " is an homage to reading and the power of the written word . on that night - when so much began and so much changed forever - one of meggie 's favorite books lay under her pillow and since the rain was n't letting her sleep , she sat up , rubbed her eyes and pulled the book out .
the page rustled promisingly as she opened it .
meggie thought that this first sound of pages was different in every book , depending on if she already knew what it was going to tell her or not . seemingly unmoved by her many literary awards and the time magazine list , cornelia funke simply goes on doing what she does best - write .
right now she 's working on a sequel to " inkheart " called " inkblood . "
like her colleague j.k. rowling on the other side of the channel , she will continue with each new book to turn both children and adults alike back to the pleasures of reading .
and that , really , is her goal . ingrid lommer -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the reluctance to read the literary world has its eyes on frankfurt this week during the world 's largest book fair .

that could soon change . on time magazine 's list of the top 100 people who have influenced the world in the past year , three germans are present .
they are n't perhaps who you 'd think .
chancellor gerhard schröder does n't get a mention , nor does foreign minister joschka fischer or any of the country 's ceos or top scientists . instead , formula one driver michael schumacher made the grade , as did cardinal ratzinger , the man some believe could become the next pope .
the third german was cornelia funke , the best-selling author of children 's books whose fantasy-filled stories are enchanting readers around the world . with a sigh he sat down behind his desk .
then , behind the door , someone whispered .
they 're probably admiring my sign , thought victor .
it was black and shiny and had gold lettering : " victor getz , detective .
investigations of any kind . "
the door knocker next to the sign was in the shape of a lion 's head with a brass ring in its mouth , which victor has just polished this morning . victor getz does n't know it yet , but on this very morning he will set out in search of two street children , prosper and bo , and perhaps while he 's at it , he will find himself .

they include strengthening administration systems , beefing up border controls and introducing competition policy measures . rampant corruption is a concern for both countries , but particularly for romania , and some green members of parliament doubted that reforms could be carried out in time . green parliamentarian daniel cohn-bendit pointed to the eu legislature 's own report on romania that said : " high-level corruption , despite recent efforts , continues to undermine the country 's socio-economic and political life . " " if we look at matters such as press freedom and corruption and we take seriously everything we 've read in the reports , no one can say that romania in its current state is ready to join , " he said . while parliament rejected a motion by some minority groups to delay the votes until after the european commission publishes a report in november about the countries ' preparation for membership , it did for the first time in an enlargement procedure invoke a protection clause which states that the union could postpone the accession until 2008 if the countries did not make satisfactory progress in implementing reforms . both countries missed the first wave of the eu 's eastwards enlargement in may because they were slow to introduce political and economic reforms after the collapse of communism in 1989 .

" we will need 20 , 30 years , even as an eu member , to reach the normal eu level , " said petar-emil mitev , a sociology professor . despite that , bulgaria 's citizens are enthusiastic about joining the european club , since for many of them it means a chance to get on a par with their neighbors .

work-life balance gets boost in germany encouraging germans to have more kids the dumbing down of germany study : men in germany are scared to start families current affairs -pipe- 14.04.2005 gerd 's family policy gets down to business großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor wants to see more germans starting families by 2020 , germany will have europe 's lowest percentage of young people .
wednesday 's conference on family policy took a close look at the economic repercussions of the declining birth rate . as germany struggles to maintain the viability of its state pension scheme amid an imminent demographic crunch caused by falling birth rates and an ageing population , chancellor gerhard schröder on wednesday renewed his commitment to encouraging families to have children and outlined new initiatives which would provide financial and job benefits to working germans who decide to start a family or expand an existing one . children are our future , " said chancellor gerhard schröder at the conference called " family - success factor for the economy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " they are our future workforce , consumers and parents .
our future , our pensions and the economic strength of our country , rests in the hands of our children . " the family challenge the number of children born in germany has fallen a dramatic 50 per cent from 1.4 million in 1964 to just 700,000 in 2005 .
as the country 's unemployment figures continue to swell , to many , the prospect of raising a family seems just too challenging .
given the nation 's nagging economic woes , women in particular see the difficulty of combining child-rearing and career as too much of a deterrent . it 's a trend germany ca n't afford to let develop . " creating good conditions for families became an economic issue a long time ago , " said schröder .
a reduced younger generation means a declining workforce , lack of innovation and ever fewer consumers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we can not allow a woman to decide against having children because she 's reluctant to have to choose between having a child or having a career , " stressed schröder .
" we can not allow a family on a normal income to decide against another child for financial reasons . in future , family policy has to create conditions which enable more people to have children . " benefits for both sides in 2003 , the government joined forces with business to form the alliance for family policy , which aimed to develop improved work-family reconciliation policies . but despite the government 's efforts to provide day care and tax relief for families , germany is still short of some 1.2 million nursery places for children under three .
schröder pledged once again to increase day care for working families . " flexible working hours and family-friendly employment policies are good , because both sides reap benefits , " he insisted . throwing out the three-year job guarantee he also said industry should do more to support employees with children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but president of the german employers association , dieter hundt , pointed out that two thirds of all firms already offer their employees flexible schedules and that business should n't be blamed for the problem .
he contended that it was the state which has to reform its policies regarding families . for now , mothers are allowed to take up to six months of paid maternity leave and unpaid leave of up to three years . " something needs to change " " as far as employers are concerned , we need to take a new look at reducing parental leave , " said hundt .
" so far , our relatively generous family support of € 150 billion has led to neither higher birth rates nor improved integration of parents within the labor market .
something needs to change . " hundt believes that parents need to return to the work faster than is currently the norm , because the german economy simply ca n't afford to forfeit qualified workers with know-how . the government largely agrees .
its latest proposal , outlined at the conference by minister for family affairs renate schmidt , would introduce a sliding scale benefit scheme dependent on income . but as schröder said wednesday , the issue is by no means purely financial .

turks are increasingly critical of the country 's possible accession to the eu as euro-skeptics warn of a potential sell-out of national interests . even though opinion polls regularly show that three-quarters of turks favour their country joining the eu , increasing numbers are also becoming aware of drawbacks : brussels is going to make increasing demands on ankara and will have a bigger role in running the country .
many see this this as a threat to the turkish state .
these warnings are also being voiced in other countries that are seeking eu membership but nowhere do they touch the nerve the way they do in turkey .
while the eu - as a result of its experiences in the two world wars - is trying to supress the individual nation-state by bringing member states closer together as one , many turks consider the nation-state to be the greatest good .
" sovereignty belongs unconditionally and unreservedly to the nation " was one of the principles of atatürk , the founder of the modern turkish state , whose image hangs on the end wall of the plenary chamber in the turkish parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recep tayyip erdogan und abdullah gül have been accused of compromising over cyprus a foreign toy ?
turkey arose out of the ruins of the ottoman empire , which was occupied by the allied victors of world war i , in the 1920s .
in a war that involved heavy losses , atatürk succeeded in driving the greek occupying powers - in west anatolia in particular - out of the country .
in the early years of the republic , turks feared that the country would be carved up and become a plaything of foreign powers .
as a result , it is unsurprising that nationalists are claiming that turkish membership in the european union would ultimately only benefit europeans , not turks .
and they point to to the conflict over cyprus as evidence . the cypress conflict turkey 's euro-skeptics criticize every step taken by the government of prime minister recep tayyip erdogan regarding cypress : he hints that he is willing to make compromises in the search for a peaceful solution for the divided mediterranean island .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a close ally of turkish membership the fact that erdogan 's government is " selling " cyprus in order to show the eu how obedient tukrkey is , is an image often peddled by the right-wing nationalist mhp party .
but concern over the fate of the turkish state in the upcoming membership negotiations with the eu is not only an issue for turkey 's right wing .
drawing attention to supposed threats to turkey from outside its national borders is also part of the repertoire of the social democratic opposition party chp .
the chp recently and successfully challenged a law governing the sale of land and buildings to foreigners through the constitutional court .
the chp is part of turkey 's lay kemalist establishment that considers all deviations from atatürk 's course to be wrong .
because of this , kemalists have terrible difficulty accepting some of the european union 's key demands .
they even have trouble opening turkey up to foreign investors – a fact demonstrated by more than just the fate of the real estate law .
president ahmet necdet sezer , a leading kemalist , recently vetoed a law that would have allowed foreigners to buy television stations in turkey .
the president explained that he had taken this action because a law of this sort would not have been in the " national interest " .
sensitive minority policy if ground-breaking economic policies such as this are viewed with such suspicion , it is no wonder that the resistance to more sensitive issues , such as policies on minorities , is even more fierce .
the alleged attempts of young kurds to burn a turkish flag triggered nationalist hysteria across the country over the past few weeks .
tens of thousands demonstratively draped their homes with turkish flags while the turkish police marched through istanbul bearing a 1.5-kilometre long flag .
meanwhile , both the nationalists and kemalists are being joined by a growing number of turkish islamists who are also sceptical about their country 's eu application .
over the past few years , turkey 's islamists has accounted for some of the country 's greatest europhiles because they hoped that moving closer to the eu would bring more freedom of religion .
but the introduction of headscarf bans in several eu states and other similar developments have dashed these hopes .
a recent report published by the independent industrialist & businessmen 's association , müsiad , concluded that the basic values on which the eu is built are a " strait-jacket " for muslims .
even though erdogan 's government has more than a two-thirds majority in parliament , it says that eu skepticism must be taken seriously .
the nationalist and islamist wing of the ruling akp ensures that this mistrust is not restricted to the opposition both inside and outside the parliament .
the debate as to what other demands the eu has yet to make on turkey and how the country should react to them is only likely to really start once accession negotiations begin october 3 . susanne güsten , qantara.de -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is turkey losing its reform zeal ?

turks are increasingly critical of the country 's possible accession to the eu as euro-skeptics warn of a potential sell-out of national interests . even though opinion polls regularly show that three-quarters of turks favour their country joining the eu , increasing numbers are also becoming aware of drawbacks : brussels is going to make increasing demands on ankara and will have a bigger role in running the country .
many see this this as a threat to the turkish state .
these warnings are also being voiced in other countries that are seeking eu membership but nowhere do they touch the nerve the way they do in turkey .
while the eu - as a result of its experiences in the two world wars - is trying to supress the individual nation-state by bringing member states closer together as one , many turks consider the nation-state to be the greatest good .
" sovereignty belongs unconditionally and unreservedly to the nation " was one of the principles of atatürk , the founder of the modern turkish state , whose image hangs on the end wall of the plenary chamber in the turkish parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recep tayyip erdogan und abdullah gül have been accused of compromising over cyprus a foreign toy ?
turkey arose out of the ruins of the ottoman empire , which was occupied by the allied victors of world war i , in the 1920s .
in a war that involved heavy losses , atatürk succeeded in driving the greek occupying powers - in west anatolia in particular - out of the country .
in the early years of the republic , turks feared that the country would be carved up and become a plaything of foreign powers .
as a result , it is unsurprising that nationalists are claiming that turkish membership in the european union would ultimately only benefit europeans , not turks .
and they point to to the conflict over cyprus as evidence . the cypress conflict turkey 's euro-skeptics criticize every step taken by the government of prime minister recep tayyip erdogan regarding cypress : he hints that he is willing to make compromises in the search for a peaceful solution for the divided mediterranean island .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a close ally of turkish membership the fact that erdogan 's government is " selling " cyprus in order to show the eu how obedient tukrkey is , is an image often peddled by the right-wing nationalist mhp party .
but concern over the fate of the turkish state in the upcoming membership negotiations with the eu is not only an issue for turkey 's right wing .
drawing attention to supposed threats to turkey from outside its national borders is also part of the repertoire of the social democratic opposition party chp .
the chp recently and successfully challenged a law governing the sale of land and buildings to foreigners through the constitutional court .
the chp is part of turkey 's lay kemalist establishment that considers all deviations from atatürk 's course to be wrong .
because of this , kemalists have terrible difficulty accepting some of the european union 's key demands .
they even have trouble opening turkey up to foreign investors – a fact demonstrated by more than just the fate of the real estate law .
president ahmet necdet sezer , a leading kemalist , recently vetoed a law that would have allowed foreigners to buy television stations in turkey .
the president explained that he had taken this action because a law of this sort would not have been in the " national interest " .
sensitive minority policy if ground-breaking economic policies such as this are viewed with such suspicion , it is no wonder that the resistance to more sensitive issues , such as policies on minorities , is even more fierce .
the alleged attempts of young kurds to burn a turkish flag triggered nationalist hysteria across the country over the past few weeks .
tens of thousands demonstratively draped their homes with turkish flags while the turkish police marched through istanbul bearing a 1.5-kilometre long flag .
meanwhile , both the nationalists and kemalists are being joined by a growing number of turkish islamists who are also sceptical about their country 's eu application .
over the past few years , turkey 's islamists has accounted for some of the country 's greatest europhiles because they hoped that moving closer to the eu would bring more freedom of religion .
but the introduction of headscarf bans in several eu states and other similar developments have dashed these hopes .
a recent report published by the independent industrialist & businessmen 's association , müsiad , concluded that the basic values on which the eu is built are a " strait-jacket " for muslims .
even though erdogan 's government has more than a two-thirds majority in parliament , it says that eu skepticism must be taken seriously .
the nationalist and islamist wing of the ruling akp ensures that this mistrust is not restricted to the opposition both inside and outside the parliament .
the debate as to what other demands the eu has yet to make on turkey and how the country should react to them is only likely to really start once accession negotiations begin october 3 . susanne güsten , qantara.de -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is turkey losing its reform zeal ?

from the edge of the midfield circle , the colorful brazilian launched a lob over keeper richard golz who had wandered too far off his line .
the ball flew over the flailing golz and landed in the net .
marcelinho went on to score on a penalty kick and assisted on nico kovac 's goal in the 90th minute .

a trend towards christian schooling in germany might just substantiate that belief . it 's a fact that both catholic and evangelical schools in germany are flourishing .
there are almost 2,000 christian schools scattered across the country and an increasing number of children waiting patiently to be given one of the highly coveted places .
demand far outstrips supply and progressive parents are taking it upon themselves to found a new generation of denominational schools .
but is the upturn really a reflection of a born-again faith ? the answer is no , at least not exclusively .
in fact it seems to have more to do with a belief in a better education than a belief in god .
jürgen frank , head of education for the evangelical church of germany says there are three main reasons for the recent rise in enthusiasm for christian schooling . " firstly , families are generally smaller and parents want to provide their children with a good education .
secondly , they want the education their children receive to meet their individual needs , and thirdly they want a progressive , modern education system , " he said . popular values ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from incense to wine , catholic children have a lot to learn andreas verhülsdonk , an expert on religious education in the catholic church , says that parents are drawn to catholicism because they know their children will be taught values and morality . " we run a project called " compassion " in which pupils spend three weeks with homeless or sick people , " he said .
" the point is not just to help the needy but to give the children the chance to see the world through the eyes of people living on the fringes of society . " but christoph hermann , who sends his son to an evangelical school in berlin says it is simply important to make christianity a part of daily life . " i would n't consider myself particularly religious , but the christian faith was a part of my upbringing and that is what i want for my son , " hermann said . " we live in an increasingly secular society and i do n't want him to grow up seeing christianity as something fundamental because he has n't been exposed to it in an everyday kind of way . " there 's more to it than just religion that , however , is not to say that denominational schools neglect reading , writing and arithmetic .
in fact they are legally bound to provide pupils with the same curricular options as state schools , with the only difference being compulsory religious education for an average of two hours each week .
hermann believes his son is getting a good deal . " christianity is helpful in learning to understand our culture and it equips children to better understand art and history as well , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young children practice their abc and that is not all .
according to frank , children at evangelical schools in germany learn to read and write better than their state school counterparts . " a study we carried out after the publication of the pisa report revealed that the educational climate at christian schools is better than in state schools , and that the quality on offer at demoninational schools genuinely does live up to its reputation , " he said . indeed , that reputation appears to have run away with the imagination of some determined and diligent parents .
since the fall of the berlin wall , the church has given its blessing to the founding of some 70 new evangelical schools and there are 50 more would-be 's waiting in the wings .
but getting such a venture off the ground is no easy feat . " we have to clear a lot of hurdles , many of them financial , before a new school can be founded , " frank said . hurdles to new beginnings new school initiatives receive a grant from the evangelical church to see them through the first three or four years until the government starts paying an annual subsistence worth some 90 percent of the regular state school budget .
but frank says church funds are running dry . " we used to pay start-up schools some 240,000 euros -lrb- $ 309,000 -rrb- for those first few years , but now with so many waiting , we ca n't afford to do that , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children can be non-denominational and still attend a protestant school most of these projects depend very heavily on the driving parental force behind them , not only to put sponsorship or financing in place , but to find and renovate premises , to interview and hire staff , and of course to handpick the protégées . the selection criteria vary from school to school , state to state and church to church .
in the case of catholics , the emphasis is on accepting children who are being brought up within the framework of the faith , whereas the evangelical church takes a more relaxed approach to the religious background of its recruits . what they want to achieve , they say , is a good social mix . but is it illusory to think that 's really possible in schools that require tuition ?
frank says that although parents who send their children to evangelical schools are expected to pay a monthly fee of between 40 and 120 euros - based on what they earn - those who ca n't afford it are exempt without a battle .
but that said , he thinks germans should be prepared to dig deeper into their pockets for a good education . " it 's horrifying how little people are prepared to invest in learning , " he said .

a trend towards christian schooling in germany might just substantiate that belief . it 's a fact that both catholic and evangelical schools in germany are flourishing .
there are almost 2,000 christian schools scattered across the country and an increasing number of children waiting patiently to be given one of the highly coveted places .
demand far outstrips supply and progressive parents are taking it upon themselves to found a new generation of denominational schools .
but is the upturn really a reflection of a born-again faith ? the answer is no , at least not exclusively .
in fact it seems to have more to do with a belief in a better education than a belief in god .
jürgen frank , head of education for the evangelical church of germany says there are three main reasons for the recent rise in enthusiasm for christian schooling . " firstly , families are generally smaller and parents want to provide their children with a good education .
secondly , they want the education their children receive to meet their individual needs , and thirdly they want a progressive , modern education system , " he said . popular values ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from incense to wine , catholic children have a lot to learn andreas verhülsdonk , an expert on religious education in the catholic church , says that parents are drawn to catholicism because they know their children will be taught values and morality . " we run a project called " compassion " in which pupils spend three weeks with homeless or sick people , " he said .
" the point is not just to help the needy but to give the children the chance to see the world through the eyes of people living on the fringes of society . " but christoph hermann , who sends his son to an evangelical school in berlin says it is simply important to make christianity a part of daily life . " i would n't consider myself particularly religious , but the christian faith was a part of my upbringing and that is what i want for my son , " hermann said . " we live in an increasingly secular society and i do n't want him to grow up seeing christianity as something fundamental because he has n't been exposed to it in an everyday kind of way . " there 's more to it than just religion that , however , is not to say that denominational schools neglect reading , writing and arithmetic .
in fact they are legally bound to provide pupils with the same curricular options as state schools , with the only difference being compulsory religious education for an average of two hours each week .
hermann believes his son is getting a good deal . " christianity is helpful in learning to understand our culture and it equips children to better understand art and history as well , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young children practice their abc and that is not all .
according to frank , children at evangelical schools in germany learn to read and write better than their state school counterparts . " a study we carried out after the publication of the pisa report revealed that the educational climate at christian schools is better than in state schools , and that the quality on offer at demoninational schools genuinely does live up to its reputation , " he said . indeed , that reputation appears to have run away with the imagination of some determined and diligent parents .
since the fall of the berlin wall , the church has given its blessing to the founding of some 70 new evangelical schools and there are 50 more would-be 's waiting in the wings .
but getting such a venture off the ground is no easy feat . " we have to clear a lot of hurdles , many of them financial , before a new school can be founded , " frank said . hurdles to new beginnings new school initiatives receive a grant from the evangelical church to see them through the first three or four years until the government starts paying an annual subsistence worth some 90 percent of the regular state school budget .
but frank says church funds are running dry .

in the case of catholics , the emphasis is on accepting children who are being brought up within the framework of the faith , whereas the evangelical church takes a more relaxed approach to the religious background of its recruits . what they want to achieve , they say , is a good social mix . but is it illusory to think that 's really possible in schools that require tuition ?
frank says that although parents who send their children to evangelical schools are expected to pay a monthly fee of between 40 and 120 euros - based on what they earn - those who ca n't afford it are exempt without a battle .

" they just find them to be very , you know , magical and enchanting and also sophisticated . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 46-year-old has sold more than three million books in her career , winning several prestigious awards in the process .
her most well-known works , " the thief lord , " dragonrider " and " inkheart " have been translated into 20 languages .
" the thief lord " has been made into a film and will hit german cinemas this fall .

that could soon change . on time magazine 's list of the top 100 people who have influenced the world in the past year , three germans are present .
they are n't perhaps who you 'd think .
chancellor gerhard schröder does n't get a mention , nor does foreign minister joschka fischer or any of the country 's ceos or top scientists . instead , formula one driver michael schumacher made the grade , as did cardinal ratzinger , the man some believe could become the next pope .
the third german was cornelia funke , the best-selling author of children 's books whose fantasy-filled stories are enchanting readers around the world . with a sigh he sat down behind his desk .
then , behind the door , someone whispered .
they 're probably admiring my sign , thought victor .
it was black and shiny and had gold lettering : " victor getz , detective .
investigations of any kind . "
the door knocker next to the sign was in the shape of a lion 's head with a brass ring in its mouth , which victor has just polished this morning . victor getz does n't know it yet , but on this very morning he will set out in search of two street children , prosper and bo , and perhaps while he 's at it , he will find himself .
victor is one of the central characters in cornelia funke 's book " the thief lord . " complex characters , page-turner plots her characters are often not the nicest folks .
they 're often grumpy , shifty , timid , complicated and cunning - always three dimensional and without exception , loveable .
in funke 's fantastical stories , the figures move through refreshingly unpredictable plots , which are always immensely entertaining for readers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " inkheart " " i like to show children things that i myself find incredibly wonderful , for example , venice , " she said .
" of course other things creep in that occupy one 's mind , like the unbelievable lack of compassion that exists so often between humans and animals , or humans and humans .
but i always try to bind it all in the story .
the story comes first . " the former book illustrator began writing her own books 15 years ago ; most have been bestsellers .
but her phenomenal success has been so quiet that most germans have n't yet noticed this new global writer in their midst .
it 's mostly parents for whom the name " cornelia funke " has taken on special meaning , since it so often pops up in the juvenile section of libraries or on the wish lists of their children . magical but sophisticated us-based time magazine has been more alert to her talent than her compatriots since it awarded her a place in the magazine 's top 100 list .

work-life balance gets boost in germany encouraging germans to have more kids the dumbing down of germany study : men in germany are scared to start families current affairs -pipe- 14.04.2005 gerd 's family policy gets down to business großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor wants to see more germans starting families by 2020 , germany will have europe 's lowest percentage of young people .
wednesday 's conference on family policy took a close look at the economic repercussions of the declining birth rate . as germany struggles to maintain the viability of its state pension scheme amid an imminent demographic crunch caused by falling birth rates and an ageing population , chancellor gerhard schröder on wednesday renewed his commitment to encouraging families to have children and outlined new initiatives which would provide financial and job benefits to working germans who decide to start a family or expand an existing one . children are our future , " said chancellor gerhard schröder at the conference called " family - success factor for the economy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " they are our future workforce , consumers and parents .
our future , our pensions and the economic strength of our country , rests in the hands of our children . " the family challenge the number of children born in germany has fallen a dramatic 50 per cent from 1.4 million in 1964 to just 700,000 in 2005 .
as the country 's unemployment figures continue to swell , to many , the prospect of raising a family seems just too challenging .
given the nation 's nagging economic woes , women in particular see the difficulty of combining child-rearing and career as too much of a deterrent . it 's a trend germany ca n't afford to let develop . " creating good conditions for families became an economic issue a long time ago , " said schröder .
a reduced younger generation means a declining workforce , lack of innovation and ever fewer consumers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we can not allow a woman to decide against having children because she 's reluctant to have to choose between having a child or having a career , " stressed schröder .
" we can not allow a family on a normal income to decide against another child for financial reasons . in future , family policy has to create conditions which enable more people to have children . " benefits for both sides in 2003 , the government joined forces with business to form the alliance for family policy , which aimed to develop improved work-family reconciliation policies . but despite the government 's efforts to provide day care and tax relief for families , germany is still short of some 1.2 million nursery places for children under three .
schröder pledged once again to increase day care for working families . " flexible working hours and family-friendly employment policies are good , because both sides reap benefits , " he insisted . throwing out the three-year job guarantee he also said industry should do more to support employees with children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but president of the german employers association , dieter hundt , pointed out that two thirds of all firms already offer their employees flexible schedules and that business should n't be blamed for the problem .
he contended that it was the state which has to reform its policies regarding families . for now , mothers are allowed to take up to six months of paid maternity leave and unpaid leave of up to three years . " something needs to change " " as far as employers are concerned , we need to take a new look at reducing parental leave , " said hundt .
" so far , our relatively generous family support of € 150 billion has led to neither higher birth rates nor improved integration of parents within the labor market .
something needs to change . " hundt believes that parents need to return to the work faster than is currently the norm , because the german economy simply ca n't afford to forfeit qualified workers with know-how . the government largely agrees .
its latest proposal , outlined at the conference by minister for family affairs renate schmidt , would introduce a sliding scale benefit scheme dependent on income . but as schröder said wednesday , the issue is by no means purely financial .

work-life balance gets boost in germany encouraging germans to have more kids the dumbing down of germany study : men in germany are scared to start families current affairs -pipe- 14.04.2005 gerd 's family policy gets down to business großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor wants to see more germans starting families by 2020 , germany will have europe 's lowest percentage of young people .
wednesday 's conference on family policy took a close look at the economic repercussions of the declining birth rate . as germany struggles to maintain the viability of its state pension scheme amid an imminent demographic crunch caused by falling birth rates and an ageing population , chancellor gerhard schröder on wednesday renewed his commitment to encouraging families to have children and outlined new initiatives which would provide financial and job benefits to working germans who decide to start a family or expand an existing one . children are our future , " said chancellor gerhard schröder at the conference called " family - success factor for the economy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " they are our future workforce , consumers and parents .
our future , our pensions and the economic strength of our country , rests in the hands of our children . " the family challenge the number of children born in germany has fallen a dramatic 50 per cent from 1.4 million in 1964 to just 700,000 in 2005 .
as the country 's unemployment figures continue to swell , to many , the prospect of raising a family seems just too challenging .
given the nation 's nagging economic woes , women in particular see the difficulty of combining child-rearing and career as too much of a deterrent . it 's a trend germany ca n't afford to let develop . " creating good conditions for families became an economic issue a long time ago , " said schröder .
a reduced younger generation means a declining workforce , lack of innovation and ever fewer consumers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we can not allow a woman to decide against having children because she 's reluctant to have to choose between having a child or having a career , " stressed schröder .
" we can not allow a family on a normal income to decide against another child for financial reasons . in future , family policy has to create conditions which enable more people to have children . " benefits for both sides in 2003 , the government joined forces with business to form the alliance for family policy , which aimed to develop improved work-family reconciliation policies . but despite the government 's efforts to provide day care and tax relief for families , germany is still short of some 1.2 million nursery places for children under three .
schröder pledged once again to increase day care for working families . " flexible working hours and family-friendly employment policies are good , because both sides reap benefits , " he insisted . throwing out the three-year job guarantee he also said industry should do more to support employees with children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but president of the german employers association , dieter hundt , pointed out that two thirds of all firms already offer their employees flexible schedules and that business should n't be blamed for the problem .
he contended that it was the state which has to reform its policies regarding families . for now , mothers are allowed to take up to six months of paid maternity leave and unpaid leave of up to three years . " something needs to change " " as far as employers are concerned , we need to take a new look at reducing parental leave , " said hundt .
" so far , our relatively generous family support of € 150 billion has led to neither higher birth rates nor improved integration of parents within the labor market .
something needs to change . " hundt believes that parents need to return to the work faster than is currently the norm , because the german economy simply ca n't afford to forfeit qualified workers with know-how . the government largely agrees .
its latest proposal , outlined at the conference by minister for family affairs renate schmidt , would introduce a sliding scale benefit scheme dependent on income . but as schröder said wednesday , the issue is by no means purely financial .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.04.2005 turkey 's euro-skeptic ranks swell großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the eu-turkish relationship one of reluctance on both sides ?
turks are increasingly critical of the country 's possible accession to the eu as euro-skeptics warn of a potential sell-out of national interests . even though opinion polls regularly show that three-quarters of turks favour their country joining the eu , increasing numbers are also becoming aware of drawbacks : brussels is going to make increasing demands on ankara and will have a bigger role in running the country .
many see this this as a threat to the turkish state .
these warnings are also being voiced in other countries that are seeking eu membership but nowhere do they touch the nerve the way they do in turkey .
while the eu - as a result of its experiences in the two world wars - is trying to supress the individual nation-state by bringing member states closer together as one , many turks consider the nation-state to be the greatest good .
" sovereignty belongs unconditionally and unreservedly to the nation " was one of the principles of atatürk , the founder of the modern turkish state , whose image hangs on the end wall of the plenary chamber in the turkish parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recep tayyip erdogan und abdullah gül have been accused of compromising over cyprus a foreign toy ?
turkey arose out of the ruins of the ottoman empire , which was occupied by the allied victors of world war i , in the 1920s .
in a war that involved heavy losses , atatürk succeeded in driving the greek occupying powers - in west anatolia in particular - out of the country .
in the early years of the republic , turks feared that the country would be carved up and become a plaything of foreign powers .
as a result , it is unsurprising that nationalists are claiming that turkish membership in the european union would ultimately only benefit europeans , not turks .
and they point to to the conflict over cyprus as evidence . the cypress conflict turkey 's euro-skeptics criticize every step taken by the government of prime minister recep tayyip erdogan regarding cypress : he hints that he is willing to make compromises in the search for a peaceful solution for the divided mediterranean island .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a close ally of turkish membership the fact that erdogan 's government is " selling " cyprus in order to show the eu how obedient tukrkey is , is an image often peddled by the right-wing nationalist mhp party .
but concern over the fate of the turkish state in the upcoming membership negotiations with the eu is not only an issue for turkey 's right wing .
drawing attention to supposed threats to turkey from outside its national borders is also part of the repertoire of the social democratic opposition party chp .
the chp recently and successfully challenged a law governing the sale of land and buildings to foreigners through the constitutional court .
the chp is part of turkey 's lay kemalist establishment that considers all deviations from atatürk 's course to be wrong .
because of this , kemalists have terrible difficulty accepting some of the european union 's key demands .
they even have trouble opening turkey up to foreign investors – a fact demonstrated by more than just the fate of the real estate law .
president ahmet necdet sezer , a leading kemalist , recently vetoed a law that would have allowed foreigners to buy television stations in turkey .
the president explained that he had taken this action because a law of this sort would not have been in the " national interest " .
sensitive minority policy if ground-breaking economic policies such as this are viewed with such suspicion , it is no wonder that the resistance to more sensitive issues , such as policies on minorities , is even more fierce .
the alleged attempts of young kurds to burn a turkish flag triggered nationalist hysteria across the country over the past few weeks .
tens of thousands demonstratively draped their homes with turkish flags while the turkish police marched through istanbul bearing a 1.5-kilometre long flag .
meanwhile , both the nationalists and kemalists are being joined by a growing number of turkish islamists who are also sceptical about their country 's eu application .
over the past few years , turkey 's islamists has accounted for some of the country 's greatest europhiles because they hoped that moving closer to the eu would bring more freedom of religion .
but the introduction of headscarf bans in several eu states and other similar developments have dashed these hopes .
a recent report published by the independent industrialist & businessmen 's association , müsiad , concluded that the basic values on which the eu is built are a " strait-jacket " for muslims .
even though erdogan 's government has more than a two-thirds majority in parliament , it says that eu skepticism must be taken seriously .
the nationalist and islamist wing of the ruling akp ensures that this mistrust is not restricted to the opposition both inside and outside the parliament .
the debate as to what other demands the eu has yet to make on turkey and how the country should react to them is only likely to really start once accession negotiations begin october 3 . susanne güsten , qantara.de -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is turkey losing its reform zeal ?

turkey arose out of the ruins of the ottoman empire , which was occupied by the allied victors of world war i , in the 1920s .
in a war that involved heavy losses , atatürk succeeded in driving the greek occupying powers - in west anatolia in particular - out of the country .

drawing attention to supposed threats to turkey from outside its national borders is also part of the repertoire of the social democratic opposition party chp .
the chp recently and successfully challenged a law governing the sale of land and buildings to foreigners through the constitutional court .
the chp is part of turkey 's lay kemalist establishment that considers all deviations from atatürk 's course to be wrong .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 14.04.2005 schalke 's brutal schedule continues 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke , blue , are on the ground while stuttgart are flying high schalke took an abysmal nose dive last week and find themselves three points back of first place bayern munich .
bayern and stuttgart start a stretch of test matches before a final clash in stuttgart . after last weekend 's disastrous 3-0 defeat in stuttgart , the mood in schalke turned for the worse .
before , there was talk of winning the title .
now they are thinking differently .
coach ralf rangnick said in kicker magazine that the most important task " is securing a spot in the champions league . "
that means finishing second in the bundesliga for automatic qualification .
the schedule , however , is against them heading down the home stretch .
in their last six matches , they face four teams with international aspirations .
this week , sixth place hamburg are in town .
coach thomas doll 's club has fallen on hard times of late .
at the beginning of the second half of the season , hamburg sprang to the top third of the standings but luck has not been on their side recently and they 've collected only one point in their last three games .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's coach ralf rangnick has had reason to frown in the bundesliga the past few weeks schalke are by no means out of the title race , but it may be stuttgart who may make the race tight for bayern munich .
they will need help from other teams though .
on 54 points , they lie five back of bayern .
yet their schedule , like bayern 's , is filled with mediocre opponents .
this saturday , the hardest adversary just may be the long bus ride to rostock on the baltic sea .
stuttgart 's markus babbel warned in sport-bild magazine that 17th place rostock , fighting for their lives against relegation , can not be taken lightly .
" we ca n't allow a loss like that of schalke against mainz . "
stuttgart are playing juggernaut-like and silently have thoughts of winning the championship .
if the cards fall right , this could happen .
in the final game of the season , matthias sammer 's team comes up against bayern .
champions league adieu , hello bundesliga bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's goalkeeper oliver kahn is not one to keep his emotions penned in following their ouster from the champions league at the hands of chelsea , 18-time bundesliga champion bayern munich can concentrate on the league title .
coach felix magath bemoaned the bad luck of the bavarians against the premiereship side .
star defender lucio deflected two balls into his own net in the two fixtures with chelsea but bayern are three points in front of second place schalke and are also in the semifinals of the league cup , " so things are n't that bad , " said magath .
their opponents , hanover , could sing a similar tune .
not because they are mixing it up at the top of the table .
more because they have stamped their ticket for the first division for next season .
hanover have taken a beating against bayern in the past , letting in 87 goals in their 31 meetings .
what speaks for ewald lienen 's club is the fact that this game is in hanover .
the only five matches they have bettered munich have taken place at home .
reigning champs and fourth place werder bremen -lrb- 50 points -rrb- have a big assignment when they host hertha berlin -lrb- 47 -rrb- .
bremen must do without captain and national midfielder frank baumann who went under the knife this week for a bad left ankle .
striker miroslav klose will also be sitting on the bench with a hurt knee .
a victory against northern rivals hamburg last week impressed coach thomas schaaf .
another impressive game will be needed on saturday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's marcelinho , left , after his stroke of genius from 48 meters against freiburg berlin 's midfielder marcelinho -lrb- photo -rrb- scored what was probably one of the top three goals in this bundesliga season against last place and second division bound freiburg last saturday .
from the edge of the midfield circle , the colorful brazilian launched a lob over keeper richard golz who had wandered too far off his line .
the ball flew over the flailing golz and landed in the net .
marcelinho went on to score on a penalty kick and assisted on nico kovac 's goal in the 90th minute .
a similar performance could cause a big headache for bremen .
but bremen are not freiburg . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern on track to take home title sunday 's bundesliga games did n't change anything about the leadership struggle between bayern and schalke : bayern seem set to win the season after stuttgart defeated schalke on saturday .

bayern and stuttgart start a stretch of test matches before a final clash in stuttgart . after last weekend 's disastrous 3-0 defeat in stuttgart , the mood in schalke turned for the worse .
before , there was talk of winning the title .

in their last six matches , they face four teams with international aspirations .
this week , sixth place hamburg are in town .

star defender lucio deflected two balls into his own net in the two fixtures with chelsea but bayern are three points in front of second place schalke and are also in the semifinals of the league cup , " so things are n't that bad , " said magath .
their opponents , hanover , could sing a similar tune .

bayern and stuttgart start a stretch of test matches before a final clash in stuttgart . after last weekend 's disastrous 3-0 defeat in stuttgart , the mood in schalke turned for the worse .
before , there was talk of winning the title .
now they are thinking differently .
coach ralf rangnick said in kicker magazine that the most important task " is securing a spot in the champions league . "
that means finishing second in the bundesliga for automatic qualification .
the schedule , however , is against them heading down the home stretch .
in their last six matches , they face four teams with international aspirations .
this week , sixth place hamburg are in town .
coach thomas doll 's club has fallen on hard times of late .

yet their schedule , like bayern 's , is filled with mediocre opponents .
this saturday , the hardest adversary just may be the long bus ride to rostock on the baltic sea .

" we ca n't allow a loss like that of schalke against mainz . "

star defender lucio deflected two balls into his own net in the two fixtures with chelsea but bayern are three points in front of second place schalke and are also in the semifinals of the league cup , " so things are n't that bad , " said magath .
their opponents , hanover , could sing a similar tune .
not because they are mixing it up at the top of the table .
more because they have stamped their ticket for the first division for next season .
hanover have taken a beating against bayern in the past , letting in 87 goals in their 31 meetings .

" every type of religion class comes with its own version of history , " explained peter schreiner , president of the intereuropean commission for church and school -lrb- iccs -rrb- .
" you can make comparisons , but there wo n't ever be a pan-european approach . " for now , he pointed out , each country decides itself how to organize classes , develop the syllabus and select teaching materials , train teachers - as well as providing options for students unwilling to attend religion classes . the way the topic of religion is treated varies widely across the continent .
in southern and eastern europe , finland , italy , austria and germany , religion classes are divided according to denomination . in other countries , including belgium , luxembourg , portugal and spain , students can opt for non-denominational alternatives , such as ethics , philosophy or values classes . germany and austria compulsory religion classes across germany 's states is a principle enshrined in the german constitution or ' grundgesetz ' , with one small opt-out clause , known as the " bremer clause " for certain states with a different legal status .
bremen and berlin , for example , are not governed by the legal obligation to provide religious education , as legislation already in existence when the ' grundgesetz ' was drawn up in 1949 takes precedence .
instead , these states offer ' biblical history ' and a discipline known as ler - ' life , ethics and religion . '
berlin , moreover , is the only german state where religion classes are the responsibility of the church rather than the state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in austria , students ca n't complain of lack of choice , with catholic , protestant , orthodox , new apostolic , jewish , islam and budhist classes available .
religion , whichever it is , is a compulsory subject in schools , while an alternative , non-denominational option has been also been available since 1997 . italy and greece catholic classes , not surprisingly , are a guaranteed fixture of the italian education system .
available to children from all backgrounds , religion became a voluntary subject in 1984 . other classes are also provided , but need to be paid for privately if sufficient pupils express interest .
alternatively , students can attend ' civic and human rights ' classes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek-orthodox priests before an easter baptism ceremony , river jordan , israel greece takes the opposite approach . here , orthodox classes are compulsory , regardless of personal faith . learning about religion in northern europe , england , wales and scotland , pupils can take religion - or a class in which they learn about the world 's different religions . " classes about religion belong to schools ' educational duties , rather than religious education per se , " observed friedrich schweitzer , theology professor at tübingen university . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : local education authorities in england and wales develop a syllabus together with the anglican church and representatives from other religious communities , although the emphasis is firmly on christianity .

schröder said after talks with south korean president roh moo-hyun that every country must find its own way to deal with the glories and shame in its history .
but , without mentioning japan by name , he said germany had learned " that one does not lose friends with a sensitive and self-critical approach to one 's own history but rather wins them " .
roh contrasted the post-world war ii reconciliation between germany and france with his country 's lingering tensions with japan , in a german newspaper interview last week before his arrival in berlin .
he told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung that " germany had succeeded in healing the wounds of the war , had overcome them and then moved on to integrate itself into europe . "
roh blamed japan , which occupied the korean peninsula from 1910-1945 , for preventing a similar reconciliation between its asian neighbors . dw-world.de german reunification model not for seoul robust economic ties may dominate german-south korean relations .
but , as president roh visits berlin , experts say political ties have sobered since seoul has realized it can not follow the path of german reunification .

the conservative cardinal , in charge of defending church doctrine , is considered a frontrunner . la repubblica and corriere della sera , both respected italian dailies with close contacts with the vatican , say two powerful german cardinals , karl lehmann of mainz and walter kasper , who is based in rome , have lined up against their fellow german who has been the catholic church 's controversial doctrinal watchdog . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal lehmann both lehmann and kasper have had public differences with ratzinger in the past . american cardinals have also expressed reservations about a possible ratzinger pontificate , according to la repubblica .
the paper reported that american and german cardinals are worried about ratzinger 's apparent lack of interest in matters of administration . german cardinals also have taken issue with ratzinger 's opposition to allowing lay theologians to take a leading roll in parishes that lack priests , a serious problem in germany .
the paper also said the ratzinger , the one-time archbishop of munich , had failed to address the issue of not allowing catholics who had divorced and remarried to receive communion . martini - the moderates ' man the milan-based corriere della sera reported that opponents to ratzinger were lining up behind 78-year-old carlo maria martini , who was a favorite of moderates until he resigned as milan 's archbishop in 2002 .
martini , a leading advocate of church reform , serves as a counterweight to the traditionalist ratzinger . bildunterschrift : carlo maria martini martini , however , is not in good health and has indicated he does not want the church 's top job .
but a strong showing for him in the first round of voting is seen as having primarily symbolic value that could show the strength of moderate cardinals and rally support behind a candidate more to their liking . vatican watchers say the first voting rounds are often considered formalities , which gauge the strengths of various camps .
a voting conclave can last for several days and often produces surprising results , as did the one in 1978 which elected poland 's karol wojtyla . however , since many of the bishops in the conclave were appointed by john paul ii , himself a conservative , the traditionalist camp is strong .
italian newspapers reported that between 40 and 50 cardinals had signalled their support for ratzinger in private meetings this week . that number , though , is short of the two-thirds majority , 77 out of 115 votes , needed to win .
vatican watchers say many of the cardinals who will go into the conclave on monday are still undecided . " ratzinger is looking strong , but it 's still far from clear who will emerge and how the voting will go , " one church official , who requested anonymity , told reuters . book published cardinal ratzinger , who turns 78 on saturday , published a book on wednesday in germany which argues that europe must retain its christian heritage .
it is not clear what kind of effect the book will have on the election , although open campaigning for the papacy is generally frowned upon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph ratzinger , as catholic prefect of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith in the book , he reiterated his conservative views , criticizing the collapse of traditional families and attacking the drive toward gay marriage , saying it was a trend in which " the entire moral history of mankind is being left behind . " he said europe had become " empty inside " and was " dependent on transplants , " referring to the continent 's low birth rate and the need for immigrant labor . although some questioned the timing of the book 's publication , it does not appear to have broken the agreement among cardinals not to talk to the media during the pre-conclave period since the book was likely written before the death of john paul ii . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de could a bavarian become pope ?

the conservative cardinal , in charge of defending church doctrine , is considered a frontrunner . la repubblica and corriere della sera , both respected italian dailies with close contacts with the vatican , say two powerful german cardinals , karl lehmann of mainz and walter kasper , who is based in rome , have lined up against their fellow german who has been the catholic church 's controversial doctrinal watchdog . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal lehmann both lehmann and kasper have had public differences with ratzinger in the past . american cardinals have also expressed reservations about a possible ratzinger pontificate , according to la repubblica .
the paper reported that american and german cardinals are worried about ratzinger 's apparent lack of interest in matters of administration . german cardinals also have taken issue with ratzinger 's opposition to allowing lay theologians to take a leading roll in parishes that lack priests , a serious problem in germany .
the paper also said the ratzinger , the one-time archbishop of munich , had failed to address the issue of not allowing catholics who had divorced and remarried to receive communion . martini - the moderates ' man the milan-based corriere della sera reported that opponents to ratzinger were lining up behind 78-year-old carlo maria martini , who was a favorite of moderates until he resigned as milan 's archbishop in 2002 .
martini , a leading advocate of church reform , serves as a counterweight to the traditionalist ratzinger . bildunterschrift : carlo maria martini martini , however , is not in good health and has indicated he does not want the church 's top job .
but a strong showing for him in the first round of voting is seen as having primarily symbolic value that could show the strength of moderate cardinals and rally support behind a candidate more to their liking . vatican watchers say the first voting rounds are often considered formalities , which gauge the strengths of various camps .
a voting conclave can last for several days and often produces surprising results , as did the one in 1978 which elected poland 's karol wojtyla . however , since many of the bishops in the conclave were appointed by john paul ii , himself a conservative , the traditionalist camp is strong .
italian newspapers reported that between 40 and 50 cardinals had signalled their support for ratzinger in private meetings this week . that number , though , is short of the two-thirds majority , 77 out of 115 votes , needed to win .
vatican watchers say many of the cardinals who will go into the conclave on monday are still undecided . " ratzinger is looking strong , but it 's still far from clear who will emerge and how the voting will go , " one church official , who requested anonymity , told reuters . book published cardinal ratzinger , who turns 78 on saturday , published a book on wednesday in germany which argues that europe must retain its christian heritage .
it is not clear what kind of effect the book will have on the election , although open campaigning for the papacy is generally frowned upon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph ratzinger , as catholic prefect of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith in the book , he reiterated his conservative views , criticizing the collapse of traditional families and attacking the drive toward gay marriage , saying it was a trend in which " the entire moral history of mankind is being left behind . " he said europe had become " empty inside " and was " dependent on transplants , " referring to the continent 's low birth rate and the need for immigrant labor . although some questioned the timing of the book 's publication , it does not appear to have broken the agreement among cardinals not to talk to the media during the pre-conclave period since the book was likely written before the death of john paul ii . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de could a bavarian become pope ?

the countries still have to institute wide-ranging reforms to satisfy eu accession criteria . the vote on wednesday in strasbourg cleared the way for the second expansion of the eu in eastern europe .
both bulgaria and romania are expected to sign the accession treaty on april 25 .
membership for the two , if they implement agreed upon economic and political reforms , is set for jan .
1 , 2007 . " romania has made a crucial step towards its eu membership in 2007 , " romanian prime minister calin tariceanu told reporters in the capital bucharest .
" after the signing of the membership treaty we will become a real accession country . " after signing the accession treaty , officials from the two countries will be allowed to participate in all eu meetings as observers . membership will also secure a place in the prosperous european club for two countries where economic output per capita is below 40 percent of eu average , even though their economies are growing quickly . reforms required the parliament in strasbourg voted with large majorities to back both countries ' accession .
the assembly voted 522 - 70 , with 69 abstentions , to back bulgaria 's eu entry , romania 's entry got a vote of 497-93 , with 71 abstentions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romanian parliament building still , there were serious doubts about whether the countries would implement the reforms the bloc requires before the 2007 date .
they include strengthening administration systems , beefing up border controls and introducing competition policy measures . rampant corruption is a concern for both countries , but particularly for romania , and some green members of parliament doubted that reforms could be carried out in time . green parliamentarian daniel cohn-bendit pointed to the eu legislature 's own report on romania that said : " high-level corruption , despite recent efforts , continues to undermine the country 's socio-economic and political life . " " if we look at matters such as press freedom and corruption and we take seriously everything we 've read in the reports , no one can say that romania in its current state is ready to join , " he said . while parliament rejected a motion by some minority groups to delay the votes until after the european commission publishes a report in november about the countries ' preparation for membership , it did for the first time in an enlargement procedure invoke a protection clause which states that the union could postpone the accession until 2008 if the countries did not make satisfactory progress in implementing reforms . both countries missed the first wave of the eu 's eastwards enlargement in may because they were slow to introduce political and economic reforms after the collapse of communism in 1989 .
romania , with its population of 22 million , is seen as worse prepared for membership and more corrupt than bulgaria , which has eight million citizens . challenges for sofia but bulgaria is not without its hurdles to overcome .
the country 's ailing judiciary is considered in need of restructuring , especially to secure effective crime fighting and a favorable business environment .
it has also been criticized for not integrating its minority communities , in particular its roma population , which numbers 800,000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel cohn-bendit bulgaria 's relative poverty worries some eu officials .
the average pension is 60 leva , or around 30 euros a month ; the average wage is 150 leva , about 75 euros . " we will need 20 , 30 years , even as an eu member , to reach the normal eu level , " said petar-emil mitev , a sociology professor . despite that , bulgaria 's citizens are enthusiastic about joining the european club , since for many of them it means a chance to get on a par with their neighbors . " our examples are the former socialist countries like the czech republic and poland , " said one woman on the streets of the capital .

work-life balance gets boost in germany encouraging germans to have more kids the dumbing down of germany study : men in germany are scared to start families current affairs -pipe- 14.04.2005 gerd 's family policy gets down to business großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor wants to see more germans starting families by 2020 , germany will have europe 's lowest percentage of young people .
wednesday 's conference on family policy took a close look at the economic repercussions of the declining birth rate . as germany struggles to maintain the viability of its state pension scheme amid an imminent demographic crunch caused by falling birth rates and an ageing population , chancellor gerhard schröder on wednesday renewed his commitment to encouraging families to have children and outlined new initiatives which would provide financial and job benefits to working germans who decide to start a family or expand an existing one . children are our future , " said chancellor gerhard schröder at the conference called " family - success factor for the economy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " they are our future workforce , consumers and parents .
our future , our pensions and the economic strength of our country , rests in the hands of our children . " the family challenge the number of children born in germany has fallen a dramatic 50 per cent from 1.4 million in 1964 to just 700,000 in 2005 .
as the country 's unemployment figures continue to swell , to many , the prospect of raising a family seems just too challenging .
given the nation 's nagging economic woes , women in particular see the difficulty of combining child-rearing and career as too much of a deterrent . it 's a trend germany ca n't afford to let develop . " creating good conditions for families became an economic issue a long time ago , " said schröder .
a reduced younger generation means a declining workforce , lack of innovation and ever fewer consumers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we can not allow a woman to decide against having children because she 's reluctant to have to choose between having a child or having a career , " stressed schröder .
" we can not allow a family on a normal income to decide against another child for financial reasons . in future , family policy has to create conditions which enable more people to have children . " benefits for both sides in 2003 , the government joined forces with business to form the alliance for family policy , which aimed to develop improved work-family reconciliation policies . but despite the government 's efforts to provide day care and tax relief for families , germany is still short of some 1.2 million nursery places for children under three .
schröder pledged once again to increase day care for working families . " flexible working hours and family-friendly employment policies are good , because both sides reap benefits , " he insisted . throwing out the three-year job guarantee he also said industry should do more to support employees with children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but president of the german employers association , dieter hundt , pointed out that two thirds of all firms already offer their employees flexible schedules and that business should n't be blamed for the problem .
he contended that it was the state which has to reform its policies regarding families . for now , mothers are allowed to take up to six months of paid maternity leave and unpaid leave of up to three years . " something needs to change " " as far as employers are concerned , we need to take a new look at reducing parental leave , " said hundt .
" so far , our relatively generous family support of € 150 billion has led to neither higher birth rates nor improved integration of parents within the labor market .
something needs to change . " hundt believes that parents need to return to the work faster than is currently the norm , because the german economy simply ca n't afford to forfeit qualified workers with know-how . the government largely agrees .
its latest proposal , outlined at the conference by minister for family affairs renate schmidt , would introduce a sliding scale benefit scheme dependent on income . but as schröder said wednesday , the issue is by no means purely financial .
" parents need more infrastructures , not just more money , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de work-life balance gets boost in germany in germany , where kids are seen as career killers , over 40 percent of highly qualified women choose to remain childless .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.04.2005 turkey 's euro-skeptic ranks swell großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the eu-turkish relationship one of reluctance on both sides ?
turks are increasingly critical of the country 's possible accession to the eu as euro-skeptics warn of a potential sell-out of national interests . even though opinion polls regularly show that three-quarters of turks favour their country joining the eu , increasing numbers are also becoming aware of drawbacks : brussels is going to make increasing demands on ankara and will have a bigger role in running the country .
many see this this as a threat to the turkish state .
these warnings are also being voiced in other countries that are seeking eu membership but nowhere do they touch the nerve the way they do in turkey .
while the eu - as a result of its experiences in the two world wars - is trying to supress the individual nation-state by bringing member states closer together as one , many turks consider the nation-state to be the greatest good .
" sovereignty belongs unconditionally and unreservedly to the nation " was one of the principles of atatürk , the founder of the modern turkish state , whose image hangs on the end wall of the plenary chamber in the turkish parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recep tayyip erdogan und abdullah gül have been accused of compromising over cyprus a foreign toy ?
turkey arose out of the ruins of the ottoman empire , which was occupied by the allied victors of world war i , in the 1920s .
in a war that involved heavy losses , atatürk succeeded in driving the greek occupying powers - in west anatolia in particular - out of the country .
in the early years of the republic , turks feared that the country would be carved up and become a plaything of foreign powers .
as a result , it is unsurprising that nationalists are claiming that turkish membership in the european union would ultimately only benefit europeans , not turks .
and they point to to the conflict over cyprus as evidence . the cypress conflict turkey 's euro-skeptics criticize every step taken by the government of prime minister recep tayyip erdogan regarding cypress : he hints that he is willing to make compromises in the search for a peaceful solution for the divided mediterranean island .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a close ally of turkish membership the fact that erdogan 's government is " selling " cyprus in order to show the eu how obedient tukrkey is , is an image often peddled by the right-wing nationalist mhp party .
but concern over the fate of the turkish state in the upcoming membership negotiations with the eu is not only an issue for turkey 's right wing .
drawing attention to supposed threats to turkey from outside its national borders is also part of the repertoire of the social democratic opposition party chp .
the chp recently and successfully challenged a law governing the sale of land and buildings to foreigners through the constitutional court .
the chp is part of turkey 's lay kemalist establishment that considers all deviations from atatürk 's course to be wrong .
because of this , kemalists have terrible difficulty accepting some of the european union 's key demands .
they even have trouble opening turkey up to foreign investors – a fact demonstrated by more than just the fate of the real estate law .
president ahmet necdet sezer , a leading kemalist , recently vetoed a law that would have allowed foreigners to buy television stations in turkey .
the president explained that he had taken this action because a law of this sort would not have been in the " national interest " .
sensitive minority policy if ground-breaking economic policies such as this are viewed with such suspicion , it is no wonder that the resistance to more sensitive issues , such as policies on minorities , is even more fierce .
the alleged attempts of young kurds to burn a turkish flag triggered nationalist hysteria across the country over the past few weeks .
tens of thousands demonstratively draped their homes with turkish flags while the turkish police marched through istanbul bearing a 1.5-kilometre long flag .
meanwhile , both the nationalists and kemalists are being joined by a growing number of turkish islamists who are also sceptical about their country 's eu application .
over the past few years , turkey 's islamists has accounted for some of the country 's greatest europhiles because they hoped that moving closer to the eu would bring more freedom of religion .
but the introduction of headscarf bans in several eu states and other similar developments have dashed these hopes .
a recent report published by the independent industrialist & businessmen 's association , müsiad , concluded that the basic values on which the eu is built are a " strait-jacket " for muslims .
even though erdogan 's government has more than a two-thirds majority in parliament , it says that eu skepticism must be taken seriously .
the nationalist and islamist wing of the ruling akp ensures that this mistrust is not restricted to the opposition both inside and outside the parliament .
the debate as to what other demands the eu has yet to make on turkey and how the country should react to them is only likely to really start once accession negotiations begin october 3 . susanne güsten , qantara.de -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is turkey losing its reform zeal ?
with the start of eu accession talks scheduled for later this year , turkey 's critics say its reform zest appears to be waning .
but could it simply be a case that the drone of domestic politics has taken over ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.04.2005 kudos for germany 's j.k. rowling großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cornelia funke with " inkheart , " one of her most successful books she 's been called the german answer to j.k. rowling , author of the harry potter books , but cornelia funke keeps a low profile and is n't even that well known in her native country .
that could soon change . on time magazine 's list of the top 100 people who have influenced the world in the past year , three germans are present .
they are n't perhaps who you 'd think .
chancellor gerhard schröder does n't get a mention , nor does foreign minister joschka fischer or any of the country 's ceos or top scientists . instead , formula one driver michael schumacher made the grade , as did cardinal ratzinger , the man some believe could become the next pope .
the third german was cornelia funke , the best-selling author of children 's books whose fantasy-filled stories are enchanting readers around the world . with a sigh he sat down behind his desk .
then , behind the door , someone whispered .
they 're probably admiring my sign , thought victor .
it was black and shiny and had gold lettering : " victor getz , detective .
investigations of any kind . "
the door knocker next to the sign was in the shape of a lion 's head with a brass ring in its mouth , which victor has just polished this morning . victor getz does n't know it yet , but on this very morning he will set out in search of two street children , prosper and bo , and perhaps while he 's at it , he will find himself .
victor is one of the central characters in cornelia funke 's book " the thief lord . " complex characters , page-turner plots her characters are often not the nicest folks .
they 're often grumpy , shifty , timid , complicated and cunning - always three dimensional and without exception , loveable .
in funke 's fantastical stories , the figures move through refreshingly unpredictable plots , which are always immensely entertaining for readers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " inkheart " " i like to show children things that i myself find incredibly wonderful , for example , venice , " she said .
" of course other things creep in that occupy one 's mind , like the unbelievable lack of compassion that exists so often between humans and animals , or humans and humans .
but i always try to bind it all in the story .
the story comes first . " the former book illustrator began writing her own books 15 years ago ; most have been bestsellers .
but her phenomenal success has been so quiet that most germans have n't yet noticed this new global writer in their midst .
it 's mostly parents for whom the name " cornelia funke " has taken on special meaning , since it so often pops up in the juvenile section of libraries or on the wish lists of their children . magical but sophisticated us-based time magazine has been more alert to her talent than her compatriots since it awarded her a place in the magazine 's top 100 list . " she has become truly international and everyone who discovers her books really loves them , " said adi ignacius , time 's executive editor .
" they just find them to be very , you know , magical and enchanting and also sophisticated . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 46-year-old has sold more than three million books in her career , winning several prestigious awards in the process .
her most well-known works , " the thief lord , " dragonrider " and " inkheart " have been translated into 20 languages .
" the thief lord " has been made into a film and will hit german cinemas this fall .

that could soon change . on time magazine 's list of the top 100 people who have influenced the world in the past year , three germans are present .
they are n't perhaps who you 'd think .
chancellor gerhard schröder does n't get a mention , nor does foreign minister joschka fischer or any of the country 's ceos or top scientists . instead , formula one driver michael schumacher made the grade , as did cardinal ratzinger , the man some believe could become the next pope .
the third german was cornelia funke , the best-selling author of children 's books whose fantasy-filled stories are enchanting readers around the world . with a sigh he sat down behind his desk .
then , behind the door , someone whispered .
they 're probably admiring my sign , thought victor .
it was black and shiny and had gold lettering : " victor getz , detective .
investigations of any kind . "
the door knocker next to the sign was in the shape of a lion 's head with a brass ring in its mouth , which victor has just polished this morning . victor getz does n't know it yet , but on this very morning he will set out in search of two street children , prosper and bo , and perhaps while he 's at it , he will find himself .
victor is one of the central characters in cornelia funke 's book " the thief lord . " complex characters , page-turner plots her characters are often not the nicest folks .
they 're often grumpy , shifty , timid , complicated and cunning - always three dimensional and without exception , loveable .

" of course other things creep in that occupy one 's mind , like the unbelievable lack of compassion that exists so often between humans and animals , or humans and humans .
but i always try to bind it all in the story .
the story comes first . " the former book illustrator began writing her own books 15 years ago ; most have been bestsellers .
but her phenomenal success has been so quiet that most germans have n't yet noticed this new global writer in their midst .
it 's mostly parents for whom the name " cornelia funke " has taken on special meaning , since it so often pops up in the juvenile section of libraries or on the wish lists of their children . magical but sophisticated us-based time magazine has been more alert to her talent than her compatriots since it awarded her a place in the magazine 's top 100 list . " she has become truly international and everyone who discovers her books really loves them , " said adi ignacius , time 's executive editor .
" they just find them to be very , you know , magical and enchanting and also sophisticated . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 46-year-old has sold more than three million books in her career , winning several prestigious awards in the process .
her most well-known works , " the thief lord , " dragonrider " and " inkheart " have been translated into 20 languages .
" the thief lord " has been made into a film and will hit german cinemas this fall .
big-screen productions of " inkheart " and the girl 's series " wilde hühner " -lrb- wild chickens -rrb- are also being planned . " it 's true that right now i 'm reaching millions of children .

lessons organized by the churches would only be optional and would not free students of the obligation to attend the new ethics classes . the decision by berlin ’ s spd leadership has infuriated numerous federal politicians particularly from the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and bavaria ’ s arch-conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- . during a special parliamentary session in the federal parliament on wednesday , the cdu 's education spokespeople called berlin ’ s plan to introduce mandatory ethics lessons an aggressive assault on the christian faith in german society . the party ’ s hermann kues said the new lessons to be introduced in 2006 smacked too much of the anti-religious approach that teachers in former communist east germany preferred : a question of choice " the freedom of religion is one of our highest values , " kues said .
" i believe that the new ethics lessons as intended by berlin are not suitable to give school students a fair choice of whether to become believers or atheists .

the head of germany 's protestant church council , wolfgang huber -lrb- photo -rrb- , declared that everything had to be done to prevent berlin from becoming godless . but wilhelm schmidt from the social democrat faction in the bundestag accused his political rivals of hypocrisy " no one prevents anyone from taking lessons in the religion of their choice , " schmidt complained .
" so why all the fuss now ?
none of the opponents of the berlin plan , he argued , ever complained about the fact that only a meager 20 percent of school students have taken part in voluntary lessons in christianity in the past few decades .
" and now all of a sudden you ’ re making such a fuss " , he told conservative mps . brandenburg success a template ethics lessons , which berlin is poised to make compulsory , were introduced in neighboring brandenburg as early as 1996 .
and according to the head of the region 's institute for education , jan hofmann , the subject has been a success . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students whose parent object will be in the minoroty , says jan hofmann " there ’ s only a very small group of school students whose parents categorically object to these lessons , " he said .
" and then there are those who have opted for lessons in religion offered by either the catholic or protestant church .
these children do not have to attend ethics classes .
i think that despite initial criticism our system has worked quite well and might serve as a model for other federal states .

turks are increasingly critical of the country 's possible accession to the eu as euro-skeptics warn of a potential sell-out of national interests . even though opinion polls regularly show that three-quarters of turks favour their country joining the eu , increasing numbers are also becoming aware of drawbacks : brussels is going to make increasing demands on ankara and will have a bigger role in running the country .
many see this this as a threat to the turkish state .
these warnings are also being voiced in other countries that are seeking eu membership but nowhere do they touch the nerve the way they do in turkey .
while the eu - as a result of its experiences in the two world wars - is trying to supress the individual nation-state by bringing member states closer together as one , many turks consider the nation-state to be the greatest good .
" sovereignty belongs unconditionally and unreservedly to the nation " was one of the principles of atatürk , the founder of the modern turkish state , whose image hangs on the end wall of the plenary chamber in the turkish parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recep tayyip erdogan und abdullah gül have been accused of compromising over cyprus a foreign toy ?
turkey arose out of the ruins of the ottoman empire , which was occupied by the allied victors of world war i , in the 1920s .
in a war that involved heavy losses , atatürk succeeded in driving the greek occupying powers - in west anatolia in particular - out of the country .
in the early years of the republic , turks feared that the country would be carved up and become a plaything of foreign powers .
as a result , it is unsurprising that nationalists are claiming that turkish membership in the european union would ultimately only benefit europeans , not turks .
and they point to to the conflict over cyprus as evidence . the cypress conflict turkey 's euro-skeptics criticize every step taken by the government of prime minister recep tayyip erdogan regarding cypress : he hints that he is willing to make compromises in the search for a peaceful solution for the divided mediterranean island .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a close ally of turkish membership the fact that erdogan 's government is " selling " cyprus in order to show the eu how obedient tukrkey is , is an image often peddled by the right-wing nationalist mhp party .
but concern over the fate of the turkish state in the upcoming membership negotiations with the eu is not only an issue for turkey 's right wing .
drawing attention to supposed threats to turkey from outside its national borders is also part of the repertoire of the social democratic opposition party chp .
the chp recently and successfully challenged a law governing the sale of land and buildings to foreigners through the constitutional court .
the chp is part of turkey 's lay kemalist establishment that considers all deviations from atatürk 's course to be wrong .
because of this , kemalists have terrible difficulty accepting some of the european union 's key demands .
they even have trouble opening turkey up to foreign investors – a fact demonstrated by more than just the fate of the real estate law .
president ahmet necdet sezer , a leading kemalist , recently vetoed a law that would have allowed foreigners to buy television stations in turkey .
the president explained that he had taken this action because a law of this sort would not have been in the " national interest " .
sensitive minority policy if ground-breaking economic policies such as this are viewed with such suspicion , it is no wonder that the resistance to more sensitive issues , such as policies on minorities , is even more fierce .
the alleged attempts of young kurds to burn a turkish flag triggered nationalist hysteria across the country over the past few weeks .
tens of thousands demonstratively draped their homes with turkish flags while the turkish police marched through istanbul bearing a 1.5-kilometre long flag .
meanwhile , both the nationalists and kemalists are being joined by a growing number of turkish islamists who are also sceptical about their country 's eu application .
over the past few years , turkey 's islamists has accounted for some of the country 's greatest europhiles because they hoped that moving closer to the eu would bring more freedom of religion .
but the introduction of headscarf bans in several eu states and other similar developments have dashed these hopes .
a recent report published by the independent industrialist & businessmen 's association , müsiad , concluded that the basic values on which the eu is built are a " strait-jacket " for muslims .
even though erdogan 's government has more than a two-thirds majority in parliament , it says that eu skepticism must be taken seriously .
the nationalist and islamist wing of the ruling akp ensures that this mistrust is not restricted to the opposition both inside and outside the parliament .
the debate as to what other demands the eu has yet to make on turkey and how the country should react to them is only likely to really start once accession negotiations begin october 3 . susanne güsten , qantara.de -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is turkey losing its reform zeal ?

bayern and stuttgart start a stretch of test matches before a final clash in stuttgart . after last weekend 's disastrous 3-0 defeat in stuttgart , the mood in schalke turned for the worse .

star defender lucio deflected two balls into his own net in the two fixtures with chelsea but bayern are three points in front of second place schalke and are also in the semifinals of the league cup , " so things are n't that bad , " said magath .
their opponents , hanover , could sing a similar tune .
not because they are mixing it up at the top of the table .

hanover have taken a beating against bayern in the past , letting in 87 goals in their 31 meetings .

work-life balance gets boost in germany encouraging germans to have more kids the dumbing down of germany study : men in germany are scared to start families current affairs -pipe- 14.04.2005 gerd 's family policy gets down to business großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor wants to see more germans starting families by 2020 , germany will have europe 's lowest percentage of young people .
wednesday 's conference on family policy took a close look at the economic repercussions of the declining birth rate . as germany struggles to maintain the viability of its state pension scheme amid an imminent demographic crunch caused by falling birth rates and an ageing population , chancellor gerhard schröder on wednesday renewed his commitment to encouraging families to have children and outlined new initiatives which would provide financial and job benefits to working germans who decide to start a family or expand an existing one . children are our future , " said chancellor gerhard schröder at the conference called " family - success factor for the economy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " they are our future workforce , consumers and parents .
our future , our pensions and the economic strength of our country , rests in the hands of our children . " the family challenge the number of children born in germany has fallen a dramatic 50 per cent from 1.4 million in 1964 to just 700,000 in 2005 .
as the country 's unemployment figures continue to swell , to many , the prospect of raising a family seems just too challenging .
given the nation 's nagging economic woes , women in particular see the difficulty of combining child-rearing and career as too much of a deterrent . it 's a trend germany ca n't afford to let develop . " creating good conditions for families became an economic issue a long time ago , " said schröder .
a reduced younger generation means a declining workforce , lack of innovation and ever fewer consumers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we can not allow a woman to decide against having children because she 's reluctant to have to choose between having a child or having a career , " stressed schröder .
" we can not allow a family on a normal income to decide against another child for financial reasons . in future , family policy has to create conditions which enable more people to have children . " benefits for both sides in 2003 , the government joined forces with business to form the alliance for family policy , which aimed to develop improved work-family reconciliation policies . but despite the government 's efforts to provide day care and tax relief for families , germany is still short of some 1.2 million nursery places for children under three .
schröder pledged once again to increase day care for working families . " flexible working hours and family-friendly employment policies are good , because both sides reap benefits , " he insisted . throwing out the three-year job guarantee he also said industry should do more to support employees with children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but president of the german employers association , dieter hundt , pointed out that two thirds of all firms already offer their employees flexible schedules and that business should n't be blamed for the problem .
he contended that it was the state which has to reform its policies regarding families . for now , mothers are allowed to take up to six months of paid maternity leave and unpaid leave of up to three years . " something needs to change " " as far as employers are concerned , we need to take a new look at reducing parental leave , " said hundt .
" so far , our relatively generous family support of € 150 billion has led to neither higher birth rates nor improved integration of parents within the labor market .
something needs to change . " hundt believes that parents need to return to the work faster than is currently the norm , because the german economy simply ca n't afford to forfeit qualified workers with know-how . the government largely agrees .
its latest proposal , outlined at the conference by minister for family affairs renate schmidt , would introduce a sliding scale benefit scheme dependent on income . but as schröder said wednesday , the issue is by no means purely financial .

" so far , our relatively generous family support of € 150 billion has led to neither higher birth rates nor improved integration of parents within the labor market .
something needs to change . " hundt believes that parents need to return to the work faster than is currently the norm , because the german economy simply ca n't afford to forfeit qualified workers with know-how . the government largely agrees .
its latest proposal , outlined at the conference by minister for family affairs renate schmidt , would introduce a sliding scale benefit scheme dependent on income . but as schröder said wednesday , the issue is by no means purely financial .

a trend towards christian schooling in germany might just substantiate that belief . it 's a fact that both catholic and evangelical schools in germany are flourishing .
there are almost 2,000 christian schools scattered across the country and an increasing number of children waiting patiently to be given one of the highly coveted places .
demand far outstrips supply and progressive parents are taking it upon themselves to found a new generation of denominational schools .
but is the upturn really a reflection of a born-again faith ? the answer is no , at least not exclusively .
in fact it seems to have more to do with a belief in a better education than a belief in god .
jürgen frank , head of education for the evangelical church of germany says there are three main reasons for the recent rise in enthusiasm for christian schooling . " firstly , families are generally smaller and parents want to provide their children with a good education .
secondly , they want the education their children receive to meet their individual needs , and thirdly they want a progressive , modern education system , " he said . popular values ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from incense to wine , catholic children have a lot to learn andreas verhülsdonk , an expert on religious education in the catholic church , says that parents are drawn to catholicism because they know their children will be taught values and morality . " we run a project called " compassion " in which pupils spend three weeks with homeless or sick people , " he said .
" the point is not just to help the needy but to give the children the chance to see the world through the eyes of people living on the fringes of society . " but christoph hermann , who sends his son to an evangelical school in berlin says it is simply important to make christianity a part of daily life . " i would n't consider myself particularly religious , but the christian faith was a part of my upbringing and that is what i want for my son , " hermann said . " we live in an increasingly secular society and i do n't want him to grow up seeing christianity as something fundamental because he has n't been exposed to it in an everyday kind of way . " there 's more to it than just religion that , however , is not to say that denominational schools neglect reading , writing and arithmetic .
in fact they are legally bound to provide pupils with the same curricular options as state schools , with the only difference being compulsory religious education for an average of two hours each week .
hermann believes his son is getting a good deal . " christianity is helpful in learning to understand our culture and it equips children to better understand art and history as well , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young children practice their abc and that is not all .
according to frank , children at evangelical schools in germany learn to read and write better than their state school counterparts . " a study we carried out after the publication of the pisa report revealed that the educational climate at christian schools is better than in state schools , and that the quality on offer at demoninational schools genuinely does live up to its reputation , " he said . indeed , that reputation appears to have run away with the imagination of some determined and diligent parents .
since the fall of the berlin wall , the church has given its blessing to the founding of some 70 new evangelical schools and there are 50 more would-be 's waiting in the wings .
but getting such a venture off the ground is no easy feat . " we have to clear a lot of hurdles , many of them financial , before a new school can be founded , " frank said . hurdles to new beginnings new school initiatives receive a grant from the evangelical church to see them through the first three or four years until the government starts paying an annual subsistence worth some 90 percent of the regular state school budget .
but frank says church funds are running dry . " we used to pay start-up schools some 240,000 euros -lrb- $ 309,000 -rrb- for those first few years , but now with so many waiting , we ca n't afford to do that , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children can be non-denominational and still attend a protestant school most of these projects depend very heavily on the driving parental force behind them , not only to put sponsorship or financing in place , but to find and renovate premises , to interview and hire staff , and of course to handpick the protégées . the selection criteria vary from school to school , state to state and church to church .
in the case of catholics , the emphasis is on accepting children who are being brought up within the framework of the faith , whereas the evangelical church takes a more relaxed approach to the religious background of its recruits . what they want to achieve , they say , is a good social mix . but is it illusory to think that 's really possible in schools that require tuition ?
frank says that although parents who send their children to evangelical schools are expected to pay a monthly fee of between 40 and 120 euros - based on what they earn - those who ca n't afford it are exempt without a battle .
but that said , he thinks germans should be prepared to dig deeper into their pockets for a good education . " it 's horrifying how little people are prepared to invest in learning , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 14.04.2005 back to belief in german schools großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian education has made a comeback in germany last week 's emotional outpouring following the pope 's death has sparked excited calls from the faithful that christianity is back ' in ' .
a trend towards christian schooling in germany might just substantiate that belief . it 's a fact that both catholic and evangelical schools in germany are flourishing .
there are almost 2,000 christian schools scattered across the country and an increasing number of children waiting patiently to be given one of the highly coveted places .
demand far outstrips supply and progressive parents are taking it upon themselves to found a new generation of denominational schools .
but is the upturn really a reflection of a born-again faith ? the answer is no , at least not exclusively .
in fact it seems to have more to do with a belief in a better education than a belief in god .
jürgen frank , head of education for the evangelical church of germany says there are three main reasons for the recent rise in enthusiasm for christian schooling . " firstly , families are generally smaller and parents want to provide their children with a good education .
secondly , they want the education their children receive to meet their individual needs , and thirdly they want a progressive , modern education system , " he said . popular values ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from incense to wine , catholic children have a lot to learn andreas verhülsdonk , an expert on religious education in the catholic church , says that parents are drawn to catholicism because they know their children will be taught values and morality . " we run a project called " compassion " in which pupils spend three weeks with homeless or sick people , " he said .
" the point is not just to help the needy but to give the children the chance to see the world through the eyes of people living on the fringes of society . " but christoph hermann , who sends his son to an evangelical school in berlin says it is simply important to make christianity a part of daily life . " i would n't consider myself particularly religious , but the christian faith was a part of my upbringing and that is what i want for my son , " hermann said . " we live in an increasingly secular society and i do n't want him to grow up seeing christianity as something fundamental because he has n't been exposed to it in an everyday kind of way . " there 's more to it than just religion that , however , is not to say that denominational schools neglect reading , writing and arithmetic .
in fact they are legally bound to provide pupils with the same curricular options as state schools , with the only difference being compulsory religious education for an average of two hours each week .
hermann believes his son is getting a good deal . " christianity is helpful in learning to understand our culture and it equips children to better understand art and history as well , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young children practice their abc and that is not all .
according to frank , children at evangelical schools in germany learn to read and write better than their state school counterparts . " a study we carried out after the publication of the pisa report revealed that the educational climate at christian schools is better than in state schools , and that the quality on offer at demoninational schools genuinely does live up to its reputation , " he said . indeed , that reputation appears to have run away with the imagination of some determined and diligent parents .
since the fall of the berlin wall , the church has given its blessing to the founding of some 70 new evangelical schools and there are 50 more would-be 's waiting in the wings .
but getting such a venture off the ground is no easy feat . " we have to clear a lot of hurdles , many of them financial , before a new school can be founded , " frank said . hurdles to new beginnings new school initiatives receive a grant from the evangelical church to see them through the first three or four years until the government starts paying an annual subsistence worth some 90 percent of the regular state school budget .
but frank says church funds are running dry . " we used to pay start-up schools some 240,000 euros -lrb- $ 309,000 -rrb- for those first few years , but now with so many waiting , we ca n't afford to do that , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children can be non-denominational and still attend a protestant school most of these projects depend very heavily on the driving parental force behind them , not only to put sponsorship or financing in place , but to find and renovate premises , to interview and hire staff , and of course to handpick the protégées . the selection criteria vary from school to school , state to state and church to church .
in the case of catholics , the emphasis is on accepting children who are being brought up within the framework of the faith , whereas the evangelical church takes a more relaxed approach to the religious background of its recruits . what they want to achieve , they say , is a good social mix . but is it illusory to think that 's really possible in schools that require tuition ?
frank says that although parents who send their children to evangelical schools are expected to pay a monthly fee of between 40 and 120 euros - based on what they earn - those who ca n't afford it are exempt without a battle .
but that said , he thinks germans should be prepared to dig deeper into their pockets for a good education . " it 's horrifying how little people are prepared to invest in learning , " he said . " they spend ten times more on entertainment than they do on education .

work-life balance gets boost in germany encouraging germans to have more kids the dumbing down of germany study : men in germany are scared to start families current affairs -pipe- 14.04.2005 gerd 's family policy gets down to business großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor wants to see more germans starting families by 2020 , germany will have europe 's lowest percentage of young people .
wednesday 's conference on family policy took a close look at the economic repercussions of the declining birth rate . as germany struggles to maintain the viability of its state pension scheme amid an imminent demographic crunch caused by falling birth rates and an ageing population , chancellor gerhard schröder on wednesday renewed his commitment to encouraging families to have children and outlined new initiatives which would provide financial and job benefits to working germans who decide to start a family or expand an existing one . children are our future , " said chancellor gerhard schröder at the conference called " family - success factor for the economy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " they are our future workforce , consumers and parents .
our future , our pensions and the economic strength of our country , rests in the hands of our children . " the family challenge the number of children born in germany has fallen a dramatic 50 per cent from 1.4 million in 1964 to just 700,000 in 2005 .
as the country 's unemployment figures continue to swell , to many , the prospect of raising a family seems just too challenging .
given the nation 's nagging economic woes , women in particular see the difficulty of combining child-rearing and career as too much of a deterrent . it 's a trend germany ca n't afford to let develop . " creating good conditions for families became an economic issue a long time ago , " said schröder .
a reduced younger generation means a declining workforce , lack of innovation and ever fewer consumers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we can not allow a woman to decide against having children because she 's reluctant to have to choose between having a child or having a career , " stressed schröder .
" we can not allow a family on a normal income to decide against another child for financial reasons . in future , family policy has to create conditions which enable more people to have children . " benefits for both sides in 2003 , the government joined forces with business to form the alliance for family policy , which aimed to develop improved work-family reconciliation policies . but despite the government 's efforts to provide day care and tax relief for families , germany is still short of some 1.2 million nursery places for children under three .
schröder pledged once again to increase day care for working families . " flexible working hours and family-friendly employment policies are good , because both sides reap benefits , " he insisted . throwing out the three-year job guarantee he also said industry should do more to support employees with children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but president of the german employers association , dieter hundt , pointed out that two thirds of all firms already offer their employees flexible schedules and that business should n't be blamed for the problem .
he contended that it was the state which has to reform its policies regarding families . for now , mothers are allowed to take up to six months of paid maternity leave and unpaid leave of up to three years . " something needs to change " " as far as employers are concerned , we need to take a new look at reducing parental leave , " said hundt .
" so far , our relatively generous family support of € 150 billion has led to neither higher birth rates nor improved integration of parents within the labor market .
something needs to change . " hundt believes that parents need to return to the work faster than is currently the norm , because the german economy simply ca n't afford to forfeit qualified workers with know-how . the government largely agrees .
its latest proposal , outlined at the conference by minister for family affairs renate schmidt , would introduce a sliding scale benefit scheme dependent on income . but as schröder said wednesday , the issue is by no means purely financial .

bayern and stuttgart start a stretch of test matches before a final clash in stuttgart . after last weekend 's disastrous 3-0 defeat in stuttgart , the mood in schalke turned for the worse .
before , there was talk of winning the title .
now they are thinking differently .
coach ralf rangnick said in kicker magazine that the most important task " is securing a spot in the champions league . "
that means finishing second in the bundesliga for automatic qualification .

on 54 points , they lie five back of bayern .
yet their schedule , like bayern 's , is filled with mediocre opponents .
this saturday , the hardest adversary just may be the long bus ride to rostock on the baltic sea .
stuttgart 's markus babbel warned in sport-bild magazine that 17th place rostock , fighting for their lives against relegation , can not be taken lightly .
" we ca n't allow a loss like that of schalke against mainz . "

star defender lucio deflected two balls into his own net in the two fixtures with chelsea but bayern are three points in front of second place schalke and are also in the semifinals of the league cup , " so things are n't that bad , " said magath .
their opponents , hanover , could sing a similar tune .
not because they are mixing it up at the top of the table .
more because they have stamped their ticket for the first division for next season .
hanover have taken a beating against bayern in the past , letting in 87 goals in their 31 meetings .
what speaks for ewald lienen 's club is the fact that this game is in hanover .

bayern and stuttgart start a stretch of test matches before a final clash in stuttgart . after last weekend 's disastrous 3-0 defeat in stuttgart , the mood in schalke turned for the worse .
before , there was talk of winning the title .
now they are thinking differently .
coach ralf rangnick said in kicker magazine that the most important task " is securing a spot in the champions league . "
that means finishing second in the bundesliga for automatic qualification .
the schedule , however , is against them heading down the home stretch .
in their last six matches , they face four teams with international aspirations .
this week , sixth place hamburg are in town .
coach thomas doll 's club has fallen on hard times of late .
at the beginning of the second half of the season , hamburg sprang to the top third of the standings but luck has not been on their side recently and they 've collected only one point in their last three games .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's coach ralf rangnick has had reason to frown in the bundesliga the past few weeks schalke are by no means out of the title race , but it may be stuttgart who may make the race tight for bayern munich .
they will need help from other teams though .
on 54 points , they lie five back of bayern .
yet their schedule , like bayern 's , is filled with mediocre opponents .
this saturday , the hardest adversary just may be the long bus ride to rostock on the baltic sea .
stuttgart 's markus babbel warned in sport-bild magazine that 17th place rostock , fighting for their lives against relegation , can not be taken lightly .
" we ca n't allow a loss like that of schalke against mainz . "
stuttgart are playing juggernaut-like and silently have thoughts of winning the championship .
if the cards fall right , this could happen .
in the final game of the season , matthias sammer 's team comes up against bayern .
champions league adieu , hello bundesliga bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's goalkeeper oliver kahn is not one to keep his emotions penned in following their ouster from the champions league at the hands of chelsea , 18-time bundesliga champion bayern munich can concentrate on the league title .
coach felix magath bemoaned the bad luck of the bavarians against the premiereship side .
star defender lucio deflected two balls into his own net in the two fixtures with chelsea but bayern are three points in front of second place schalke and are also in the semifinals of the league cup , " so things are n't that bad , " said magath .
their opponents , hanover , could sing a similar tune .
not because they are mixing it up at the top of the table .
more because they have stamped their ticket for the first division for next season .
hanover have taken a beating against bayern in the past , letting in 87 goals in their 31 meetings .
what speaks for ewald lienen 's club is the fact that this game is in hanover .
the only five matches they have bettered munich have taken place at home .
reigning champs and fourth place werder bremen -lrb- 50 points -rrb- have a big assignment when they host hertha berlin -lrb- 47 -rrb- .
bremen must do without captain and national midfielder frank baumann who went under the knife this week for a bad left ankle .

but i 'm not very optimistic what kind of influence i have , " funke said .
" but if it means that children in for example america are told stories by a european , then that 's something at least . " prolific author in the uk especially , funke is often described as the german response to j.k. rowling , the british superstar author of the harry potter series .
rowling , who is nine years younger than funke , is now working on her sixth harry potter book .
funke , on the other hand , has written more than 40 books in 15 years .
one of her most successful , " inkheart , " is an homage to reading and the power of the written word . on that night - when so much began and so much changed forever - one of meggie 's favorite books lay under her pillow and since the rain was n't letting her sleep , she sat up , rubbed her eyes and pulled the book out .
the page rustled promisingly as she opened it .
meggie thought that this first sound of pages was different in every book , depending on if she already knew what it was going to tell her or not . seemingly unmoved by her many literary awards and the time magazine list , cornelia funke simply goes on doing what she does best - write .
right now she 's working on a sequel to " inkheart " called " inkblood . "
like her colleague j.k. rowling on the other side of the channel , she will continue with each new book to turn both children and adults alike back to the pleasures of reading .

that could soon change . on time magazine 's list of the top 100 people who have influenced the world in the past year , three germans are present .
they are n't perhaps who you 'd think .
chancellor gerhard schröder does n't get a mention , nor does foreign minister joschka fischer or any of the country 's ceos or top scientists . instead , formula one driver michael schumacher made the grade , as did cardinal ratzinger , the man some believe could become the next pope .
the third german was cornelia funke , the best-selling author of children 's books whose fantasy-filled stories are enchanting readers around the world . with a sigh he sat down behind his desk .
then , behind the door , someone whispered .
they 're probably admiring my sign , thought victor .
it was black and shiny and had gold lettering : " victor getz , detective .
investigations of any kind . "
the door knocker next to the sign was in the shape of a lion 's head with a brass ring in its mouth , which victor has just polished this morning . victor getz does n't know it yet , but on this very morning he will set out in search of two street children , prosper and bo , and perhaps while he 's at it , he will find himself .
victor is one of the central characters in cornelia funke 's book " the thief lord . " complex characters , page-turner plots her characters are often not the nicest folks .
they 're often grumpy , shifty , timid , complicated and cunning - always three dimensional and without exception , loveable .
in funke 's fantastical stories , the figures move through refreshingly unpredictable plots , which are always immensely entertaining for readers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " inkheart " " i like to show children things that i myself find incredibly wonderful , for example , venice , " she said .
" of course other things creep in that occupy one 's mind , like the unbelievable lack of compassion that exists so often between humans and animals , or humans and humans .
but i always try to bind it all in the story .
the story comes first . " the former book illustrator began writing her own books 15 years ago ; most have been bestsellers .
but her phenomenal success has been so quiet that most germans have n't yet noticed this new global writer in their midst .
it 's mostly parents for whom the name " cornelia funke " has taken on special meaning , since it so often pops up in the juvenile section of libraries or on the wish lists of their children . magical but sophisticated us-based time magazine has been more alert to her talent than her compatriots since it awarded her a place in the magazine 's top 100 list . " she has become truly international and everyone who discovers her books really loves them , " said adi ignacius , time 's executive editor .
" they just find them to be very , you know , magical and enchanting and also sophisticated . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 46-year-old has sold more than three million books in her career , winning several prestigious awards in the process .
her most well-known works , " the thief lord , " dragonrider " and " inkheart " have been translated into 20 languages .
" the thief lord " has been made into a film and will hit german cinemas this fall .
big-screen productions of " inkheart " and the girl 's series " wilde hühner " -lrb- wild chickens -rrb- are also being planned . " it 's true that right now i 'm reaching millions of children .

the countries still have to institute wide-ranging reforms to satisfy eu accession criteria . the vote on wednesday in strasbourg cleared the way for the second expansion of the eu in eastern europe .
both bulgaria and romania are expected to sign the accession treaty on april 25 .
membership for the two , if they implement agreed upon economic and political reforms , is set for jan .
1 , 2007 . " romania has made a crucial step towards its eu membership in 2007 , " romanian prime minister calin tariceanu told reporters in the capital bucharest .
" after the signing of the membership treaty we will become a real accession country . " after signing the accession treaty , officials from the two countries will be allowed to participate in all eu meetings as observers . membership will also secure a place in the prosperous european club for two countries where economic output per capita is below 40 percent of eu average , even though their economies are growing quickly . reforms required the parliament in strasbourg voted with large majorities to back both countries ' accession .
the assembly voted 522 - 70 , with 69 abstentions , to back bulgaria 's eu entry , romania 's entry got a vote of 497-93 , with 71 abstentions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romanian parliament building still , there were serious doubts about whether the countries would implement the reforms the bloc requires before the 2007 date .
they include strengthening administration systems , beefing up border controls and introducing competition policy measures . rampant corruption is a concern for both countries , but particularly for romania , and some green members of parliament doubted that reforms could be carried out in time . green parliamentarian daniel cohn-bendit pointed to the eu legislature 's own report on romania that said : " high-level corruption , despite recent efforts , continues to undermine the country 's socio-economic and political life . " " if we look at matters such as press freedom and corruption and we take seriously everything we 've read in the reports , no one can say that romania in its current state is ready to join , " he said . while parliament rejected a motion by some minority groups to delay the votes until after the european commission publishes a report in november about the countries ' preparation for membership , it did for the first time in an enlargement procedure invoke a protection clause which states that the union could postpone the accession until 2008 if the countries did not make satisfactory progress in implementing reforms . both countries missed the first wave of the eu 's eastwards enlargement in may because they were slow to introduce political and economic reforms after the collapse of communism in 1989 .
romania , with its population of 22 million , is seen as worse prepared for membership and more corrupt than bulgaria , which has eight million citizens . challenges for sofia but bulgaria is not without its hurdles to overcome .
the country 's ailing judiciary is considered in need of restructuring , especially to secure effective crime fighting and a favorable business environment .
it has also been criticized for not integrating its minority communities , in particular its roma population , which numbers 800,000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel cohn-bendit bulgaria 's relative poverty worries some eu officials .
the average pension is 60 leva , or around 30 euros a month ; the average wage is 150 leva , about 75 euros . " we will need 20 , 30 years , even as an eu member , to reach the normal eu level , " said petar-emil mitev , a sociology professor . despite that , bulgaria 's citizens are enthusiastic about joining the european club , since for many of them it means a chance to get on a par with their neighbors . " our examples are the former socialist countries like the czech republic and poland , " said one woman on the streets of the capital .

the conservative cardinal , in charge of defending church doctrine , is considered a frontrunner . la repubblica and corriere della sera , both respected italian dailies with close contacts with the vatican , say two powerful german cardinals , karl lehmann of mainz and walter kasper , who is based in rome , have lined up against their fellow german who has been the catholic church 's controversial doctrinal watchdog . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal lehmann both lehmann and kasper have had public differences with ratzinger in the past . american cardinals have also expressed reservations about a possible ratzinger pontificate , according to la repubblica .
the paper reported that american and german cardinals are worried about ratzinger 's apparent lack of interest in matters of administration . german cardinals also have taken issue with ratzinger 's opposition to allowing lay theologians to take a leading roll in parishes that lack priests , a serious problem in germany .
the paper also said the ratzinger , the one-time archbishop of munich , had failed to address the issue of not allowing catholics who had divorced and remarried to receive communion . martini - the moderates ' man the milan-based corriere della sera reported that opponents to ratzinger were lining up behind 78-year-old carlo maria martini , who was a favorite of moderates until he resigned as milan 's archbishop in 2002 .
martini , a leading advocate of church reform , serves as a counterweight to the traditionalist ratzinger . bildunterschrift : carlo maria martini martini , however , is not in good health and has indicated he does not want the church 's top job .
but a strong showing for him in the first round of voting is seen as having primarily symbolic value that could show the strength of moderate cardinals and rally support behind a candidate more to their liking . vatican watchers say the first voting rounds are often considered formalities , which gauge the strengths of various camps .
a voting conclave can last for several days and often produces surprising results , as did the one in 1978 which elected poland 's karol wojtyla . however , since many of the bishops in the conclave were appointed by john paul ii , himself a conservative , the traditionalist camp is strong .
italian newspapers reported that between 40 and 50 cardinals had signalled their support for ratzinger in private meetings this week . that number , though , is short of the two-thirds majority , 77 out of 115 votes , needed to win .
vatican watchers say many of the cardinals who will go into the conclave on monday are still undecided . " ratzinger is looking strong , but it 's still far from clear who will emerge and how the voting will go , " one church official , who requested anonymity , told reuters . book published cardinal ratzinger , who turns 78 on saturday , published a book on wednesday in germany which argues that europe must retain its christian heritage .
it is not clear what kind of effect the book will have on the election , although open campaigning for the papacy is generally frowned upon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph ratzinger , as catholic prefect of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith in the book , he reiterated his conservative views , criticizing the collapse of traditional families and attacking the drive toward gay marriage , saying it was a trend in which " the entire moral history of mankind is being left behind . " he said europe had become " empty inside " and was " dependent on transplants , " referring to the continent 's low birth rate and the need for immigrant labor . although some questioned the timing of the book 's publication , it does not appear to have broken the agreement among cardinals not to talk to the media during the pre-conclave period since the book was likely written before the death of john paul ii . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de could a bavarian become pope ?

a trend towards christian schooling in germany might just substantiate that belief . it 's a fact that both catholic and evangelical schools in germany are flourishing .
there are almost 2,000 christian schools scattered across the country and an increasing number of children waiting patiently to be given one of the highly coveted places .
demand far outstrips supply and progressive parents are taking it upon themselves to found a new generation of denominational schools .
but is the upturn really a reflection of a born-again faith ? the answer is no , at least not exclusively .
in fact it seems to have more to do with a belief in a better education than a belief in god .
jürgen frank , head of education for the evangelical church of germany says there are three main reasons for the recent rise in enthusiasm for christian schooling . " firstly , families are generally smaller and parents want to provide their children with a good education .
secondly , they want the education their children receive to meet their individual needs , and thirdly they want a progressive , modern education system , " he said . popular values ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from incense to wine , catholic children have a lot to learn andreas verhülsdonk , an expert on religious education in the catholic church , says that parents are drawn to catholicism because they know their children will be taught values and morality . " we run a project called " compassion " in which pupils spend three weeks with homeless or sick people , " he said .
" the point is not just to help the needy but to give the children the chance to see the world through the eyes of people living on the fringes of society . " but christoph hermann , who sends his son to an evangelical school in berlin says it is simply important to make christianity a part of daily life . " i would n't consider myself particularly religious , but the christian faith was a part of my upbringing and that is what i want for my son , " hermann said . " we live in an increasingly secular society and i do n't want him to grow up seeing christianity as something fundamental because he has n't been exposed to it in an everyday kind of way . " there 's more to it than just religion that , however , is not to say that denominational schools neglect reading , writing and arithmetic .
in fact they are legally bound to provide pupils with the same curricular options as state schools , with the only difference being compulsory religious education for an average of two hours each week .
hermann believes his son is getting a good deal . " christianity is helpful in learning to understand our culture and it equips children to better understand art and history as well , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young children practice their abc and that is not all .
according to frank , children at evangelical schools in germany learn to read and write better than their state school counterparts . " a study we carried out after the publication of the pisa report revealed that the educational climate at christian schools is better than in state schools , and that the quality on offer at demoninational schools genuinely does live up to its reputation , " he said . indeed , that reputation appears to have run away with the imagination of some determined and diligent parents .
since the fall of the berlin wall , the church has given its blessing to the founding of some 70 new evangelical schools and there are 50 more would-be 's waiting in the wings .
but getting such a venture off the ground is no easy feat . " we have to clear a lot of hurdles , many of them financial , before a new school can be founded , " frank said . hurdles to new beginnings new school initiatives receive a grant from the evangelical church to see them through the first three or four years until the government starts paying an annual subsistence worth some 90 percent of the regular state school budget .
but frank says church funds are running dry . " we used to pay start-up schools some 240,000 euros -lrb- $ 309,000 -rrb- for those first few years , but now with so many waiting , we ca n't afford to do that , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children can be non-denominational and still attend a protestant school most of these projects depend very heavily on the driving parental force behind them , not only to put sponsorship or financing in place , but to find and renovate premises , to interview and hire staff , and of course to handpick the protégées . the selection criteria vary from school to school , state to state and church to church .
in the case of catholics , the emphasis is on accepting children who are being brought up within the framework of the faith , whereas the evangelical church takes a more relaxed approach to the religious background of its recruits . what they want to achieve , they say , is a good social mix . but is it illusory to think that 's really possible in schools that require tuition ?
frank says that although parents who send their children to evangelical schools are expected to pay a monthly fee of between 40 and 120 euros - based on what they earn - those who ca n't afford it are exempt without a battle .
but that said , he thinks germans should be prepared to dig deeper into their pockets for a good education . " it 's horrifying how little people are prepared to invest in learning , " he said .

a trend towards christian schooling in germany might just substantiate that belief . it 's a fact that both catholic and evangelical schools in germany are flourishing .
there are almost 2,000 christian schools scattered across the country and an increasing number of children waiting patiently to be given one of the highly coveted places .
demand far outstrips supply and progressive parents are taking it upon themselves to found a new generation of denominational schools .
but is the upturn really a reflection of a born-again faith ? the answer is no , at least not exclusively .
in fact it seems to have more to do with a belief in a better education than a belief in god .
jürgen frank , head of education for the evangelical church of germany says there are three main reasons for the recent rise in enthusiasm for christian schooling . " firstly , families are generally smaller and parents want to provide their children with a good education .
secondly , they want the education their children receive to meet their individual needs , and thirdly they want a progressive , modern education system , " he said . popular values ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from incense to wine , catholic children have a lot to learn andreas verhülsdonk , an expert on religious education in the catholic church , says that parents are drawn to catholicism because they know their children will be taught values and morality . " we run a project called " compassion " in which pupils spend three weeks with homeless or sick people , " he said .
" the point is not just to help the needy but to give the children the chance to see the world through the eyes of people living on the fringes of society . " but christoph hermann , who sends his son to an evangelical school in berlin says it is simply important to make christianity a part of daily life . " i would n't consider myself particularly religious , but the christian faith was a part of my upbringing and that is what i want for my son , " hermann said . " we live in an increasingly secular society and i do n't want him to grow up seeing christianity as something fundamental because he has n't been exposed to it in an everyday kind of way . " there 's more to it than just religion that , however , is not to say that denominational schools neglect reading , writing and arithmetic .

" we used to pay start-up schools some 240,000 euros -lrb- $ 309,000 -rrb- for those first few years , but now with so many waiting , we ca n't afford to do that , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children can be non-denominational and still attend a protestant school most of these projects depend very heavily on the driving parental force behind them , not only to put sponsorship or financing in place , but to find and renovate premises , to interview and hire staff , and of course to handpick the protégées . the selection criteria vary from school to school , state to state and church to church .
in the case of catholics , the emphasis is on accepting children who are being brought up within the framework of the faith , whereas the evangelical church takes a more relaxed approach to the religious background of its recruits . what they want to achieve , they say , is a good social mix . but is it illusory to think that 's really possible in schools that require tuition ?
frank says that although parents who send their children to evangelical schools are expected to pay a monthly fee of between 40 and 120 euros - based on what they earn - those who ca n't afford it are exempt without a battle .
but that said , he thinks germans should be prepared to dig deeper into their pockets for a good education . " it 's horrifying how little people are prepared to invest in learning , " he said .

work-life balance gets boost in germany encouraging germans to have more kids the dumbing down of germany study : men in germany are scared to start families current affairs -pipe- 14.04.2005 gerd 's family policy gets down to business großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor wants to see more germans starting families by 2020 , germany will have europe 's lowest percentage of young people .
wednesday 's conference on family policy took a close look at the economic repercussions of the declining birth rate . as germany struggles to maintain the viability of its state pension scheme amid an imminent demographic crunch caused by falling birth rates and an ageing population , chancellor gerhard schröder on wednesday renewed his commitment to encouraging families to have children and outlined new initiatives which would provide financial and job benefits to working germans who decide to start a family or expand an existing one . children are our future , " said chancellor gerhard schröder at the conference called " family - success factor for the economy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " they are our future workforce , consumers and parents .
our future , our pensions and the economic strength of our country , rests in the hands of our children . " the family challenge the number of children born in germany has fallen a dramatic 50 per cent from 1.4 million in 1964 to just 700,000 in 2005 .
as the country 's unemployment figures continue to swell , to many , the prospect of raising a family seems just too challenging .
given the nation 's nagging economic woes , women in particular see the difficulty of combining child-rearing and career as too much of a deterrent . it 's a trend germany ca n't afford to let develop . " creating good conditions for families became an economic issue a long time ago , " said schröder .
a reduced younger generation means a declining workforce , lack of innovation and ever fewer consumers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we can not allow a woman to decide against having children because she 's reluctant to have to choose between having a child or having a career , " stressed schröder .
" we can not allow a family on a normal income to decide against another child for financial reasons . in future , family policy has to create conditions which enable more people to have children . " benefits for both sides in 2003 , the government joined forces with business to form the alliance for family policy , which aimed to develop improved work-family reconciliation policies . but despite the government 's efforts to provide day care and tax relief for families , germany is still short of some 1.2 million nursery places for children under three .
schröder pledged once again to increase day care for working families . " flexible working hours and family-friendly employment policies are good , because both sides reap benefits , " he insisted . throwing out the three-year job guarantee he also said industry should do more to support employees with children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but president of the german employers association , dieter hundt , pointed out that two thirds of all firms already offer their employees flexible schedules and that business should n't be blamed for the problem .
he contended that it was the state which has to reform its policies regarding families . for now , mothers are allowed to take up to six months of paid maternity leave and unpaid leave of up to three years . " something needs to change " " as far as employers are concerned , we need to take a new look at reducing parental leave , " said hundt .
" so far , our relatively generous family support of € 150 billion has led to neither higher birth rates nor improved integration of parents within the labor market .
something needs to change . " hundt believes that parents need to return to the work faster than is currently the norm , because the german economy simply ca n't afford to forfeit qualified workers with know-how . the government largely agrees .
its latest proposal , outlined at the conference by minister for family affairs renate schmidt , would introduce a sliding scale benefit scheme dependent on income . but as schröder said wednesday , the issue is by no means purely financial .

work-life balance gets boost in germany encouraging germans to have more kids the dumbing down of germany study : men in germany are scared to start families current affairs -pipe- 14.04.2005 gerd 's family policy gets down to business großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor wants to see more germans starting families by 2020 , germany will have europe 's lowest percentage of young people .
wednesday 's conference on family policy took a close look at the economic repercussions of the declining birth rate . as germany struggles to maintain the viability of its state pension scheme amid an imminent demographic crunch caused by falling birth rates and an ageing population , chancellor gerhard schröder on wednesday renewed his commitment to encouraging families to have children and outlined new initiatives which would provide financial and job benefits to working germans who decide to start a family or expand an existing one . children are our future , " said chancellor gerhard schröder at the conference called " family - success factor for the economy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " they are our future workforce , consumers and parents .
our future , our pensions and the economic strength of our country , rests in the hands of our children . " the family challenge the number of children born in germany has fallen a dramatic 50 per cent from 1.4 million in 1964 to just 700,000 in 2005 .
as the country 's unemployment figures continue to swell , to many , the prospect of raising a family seems just too challenging .
given the nation 's nagging economic woes , women in particular see the difficulty of combining child-rearing and career as too much of a deterrent . it 's a trend germany ca n't afford to let develop . " creating good conditions for families became an economic issue a long time ago , " said schröder .
a reduced younger generation means a declining workforce , lack of innovation and ever fewer consumers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we can not allow a woman to decide against having children because she 's reluctant to have to choose between having a child or having a career , " stressed schröder .
" we can not allow a family on a normal income to decide against another child for financial reasons . in future , family policy has to create conditions which enable more people to have children . " benefits for both sides in 2003 , the government joined forces with business to form the alliance for family policy , which aimed to develop improved work-family reconciliation policies . but despite the government 's efforts to provide day care and tax relief for families , germany is still short of some 1.2 million nursery places for children under three .
schröder pledged once again to increase day care for working families . " flexible working hours and family-friendly employment policies are good , because both sides reap benefits , " he insisted . throwing out the three-year job guarantee he also said industry should do more to support employees with children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but president of the german employers association , dieter hundt , pointed out that two thirds of all firms already offer their employees flexible schedules and that business should n't be blamed for the problem .
he contended that it was the state which has to reform its policies regarding families . for now , mothers are allowed to take up to six months of paid maternity leave and unpaid leave of up to three years . " something needs to change " " as far as employers are concerned , we need to take a new look at reducing parental leave , " said hundt .
" so far , our relatively generous family support of € 150 billion has led to neither higher birth rates nor improved integration of parents within the labor market .
something needs to change . " hundt believes that parents need to return to the work faster than is currently the norm , because the german economy simply ca n't afford to forfeit qualified workers with know-how . the government largely agrees .
its latest proposal , outlined at the conference by minister for family affairs renate schmidt , would introduce a sliding scale benefit scheme dependent on income . but as schröder said wednesday , the issue is by no means purely financial .

work-life balance gets boost in germany encouraging germans to have more kids the dumbing down of germany study : men in germany are scared to start families current affairs -pipe- 14.04.2005 gerd 's family policy gets down to business großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor wants to see more germans starting families by 2020 , germany will have europe 's lowest percentage of young people .
wednesday 's conference on family policy took a close look at the economic repercussions of the declining birth rate . as germany struggles to maintain the viability of its state pension scheme amid an imminent demographic crunch caused by falling birth rates and an ageing population , chancellor gerhard schröder on wednesday renewed his commitment to encouraging families to have children and outlined new initiatives which would provide financial and job benefits to working germans who decide to start a family or expand an existing one . children are our future , " said chancellor gerhard schröder at the conference called " family - success factor for the economy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " they are our future workforce , consumers and parents .
our future , our pensions and the economic strength of our country , rests in the hands of our children . " the family challenge the number of children born in germany has fallen a dramatic 50 per cent from 1.4 million in 1964 to just 700,000 in 2005 .
as the country 's unemployment figures continue to swell , to many , the prospect of raising a family seems just too challenging .
given the nation 's nagging economic woes , women in particular see the difficulty of combining child-rearing and career as too much of a deterrent . it 's a trend germany ca n't afford to let develop . " creating good conditions for families became an economic issue a long time ago , " said schröder .
a reduced younger generation means a declining workforce , lack of innovation and ever fewer consumers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we can not allow a woman to decide against having children because she 's reluctant to have to choose between having a child or having a career , " stressed schröder .
" we can not allow a family on a normal income to decide against another child for financial reasons . in future , family policy has to create conditions which enable more people to have children . " benefits for both sides in 2003 , the government joined forces with business to form the alliance for family policy , which aimed to develop improved work-family reconciliation policies . but despite the government 's efforts to provide day care and tax relief for families , germany is still short of some 1.2 million nursery places for children under three .
schröder pledged once again to increase day care for working families . " flexible working hours and family-friendly employment policies are good , because both sides reap benefits , " he insisted . throwing out the three-year job guarantee he also said industry should do more to support employees with children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but president of the german employers association , dieter hundt , pointed out that two thirds of all firms already offer their employees flexible schedules and that business should n't be blamed for the problem .
he contended that it was the state which has to reform its policies regarding families . for now , mothers are allowed to take up to six months of paid maternity leave and unpaid leave of up to three years . " something needs to change " " as far as employers are concerned , we need to take a new look at reducing parental leave , " said hundt .
" so far , our relatively generous family support of € 150 billion has led to neither higher birth rates nor improved integration of parents within the labor market .
something needs to change . " hundt believes that parents need to return to the work faster than is currently the norm , because the german economy simply ca n't afford to forfeit qualified workers with know-how . the government largely agrees .
its latest proposal , outlined at the conference by minister for family affairs renate schmidt , would introduce a sliding scale benefit scheme dependent on income . but as schröder said wednesday , the issue is by no means purely financial .
" parents need more infrastructures , not just more money , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de work-life balance gets boost in germany in germany , where kids are seen as career killers , over 40 percent of highly qualified women choose to remain childless .

a trend towards christian schooling in germany might just substantiate that belief . it 's a fact that both catholic and evangelical schools in germany are flourishing .
there are almost 2,000 christian schools scattered across the country and an increasing number of children waiting patiently to be given one of the highly coveted places .
demand far outstrips supply and progressive parents are taking it upon themselves to found a new generation of denominational schools .
but is the upturn really a reflection of a born-again faith ? the answer is no , at least not exclusively .
in fact it seems to have more to do with a belief in a better education than a belief in god .
jürgen frank , head of education for the evangelical church of germany says there are three main reasons for the recent rise in enthusiasm for christian schooling . " firstly , families are generally smaller and parents want to provide their children with a good education .
secondly , they want the education their children receive to meet their individual needs , and thirdly they want a progressive , modern education system , " he said . popular values ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from incense to wine , catholic children have a lot to learn andreas verhülsdonk , an expert on religious education in the catholic church , says that parents are drawn to catholicism because they know their children will be taught values and morality . " we run a project called " compassion " in which pupils spend three weeks with homeless or sick people , " he said .
" the point is not just to help the needy but to give the children the chance to see the world through the eyes of people living on the fringes of society . " but christoph hermann , who sends his son to an evangelical school in berlin says it is simply important to make christianity a part of daily life . " i would n't consider myself particularly religious , but the christian faith was a part of my upbringing and that is what i want for my son , " hermann said . " we live in an increasingly secular society and i do n't want him to grow up seeing christianity as something fundamental because he has n't been exposed to it in an everyday kind of way . " there 's more to it than just religion that , however , is not to say that denominational schools neglect reading , writing and arithmetic .
in fact they are legally bound to provide pupils with the same curricular options as state schools , with the only difference being compulsory religious education for an average of two hours each week .
hermann believes his son is getting a good deal . " christianity is helpful in learning to understand our culture and it equips children to better understand art and history as well , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young children practice their abc and that is not all .
according to frank , children at evangelical schools in germany learn to read and write better than their state school counterparts . " a study we carried out after the publication of the pisa report revealed that the educational climate at christian schools is better than in state schools , and that the quality on offer at demoninational schools genuinely does live up to its reputation , " he said . indeed , that reputation appears to have run away with the imagination of some determined and diligent parents .
since the fall of the berlin wall , the church has given its blessing to the founding of some 70 new evangelical schools and there are 50 more would-be 's waiting in the wings .
but getting such a venture off the ground is no easy feat . " we have to clear a lot of hurdles , many of them financial , before a new school can be founded , " frank said . hurdles to new beginnings new school initiatives receive a grant from the evangelical church to see them through the first three or four years until the government starts paying an annual subsistence worth some 90 percent of the regular state school budget .
but frank says church funds are running dry . " we used to pay start-up schools some 240,000 euros -lrb- $ 309,000 -rrb- for those first few years , but now with so many waiting , we ca n't afford to do that , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children can be non-denominational and still attend a protestant school most of these projects depend very heavily on the driving parental force behind them , not only to put sponsorship or financing in place , but to find and renovate premises , to interview and hire staff , and of course to handpick the protégées . the selection criteria vary from school to school , state to state and church to church .
in the case of catholics , the emphasis is on accepting children who are being brought up within the framework of the faith , whereas the evangelical church takes a more relaxed approach to the religious background of its recruits . what they want to achieve , they say , is a good social mix . but is it illusory to think that 's really possible in schools that require tuition ?
frank says that although parents who send their children to evangelical schools are expected to pay a monthly fee of between 40 and 120 euros - based on what they earn - those who ca n't afford it are exempt without a battle .
but that said , he thinks germans should be prepared to dig deeper into their pockets for a good education . " it 's horrifying how little people are prepared to invest in learning , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.04.2005 turkey 's euro-skeptic ranks swell großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the eu-turkish relationship one of reluctance on both sides ?
turks are increasingly critical of the country 's possible accession to the eu as euro-skeptics warn of a potential sell-out of national interests . even though opinion polls regularly show that three-quarters of turks favour their country joining the eu , increasing numbers are also becoming aware of drawbacks : brussels is going to make increasing demands on ankara and will have a bigger role in running the country .
many see this this as a threat to the turkish state .
these warnings are also being voiced in other countries that are seeking eu membership but nowhere do they touch the nerve the way they do in turkey .
while the eu - as a result of its experiences in the two world wars - is trying to supress the individual nation-state by bringing member states closer together as one , many turks consider the nation-state to be the greatest good .
" sovereignty belongs unconditionally and unreservedly to the nation " was one of the principles of atatürk , the founder of the modern turkish state , whose image hangs on the end wall of the plenary chamber in the turkish parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recep tayyip erdogan und abdullah gül have been accused of compromising over cyprus a foreign toy ?
turkey arose out of the ruins of the ottoman empire , which was occupied by the allied victors of world war i , in the 1920s .
in a war that involved heavy losses , atatürk succeeded in driving the greek occupying powers - in west anatolia in particular - out of the country .
in the early years of the republic , turks feared that the country would be carved up and become a plaything of foreign powers .
as a result , it is unsurprising that nationalists are claiming that turkish membership in the european union would ultimately only benefit europeans , not turks .
and they point to to the conflict over cyprus as evidence . the cypress conflict turkey 's euro-skeptics criticize every step taken by the government of prime minister recep tayyip erdogan regarding cypress : he hints that he is willing to make compromises in the search for a peaceful solution for the divided mediterranean island .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a close ally of turkish membership the fact that erdogan 's government is " selling " cyprus in order to show the eu how obedient tukrkey is , is an image often peddled by the right-wing nationalist mhp party .
but concern over the fate of the turkish state in the upcoming membership negotiations with the eu is not only an issue for turkey 's right wing .
drawing attention to supposed threats to turkey from outside its national borders is also part of the repertoire of the social democratic opposition party chp .
the chp recently and successfully challenged a law governing the sale of land and buildings to foreigners through the constitutional court .
the chp is part of turkey 's lay kemalist establishment that considers all deviations from atatürk 's course to be wrong .
because of this , kemalists have terrible difficulty accepting some of the european union 's key demands .
they even have trouble opening turkey up to foreign investors – a fact demonstrated by more than just the fate of the real estate law .
president ahmet necdet sezer , a leading kemalist , recently vetoed a law that would have allowed foreigners to buy television stations in turkey .
the president explained that he had taken this action because a law of this sort would not have been in the " national interest " .
sensitive minority policy if ground-breaking economic policies such as this are viewed with such suspicion , it is no wonder that the resistance to more sensitive issues , such as policies on minorities , is even more fierce .
the alleged attempts of young kurds to burn a turkish flag triggered nationalist hysteria across the country over the past few weeks .
tens of thousands demonstratively draped their homes with turkish flags while the turkish police marched through istanbul bearing a 1.5-kilometre long flag .
meanwhile , both the nationalists and kemalists are being joined by a growing number of turkish islamists who are also sceptical about their country 's eu application .
over the past few years , turkey 's islamists has accounted for some of the country 's greatest europhiles because they hoped that moving closer to the eu would bring more freedom of religion .
but the introduction of headscarf bans in several eu states and other similar developments have dashed these hopes .
a recent report published by the independent industrialist & businessmen 's association , müsiad , concluded that the basic values on which the eu is built are a " strait-jacket " for muslims .
even though erdogan 's government has more than a two-thirds majority in parliament , it says that eu skepticism must be taken seriously .
the nationalist and islamist wing of the ruling akp ensures that this mistrust is not restricted to the opposition both inside and outside the parliament .
the debate as to what other demands the eu has yet to make on turkey and how the country should react to them is only likely to really start once accession negotiations begin october 3 . susanne güsten , qantara.de -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is turkey losing its reform zeal ?

turks are increasingly critical of the country 's possible accession to the eu as euro-skeptics warn of a potential sell-out of national interests . even though opinion polls regularly show that three-quarters of turks favour their country joining the eu , increasing numbers are also becoming aware of drawbacks : brussels is going to make increasing demands on ankara and will have a bigger role in running the country .
many see this this as a threat to the turkish state .
these warnings are also being voiced in other countries that are seeking eu membership but nowhere do they touch the nerve the way they do in turkey .
while the eu - as a result of its experiences in the two world wars - is trying to supress the individual nation-state by bringing member states closer together as one , many turks consider the nation-state to be the greatest good .
" sovereignty belongs unconditionally and unreservedly to the nation " was one of the principles of atatürk , the founder of the modern turkish state , whose image hangs on the end wall of the plenary chamber in the turkish parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recep tayyip erdogan und abdullah gül have been accused of compromising over cyprus a foreign toy ?
turkey arose out of the ruins of the ottoman empire , which was occupied by the allied victors of world war i , in the 1920s .
in a war that involved heavy losses , atatürk succeeded in driving the greek occupying powers - in west anatolia in particular - out of the country .
in the early years of the republic , turks feared that the country would be carved up and become a plaything of foreign powers .
as a result , it is unsurprising that nationalists are claiming that turkish membership in the european union would ultimately only benefit europeans , not turks .
and they point to to the conflict over cyprus as evidence . the cypress conflict turkey 's euro-skeptics criticize every step taken by the government of prime minister recep tayyip erdogan regarding cypress : he hints that he is willing to make compromises in the search for a peaceful solution for the divided mediterranean island .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a close ally of turkish membership the fact that erdogan 's government is " selling " cyprus in order to show the eu how obedient tukrkey is , is an image often peddled by the right-wing nationalist mhp party .
but concern over the fate of the turkish state in the upcoming membership negotiations with the eu is not only an issue for turkey 's right wing .
drawing attention to supposed threats to turkey from outside its national borders is also part of the repertoire of the social democratic opposition party chp .
the chp recently and successfully challenged a law governing the sale of land and buildings to foreigners through the constitutional court .
the chp is part of turkey 's lay kemalist establishment that considers all deviations from atatürk 's course to be wrong .
because of this , kemalists have terrible difficulty accepting some of the european union 's key demands .
they even have trouble opening turkey up to foreign investors – a fact demonstrated by more than just the fate of the real estate law .
president ahmet necdet sezer , a leading kemalist , recently vetoed a law that would have allowed foreigners to buy television stations in turkey .
the president explained that he had taken this action because a law of this sort would not have been in the " national interest " .
sensitive minority policy if ground-breaking economic policies such as this are viewed with such suspicion , it is no wonder that the resistance to more sensitive issues , such as policies on minorities , is even more fierce .
the alleged attempts of young kurds to burn a turkish flag triggered nationalist hysteria across the country over the past few weeks .
tens of thousands demonstratively draped their homes with turkish flags while the turkish police marched through istanbul bearing a 1.5-kilometre long flag .
meanwhile , both the nationalists and kemalists are being joined by a growing number of turkish islamists who are also sceptical about their country 's eu application .
over the past few years , turkey 's islamists has accounted for some of the country 's greatest europhiles because they hoped that moving closer to the eu would bring more freedom of religion .
but the introduction of headscarf bans in several eu states and other similar developments have dashed these hopes .
a recent report published by the independent industrialist & businessmen 's association , müsiad , concluded that the basic values on which the eu is built are a " strait-jacket " for muslims .
even though erdogan 's government has more than a two-thirds majority in parliament , it says that eu skepticism must be taken seriously .
the nationalist and islamist wing of the ruling akp ensures that this mistrust is not restricted to the opposition both inside and outside the parliament .
the debate as to what other demands the eu has yet to make on turkey and how the country should react to them is only likely to really start once accession negotiations begin october 3 . susanne güsten , qantara.de -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is turkey losing its reform zeal ?

turks are increasingly critical of the country 's possible accession to the eu as euro-skeptics warn of a potential sell-out of national interests . even though opinion polls regularly show that three-quarters of turks favour their country joining the eu , increasing numbers are also becoming aware of drawbacks : brussels is going to make increasing demands on ankara and will have a bigger role in running the country .
many see this this as a threat to the turkish state .
these warnings are also being voiced in other countries that are seeking eu membership but nowhere do they touch the nerve the way they do in turkey .
while the eu - as a result of its experiences in the two world wars - is trying to supress the individual nation-state by bringing member states closer together as one , many turks consider the nation-state to be the greatest good .
" sovereignty belongs unconditionally and unreservedly to the nation " was one of the principles of atatürk , the founder of the modern turkish state , whose image hangs on the end wall of the plenary chamber in the turkish parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recep tayyip erdogan und abdullah gül have been accused of compromising over cyprus a foreign toy ?
turkey arose out of the ruins of the ottoman empire , which was occupied by the allied victors of world war i , in the 1920s .
in a war that involved heavy losses , atatürk succeeded in driving the greek occupying powers - in west anatolia in particular - out of the country .
in the early years of the republic , turks feared that the country would be carved up and become a plaything of foreign powers .
as a result , it is unsurprising that nationalists are claiming that turkish membership in the european union would ultimately only benefit europeans , not turks .
and they point to to the conflict over cyprus as evidence . the cypress conflict turkey 's euro-skeptics criticize every step taken by the government of prime minister recep tayyip erdogan regarding cypress : he hints that he is willing to make compromises in the search for a peaceful solution for the divided mediterranean island .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a close ally of turkish membership the fact that erdogan 's government is " selling " cyprus in order to show the eu how obedient tukrkey is , is an image often peddled by the right-wing nationalist mhp party .
but concern over the fate of the turkish state in the upcoming membership negotiations with the eu is not only an issue for turkey 's right wing .
drawing attention to supposed threats to turkey from outside its national borders is also part of the repertoire of the social democratic opposition party chp .
the chp recently and successfully challenged a law governing the sale of land and buildings to foreigners through the constitutional court .
the chp is part of turkey 's lay kemalist establishment that considers all deviations from atatürk 's course to be wrong .
because of this , kemalists have terrible difficulty accepting some of the european union 's key demands .
they even have trouble opening turkey up to foreign investors – a fact demonstrated by more than just the fate of the real estate law .
president ahmet necdet sezer , a leading kemalist , recently vetoed a law that would have allowed foreigners to buy television stations in turkey .
the president explained that he had taken this action because a law of this sort would not have been in the " national interest " .
sensitive minority policy if ground-breaking economic policies such as this are viewed with such suspicion , it is no wonder that the resistance to more sensitive issues , such as policies on minorities , is even more fierce .
the alleged attempts of young kurds to burn a turkish flag triggered nationalist hysteria across the country over the past few weeks .
tens of thousands demonstratively draped their homes with turkish flags while the turkish police marched through istanbul bearing a 1.5-kilometre long flag .
meanwhile , both the nationalists and kemalists are being joined by a growing number of turkish islamists who are also sceptical about their country 's eu application .
over the past few years , turkey 's islamists has accounted for some of the country 's greatest europhiles because they hoped that moving closer to the eu would bring more freedom of religion .
but the introduction of headscarf bans in several eu states and other similar developments have dashed these hopes .
a recent report published by the independent industrialist & businessmen 's association , müsiad , concluded that the basic values on which the eu is built are a " strait-jacket " for muslims .
even though erdogan 's government has more than a two-thirds majority in parliament , it says that eu skepticism must be taken seriously .
the nationalist and islamist wing of the ruling akp ensures that this mistrust is not restricted to the opposition both inside and outside the parliament .
the debate as to what other demands the eu has yet to make on turkey and how the country should react to them is only likely to really start once accession negotiations begin october 3 . susanne güsten , qantara.de -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is turkey losing its reform zeal ?

bayern and stuttgart start a stretch of test matches before a final clash in stuttgart . after last weekend 's disastrous 3-0 defeat in stuttgart , the mood in schalke turned for the worse .
before , there was talk of winning the title .
now they are thinking differently .
coach ralf rangnick said in kicker magazine that the most important task " is securing a spot in the champions league . "
that means finishing second in the bundesliga for automatic qualification .
the schedule , however , is against them heading down the home stretch .
in their last six matches , they face four teams with international aspirations .
this week , sixth place hamburg are in town .
coach thomas doll 's club has fallen on hard times of late .
at the beginning of the second half of the season , hamburg sprang to the top third of the standings but luck has not been on their side recently and they 've collected only one point in their last three games .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's coach ralf rangnick has had reason to frown in the bundesliga the past few weeks schalke are by no means out of the title race , but it may be stuttgart who may make the race tight for bayern munich .
they will need help from other teams though .
on 54 points , they lie five back of bayern .
yet their schedule , like bayern 's , is filled with mediocre opponents .
this saturday , the hardest adversary just may be the long bus ride to rostock on the baltic sea .
stuttgart 's markus babbel warned in sport-bild magazine that 17th place rostock , fighting for their lives against relegation , can not be taken lightly .
" we ca n't allow a loss like that of schalke against mainz . "
stuttgart are playing juggernaut-like and silently have thoughts of winning the championship .
if the cards fall right , this could happen .
in the final game of the season , matthias sammer 's team comes up against bayern .

coach felix magath bemoaned the bad luck of the bavarians against the premiereship side .
star defender lucio deflected two balls into his own net in the two fixtures with chelsea but bayern are three points in front of second place schalke and are also in the semifinals of the league cup , " so things are n't that bad , " said magath .
their opponents , hanover , could sing a similar tune .
not because they are mixing it up at the top of the table .
more because they have stamped their ticket for the first division for next season .
hanover have taken a beating against bayern in the past , letting in 87 goals in their 31 meetings .
what speaks for ewald lienen 's club is the fact that this game is in hanover .
the only five matches they have bettered munich have taken place at home .

from the edge of the midfield circle , the colorful brazilian launched a lob over keeper richard golz who had wandered too far off his line .
the ball flew over the flailing golz and landed in the net .

bayern and stuttgart start a stretch of test matches before a final clash in stuttgart . after last weekend 's disastrous 3-0 defeat in stuttgart , the mood in schalke turned for the worse .
before , there was talk of winning the title .
now they are thinking differently .
coach ralf rangnick said in kicker magazine that the most important task " is securing a spot in the champions league . "
that means finishing second in the bundesliga for automatic qualification .
the schedule , however , is against them heading down the home stretch .
in their last six matches , they face four teams with international aspirations .
this week , sixth place hamburg are in town .
coach thomas doll 's club has fallen on hard times of late .
at the beginning of the second half of the season , hamburg sprang to the top third of the standings but luck has not been on their side recently and they 've collected only one point in their last three games .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's coach ralf rangnick has had reason to frown in the bundesliga the past few weeks schalke are by no means out of the title race , but it may be stuttgart who may make the race tight for bayern munich .
they will need help from other teams though .
on 54 points , they lie five back of bayern .
yet their schedule , like bayern 's , is filled with mediocre opponents .
this saturday , the hardest adversary just may be the long bus ride to rostock on the baltic sea .
stuttgart 's markus babbel warned in sport-bild magazine that 17th place rostock , fighting for their lives against relegation , can not be taken lightly .
" we ca n't allow a loss like that of schalke against mainz . "
stuttgart are playing juggernaut-like and silently have thoughts of winning the championship .

coach felix magath bemoaned the bad luck of the bavarians against the premiereship side .
star defender lucio deflected two balls into his own net in the two fixtures with chelsea but bayern are three points in front of second place schalke and are also in the semifinals of the league cup , " so things are n't that bad , " said magath .
their opponents , hanover , could sing a similar tune .
not because they are mixing it up at the top of the table .
more because they have stamped their ticket for the first division for next season .
hanover have taken a beating against bayern in the past , letting in 87 goals in their 31 meetings .
what speaks for ewald lienen 's club is the fact that this game is in hanover .
the only five matches they have bettered munich have taken place at home .

from the edge of the midfield circle , the colorful brazilian launched a lob over keeper richard golz who had wandered too far off his line .
the ball flew over the flailing golz and landed in the net .

the conservative cardinal , in charge of defending church doctrine , is considered a frontrunner . la repubblica and corriere della sera , both respected italian dailies with close contacts with the vatican , say two powerful german cardinals , karl lehmann of mainz and walter kasper , who is based in rome , have lined up against their fellow german who has been the catholic church 's controversial doctrinal watchdog . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal lehmann both lehmann and kasper have had public differences with ratzinger in the past . american cardinals have also expressed reservations about a possible ratzinger pontificate , according to la repubblica .
the paper reported that american and german cardinals are worried about ratzinger 's apparent lack of interest in matters of administration . german cardinals also have taken issue with ratzinger 's opposition to allowing lay theologians to take a leading roll in parishes that lack priests , a serious problem in germany .
the paper also said the ratzinger , the one-time archbishop of munich , had failed to address the issue of not allowing catholics who had divorced and remarried to receive communion . martini - the moderates ' man the milan-based corriere della sera reported that opponents to ratzinger were lining up behind 78-year-old carlo maria martini , who was a favorite of moderates until he resigned as milan 's archbishop in 2002 .
martini , a leading advocate of church reform , serves as a counterweight to the traditionalist ratzinger . bildunterschrift : carlo maria martini martini , however , is not in good health and has indicated he does not want the church 's top job .
but a strong showing for him in the first round of voting is seen as having primarily symbolic value that could show the strength of moderate cardinals and rally support behind a candidate more to their liking . vatican watchers say the first voting rounds are often considered formalities , which gauge the strengths of various camps .
a voting conclave can last for several days and often produces surprising results , as did the one in 1978 which elected poland 's karol wojtyla . however , since many of the bishops in the conclave were appointed by john paul ii , himself a conservative , the traditionalist camp is strong .
italian newspapers reported that between 40 and 50 cardinals had signalled their support for ratzinger in private meetings this week . that number , though , is short of the two-thirds majority , 77 out of 115 votes , needed to win .
vatican watchers say many of the cardinals who will go into the conclave on monday are still undecided . " ratzinger is looking strong , but it 's still far from clear who will emerge and how the voting will go , " one church official , who requested anonymity , told reuters . book published cardinal ratzinger , who turns 78 on saturday , published a book on wednesday in germany which argues that europe must retain its christian heritage .
it is not clear what kind of effect the book will have on the election , although open campaigning for the papacy is generally frowned upon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph ratzinger , as catholic prefect of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith in the book , he reiterated his conservative views , criticizing the collapse of traditional families and attacking the drive toward gay marriage , saying it was a trend in which " the entire moral history of mankind is being left behind . " he said europe had become " empty inside " and was " dependent on transplants , " referring to the continent 's low birth rate and the need for immigrant labor . although some questioned the timing of the book 's publication , it does not appear to have broken the agreement among cardinals not to talk to the media during the pre-conclave period since the book was likely written before the death of john paul ii . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de could a bavarian become pope ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.04.2005 opposition mounting to ratzinger as pope großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ratzinger has the blessing of some cardinals , but not all according to italian media , american and german cardinals have lined up against a possible papacy of joseph ratzinger .
the conservative cardinal , in charge of defending church doctrine , is considered a frontrunner . la repubblica and corriere della sera , both respected italian dailies with close contacts with the vatican , say two powerful german cardinals , karl lehmann of mainz and walter kasper , who is based in rome , have lined up against their fellow german who has been the catholic church 's controversial doctrinal watchdog . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal lehmann both lehmann and kasper have had public differences with ratzinger in the past . american cardinals have also expressed reservations about a possible ratzinger pontificate , according to la repubblica .
the paper reported that american and german cardinals are worried about ratzinger 's apparent lack of interest in matters of administration . german cardinals also have taken issue with ratzinger 's opposition to allowing lay theologians to take a leading roll in parishes that lack priests , a serious problem in germany .
the paper also said the ratzinger , the one-time archbishop of munich , had failed to address the issue of not allowing catholics who had divorced and remarried to receive communion . martini - the moderates ' man the milan-based corriere della sera reported that opponents to ratzinger were lining up behind 78-year-old carlo maria martini , who was a favorite of moderates until he resigned as milan 's archbishop in 2002 .
martini , a leading advocate of church reform , serves as a counterweight to the traditionalist ratzinger . bildunterschrift : carlo maria martini martini , however , is not in good health and has indicated he does not want the church 's top job .
but a strong showing for him in the first round of voting is seen as having primarily symbolic value that could show the strength of moderate cardinals and rally support behind a candidate more to their liking . vatican watchers say the first voting rounds are often considered formalities , which gauge the strengths of various camps .
a voting conclave can last for several days and often produces surprising results , as did the one in 1978 which elected poland 's karol wojtyla . however , since many of the bishops in the conclave were appointed by john paul ii , himself a conservative , the traditionalist camp is strong .
italian newspapers reported that between 40 and 50 cardinals had signalled their support for ratzinger in private meetings this week . that number , though , is short of the two-thirds majority , 77 out of 115 votes , needed to win .
vatican watchers say many of the cardinals who will go into the conclave on monday are still undecided .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.04.2005 teaching religion the european way großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe still looks to the church for spiritual and moral values as the bundestag discusses introducing compulsory religion and ethics classes , dw-world takes a look at how the topic is dealt with across europe . " every type of religion class comes with its own version of history , " explained peter schreiner , president of the intereuropean commission for church and school -lrb- iccs -rrb- .
" you can make comparisons , but there wo n't ever be a pan-european approach . " for now , he pointed out , each country decides itself how to organize classes , develop the syllabus and select teaching materials , train teachers - as well as providing options for students unwilling to attend religion classes . the way the topic of religion is treated varies widely across the continent .
in southern and eastern europe , finland , italy , austria and germany , religion classes are divided according to denomination . in other countries , including belgium , luxembourg , portugal and spain , students can opt for non-denominational alternatives , such as ethics , philosophy or values classes . germany and austria compulsory religion classes across germany 's states is a principle enshrined in the german constitution or ' grundgesetz ' , with one small opt-out clause , known as the " bremer clause " for certain states with a different legal status .
bremen and berlin , for example , are not governed by the legal obligation to provide religious education , as legislation already in existence when the ' grundgesetz ' was drawn up in 1949 takes precedence .
instead , these states offer ' biblical history ' and a discipline known as ler - ' life , ethics and religion . '
berlin , moreover , is the only german state where religion classes are the responsibility of the church rather than the state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in austria , students ca n't complain of lack of choice , with catholic , protestant , orthodox , new apostolic , jewish , islam and budhist classes available .
religion , whichever it is , is a compulsory subject in schools , while an alternative , non-denominational option has been also been available since 1997 . italy and greece catholic classes , not surprisingly , are a guaranteed fixture of the italian education system .
available to children from all backgrounds , religion became a voluntary subject in 1984 . other classes are also provided , but need to be paid for privately if sufficient pupils express interest .
alternatively , students can attend ' civic and human rights ' classes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek-orthodox priests before an easter baptism ceremony , river jordan , israel greece takes the opposite approach . here , orthodox classes are compulsory , regardless of personal faith . learning about religion in northern europe , england , wales and scotland , pupils can take religion - or a class in which they learn about the world 's different religions . " classes about religion belong to schools ' educational duties , rather than religious education per se , " observed friedrich schweitzer , theology professor at tübingen university . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : local education authorities in england and wales develop a syllabus together with the anglican church and representatives from other religious communities , although the emphasis is firmly on christianity .
even so , since 1994 , muslims , hindus , sikhs , jews and budhists have been encouraged to help contribute to the syllabus . ingun arnold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de row erupts over ethics and religion ruling conservative politicians in germany are up in arms over the decision made by the ruling spd-green government to make lessons in ethics and religion compulsory in berlin .

in southern and eastern europe , finland , italy , austria and germany , religion classes are divided according to denomination . in other countries , including belgium , luxembourg , portugal and spain , students can opt for non-denominational alternatives , such as ethics , philosophy or values classes . germany and austria compulsory religion classes across germany 's states is a principle enshrined in the german constitution or ' grundgesetz ' , with one small opt-out clause , known as the " bremer clause " for certain states with a different legal status .
bremen and berlin , for example , are not governed by the legal obligation to provide religious education , as legislation already in existence when the ' grundgesetz ' was drawn up in 1949 takes precedence .

schröder said after talks with south korean president roh moo-hyun that every country must find its own way to deal with the glories and shame in its history .
but , without mentioning japan by name , he said germany had learned " that one does not lose friends with a sensitive and self-critical approach to one 's own history but rather wins them " .
roh contrasted the post-world war ii reconciliation between germany and france with his country 's lingering tensions with japan , in a german newspaper interview last week before his arrival in berlin .
he told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung that " germany had succeeded in healing the wounds of the war , had overcome them and then moved on to integrate itself into europe . "

work-life balance gets boost in germany encouraging germans to have more kids the dumbing down of germany study : men in germany are scared to start families current affairs -pipe- 14.04.2005 gerd 's family policy gets down to business großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor wants to see more germans starting families by 2020 , germany will have europe 's lowest percentage of young people .
wednesday 's conference on family policy took a close look at the economic repercussions of the declining birth rate . as germany struggles to maintain the viability of its state pension scheme amid an imminent demographic crunch caused by falling birth rates and an ageing population , chancellor gerhard schröder on wednesday renewed his commitment to encouraging families to have children and outlined new initiatives which would provide financial and job benefits to working germans who decide to start a family or expand an existing one . children are our future , " said chancellor gerhard schröder at the conference called " family - success factor for the economy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " they are our future workforce , consumers and parents .
our future , our pensions and the economic strength of our country , rests in the hands of our children . " the family challenge the number of children born in germany has fallen a dramatic 50 per cent from 1.4 million in 1964 to just 700,000 in 2005 .
as the country 's unemployment figures continue to swell , to many , the prospect of raising a family seems just too challenging .
given the nation 's nagging economic woes , women in particular see the difficulty of combining child-rearing and career as too much of a deterrent . it 's a trend germany ca n't afford to let develop . " creating good conditions for families became an economic issue a long time ago , " said schröder .
a reduced younger generation means a declining workforce , lack of innovation and ever fewer consumers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we can not allow a woman to decide against having children because she 's reluctant to have to choose between having a child or having a career , " stressed schröder .
" we can not allow a family on a normal income to decide against another child for financial reasons . in future , family policy has to create conditions which enable more people to have children . " benefits for both sides in 2003 , the government joined forces with business to form the alliance for family policy , which aimed to develop improved work-family reconciliation policies . but despite the government 's efforts to provide day care and tax relief for families , germany is still short of some 1.2 million nursery places for children under three .
schröder pledged once again to increase day care for working families . " flexible working hours and family-friendly employment policies are good , because both sides reap benefits , " he insisted . throwing out the three-year job guarantee he also said industry should do more to support employees with children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but president of the german employers association , dieter hundt , pointed out that two thirds of all firms already offer their employees flexible schedules and that business should n't be blamed for the problem .
he contended that it was the state which has to reform its policies regarding families . for now , mothers are allowed to take up to six months of paid maternity leave and unpaid leave of up to three years . " something needs to change " " as far as employers are concerned , we need to take a new look at reducing parental leave , " said hundt .
" so far , our relatively generous family support of € 150 billion has led to neither higher birth rates nor improved integration of parents within the labor market .
something needs to change . " hundt believes that parents need to return to the work faster than is currently the norm , because the german economy simply ca n't afford to forfeit qualified workers with know-how . the government largely agrees .
its latest proposal , outlined at the conference by minister for family affairs renate schmidt , would introduce a sliding scale benefit scheme dependent on income . but as schröder said wednesday , the issue is by no means purely financial .
" parents need more infrastructures , not just more money , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de work-life balance gets boost in germany in germany , where kids are seen as career killers , over 40 percent of highly qualified women choose to remain childless .

the conservative cardinal , in charge of defending church doctrine , is considered a frontrunner . la repubblica and corriere della sera , both respected italian dailies with close contacts with the vatican , say two powerful german cardinals , karl lehmann of mainz and walter kasper , who is based in rome , have lined up against their fellow german who has been the catholic church 's controversial doctrinal watchdog . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal lehmann both lehmann and kasper have had public differences with ratzinger in the past . american cardinals have also expressed reservations about a possible ratzinger pontificate , according to la repubblica .
the paper reported that american and german cardinals are worried about ratzinger 's apparent lack of interest in matters of administration . german cardinals also have taken issue with ratzinger 's opposition to allowing lay theologians to take a leading roll in parishes that lack priests , a serious problem in germany .
the paper also said the ratzinger , the one-time archbishop of munich , had failed to address the issue of not allowing catholics who had divorced and remarried to receive communion . martini - the moderates ' man the milan-based corriere della sera reported that opponents to ratzinger were lining up behind 78-year-old carlo maria martini , who was a favorite of moderates until he resigned as milan 's archbishop in 2002 .
martini , a leading advocate of church reform , serves as a counterweight to the traditionalist ratzinger . bildunterschrift : carlo maria martini martini , however , is not in good health and has indicated he does not want the church 's top job .
but a strong showing for him in the first round of voting is seen as having primarily symbolic value that could show the strength of moderate cardinals and rally support behind a candidate more to their liking . vatican watchers say the first voting rounds are often considered formalities , which gauge the strengths of various camps .
a voting conclave can last for several days and often produces surprising results , as did the one in 1978 which elected poland 's karol wojtyla . however , since many of the bishops in the conclave were appointed by john paul ii , himself a conservative , the traditionalist camp is strong .
italian newspapers reported that between 40 and 50 cardinals had signalled their support for ratzinger in private meetings this week . that number , though , is short of the two-thirds majority , 77 out of 115 votes , needed to win .
vatican watchers say many of the cardinals who will go into the conclave on monday are still undecided . " ratzinger is looking strong , but it 's still far from clear who will emerge and how the voting will go , " one church official , who requested anonymity , told reuters . book published cardinal ratzinger , who turns 78 on saturday , published a book on wednesday in germany which argues that europe must retain its christian heritage .
it is not clear what kind of effect the book will have on the election , although open campaigning for the papacy is generally frowned upon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph ratzinger , as catholic prefect of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith in the book , he reiterated his conservative views , criticizing the collapse of traditional families and attacking the drive toward gay marriage , saying it was a trend in which " the entire moral history of mankind is being left behind . " he said europe had become " empty inside " and was " dependent on transplants , " referring to the continent 's low birth rate and the need for immigrant labor . although some questioned the timing of the book 's publication , it does not appear to have broken the agreement among cardinals not to talk to the media during the pre-conclave period since the book was likely written before the death of john paul ii . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de could a bavarian become pope ?

the conservative cardinal , in charge of defending church doctrine , is considered a frontrunner . la repubblica and corriere della sera , both respected italian dailies with close contacts with the vatican , say two powerful german cardinals , karl lehmann of mainz and walter kasper , who is based in rome , have lined up against their fellow german who has been the catholic church 's controversial doctrinal watchdog . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal lehmann both lehmann and kasper have had public differences with ratzinger in the past . american cardinals have also expressed reservations about a possible ratzinger pontificate , according to la repubblica .
the paper reported that american and german cardinals are worried about ratzinger 's apparent lack of interest in matters of administration . german cardinals also have taken issue with ratzinger 's opposition to allowing lay theologians to take a leading roll in parishes that lack priests , a serious problem in germany .
the paper also said the ratzinger , the one-time archbishop of munich , had failed to address the issue of not allowing catholics who had divorced and remarried to receive communion . martini - the moderates ' man the milan-based corriere della sera reported that opponents to ratzinger were lining up behind 78-year-old carlo maria martini , who was a favorite of moderates until he resigned as milan 's archbishop in 2002 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 14.04.2005 back to belief in german schools großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian education has made a comeback in germany last week 's emotional outpouring following the pope 's death has sparked excited calls from the faithful that christianity is back ' in ' .
a trend towards christian schooling in germany might just substantiate that belief . it 's a fact that both catholic and evangelical schools in germany are flourishing .
there are almost 2,000 christian schools scattered across the country and an increasing number of children waiting patiently to be given one of the highly coveted places .
demand far outstrips supply and progressive parents are taking it upon themselves to found a new generation of denominational schools .
but is the upturn really a reflection of a born-again faith ? the answer is no , at least not exclusively .
in fact it seems to have more to do with a belief in a better education than a belief in god .
jürgen frank , head of education for the evangelical church of germany says there are three main reasons for the recent rise in enthusiasm for christian schooling . " firstly , families are generally smaller and parents want to provide their children with a good education .
secondly , they want the education their children receive to meet their individual needs , and thirdly they want a progressive , modern education system , " he said . popular values ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from incense to wine , catholic children have a lot to learn andreas verhülsdonk , an expert on religious education in the catholic church , says that parents are drawn to catholicism because they know their children will be taught values and morality . " we run a project called " compassion " in which pupils spend three weeks with homeless or sick people , " he said .
" the point is not just to help the needy but to give the children the chance to see the world through the eyes of people living on the fringes of society .

a trend towards christian schooling in germany might just substantiate that belief . it 's a fact that both catholic and evangelical schools in germany are flourishing .
there are almost 2,000 christian schools scattered across the country and an increasing number of children waiting patiently to be given one of the highly coveted places .

but is the upturn really a reflection of a born-again faith ? the answer is no , at least not exclusively .
in fact it seems to have more to do with a belief in a better education than a belief in god .
jürgen frank , head of education for the evangelical church of germany says there are three main reasons for the recent rise in enthusiasm for christian schooling . " firstly , families are generally smaller and parents want to provide their children with a good education .
secondly , they want the education their children receive to meet their individual needs , and thirdly they want a progressive , modern education system , " he said . popular values ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from incense to wine , catholic children have a lot to learn andreas verhülsdonk , an expert on religious education in the catholic church , says that parents are drawn to catholicism because they know their children will be taught values and morality .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.04.2005 teaching religion the european way großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe still looks to the church for spiritual and moral values as the bundestag discusses introducing compulsory religion and ethics classes , dw-world takes a look at how the topic is dealt with across europe . " every type of religion class comes with its own version of history , " explained peter schreiner , president of the intereuropean commission for church and school -lrb- iccs -rrb- .
" you can make comparisons , but there wo n't ever be a pan-european approach . " for now , he pointed out , each country decides itself how to organize classes , develop the syllabus and select teaching materials , train teachers - as well as providing options for students unwilling to attend religion classes . the way the topic of religion is treated varies widely across the continent .
in southern and eastern europe , finland , italy , austria and germany , religion classes are divided according to denomination . in other countries , including belgium , luxembourg , portugal and spain , students can opt for non-denominational alternatives , such as ethics , philosophy or values classes . germany and austria compulsory religion classes across germany 's states is a principle enshrined in the german constitution or ' grundgesetz ' , with one small opt-out clause , known as the " bremer clause " for certain states with a different legal status .
bremen and berlin , for example , are not governed by the legal obligation to provide religious education , as legislation already in existence when the ' grundgesetz ' was drawn up in 1949 takes precedence .
instead , these states offer ' biblical history ' and a discipline known as ler - ' life , ethics and religion . '
berlin , moreover , is the only german state where religion classes are the responsibility of the church rather than the state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in austria , students ca n't complain of lack of choice , with catholic , protestant , orthodox , new apostolic , jewish , islam and budhist classes available .
religion , whichever it is , is a compulsory subject in schools , while an alternative , non-denominational option has been also been available since 1997 . italy and greece catholic classes , not surprisingly , are a guaranteed fixture of the italian education system .
available to children from all backgrounds , religion became a voluntary subject in 1984 . other classes are also provided , but need to be paid for privately if sufficient pupils express interest .
alternatively , students can attend ' civic and human rights ' classes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek-orthodox priests before an easter baptism ceremony , river jordan , israel greece takes the opposite approach . here , orthodox classes are compulsory , regardless of personal faith . learning about religion in northern europe , england , wales and scotland , pupils can take religion - or a class in which they learn about the world 's different religions . " classes about religion belong to schools ' educational duties , rather than religious education per se , " observed friedrich schweitzer , theology professor at tübingen university . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : local education authorities in england and wales develop a syllabus together with the anglican church and representatives from other religious communities , although the emphasis is firmly on christianity .
even so , since 1994 , muslims , hindus , sikhs , jews and budhists have been encouraged to help contribute to the syllabus . ingun arnold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de row erupts over ethics and religion ruling conservative politicians in germany are up in arms over the decision made by the ruling spd-green government to make lessons in ethics and religion compulsory in berlin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.04.2005 teaching religion the european way großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe still looks to the church for spiritual and moral values as the bundestag discusses introducing compulsory religion and ethics classes , dw-world takes a look at how the topic is dealt with across europe . " every type of religion class comes with its own version of history , " explained peter schreiner , president of the intereuropean commission for church and school -lrb- iccs -rrb- .
" you can make comparisons , but there wo n't ever be a pan-european approach . " for now , he pointed out , each country decides itself how to organize classes , develop the syllabus and select teaching materials , train teachers - as well as providing options for students unwilling to attend religion classes . the way the topic of religion is treated varies widely across the continent .
in southern and eastern europe , finland , italy , austria and germany , religion classes are divided according to denomination . in other countries , including belgium , luxembourg , portugal and spain , students can opt for non-denominational alternatives , such as ethics , philosophy or values classes . germany and austria compulsory religion classes across germany 's states is a principle enshrined in the german constitution or ' grundgesetz ' , with one small opt-out clause , known as the " bremer clause " for certain states with a different legal status .
bremen and berlin , for example , are not governed by the legal obligation to provide religious education , as legislation already in existence when the ' grundgesetz ' was drawn up in 1949 takes precedence .
instead , these states offer ' biblical history ' and a discipline known as ler - ' life , ethics and religion . '
berlin , moreover , is the only german state where religion classes are the responsibility of the church rather than the state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in austria , students ca n't complain of lack of choice , with catholic , protestant , orthodox , new apostolic , jewish , islam and budhist classes available .
religion , whichever it is , is a compulsory subject in schools , while an alternative , non-denominational option has been also been available since 1997 . italy and greece catholic classes , not surprisingly , are a guaranteed fixture of the italian education system .
available to children from all backgrounds , religion became a voluntary subject in 1984 . other classes are also provided , but need to be paid for privately if sufficient pupils express interest .
alternatively , students can attend ' civic and human rights ' classes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek-orthodox priests before an easter baptism ceremony , river jordan , israel greece takes the opposite approach . here , orthodox classes are compulsory , regardless of personal faith . learning about religion in northern europe , england , wales and scotland , pupils can take religion - or a class in which they learn about the world 's different religions . " classes about religion belong to schools ' educational duties , rather than religious education per se , " observed friedrich schweitzer , theology professor at tübingen university . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : local education authorities in england and wales develop a syllabus together with the anglican church and representatives from other religious communities , although the emphasis is firmly on christianity .
even so , since 1994 , muslims , hindus , sikhs , jews and budhists have been encouraged to help contribute to the syllabus . ingun arnold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de row erupts over ethics and religion ruling conservative politicians in germany are up in arms over the decision made by the ruling spd-green government to make lessons in ethics and religion compulsory in berlin .

the film , der untergang - the downfall , will now open in israeli cinemas in may . a highly acclaimed german film sometimes criticized for portraying adolf hitler in too positive a light is to be released in israel after viewers gave it positive feedback last week . the film , " the downfall , -lrb- der untergang -rrb- " which was nominated in 2004 for an oscar in the best foreign film category , depicts hitler 's final days in a berlin bunker and includes scenes in which the nazi dictator seems almost approachable . while the film has been a hit in europe since its release , it had problems finding a distributor in israel .
but last week , nurit shani , owner of the israeli cinema chain lev and film distributor shani , told reuters that she decided to show the movie after an audience of 1,000 invited to a preview last week approved of it by 91 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : presenting two sides " i expected a vote in favour of the movie , but i did n't imagine it would be so decisive , " shani told reuters .
" i know there are still many for whom it will be difficult to see the human side of hitler portrayed in a film .
but it would have been unfair to prevent a curious and interested audience that is willing to confront the painful subject in its own way from seeing the movie . " a brutal megalomaniac the jewish state gained its independence after the end of world war ii , in which six million jews were slaughtered according to hitler 's plan .
even 60 years later is no issue more sensitive to the nation .
for example , a few israeli officials boycotted a recent appearance of german president horst köhler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the film portrays hitler as a brutal megalomaniac , it also shows his more human side : a man who could show kindness to his staff , to animals and to his wife and a man who suffered from parkinson 's disease .
hitler committed suicide april 30 , 1945 in the bunker . " this is the first time i saw how they -lrb- the germans -rrb- suffered , how they struggled with themselves , how they saw their ' fuehrer ' as crazy , " simha siani , who voted for screening the film , told reuters . the film will open in three israeli cities may 19 , two weeks after the annual holocaust memorial day is observed . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german film aims to gatecrash oscar party hollywood hosts the 77th academy awards ceremony on sunday night .

a trend towards christian schooling in germany might just substantiate that belief . it 's a fact that both catholic and evangelical schools in germany are flourishing .
there are almost 2,000 christian schools scattered across the country and an increasing number of children waiting patiently to be given one of the highly coveted places .

but is the upturn really a reflection of a born-again faith ? the answer is no , at least not exclusively .
in fact it seems to have more to do with a belief in a better education than a belief in god .
jürgen frank , head of education for the evangelical church of germany says there are three main reasons for the recent rise in enthusiasm for christian schooling . " firstly , families are generally smaller and parents want to provide their children with a good education .
secondly , they want the education their children receive to meet their individual needs , and thirdly they want a progressive , modern education system , " he said . popular values ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from incense to wine , catholic children have a lot to learn andreas verhülsdonk , an expert on religious education in the catholic church , says that parents are drawn to catholicism because they know their children will be taught values and morality . " we run a project called " compassion " in which pupils spend three weeks with homeless or sick people , " he said .
" the point is not just to help the needy but to give the children the chance to see the world through the eyes of people living on the fringes of society . " but christoph hermann , who sends his son to an evangelical school in berlin says it is simply important to make christianity a part of daily life . " i would n't consider myself particularly religious , but the christian faith was a part of my upbringing and that is what i want for my son , " hermann said . " we live in an increasingly secular society and i do n't want him to grow up seeing christianity as something fundamental because he has n't been exposed to it in an everyday kind of way . " there 's more to it than just religion that , however , is not to say that denominational schools neglect reading , writing and arithmetic .
in fact they are legally bound to provide pupils with the same curricular options as state schools , with the only difference being compulsory religious education for an average of two hours each week .
hermann believes his son is getting a good deal . " christianity is helpful in learning to understand our culture and it equips children to better understand art and history as well , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young children practice their abc and that is not all .
according to frank , children at evangelical schools in germany learn to read and write better than their state school counterparts . " a study we carried out after the publication of the pisa report revealed that the educational climate at christian schools is better than in state schools , and that the quality on offer at demoninational schools genuinely does live up to its reputation , " he said . indeed , that reputation appears to have run away with the imagination of some determined and diligent parents .
since the fall of the berlin wall , the church has given its blessing to the founding of some 70 new evangelical schools and there are 50 more would-be 's waiting in the wings .
but getting such a venture off the ground is no easy feat . " we have to clear a lot of hurdles , many of them financial , before a new school can be founded , " frank said . hurdles to new beginnings new school initiatives receive a grant from the evangelical church to see them through the first three or four years until the government starts paying an annual subsistence worth some 90 percent of the regular state school budget .
but frank says church funds are running dry .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 14.04.2005 schalke 's brutal schedule continues 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke , blue , are on the ground while stuttgart are flying high schalke took an abysmal nose dive last week and find themselves three points back of first place bayern munich .
bayern and stuttgart start a stretch of test matches before a final clash in stuttgart . after last weekend 's disastrous 3-0 defeat in stuttgart , the mood in schalke turned for the worse .
before , there was talk of winning the title .
now they are thinking differently .
coach ralf rangnick said in kicker magazine that the most important task " is securing a spot in the champions league . "
that means finishing second in the bundesliga for automatic qualification .
the schedule , however , is against them heading down the home stretch .
in their last six matches , they face four teams with international aspirations .
this week , sixth place hamburg are in town .
coach thomas doll 's club has fallen on hard times of late .
at the beginning of the second half of the season , hamburg sprang to the top third of the standings but luck has not been on their side recently and they 've collected only one point in their last three games .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's coach ralf rangnick has had reason to frown in the bundesliga the past few weeks schalke are by no means out of the title race , but it may be stuttgart who may make the race tight for bayern munich .
they will need help from other teams though .
on 54 points , they lie five back of bayern .
yet their schedule , like bayern 's , is filled with mediocre opponents .
this saturday , the hardest adversary just may be the long bus ride to rostock on the baltic sea .
stuttgart 's markus babbel warned in sport-bild magazine that 17th place rostock , fighting for their lives against relegation , can not be taken lightly .
" we ca n't allow a loss like that of schalke against mainz . "
stuttgart are playing juggernaut-like and silently have thoughts of winning the championship .
if the cards fall right , this could happen .
in the final game of the season , matthias sammer 's team comes up against bayern .
champions league adieu , hello bundesliga bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's goalkeeper oliver kahn is not one to keep his emotions penned in following their ouster from the champions league at the hands of chelsea , 18-time bundesliga champion bayern munich can concentrate on the league title .
coach felix magath bemoaned the bad luck of the bavarians against the premiereship side .
star defender lucio deflected two balls into his own net in the two fixtures with chelsea but bayern are three points in front of second place schalke and are also in the semifinals of the league cup , " so things are n't that bad , " said magath .
their opponents , hanover , could sing a similar tune .
not because they are mixing it up at the top of the table .
more because they have stamped their ticket for the first division for next season .
hanover have taken a beating against bayern in the past , letting in 87 goals in their 31 meetings .
what speaks for ewald lienen 's club is the fact that this game is in hanover .
the only five matches they have bettered munich have taken place at home .
reigning champs and fourth place werder bremen -lrb- 50 points -rrb- have a big assignment when they host hertha berlin -lrb- 47 -rrb- .
bremen must do without captain and national midfielder frank baumann who went under the knife this week for a bad left ankle .
striker miroslav klose will also be sitting on the bench with a hurt knee .
a victory against northern rivals hamburg last week impressed coach thomas schaaf .
another impressive game will be needed on saturday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's marcelinho , left , after his stroke of genius from 48 meters against freiburg berlin 's midfielder marcelinho -lrb- photo -rrb- scored what was probably one of the top three goals in this bundesliga season against last place and second division bound freiburg last saturday .

bayern and stuttgart start a stretch of test matches before a final clash in stuttgart . after last weekend 's disastrous 3-0 defeat in stuttgart , the mood in schalke turned for the worse .
before , there was talk of winning the title .
now they are thinking differently .
coach ralf rangnick said in kicker magazine that the most important task " is securing a spot in the champions league . "
that means finishing second in the bundesliga for automatic qualification .
the schedule , however , is against them heading down the home stretch .
in their last six matches , they face four teams with international aspirations .
this week , sixth place hamburg are in town .
coach thomas doll 's club has fallen on hard times of late .

they will need help from other teams though .
on 54 points , they lie five back of bayern .
yet their schedule , like bayern 's , is filled with mediocre opponents .
this saturday , the hardest adversary just may be the long bus ride to rostock on the baltic sea .

" we ca n't allow a loss like that of schalke against mainz . "

star defender lucio deflected two balls into his own net in the two fixtures with chelsea but bayern are three points in front of second place schalke and are also in the semifinals of the league cup , " so things are n't that bad , " said magath .
their opponents , hanover , could sing a similar tune .
not because they are mixing it up at the top of the table .

bayern and stuttgart start a stretch of test matches before a final clash in stuttgart . after last weekend 's disastrous 3-0 defeat in stuttgart , the mood in schalke turned for the worse .
before , there was talk of winning the title .
now they are thinking differently .
coach ralf rangnick said in kicker magazine that the most important task " is securing a spot in the champions league . "
that means finishing second in the bundesliga for automatic qualification .
the schedule , however , is against them heading down the home stretch .
in their last six matches , they face four teams with international aspirations .
this week , sixth place hamburg are in town .
coach thomas doll 's club has fallen on hard times of late .
at the beginning of the second half of the season , hamburg sprang to the top third of the standings but luck has not been on their side recently and they 've collected only one point in their last three games .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's coach ralf rangnick has had reason to frown in the bundesliga the past few weeks schalke are by no means out of the title race , but it may be stuttgart who may make the race tight for bayern munich .
they will need help from other teams though .
on 54 points , they lie five back of bayern .
yet their schedule , like bayern 's , is filled with mediocre opponents .
this saturday , the hardest adversary just may be the long bus ride to rostock on the baltic sea .
stuttgart 's markus babbel warned in sport-bild magazine that 17th place rostock , fighting for their lives against relegation , can not be taken lightly .
" we ca n't allow a loss like that of schalke against mainz . "
stuttgart are playing juggernaut-like and silently have thoughts of winning the championship .
if the cards fall right , this could happen .
in the final game of the season , matthias sammer 's team comes up against bayern .
champions league adieu , hello bundesliga bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's goalkeeper oliver kahn is not one to keep his emotions penned in following their ouster from the champions league at the hands of chelsea , 18-time bundesliga champion bayern munich can concentrate on the league title .
coach felix magath bemoaned the bad luck of the bavarians against the premiereship side .
star defender lucio deflected two balls into his own net in the two fixtures with chelsea but bayern are three points in front of second place schalke and are also in the semifinals of the league cup , " so things are n't that bad , " said magath .
their opponents , hanover , could sing a similar tune .
not because they are mixing it up at the top of the table .
more because they have stamped their ticket for the first division for next season .
hanover have taken a beating against bayern in the past , letting in 87 goals in their 31 meetings .
what speaks for ewald lienen 's club is the fact that this game is in hanover .
the only five matches they have bettered munich have taken place at home .
reigning champs and fourth place werder bremen -lrb- 50 points -rrb- have a big assignment when they host hertha berlin -lrb- 47 -rrb- .
bremen must do without captain and national midfielder frank baumann who went under the knife this week for a bad left ankle .
striker miroslav klose will also be sitting on the bench with a hurt knee .
a victory against northern rivals hamburg last week impressed coach thomas schaaf .
another impressive game will be needed on saturday .

from the edge of the midfield circle , the colorful brazilian launched a lob over keeper richard golz who had wandered too far off his line .
the ball flew over the flailing golz and landed in the net .
marcelinho went on to score on a penalty kick and assisted on nico kovac 's goal in the 90th minute .

turks are increasingly critical of the country 's possible accession to the eu as euro-skeptics warn of a potential sell-out of national interests . even though opinion polls regularly show that three-quarters of turks favour their country joining the eu , increasing numbers are also becoming aware of drawbacks : brussels is going to make increasing demands on ankara and will have a bigger role in running the country .
many see this this as a threat to the turkish state .
these warnings are also being voiced in other countries that are seeking eu membership but nowhere do they touch the nerve the way they do in turkey .
while the eu - as a result of its experiences in the two world wars - is trying to supress the individual nation-state by bringing member states closer together as one , many turks consider the nation-state to be the greatest good .
" sovereignty belongs unconditionally and unreservedly to the nation " was one of the principles of atatürk , the founder of the modern turkish state , whose image hangs on the end wall of the plenary chamber in the turkish parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recep tayyip erdogan und abdullah gül have been accused of compromising over cyprus a foreign toy ?
turkey arose out of the ruins of the ottoman empire , which was occupied by the allied victors of world war i , in the 1920s .
in a war that involved heavy losses , atatürk succeeded in driving the greek occupying powers - in west anatolia in particular - out of the country .
in the early years of the republic , turks feared that the country would be carved up and become a plaything of foreign powers .
as a result , it is unsurprising that nationalists are claiming that turkish membership in the european union would ultimately only benefit europeans , not turks .
and they point to to the conflict over cyprus as evidence . the cypress conflict turkey 's euro-skeptics criticize every step taken by the government of prime minister recep tayyip erdogan regarding cypress : he hints that he is willing to make compromises in the search for a peaceful solution for the divided mediterranean island .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a close ally of turkish membership the fact that erdogan 's government is " selling " cyprus in order to show the eu how obedient tukrkey is , is an image often peddled by the right-wing nationalist mhp party .
but concern over the fate of the turkish state in the upcoming membership negotiations with the eu is not only an issue for turkey 's right wing .
drawing attention to supposed threats to turkey from outside its national borders is also part of the repertoire of the social democratic opposition party chp .
the chp recently and successfully challenged a law governing the sale of land and buildings to foreigners through the constitutional court .
the chp is part of turkey 's lay kemalist establishment that considers all deviations from atatürk 's course to be wrong .
because of this , kemalists have terrible difficulty accepting some of the european union 's key demands .
they even have trouble opening turkey up to foreign investors – a fact demonstrated by more than just the fate of the real estate law .
president ahmet necdet sezer , a leading kemalist , recently vetoed a law that would have allowed foreigners to buy television stations in turkey .
the president explained that he had taken this action because a law of this sort would not have been in the " national interest " .
sensitive minority policy if ground-breaking economic policies such as this are viewed with such suspicion , it is no wonder that the resistance to more sensitive issues , such as policies on minorities , is even more fierce .
the alleged attempts of young kurds to burn a turkish flag triggered nationalist hysteria across the country over the past few weeks .
tens of thousands demonstratively draped their homes with turkish flags while the turkish police marched through istanbul bearing a 1.5-kilometre long flag .
meanwhile , both the nationalists and kemalists are being joined by a growing number of turkish islamists who are also sceptical about their country 's eu application .
over the past few years , turkey 's islamists has accounted for some of the country 's greatest europhiles because they hoped that moving closer to the eu would bring more freedom of religion .
but the introduction of headscarf bans in several eu states and other similar developments have dashed these hopes .
a recent report published by the independent industrialist & businessmen 's association , müsiad , concluded that the basic values on which the eu is built are a " strait-jacket " for muslims .
even though erdogan 's government has more than a two-thirds majority in parliament , it says that eu skepticism must be taken seriously .
the nationalist and islamist wing of the ruling akp ensures that this mistrust is not restricted to the opposition both inside and outside the parliament .

that could soon change . on time magazine 's list of the top 100 people who have influenced the world in the past year , three germans are present .
they are n't perhaps who you 'd think .
chancellor gerhard schröder does n't get a mention , nor does foreign minister joschka fischer or any of the country 's ceos or top scientists . instead , formula one driver michael schumacher made the grade , as did cardinal ratzinger , the man some believe could become the next pope .
the third german was cornelia funke , the best-selling author of children 's books whose fantasy-filled stories are enchanting readers around the world . with a sigh he sat down behind his desk .
then , behind the door , someone whispered .
they 're probably admiring my sign , thought victor .
it was black and shiny and had gold lettering : " victor getz , detective .
investigations of any kind . "
the door knocker next to the sign was in the shape of a lion 's head with a brass ring in its mouth , which victor has just polished this morning . victor getz does n't know it yet , but on this very morning he will set out in search of two street children , prosper and bo , and perhaps while he 's at it , he will find himself .
victor is one of the central characters in cornelia funke 's book " the thief lord . " complex characters , page-turner plots her characters are often not the nicest folks .
they 're often grumpy , shifty , timid , complicated and cunning - always three dimensional and without exception , loveable .
in funke 's fantastical stories , the figures move through refreshingly unpredictable plots , which are always immensely entertaining for readers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " inkheart " " i like to show children things that i myself find incredibly wonderful , for example , venice , " she said .
" of course other things creep in that occupy one 's mind , like the unbelievable lack of compassion that exists so often between humans and animals , or humans and humans .
but i always try to bind it all in the story .
the story comes first . " the former book illustrator began writing her own books 15 years ago ; most have been bestsellers .
but her phenomenal success has been so quiet that most germans have n't yet noticed this new global writer in their midst .
it 's mostly parents for whom the name " cornelia funke " has taken on special meaning , since it so often pops up in the juvenile section of libraries or on the wish lists of their children . magical but sophisticated us-based time magazine has been more alert to her talent than her compatriots since it awarded her a place in the magazine 's top 100 list . " she has become truly international and everyone who discovers her books really loves them , " said adi ignacius , time 's executive editor .
" they just find them to be very , you know , magical and enchanting and also sophisticated . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 46-year-old has sold more than three million books in her career , winning several prestigious awards in the process .
her most well-known works , " the thief lord , " dragonrider " and " inkheart " have been translated into 20 languages .
" the thief lord " has been made into a film and will hit german cinemas this fall .
big-screen productions of " inkheart " and the girl 's series " wilde hühner " -lrb- wild chickens -rrb- are also being planned . " it 's true that right now i 'm reaching millions of children .
but i 'm not very optimistic what kind of influence i have , " funke said .
" but if it means that children in for example america are told stories by a european , then that 's something at least . " prolific author in the uk especially , funke is often described as the german response to j.k. rowling , the british superstar author of the harry potter series .
rowling , who is nine years younger than funke , is now working on her sixth harry potter book .
funke , on the other hand , has written more than 40 books in 15 years .
one of her most successful , " inkheart , " is an homage to reading and the power of the written word . on that night - when so much began and so much changed forever - one of meggie 's favorite books lay under her pillow and since the rain was n't letting her sleep , she sat up , rubbed her eyes and pulled the book out .
the page rustled promisingly as she opened it .
meggie thought that this first sound of pages was different in every book , depending on if she already knew what it was going to tell her or not . seemingly unmoved by her many literary awards and the time magazine list , cornelia funke simply goes on doing what she does best - write .
right now she 's working on a sequel to " inkheart " called " inkblood . "
like her colleague j.k. rowling on the other side of the channel , she will continue with each new book to turn both children and adults alike back to the pleasures of reading .
and that , really , is her goal . ingrid lommer -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the reluctance to read the literary world has its eyes on frankfurt this week during the world 's largest book fair .

reading is on its way out .
sounds sad ?
it is , but if psychologists are to be believed , it 's just a temporary phenomenon .

they are n't perhaps who you 'd think .
chancellor gerhard schröder does n't get a mention , nor does foreign minister joschka fischer or any of the country 's ceos or top scientists . instead , formula one driver michael schumacher made the grade , as did cardinal ratzinger , the man some believe could become the next pope .

then , behind the door , someone whispered .
they 're probably admiring my sign , thought victor .
it was black and shiny and had gold lettering : " victor getz , detective .
investigations of any kind . "
the door knocker next to the sign was in the shape of a lion 's head with a brass ring in its mouth , which victor has just polished this morning . victor getz does n't know it yet , but on this very morning he will set out in search of two street children , prosper and bo , and perhaps while he 's at it , he will find himself .
victor is one of the central characters in cornelia funke 's book " the thief lord . " complex characters , page-turner plots her characters are often not the nicest folks .

rowling , who is nine years younger than funke , is now working on her sixth harry potter book .
funke , on the other hand , has written more than 40 books in 15 years .
one of her most successful , " inkheart , " is an homage to reading and the power of the written word . on that night - when so much began and so much changed forever - one of meggie 's favorite books lay under her pillow and since the rain was n't letting her sleep , she sat up , rubbed her eyes and pulled the book out .

turks are increasingly critical of the country 's possible accession to the eu as euro-skeptics warn of a potential sell-out of national interests . even though opinion polls regularly show that three-quarters of turks favour their country joining the eu , increasing numbers are also becoming aware of drawbacks : brussels is going to make increasing demands on ankara and will have a bigger role in running the country .
many see this this as a threat to the turkish state .
these warnings are also being voiced in other countries that are seeking eu membership but nowhere do they touch the nerve the way they do in turkey .
while the eu - as a result of its experiences in the two world wars - is trying to supress the individual nation-state by bringing member states closer together as one , many turks consider the nation-state to be the greatest good .
" sovereignty belongs unconditionally and unreservedly to the nation " was one of the principles of atatürk , the founder of the modern turkish state , whose image hangs on the end wall of the plenary chamber in the turkish parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recep tayyip erdogan und abdullah gül have been accused of compromising over cyprus a foreign toy ?
turkey arose out of the ruins of the ottoman empire , which was occupied by the allied victors of world war i , in the 1920s .
in a war that involved heavy losses , atatürk succeeded in driving the greek occupying powers - in west anatolia in particular - out of the country .
in the early years of the republic , turks feared that the country would be carved up and become a plaything of foreign powers .
as a result , it is unsurprising that nationalists are claiming that turkish membership in the european union would ultimately only benefit europeans , not turks .
and they point to to the conflict over cyprus as evidence . the cypress conflict turkey 's euro-skeptics criticize every step taken by the government of prime minister recep tayyip erdogan regarding cypress : he hints that he is willing to make compromises in the search for a peaceful solution for the divided mediterranean island .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a close ally of turkish membership the fact that erdogan 's government is " selling " cyprus in order to show the eu how obedient tukrkey is , is an image often peddled by the right-wing nationalist mhp party .
but concern over the fate of the turkish state in the upcoming membership negotiations with the eu is not only an issue for turkey 's right wing .
drawing attention to supposed threats to turkey from outside its national borders is also part of the repertoire of the social democratic opposition party chp .
the chp recently and successfully challenged a law governing the sale of land and buildings to foreigners through the constitutional court .
the chp is part of turkey 's lay kemalist establishment that considers all deviations from atatürk 's course to be wrong .
because of this , kemalists have terrible difficulty accepting some of the european union 's key demands .
they even have trouble opening turkey up to foreign investors – a fact demonstrated by more than just the fate of the real estate law .
president ahmet necdet sezer , a leading kemalist , recently vetoed a law that would have allowed foreigners to buy television stations in turkey .
the president explained that he had taken this action because a law of this sort would not have been in the " national interest " .
sensitive minority policy if ground-breaking economic policies such as this are viewed with such suspicion , it is no wonder that the resistance to more sensitive issues , such as policies on minorities , is even more fierce .
the alleged attempts of young kurds to burn a turkish flag triggered nationalist hysteria across the country over the past few weeks .
tens of thousands demonstratively draped their homes with turkish flags while the turkish police marched through istanbul bearing a 1.5-kilometre long flag .
meanwhile , both the nationalists and kemalists are being joined by a growing number of turkish islamists who are also sceptical about their country 's eu application .
over the past few years , turkey 's islamists has accounted for some of the country 's greatest europhiles because they hoped that moving closer to the eu would bring more freedom of religion .
but the introduction of headscarf bans in several eu states and other similar developments have dashed these hopes .
a recent report published by the independent industrialist & businessmen 's association , müsiad , concluded that the basic values on which the eu is built are a " strait-jacket " for muslims .
even though erdogan 's government has more than a two-thirds majority in parliament , it says that eu skepticism must be taken seriously .
the nationalist and islamist wing of the ruling akp ensures that this mistrust is not restricted to the opposition both inside and outside the parliament .
the debate as to what other demands the eu has yet to make on turkey and how the country should react to them is only likely to really start once accession negotiations begin october 3 . susanne güsten , qantara.de -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is turkey losing its reform zeal ?

work-life balance gets boost in germany encouraging germans to have more kids the dumbing down of germany study : men in germany are scared to start families current affairs -pipe- 14.04.2005 gerd 's family policy gets down to business großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor wants to see more germans starting families by 2020 , germany will have europe 's lowest percentage of young people .
wednesday 's conference on family policy took a close look at the economic repercussions of the declining birth rate . as germany struggles to maintain the viability of its state pension scheme amid an imminent demographic crunch caused by falling birth rates and an ageing population , chancellor gerhard schröder on wednesday renewed his commitment to encouraging families to have children and outlined new initiatives which would provide financial and job benefits to working germans who decide to start a family or expand an existing one . children are our future , " said chancellor gerhard schröder at the conference called " family - success factor for the economy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " they are our future workforce , consumers and parents .
our future , our pensions and the economic strength of our country , rests in the hands of our children . " the family challenge the number of children born in germany has fallen a dramatic 50 per cent from 1.4 million in 1964 to just 700,000 in 2005 .
as the country 's unemployment figures continue to swell , to many , the prospect of raising a family seems just too challenging .
given the nation 's nagging economic woes , women in particular see the difficulty of combining child-rearing and career as too much of a deterrent . it 's a trend germany ca n't afford to let develop . " creating good conditions for families became an economic issue a long time ago , " said schröder .
a reduced younger generation means a declining workforce , lack of innovation and ever fewer consumers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we can not allow a woman to decide against having children because she 's reluctant to have to choose between having a child or having a career , " stressed schröder .
" we can not allow a family on a normal income to decide against another child for financial reasons . in future , family policy has to create conditions which enable more people to have children . " benefits for both sides in 2003 , the government joined forces with business to form the alliance for family policy , which aimed to develop improved work-family reconciliation policies . but despite the government 's efforts to provide day care and tax relief for families , germany is still short of some 1.2 million nursery places for children under three .
schröder pledged once again to increase day care for working families . " flexible working hours and family-friendly employment policies are good , because both sides reap benefits , " he insisted . throwing out the three-year job guarantee he also said industry should do more to support employees with children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but president of the german employers association , dieter hundt , pointed out that two thirds of all firms already offer their employees flexible schedules and that business should n't be blamed for the problem .

work-life balance gets boost in germany encouraging germans to have more kids the dumbing down of germany study : men in germany are scared to start families current affairs -pipe- 14.04.2005 gerd 's family policy gets down to business großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor wants to see more germans starting families by 2020 , germany will have europe 's lowest percentage of young people .
wednesday 's conference on family policy took a close look at the economic repercussions of the declining birth rate . as germany struggles to maintain the viability of its state pension scheme amid an imminent demographic crunch caused by falling birth rates and an ageing population , chancellor gerhard schröder on wednesday renewed his commitment to encouraging families to have children and outlined new initiatives which would provide financial and job benefits to working germans who decide to start a family or expand an existing one . children are our future , " said chancellor gerhard schröder at the conference called " family - success factor for the economy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " they are our future workforce , consumers and parents .
our future , our pensions and the economic strength of our country , rests in the hands of our children . " the family challenge the number of children born in germany has fallen a dramatic 50 per cent from 1.4 million in 1964 to just 700,000 in 2005 .
as the country 's unemployment figures continue to swell , to many , the prospect of raising a family seems just too challenging .
given the nation 's nagging economic woes , women in particular see the difficulty of combining child-rearing and career as too much of a deterrent . it 's a trend germany ca n't afford to let develop . " creating good conditions for families became an economic issue a long time ago , " said schröder .
a reduced younger generation means a declining workforce , lack of innovation and ever fewer consumers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we can not allow a woman to decide against having children because she 's reluctant to have to choose between having a child or having a career , " stressed schröder .
" we can not allow a family on a normal income to decide against another child for financial reasons . in future , family policy has to create conditions which enable more people to have children . " benefits for both sides in 2003 , the government joined forces with business to form the alliance for family policy , which aimed to develop improved work-family reconciliation policies . but despite the government 's efforts to provide day care and tax relief for families , germany is still short of some 1.2 million nursery places for children under three .
schröder pledged once again to increase day care for working families . " flexible working hours and family-friendly employment policies are good , because both sides reap benefits , " he insisted . throwing out the three-year job guarantee he also said industry should do more to support employees with children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but president of the german employers association , dieter hundt , pointed out that two thirds of all firms already offer their employees flexible schedules and that business should n't be blamed for the problem .
he contended that it was the state which has to reform its policies regarding families . for now , mothers are allowed to take up to six months of paid maternity leave and unpaid leave of up to three years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.04.2005 teaching religion the european way großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe still looks to the church for spiritual and moral values as the bundestag discusses introducing compulsory religion and ethics classes , dw-world takes a look at how the topic is dealt with across europe . " every type of religion class comes with its own version of history , " explained peter schreiner , president of the intereuropean commission for church and school -lrb- iccs -rrb- .
" you can make comparisons , but there wo n't ever be a pan-european approach . " for now , he pointed out , each country decides itself how to organize classes , develop the syllabus and select teaching materials , train teachers - as well as providing options for students unwilling to attend religion classes . the way the topic of religion is treated varies widely across the continent .
in southern and eastern europe , finland , italy , austria and germany , religion classes are divided according to denomination . in other countries , including belgium , luxembourg , portugal and spain , students can opt for non-denominational alternatives , such as ethics , philosophy or values classes . germany and austria compulsory religion classes across germany 's states is a principle enshrined in the german constitution or ' grundgesetz ' , with one small opt-out clause , known as the " bremer clause " for certain states with a different legal status .
bremen and berlin , for example , are not governed by the legal obligation to provide religious education , as legislation already in existence when the ' grundgesetz ' was drawn up in 1949 takes precedence .
instead , these states offer ' biblical history ' and a discipline known as ler - ' life , ethics and religion . '
berlin , moreover , is the only german state where religion classes are the responsibility of the church rather than the state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in austria , students ca n't complain of lack of choice , with catholic , protestant , orthodox , new apostolic , jewish , islam and budhist classes available .
religion , whichever it is , is a compulsory subject in schools , while an alternative , non-denominational option has been also been available since 1997 . italy and greece catholic classes , not surprisingly , are a guaranteed fixture of the italian education system .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.04.2005 teaching religion the european way großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe still looks to the church for spiritual and moral values as the bundestag discusses introducing compulsory religion and ethics classes , dw-world takes a look at how the topic is dealt with across europe . " every type of religion class comes with its own version of history , " explained peter schreiner , president of the intereuropean commission for church and school -lrb- iccs -rrb- .
" you can make comparisons , but there wo n't ever be a pan-european approach . " for now , he pointed out , each country decides itself how to organize classes , develop the syllabus and select teaching materials , train teachers - as well as providing options for students unwilling to attend religion classes . the way the topic of religion is treated varies widely across the continent .
in southern and eastern europe , finland , italy , austria and germany , religion classes are divided according to denomination . in other countries , including belgium , luxembourg , portugal and spain , students can opt for non-denominational alternatives , such as ethics , philosophy or values classes . germany and austria compulsory religion classes across germany 's states is a principle enshrined in the german constitution or ' grundgesetz ' , with one small opt-out clause , known as the " bremer clause " for certain states with a different legal status .
bremen and berlin , for example , are not governed by the legal obligation to provide religious education , as legislation already in existence when the ' grundgesetz ' was drawn up in 1949 takes precedence .
instead , these states offer ' biblical history ' and a discipline known as ler - ' life , ethics and religion . '
berlin , moreover , is the only german state where religion classes are the responsibility of the church rather than the state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in austria , students ca n't complain of lack of choice , with catholic , protestant , orthodox , new apostolic , jewish , islam and budhist classes available .
religion , whichever it is , is a compulsory subject in schools , while an alternative , non-denominational option has been also been available since 1997 . italy and greece catholic classes , not surprisingly , are a guaranteed fixture of the italian education system .
available to children from all backgrounds , religion became a voluntary subject in 1984 . other classes are also provided , but need to be paid for privately if sufficient pupils express interest .
alternatively , students can attend ' civic and human rights ' classes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek-orthodox priests before an easter baptism ceremony , river jordan , israel greece takes the opposite approach . here , orthodox classes are compulsory , regardless of personal faith . learning about religion in northern europe , england , wales and scotland , pupils can take religion - or a class in which they learn about the world 's different religions .

the conservative cardinal , in charge of defending church doctrine , is considered a frontrunner . la repubblica and corriere della sera , both respected italian dailies with close contacts with the vatican , say two powerful german cardinals , karl lehmann of mainz and walter kasper , who is based in rome , have lined up against their fellow german who has been the catholic church 's controversial doctrinal watchdog . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal lehmann both lehmann and kasper have had public differences with ratzinger in the past . american cardinals have also expressed reservations about a possible ratzinger pontificate , according to la repubblica .
the paper reported that american and german cardinals are worried about ratzinger 's apparent lack of interest in matters of administration . german cardinals also have taken issue with ratzinger 's opposition to allowing lay theologians to take a leading roll in parishes that lack priests , a serious problem in germany .
the paper also said the ratzinger , the one-time archbishop of munich , had failed to address the issue of not allowing catholics who had divorced and remarried to receive communion . martini - the moderates ' man the milan-based corriere della sera reported that opponents to ratzinger were lining up behind 78-year-old carlo maria martini , who was a favorite of moderates until he resigned as milan 's archbishop in 2002 .
martini , a leading advocate of church reform , serves as a counterweight to the traditionalist ratzinger . bildunterschrift : carlo maria martini martini , however , is not in good health and has indicated he does not want the church 's top job .
but a strong showing for him in the first round of voting is seen as having primarily symbolic value that could show the strength of moderate cardinals and rally support behind a candidate more to their liking . vatican watchers say the first voting rounds are often considered formalities , which gauge the strengths of various camps .
a voting conclave can last for several days and often produces surprising results , as did the one in 1978 which elected poland 's karol wojtyla . however , since many of the bishops in the conclave were appointed by john paul ii , himself a conservative , the traditionalist camp is strong .
italian newspapers reported that between 40 and 50 cardinals had signalled their support for ratzinger in private meetings this week . that number , though , is short of the two-thirds majority , 77 out of 115 votes , needed to win .
vatican watchers say many of the cardinals who will go into the conclave on monday are still undecided . " ratzinger is looking strong , but it 's still far from clear who will emerge and how the voting will go , " one church official , who requested anonymity , told reuters . book published cardinal ratzinger , who turns 78 on saturday , published a book on wednesday in germany which argues that europe must retain its christian heritage .
it is not clear what kind of effect the book will have on the election , although open campaigning for the papacy is generally frowned upon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph ratzinger , as catholic prefect of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith in the book , he reiterated his conservative views , criticizing the collapse of traditional families and attacking the drive toward gay marriage , saying it was a trend in which " the entire moral history of mankind is being left behind . " he said europe had become " empty inside " and was " dependent on transplants , " referring to the continent 's low birth rate and the need for immigrant labor . although some questioned the timing of the book 's publication , it does not appear to have broken the agreement among cardinals not to talk to the media during the pre-conclave period since the book was likely written before the death of john paul ii . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de could a bavarian become pope ?
while some priests say talk of a papal resignation is in bad taste , others are looking for the man who will come after john paul ii , and there 's a chance it might be german cardinal joseph ratzinger .

the conservative cardinal , in charge of defending church doctrine , is considered a frontrunner . la repubblica and corriere della sera , both respected italian dailies with close contacts with the vatican , say two powerful german cardinals , karl lehmann of mainz and walter kasper , who is based in rome , have lined up against their fellow german who has been the catholic church 's controversial doctrinal watchdog . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal lehmann both lehmann and kasper have had public differences with ratzinger in the past . american cardinals have also expressed reservations about a possible ratzinger pontificate , according to la repubblica .
the paper reported that american and german cardinals are worried about ratzinger 's apparent lack of interest in matters of administration . german cardinals also have taken issue with ratzinger 's opposition to allowing lay theologians to take a leading roll in parishes that lack priests , a serious problem in germany .
the paper also said the ratzinger , the one-time archbishop of munich , had failed to address the issue of not allowing catholics who had divorced and remarried to receive communion . martini - the moderates ' man the milan-based corriere della sera reported that opponents to ratzinger were lining up behind 78-year-old carlo maria martini , who was a favorite of moderates until he resigned as milan 's archbishop in 2002 .
martini , a leading advocate of church reform , serves as a counterweight to the traditionalist ratzinger . bildunterschrift : carlo maria martini martini , however , is not in good health and has indicated he does not want the church 's top job .
but a strong showing for him in the first round of voting is seen as having primarily symbolic value that could show the strength of moderate cardinals and rally support behind a candidate more to their liking . vatican watchers say the first voting rounds are often considered formalities , which gauge the strengths of various camps .
a voting conclave can last for several days and often produces surprising results , as did the one in 1978 which elected poland 's karol wojtyla . however , since many of the bishops in the conclave were appointed by john paul ii , himself a conservative , the traditionalist camp is strong .
italian newspapers reported that between 40 and 50 cardinals had signalled their support for ratzinger in private meetings this week . that number , though , is short of the two-thirds majority , 77 out of 115 votes , needed to win .
vatican watchers say many of the cardinals who will go into the conclave on monday are still undecided . " ratzinger is looking strong , but it 's still far from clear who will emerge and how the voting will go , " one church official , who requested anonymity , told reuters . book published cardinal ratzinger , who turns 78 on saturday , published a book on wednesday in germany which argues that europe must retain its christian heritage .
it is not clear what kind of effect the book will have on the election , although open campaigning for the papacy is generally frowned upon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph ratzinger , as catholic prefect of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith in the book , he reiterated his conservative views , criticizing the collapse of traditional families and attacking the drive toward gay marriage , saying it was a trend in which " the entire moral history of mankind is being left behind . " he said europe had become " empty inside " and was " dependent on transplants , " referring to the continent 's low birth rate and the need for immigrant labor . although some questioned the timing of the book 's publication , it does not appear to have broken the agreement among cardinals not to talk to the media during the pre-conclave period since the book was likely written before the death of john paul ii . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de could a bavarian become pope ?

the paper reported that american and german cardinals are worried about ratzinger 's apparent lack of interest in matters of administration . german cardinals also have taken issue with ratzinger 's opposition to allowing lay theologians to take a leading roll in parishes that lack priests , a serious problem in germany .
the paper also said the ratzinger , the one-time archbishop of munich , had failed to address the issue of not allowing catholics who had divorced and remarried to receive communion . martini - the moderates ' man the milan-based corriere della sera reported that opponents to ratzinger were lining up behind 78-year-old carlo maria martini , who was a favorite of moderates until he resigned as milan 's archbishop in 2002 .
martini , a leading advocate of church reform , serves as a counterweight to the traditionalist ratzinger . bildunterschrift : carlo maria martini martini , however , is not in good health and has indicated he does not want the church 's top job .
but a strong showing for him in the first round of voting is seen as having primarily symbolic value that could show the strength of moderate cardinals and rally support behind a candidate more to their liking . vatican watchers say the first voting rounds are often considered formalities , which gauge the strengths of various camps .
a voting conclave can last for several days and often produces surprising results , as did the one in 1978 which elected poland 's karol wojtyla . however , since many of the bishops in the conclave were appointed by john paul ii , himself a conservative , the traditionalist camp is strong .
italian newspapers reported that between 40 and 50 cardinals had signalled their support for ratzinger in private meetings this week . that number , though , is short of the two-thirds majority , 77 out of 115 votes , needed to win .
vatican watchers say many of the cardinals who will go into the conclave on monday are still undecided . " ratzinger is looking strong , but it 's still far from clear who will emerge and how the voting will go , " one church official , who requested anonymity , told reuters . book published cardinal ratzinger , who turns 78 on saturday , published a book on wednesday in germany which argues that europe must retain its christian heritage .
it is not clear what kind of effect the book will have on the election , although open campaigning for the papacy is generally frowned upon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph ratzinger , as catholic prefect of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith in the book , he reiterated his conservative views , criticizing the collapse of traditional families and attacking the drive toward gay marriage , saying it was a trend in which " the entire moral history of mankind is being left behind . " he said europe had become " empty inside " and was " dependent on transplants , " referring to the continent 's low birth rate and the need for immigrant labor . although some questioned the timing of the book 's publication , it does not appear to have broken the agreement among cardinals not to talk to the media during the pre-conclave period since the book was likely written before the death of john paul ii . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de could a bavarian become pope ?
while some priests say talk of a papal resignation is in bad taste , others are looking for the man who will come after john paul ii , and there 's a chance it might be german cardinal joseph ratzinger .

alternatively , students can attend ' civic and human rights ' classes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek-orthodox priests before an easter baptism ceremony , river jordan , israel greece takes the opposite approach . here , orthodox classes are compulsory , regardless of personal faith . learning about religion in northern europe , england , wales and scotland , pupils can take religion - or a class in which they learn about the world 's different religions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.04.2005 opposition mounting to ratzinger as pope großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ratzinger has the blessing of some cardinals , but not all according to italian media , american and german cardinals have lined up against a possible papacy of joseph ratzinger .
the conservative cardinal , in charge of defending church doctrine , is considered a frontrunner . la repubblica and corriere della sera , both respected italian dailies with close contacts with the vatican , say two powerful german cardinals , karl lehmann of mainz and walter kasper , who is based in rome , have lined up against their fellow german who has been the catholic church 's controversial doctrinal watchdog . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal lehmann both lehmann and kasper have had public differences with ratzinger in the past . american cardinals have also expressed reservations about a possible ratzinger pontificate , according to la repubblica .
the paper reported that american and german cardinals are worried about ratzinger 's apparent lack of interest in matters of administration . german cardinals also have taken issue with ratzinger 's opposition to allowing lay theologians to take a leading roll in parishes that lack priests , a serious problem in germany .
the paper also said the ratzinger , the one-time archbishop of munich , had failed to address the issue of not allowing catholics who had divorced and remarried to receive communion . martini - the moderates ' man the milan-based corriere della sera reported that opponents to ratzinger were lining up behind 78-year-old carlo maria martini , who was a favorite of moderates until he resigned as milan 's archbishop in 2002 .
martini , a leading advocate of church reform , serves as a counterweight to the traditionalist ratzinger . bildunterschrift : carlo maria martini martini , however , is not in good health and has indicated he does not want the church 's top job .
but a strong showing for him in the first round of voting is seen as having primarily symbolic value that could show the strength of moderate cardinals and rally support behind a candidate more to their liking . vatican watchers say the first voting rounds are often considered formalities , which gauge the strengths of various camps .
a voting conclave can last for several days and often produces surprising results , as did the one in 1978 which elected poland 's karol wojtyla . however , since many of the bishops in the conclave were appointed by john paul ii , himself a conservative , the traditionalist camp is strong .
italian newspapers reported that between 40 and 50 cardinals had signalled their support for ratzinger in private meetings this week . that number , though , is short of the two-thirds majority , 77 out of 115 votes , needed to win .
vatican watchers say many of the cardinals who will go into the conclave on monday are still undecided . " ratzinger is looking strong , but it 's still far from clear who will emerge and how the voting will go , " one church official , who requested anonymity , told reuters . book published cardinal ratzinger , who turns 78 on saturday , published a book on wednesday in germany which argues that europe must retain its christian heritage .
it is not clear what kind of effect the book will have on the election , although open campaigning for the papacy is generally frowned upon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph ratzinger , as catholic prefect of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith in the book , he reiterated his conservative views , criticizing the collapse of traditional families and attacking the drive toward gay marriage , saying it was a trend in which " the entire moral history of mankind is being left behind . " he said europe had become " empty inside " and was " dependent on transplants , " referring to the continent 's low birth rate and the need for immigrant labor . although some questioned the timing of the book 's publication , it does not appear to have broken the agreement among cardinals not to talk to the media during the pre-conclave period since the book was likely written before the death of john paul ii . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de could a bavarian become pope ?
while some priests say talk of a papal resignation is in bad taste , others are looking for the man who will come after john paul ii , and there 's a chance it might be german cardinal joseph ratzinger .
-lrb- feb .

work-life balance gets boost in germany encouraging germans to have more kids the dumbing down of germany study : men in germany are scared to start families current affairs -pipe- 14.04.2005 gerd 's family policy gets down to business großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor wants to see more germans starting families by 2020 , germany will have europe 's lowest percentage of young people .
wednesday 's conference on family policy took a close look at the economic repercussions of the declining birth rate . as germany struggles to maintain the viability of its state pension scheme amid an imminent demographic crunch caused by falling birth rates and an ageing population , chancellor gerhard schröder on wednesday renewed his commitment to encouraging families to have children and outlined new initiatives which would provide financial and job benefits to working germans who decide to start a family or expand an existing one . children are our future , " said chancellor gerhard schröder at the conference called " family - success factor for the economy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " they are our future workforce , consumers and parents .
our future , our pensions and the economic strength of our country , rests in the hands of our children . " the family challenge the number of children born in germany has fallen a dramatic 50 per cent from 1.4 million in 1964 to just 700,000 in 2005 .
as the country 's unemployment figures continue to swell , to many , the prospect of raising a family seems just too challenging .
given the nation 's nagging economic woes , women in particular see the difficulty of combining child-rearing and career as too much of a deterrent . it 's a trend germany ca n't afford to let develop . " creating good conditions for families became an economic issue a long time ago , " said schröder .
a reduced younger generation means a declining workforce , lack of innovation and ever fewer consumers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we can not allow a woman to decide against having children because she 's reluctant to have to choose between having a child or having a career , " stressed schröder .
" we can not allow a family on a normal income to decide against another child for financial reasons . in future , family policy has to create conditions which enable more people to have children . " benefits for both sides in 2003 , the government joined forces with business to form the alliance for family policy , which aimed to develop improved work-family reconciliation policies . but despite the government 's efforts to provide day care and tax relief for families , germany is still short of some 1.2 million nursery places for children under three .
schröder pledged once again to increase day care for working families . " flexible working hours and family-friendly employment policies are good , because both sides reap benefits , " he insisted . throwing out the three-year job guarantee he also said industry should do more to support employees with children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but president of the german employers association , dieter hundt , pointed out that two thirds of all firms already offer their employees flexible schedules and that business should n't be blamed for the problem .
he contended that it was the state which has to reform its policies regarding families . for now , mothers are allowed to take up to six months of paid maternity leave and unpaid leave of up to three years . " something needs to change " " as far as employers are concerned , we need to take a new look at reducing parental leave , " said hundt .
" so far , our relatively generous family support of € 150 billion has led to neither higher birth rates nor improved integration of parents within the labor market .

work-life balance gets boost in germany encouraging germans to have more kids the dumbing down of germany study : men in germany are scared to start families current affairs -pipe- 14.04.2005 gerd 's family policy gets down to business großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor wants to see more germans starting families by 2020 , germany will have europe 's lowest percentage of young people .
wednesday 's conference on family policy took a close look at the economic repercussions of the declining birth rate . as germany struggles to maintain the viability of its state pension scheme amid an imminent demographic crunch caused by falling birth rates and an ageing population , chancellor gerhard schröder on wednesday renewed his commitment to encouraging families to have children and outlined new initiatives which would provide financial and job benefits to working germans who decide to start a family or expand an existing one . children are our future , " said chancellor gerhard schröder at the conference called " family - success factor for the economy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " they are our future workforce , consumers and parents .
our future , our pensions and the economic strength of our country , rests in the hands of our children . " the family challenge the number of children born in germany has fallen a dramatic 50 per cent from 1.4 million in 1964 to just 700,000 in 2005 .
as the country 's unemployment figures continue to swell , to many , the prospect of raising a family seems just too challenging .
given the nation 's nagging economic woes , women in particular see the difficulty of combining child-rearing and career as too much of a deterrent . it 's a trend germany ca n't afford to let develop . " creating good conditions for families became an economic issue a long time ago , " said schröder .
a reduced younger generation means a declining workforce , lack of innovation and ever fewer consumers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we can not allow a woman to decide against having children because she 's reluctant to have to choose between having a child or having a career , " stressed schröder .
" we can not allow a family on a normal income to decide against another child for financial reasons . in future , family policy has to create conditions which enable more people to have children . " benefits for both sides in 2003 , the government joined forces with business to form the alliance for family policy , which aimed to develop improved work-family reconciliation policies . but despite the government 's efforts to provide day care and tax relief for families , germany is still short of some 1.2 million nursery places for children under three .
schröder pledged once again to increase day care for working families . " flexible working hours and family-friendly employment policies are good , because both sides reap benefits , " he insisted . throwing out the three-year job guarantee he also said industry should do more to support employees with children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but president of the german employers association , dieter hundt , pointed out that two thirds of all firms already offer their employees flexible schedules and that business should n't be blamed for the problem .
he contended that it was the state which has to reform its policies regarding families . for now , mothers are allowed to take up to six months of paid maternity leave and unpaid leave of up to three years . " something needs to change " " as far as employers are concerned , we need to take a new look at reducing parental leave , " said hundt .
" so far , our relatively generous family support of € 150 billion has led to neither higher birth rates nor improved integration of parents within the labor market .
something needs to change . " hundt believes that parents need to return to the work faster than is currently the norm , because the german economy simply ca n't afford to forfeit qualified workers with know-how . the government largely agrees .

he contended that it was the state which has to reform its policies regarding families . for now , mothers are allowed to take up to six months of paid maternity leave and unpaid leave of up to three years . " something needs to change " " as far as employers are concerned , we need to take a new look at reducing parental leave , " said hundt .
" so far , our relatively generous family support of € 150 billion has led to neither higher birth rates nor improved integration of parents within the labor market .
something needs to change . " hundt believes that parents need to return to the work faster than is currently the norm , because the german economy simply ca n't afford to forfeit qualified workers with know-how . the government largely agrees .
its latest proposal , outlined at the conference by minister for family affairs renate schmidt , would introduce a sliding scale benefit scheme dependent on income . but as schröder said wednesday , the issue is by no means purely financial .
" parents need more infrastructures , not just more money , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de work-life balance gets boost in germany in germany , where kids are seen as career killers , over 40 percent of highly qualified women choose to remain childless .

turks are increasingly critical of the country 's possible accession to the eu as euro-skeptics warn of a potential sell-out of national interests . even though opinion polls regularly show that three-quarters of turks favour their country joining the eu , increasing numbers are also becoming aware of drawbacks : brussels is going to make increasing demands on ankara and will have a bigger role in running the country .
many see this this as a threat to the turkish state .
these warnings are also being voiced in other countries that are seeking eu membership but nowhere do they touch the nerve the way they do in turkey .
while the eu - as a result of its experiences in the two world wars - is trying to supress the individual nation-state by bringing member states closer together as one , many turks consider the nation-state to be the greatest good .
" sovereignty belongs unconditionally and unreservedly to the nation " was one of the principles of atatürk , the founder of the modern turkish state , whose image hangs on the end wall of the plenary chamber in the turkish parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recep tayyip erdogan und abdullah gül have been accused of compromising over cyprus a foreign toy ?
turkey arose out of the ruins of the ottoman empire , which was occupied by the allied victors of world war i , in the 1920s .
in a war that involved heavy losses , atatürk succeeded in driving the greek occupying powers - in west anatolia in particular - out of the country .
in the early years of the republic , turks feared that the country would be carved up and become a plaything of foreign powers .
as a result , it is unsurprising that nationalists are claiming that turkish membership in the european union would ultimately only benefit europeans , not turks .
and they point to to the conflict over cyprus as evidence . the cypress conflict turkey 's euro-skeptics criticize every step taken by the government of prime minister recep tayyip erdogan regarding cypress : he hints that he is willing to make compromises in the search for a peaceful solution for the divided mediterranean island .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a close ally of turkish membership the fact that erdogan 's government is " selling " cyprus in order to show the eu how obedient tukrkey is , is an image often peddled by the right-wing nationalist mhp party .
but concern over the fate of the turkish state in the upcoming membership negotiations with the eu is not only an issue for turkey 's right wing .
drawing attention to supposed threats to turkey from outside its national borders is also part of the repertoire of the social democratic opposition party chp .
the chp recently and successfully challenged a law governing the sale of land and buildings to foreigners through the constitutional court .
the chp is part of turkey 's lay kemalist establishment that considers all deviations from atatürk 's course to be wrong .
because of this , kemalists have terrible difficulty accepting some of the european union 's key demands .
they even have trouble opening turkey up to foreign investors – a fact demonstrated by more than just the fate of the real estate law .
president ahmet necdet sezer , a leading kemalist , recently vetoed a law that would have allowed foreigners to buy television stations in turkey .
the president explained that he had taken this action because a law of this sort would not have been in the " national interest " .
sensitive minority policy if ground-breaking economic policies such as this are viewed with such suspicion , it is no wonder that the resistance to more sensitive issues , such as policies on minorities , is even more fierce .
the alleged attempts of young kurds to burn a turkish flag triggered nationalist hysteria across the country over the past few weeks .
tens of thousands demonstratively draped their homes with turkish flags while the turkish police marched through istanbul bearing a 1.5-kilometre long flag .
meanwhile , both the nationalists and kemalists are being joined by a growing number of turkish islamists who are also sceptical about their country 's eu application .
over the past few years , turkey 's islamists has accounted for some of the country 's greatest europhiles because they hoped that moving closer to the eu would bring more freedom of religion .
but the introduction of headscarf bans in several eu states and other similar developments have dashed these hopes .
a recent report published by the independent industrialist & businessmen 's association , müsiad , concluded that the basic values on which the eu is built are a " strait-jacket " for muslims .
even though erdogan 's government has more than a two-thirds majority in parliament , it says that eu skepticism must be taken seriously .
the nationalist and islamist wing of the ruling akp ensures that this mistrust is not restricted to the opposition both inside and outside the parliament .
the debate as to what other demands the eu has yet to make on turkey and how the country should react to them is only likely to really start once accession negotiations begin october 3 . susanne güsten , qantara.de -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is turkey losing its reform zeal ?

turkey arose out of the ruins of the ottoman empire , which was occupied by the allied victors of world war i , in the 1920s .
in a war that involved heavy losses , atatürk succeeded in driving the greek occupying powers - in west anatolia in particular - out of the country .

bayern and stuttgart start a stretch of test matches before a final clash in stuttgart . after last weekend 's disastrous 3-0 defeat in stuttgart , the mood in schalke turned for the worse .
before , there was talk of winning the title .
now they are thinking differently .
coach ralf rangnick said in kicker magazine that the most important task " is securing a spot in the champions league . "
that means finishing second in the bundesliga for automatic qualification .
the schedule , however , is against them heading down the home stretch .
in their last six matches , they face four teams with international aspirations .
this week , sixth place hamburg are in town .
coach thomas doll 's club has fallen on hard times of late .
at the beginning of the second half of the season , hamburg sprang to the top third of the standings but luck has not been on their side recently and they 've collected only one point in their last three games .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's coach ralf rangnick has had reason to frown in the bundesliga the past few weeks schalke are by no means out of the title race , but it may be stuttgart who may make the race tight for bayern munich .
they will need help from other teams though .
on 54 points , they lie five back of bayern .
yet their schedule , like bayern 's , is filled with mediocre opponents .
this saturday , the hardest adversary just may be the long bus ride to rostock on the baltic sea .
stuttgart 's markus babbel warned in sport-bild magazine that 17th place rostock , fighting for their lives against relegation , can not be taken lightly .
" we ca n't allow a loss like that of schalke against mainz . "
stuttgart are playing juggernaut-like and silently have thoughts of winning the championship .
if the cards fall right , this could happen .
in the final game of the season , matthias sammer 's team comes up against bayern .
champions league adieu , hello bundesliga bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's goalkeeper oliver kahn is not one to keep his emotions penned in following their ouster from the champions league at the hands of chelsea , 18-time bundesliga champion bayern munich can concentrate on the league title .
coach felix magath bemoaned the bad luck of the bavarians against the premiereship side .
star defender lucio deflected two balls into his own net in the two fixtures with chelsea but bayern are three points in front of second place schalke and are also in the semifinals of the league cup , " so things are n't that bad , " said magath .
their opponents , hanover , could sing a similar tune .
not because they are mixing it up at the top of the table .
more because they have stamped their ticket for the first division for next season .
hanover have taken a beating against bayern in the past , letting in 87 goals in their 31 meetings .
what speaks for ewald lienen 's club is the fact that this game is in hanover .
the only five matches they have bettered munich have taken place at home .
reigning champs and fourth place werder bremen -lrb- 50 points -rrb- have a big assignment when they host hertha berlin -lrb- 47 -rrb- .
bremen must do without captain and national midfielder frank baumann who went under the knife this week for a bad left ankle .
striker miroslav klose will also be sitting on the bench with a hurt knee .
a victory against northern rivals hamburg last week impressed coach thomas schaaf .
another impressive game will be needed on saturday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's marcelinho , left , after his stroke of genius from 48 meters against freiburg berlin 's midfielder marcelinho -lrb- photo -rrb- scored what was probably one of the top three goals in this bundesliga season against last place and second division bound freiburg last saturday .
from the edge of the midfield circle , the colorful brazilian launched a lob over keeper richard golz who had wandered too far off his line .
the ball flew over the flailing golz and landed in the net .
marcelinho went on to score on a penalty kick and assisted on nico kovac 's goal in the 90th minute .
a similar performance could cause a big headache for bremen .
but bremen are not freiburg . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern on track to take home title sunday 's bundesliga games did n't change anything about the leadership struggle between bayern and schalke : bayern seem set to win the season after stuttgart defeated schalke on saturday .

bayern and stuttgart start a stretch of test matches before a final clash in stuttgart . after last weekend 's disastrous 3-0 defeat in stuttgart , the mood in schalke turned for the worse .
before , there was talk of winning the title .
now they are thinking differently .
coach ralf rangnick said in kicker magazine that the most important task " is securing a spot in the champions league . "
that means finishing second in the bundesliga for automatic qualification .
the schedule , however , is against them heading down the home stretch .
in their last six matches , they face four teams with international aspirations .
this week , sixth place hamburg are in town .
coach thomas doll 's club has fallen on hard times of late .
at the beginning of the second half of the season , hamburg sprang to the top third of the standings but luck has not been on their side recently and they 've collected only one point in their last three games .

they will need help from other teams though .
on 54 points , they lie five back of bayern .
yet their schedule , like bayern 's , is filled with mediocre opponents .
this saturday , the hardest adversary just may be the long bus ride to rostock on the baltic sea .
stuttgart 's markus babbel warned in sport-bild magazine that 17th place rostock , fighting for their lives against relegation , can not be taken lightly .
" we ca n't allow a loss like that of schalke against mainz . "

coach felix magath bemoaned the bad luck of the bavarians against the premiereship side .
star defender lucio deflected two balls into his own net in the two fixtures with chelsea but bayern are three points in front of second place schalke and are also in the semifinals of the league cup , " so things are n't that bad , " said magath .
their opponents , hanover , could sing a similar tune .
not because they are mixing it up at the top of the table .
more because they have stamped their ticket for the first division for next season .
hanover have taken a beating against bayern in the past , letting in 87 goals in their 31 meetings .

the film , der untergang - the downfall , will now open in israeli cinemas in may . a highly acclaimed german film sometimes criticized for portraying adolf hitler in too positive a light is to be released in israel after viewers gave it positive feedback last week . the film , " the downfall , -lrb- der untergang -rrb- " which was nominated in 2004 for an oscar in the best foreign film category , depicts hitler 's final days in a berlin bunker and includes scenes in which the nazi dictator seems almost approachable . while the film has been a hit in europe since its release , it had problems finding a distributor in israel .
but last week , nurit shani , owner of the israeli cinema chain lev and film distributor shani , told reuters that she decided to show the movie after an audience of 1,000 invited to a preview last week approved of it by 91 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : presenting two sides " i expected a vote in favour of the movie , but i did n't imagine it would be so decisive , " shani told reuters .
" i know there are still many for whom it will be difficult to see the human side of hitler portrayed in a film .
but it would have been unfair to prevent a curious and interested audience that is willing to confront the painful subject in its own way from seeing the movie . " a brutal megalomaniac the jewish state gained its independence after the end of world war ii , in which six million jews were slaughtered according to hitler 's plan .
even 60 years later is no issue more sensitive to the nation .
for example , a few israeli officials boycotted a recent appearance of german president horst köhler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the film portrays hitler as a brutal megalomaniac , it also shows his more human side : a man who could show kindness to his staff , to animals and to his wife and a man who suffered from parkinson 's disease .
hitler committed suicide april 30 , 1945 in the bunker . " this is the first time i saw how they -lrb- the germans -rrb- suffered , how they struggled with themselves , how they saw their ' fuehrer ' as crazy , " simha siani , who voted for screening the film , told reuters . the film will open in three israeli cities may 19 , two weeks after the annual holocaust memorial day is observed . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german film aims to gatecrash oscar party hollywood hosts the 77th academy awards ceremony on sunday night .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.04.2005 teaching religion the european way großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe still looks to the church for spiritual and moral values as the bundestag discusses introducing compulsory religion and ethics classes , dw-world takes a look at how the topic is dealt with across europe . " every type of religion class comes with its own version of history , " explained peter schreiner , president of the intereuropean commission for church and school -lrb- iccs -rrb- .
" you can make comparisons , but there wo n't ever be a pan-european approach . " for now , he pointed out , each country decides itself how to organize classes , develop the syllabus and select teaching materials , train teachers - as well as providing options for students unwilling to attend religion classes . the way the topic of religion is treated varies widely across the continent .
in southern and eastern europe , finland , italy , austria and germany , religion classes are divided according to denomination . in other countries , including belgium , luxembourg , portugal and spain , students can opt for non-denominational alternatives , such as ethics , philosophy or values classes . germany and austria compulsory religion classes across germany 's states is a principle enshrined in the german constitution or ' grundgesetz ' , with one small opt-out clause , known as the " bremer clause " for certain states with a different legal status .
bremen and berlin , for example , are not governed by the legal obligation to provide religious education , as legislation already in existence when the ' grundgesetz ' was drawn up in 1949 takes precedence .
instead , these states offer ' biblical history ' and a discipline known as ler - ' life , ethics and religion . '
berlin , moreover , is the only german state where religion classes are the responsibility of the church rather than the state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in austria , students ca n't complain of lack of choice , with catholic , protestant , orthodox , new apostolic , jewish , islam and budhist classes available .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.04.2005 opposition mounting to ratzinger as pope großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ratzinger has the blessing of some cardinals , but not all according to italian media , american and german cardinals have lined up against a possible papacy of joseph ratzinger .
the conservative cardinal , in charge of defending church doctrine , is considered a frontrunner . la repubblica and corriere della sera , both respected italian dailies with close contacts with the vatican , say two powerful german cardinals , karl lehmann of mainz and walter kasper , who is based in rome , have lined up against their fellow german who has been the catholic church 's controversial doctrinal watchdog . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal lehmann both lehmann and kasper have had public differences with ratzinger in the past . american cardinals have also expressed reservations about a possible ratzinger pontificate , according to la repubblica .
the paper reported that american and german cardinals are worried about ratzinger 's apparent lack of interest in matters of administration . german cardinals also have taken issue with ratzinger 's opposition to allowing lay theologians to take a leading roll in parishes that lack priests , a serious problem in germany .
the paper also said the ratzinger , the one-time archbishop of munich , had failed to address the issue of not allowing catholics who had divorced and remarried to receive communion . martini - the moderates ' man the milan-based corriere della sera reported that opponents to ratzinger were lining up behind 78-year-old carlo maria martini , who was a favorite of moderates until he resigned as milan 's archbishop in 2002 .
martini , a leading advocate of church reform , serves as a counterweight to the traditionalist ratzinger . bildunterschrift : carlo maria martini martini , however , is not in good health and has indicated he does not want the church 's top job .
but a strong showing for him in the first round of voting is seen as having primarily symbolic value that could show the strength of moderate cardinals and rally support behind a candidate more to their liking . vatican watchers say the first voting rounds are often considered formalities , which gauge the strengths of various camps .
a voting conclave can last for several days and often produces surprising results , as did the one in 1978 which elected poland 's karol wojtyla . however , since many of the bishops in the conclave were appointed by john paul ii , himself a conservative , the traditionalist camp is strong .
italian newspapers reported that between 40 and 50 cardinals had signalled their support for ratzinger in private meetings this week . that number , though , is short of the two-thirds majority , 77 out of 115 votes , needed to win .
vatican watchers say many of the cardinals who will go into the conclave on monday are still undecided .

the conservative cardinal , in charge of defending church doctrine , is considered a frontrunner . la repubblica and corriere della sera , both respected italian dailies with close contacts with the vatican , say two powerful german cardinals , karl lehmann of mainz and walter kasper , who is based in rome , have lined up against their fellow german who has been the catholic church 's controversial doctrinal watchdog . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal lehmann both lehmann and kasper have had public differences with ratzinger in the past . american cardinals have also expressed reservations about a possible ratzinger pontificate , according to la repubblica .
the paper reported that american and german cardinals are worried about ratzinger 's apparent lack of interest in matters of administration . german cardinals also have taken issue with ratzinger 's opposition to allowing lay theologians to take a leading roll in parishes that lack priests , a serious problem in germany .
the paper also said the ratzinger , the one-time archbishop of munich , had failed to address the issue of not allowing catholics who had divorced and remarried to receive communion . martini - the moderates ' man the milan-based corriere della sera reported that opponents to ratzinger were lining up behind 78-year-old carlo maria martini , who was a favorite of moderates until he resigned as milan 's archbishop in 2002 .
martini , a leading advocate of church reform , serves as a counterweight to the traditionalist ratzinger . bildunterschrift : carlo maria martini martini , however , is not in good health and has indicated he does not want the church 's top job .
but a strong showing for him in the first round of voting is seen as having primarily symbolic value that could show the strength of moderate cardinals and rally support behind a candidate more to their liking . vatican watchers say the first voting rounds are often considered formalities , which gauge the strengths of various camps .
a voting conclave can last for several days and often produces surprising results , as did the one in 1978 which elected poland 's karol wojtyla . however , since many of the bishops in the conclave were appointed by john paul ii , himself a conservative , the traditionalist camp is strong .
italian newspapers reported that between 40 and 50 cardinals had signalled their support for ratzinger in private meetings this week . that number , though , is short of the two-thirds majority , 77 out of 115 votes , needed to win .
vatican watchers say many of the cardinals who will go into the conclave on monday are still undecided . " ratzinger is looking strong , but it 's still far from clear who will emerge and how the voting will go , " one church official , who requested anonymity , told reuters . book published cardinal ratzinger , who turns 78 on saturday , published a book on wednesday in germany which argues that europe must retain its christian heritage .

the countries still have to institute wide-ranging reforms to satisfy eu accession criteria . the vote on wednesday in strasbourg cleared the way for the second expansion of the eu in eastern europe .
both bulgaria and romania are expected to sign the accession treaty on april 25 .
membership for the two , if they implement agreed upon economic and political reforms , is set for jan .
1 , 2007 . " romania has made a crucial step towards its eu membership in 2007 , " romanian prime minister calin tariceanu told reporters in the capital bucharest .
" after the signing of the membership treaty we will become a real accession country . " after signing the accession treaty , officials from the two countries will be allowed to participate in all eu meetings as observers . membership will also secure a place in the prosperous european club for two countries where economic output per capita is below 40 percent of eu average , even though their economies are growing quickly . reforms required the parliament in strasbourg voted with large majorities to back both countries ' accession .
the assembly voted 522 - 70 , with 69 abstentions , to back bulgaria 's eu entry , romania 's entry got a vote of 497-93 , with 71 abstentions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romanian parliament building still , there were serious doubts about whether the countries would implement the reforms the bloc requires before the 2007 date .
they include strengthening administration systems , beefing up border controls and introducing competition policy measures . rampant corruption is a concern for both countries , but particularly for romania , and some green members of parliament doubted that reforms could be carried out in time . green parliamentarian daniel cohn-bendit pointed to the eu legislature 's own report on romania that said : " high-level corruption , despite recent efforts , continues to undermine the country 's socio-economic and political life . " " if we look at matters such as press freedom and corruption and we take seriously everything we 've read in the reports , no one can say that romania in its current state is ready to join , " he said . while parliament rejected a motion by some minority groups to delay the votes until after the european commission publishes a report in november about the countries ' preparation for membership , it did for the first time in an enlargement procedure invoke a protection clause which states that the union could postpone the accession until 2008 if the countries did not make satisfactory progress in implementing reforms . both countries missed the first wave of the eu 's eastwards enlargement in may because they were slow to introduce political and economic reforms after the collapse of communism in 1989 .
romania , with its population of 22 million , is seen as worse prepared for membership and more corrupt than bulgaria , which has eight million citizens . challenges for sofia but bulgaria is not without its hurdles to overcome .
the country 's ailing judiciary is considered in need of restructuring , especially to secure effective crime fighting and a favorable business environment .
it has also been criticized for not integrating its minority communities , in particular its roma population , which numbers 800,000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel cohn-bendit bulgaria 's relative poverty worries some eu officials .
the average pension is 60 leva , or around 30 euros a month ; the average wage is 150 leva , about 75 euros . " we will need 20 , 30 years , even as an eu member , to reach the normal eu level , " said petar-emil mitev , a sociology professor . despite that , bulgaria 's citizens are enthusiastic about joining the european club , since for many of them it means a chance to get on a par with their neighbors .

a trend towards christian schooling in germany might just substantiate that belief . it 's a fact that both catholic and evangelical schools in germany are flourishing .
there are almost 2,000 christian schools scattered across the country and an increasing number of children waiting patiently to be given one of the highly coveted places .

but is the upturn really a reflection of a born-again faith ? the answer is no , at least not exclusively .
in fact it seems to have more to do with a belief in a better education than a belief in god .
jürgen frank , head of education for the evangelical church of germany says there are three main reasons for the recent rise in enthusiasm for christian schooling . " firstly , families are generally smaller and parents want to provide their children with a good education .
secondly , they want the education their children receive to meet their individual needs , and thirdly they want a progressive , modern education system , " he said . popular values ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from incense to wine , catholic children have a lot to learn andreas verhülsdonk , an expert on religious education in the catholic church , says that parents are drawn to catholicism because they know their children will be taught values and morality . " we run a project called " compassion " in which pupils spend three weeks with homeless or sick people , " he said .
" the point is not just to help the needy but to give the children the chance to see the world through the eyes of people living on the fringes of society . " but christoph hermann , who sends his son to an evangelical school in berlin says it is simply important to make christianity a part of daily life . " i would n't consider myself particularly religious , but the christian faith was a part of my upbringing and that is what i want for my son , " hermann said . " we live in an increasingly secular society and i do n't want him to grow up seeing christianity as something fundamental because he has n't been exposed to it in an everyday kind of way . " there 's more to it than just religion that , however , is not to say that denominational schools neglect reading , writing and arithmetic .
in fact they are legally bound to provide pupils with the same curricular options as state schools , with the only difference being compulsory religious education for an average of two hours each week .
hermann believes his son is getting a good deal . " christianity is helpful in learning to understand our culture and it equips children to better understand art and history as well , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young children practice their abc and that is not all .
according to frank , children at evangelical schools in germany learn to read and write better than their state school counterparts . " a study we carried out after the publication of the pisa report revealed that the educational climate at christian schools is better than in state schools , and that the quality on offer at demoninational schools genuinely does live up to its reputation , " he said . indeed , that reputation appears to have run away with the imagination of some determined and diligent parents .
since the fall of the berlin wall , the church has given its blessing to the founding of some 70 new evangelical schools and there are 50 more would-be 's waiting in the wings .
but getting such a venture off the ground is no easy feat . " we have to clear a lot of hurdles , many of them financial , before a new school can be founded , " frank said . hurdles to new beginnings new school initiatives receive a grant from the evangelical church to see them through the first three or four years until the government starts paying an annual subsistence worth some 90 percent of the regular state school budget .
but frank says church funds are running dry . " we used to pay start-up schools some 240,000 euros -lrb- $ 309,000 -rrb- for those first few years , but now with so many waiting , we ca n't afford to do that , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children can be non-denominational and still attend a protestant school most of these projects depend very heavily on the driving parental force behind them , not only to put sponsorship or financing in place , but to find and renovate premises , to interview and hire staff , and of course to handpick the protégées . the selection criteria vary from school to school , state to state and church to church .
in the case of catholics , the emphasis is on accepting children who are being brought up within the framework of the faith , whereas the evangelical church takes a more relaxed approach to the religious background of its recruits . what they want to achieve , they say , is a good social mix . but is it illusory to think that 's really possible in schools that require tuition ?
frank says that although parents who send their children to evangelical schools are expected to pay a monthly fee of between 40 and 120 euros - based on what they earn - those who ca n't afford it are exempt without a battle .

a trend towards christian schooling in germany might just substantiate that belief . it 's a fact that both catholic and evangelical schools in germany are flourishing .
there are almost 2,000 christian schools scattered across the country and an increasing number of children waiting patiently to be given one of the highly coveted places .
demand far outstrips supply and progressive parents are taking it upon themselves to found a new generation of denominational schools .
but is the upturn really a reflection of a born-again faith ? the answer is no , at least not exclusively .
in fact it seems to have more to do with a belief in a better education than a belief in god .
jürgen frank , head of education for the evangelical church of germany says there are three main reasons for the recent rise in enthusiasm for christian schooling . " firstly , families are generally smaller and parents want to provide their children with a good education .
secondly , they want the education their children receive to meet their individual needs , and thirdly they want a progressive , modern education system , " he said . popular values ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from incense to wine , catholic children have a lot to learn andreas verhülsdonk , an expert on religious education in the catholic church , says that parents are drawn to catholicism because they know their children will be taught values and morality . " we run a project called " compassion " in which pupils spend three weeks with homeless or sick people , " he said .
" the point is not just to help the needy but to give the children the chance to see the world through the eyes of people living on the fringes of society . " but christoph hermann , who sends his son to an evangelical school in berlin says it is simply important to make christianity a part of daily life . " i would n't consider myself particularly religious , but the christian faith was a part of my upbringing and that is what i want for my son , " hermann said . " we live in an increasingly secular society and i do n't want him to grow up seeing christianity as something fundamental because he has n't been exposed to it in an everyday kind of way . " there 's more to it than just religion that , however , is not to say that denominational schools neglect reading , writing and arithmetic .
in fact they are legally bound to provide pupils with the same curricular options as state schools , with the only difference being compulsory religious education for an average of two hours each week .
hermann believes his son is getting a good deal . " christianity is helpful in learning to understand our culture and it equips children to better understand art and history as well , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young children practice their abc and that is not all .
according to frank , children at evangelical schools in germany learn to read and write better than their state school counterparts . " a study we carried out after the publication of the pisa report revealed that the educational climate at christian schools is better than in state schools , and that the quality on offer at demoninational schools genuinely does live up to its reputation , " he said . indeed , that reputation appears to have run away with the imagination of some determined and diligent parents .
since the fall of the berlin wall , the church has given its blessing to the founding of some 70 new evangelical schools and there are 50 more would-be 's waiting in the wings .
but getting such a venture off the ground is no easy feat . " we have to clear a lot of hurdles , many of them financial , before a new school can be founded , " frank said . hurdles to new beginnings new school initiatives receive a grant from the evangelical church to see them through the first three or four years until the government starts paying an annual subsistence worth some 90 percent of the regular state school budget .
but frank says church funds are running dry . " we used to pay start-up schools some 240,000 euros -lrb- $ 309,000 -rrb- for those first few years , but now with so many waiting , we ca n't afford to do that , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children can be non-denominational and still attend a protestant school most of these projects depend very heavily on the driving parental force behind them , not only to put sponsorship or financing in place , but to find and renovate premises , to interview and hire staff , and of course to handpick the protégées . the selection criteria vary from school to school , state to state and church to church .
in the case of catholics , the emphasis is on accepting children who are being brought up within the framework of the faith , whereas the evangelical church takes a more relaxed approach to the religious background of its recruits . what they want to achieve , they say , is a good social mix . but is it illusory to think that 's really possible in schools that require tuition ?
frank says that although parents who send their children to evangelical schools are expected to pay a monthly fee of between 40 and 120 euros - based on what they earn - those who ca n't afford it are exempt without a battle .

that could soon change . on time magazine 's list of the top 100 people who have influenced the world in the past year , three germans are present .
they are n't perhaps who you 'd think .
chancellor gerhard schröder does n't get a mention , nor does foreign minister joschka fischer or any of the country 's ceos or top scientists . instead , formula one driver michael schumacher made the grade , as did cardinal ratzinger , the man some believe could become the next pope .
the third german was cornelia funke , the best-selling author of children 's books whose fantasy-filled stories are enchanting readers around the world . with a sigh he sat down behind his desk .
then , behind the door , someone whispered .
they 're probably admiring my sign , thought victor .
it was black and shiny and had gold lettering : " victor getz , detective .
investigations of any kind . "
the door knocker next to the sign was in the shape of a lion 's head with a brass ring in its mouth , which victor has just polished this morning . victor getz does n't know it yet , but on this very morning he will set out in search of two street children , prosper and bo , and perhaps while he 's at it , he will find himself .
victor is one of the central characters in cornelia funke 's book " the thief lord . " complex characters , page-turner plots her characters are often not the nicest folks .
they 're often grumpy , shifty , timid , complicated and cunning - always three dimensional and without exception , loveable .
in funke 's fantastical stories , the figures move through refreshingly unpredictable plots , which are always immensely entertaining for readers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " inkheart " " i like to show children things that i myself find incredibly wonderful , for example , venice , " she said .
" of course other things creep in that occupy one 's mind , like the unbelievable lack of compassion that exists so often between humans and animals , or humans and humans .
but i always try to bind it all in the story .
the story comes first . " the former book illustrator began writing her own books 15 years ago ; most have been bestsellers .
but her phenomenal success has been so quiet that most germans have n't yet noticed this new global writer in their midst .
it 's mostly parents for whom the name " cornelia funke " has taken on special meaning , since it so often pops up in the juvenile section of libraries or on the wish lists of their children . magical but sophisticated us-based time magazine has been more alert to her talent than her compatriots since it awarded her a place in the magazine 's top 100 list . " she has become truly international and everyone who discovers her books really loves them , " said adi ignacius , time 's executive editor .
" they just find them to be very , you know , magical and enchanting and also sophisticated . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 46-year-old has sold more than three million books in her career , winning several prestigious awards in the process .
her most well-known works , " the thief lord , " dragonrider " and " inkheart " have been translated into 20 languages .
" the thief lord " has been made into a film and will hit german cinemas this fall .
big-screen productions of " inkheart " and the girl 's series " wilde hühner " -lrb- wild chickens -rrb- are also being planned . " it 's true that right now i 'm reaching millions of children .
but i 'm not very optimistic what kind of influence i have , " funke said .
" but if it means that children in for example america are told stories by a european , then that 's something at least . " prolific author in the uk especially , funke is often described as the german response to j.k. rowling , the british superstar author of the harry potter series .
rowling , who is nine years younger than funke , is now working on her sixth harry potter book .
funke , on the other hand , has written more than 40 books in 15 years .
one of her most successful , " inkheart , " is an homage to reading and the power of the written word . on that night - when so much began and so much changed forever - one of meggie 's favorite books lay under her pillow and since the rain was n't letting her sleep , she sat up , rubbed her eyes and pulled the book out .
the page rustled promisingly as she opened it .
meggie thought that this first sound of pages was different in every book , depending on if she already knew what it was going to tell her or not . seemingly unmoved by her many literary awards and the time magazine list , cornelia funke simply goes on doing what she does best - write .
right now she 's working on a sequel to " inkheart " called " inkblood . "
like her colleague j.k. rowling on the other side of the channel , she will continue with each new book to turn both children and adults alike back to the pleasures of reading .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 14.04.2005 back to belief in german schools großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian education has made a comeback in germany last week 's emotional outpouring following the pope 's death has sparked excited calls from the faithful that christianity is back ' in ' .
a trend towards christian schooling in germany might just substantiate that belief . it 's a fact that both catholic and evangelical schools in germany are flourishing .
there are almost 2,000 christian schools scattered across the country and an increasing number of children waiting patiently to be given one of the highly coveted places .
demand far outstrips supply and progressive parents are taking it upon themselves to found a new generation of denominational schools .
but is the upturn really a reflection of a born-again faith ? the answer is no , at least not exclusively .
in fact it seems to have more to do with a belief in a better education than a belief in god .
jürgen frank , head of education for the evangelical church of germany says there are three main reasons for the recent rise in enthusiasm for christian schooling . " firstly , families are generally smaller and parents want to provide their children with a good education .
secondly , they want the education their children receive to meet their individual needs , and thirdly they want a progressive , modern education system , " he said . popular values ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from incense to wine , catholic children have a lot to learn andreas verhülsdonk , an expert on religious education in the catholic church , says that parents are drawn to catholicism because they know their children will be taught values and morality . " we run a project called " compassion " in which pupils spend three weeks with homeless or sick people , " he said .
" the point is not just to help the needy but to give the children the chance to see the world through the eyes of people living on the fringes of society . " but christoph hermann , who sends his son to an evangelical school in berlin says it is simply important to make christianity a part of daily life . " i would n't consider myself particularly religious , but the christian faith was a part of my upbringing and that is what i want for my son , " hermann said . " we live in an increasingly secular society and i do n't want him to grow up seeing christianity as something fundamental because he has n't been exposed to it in an everyday kind of way . " there 's more to it than just religion that , however , is not to say that denominational schools neglect reading , writing and arithmetic .
in fact they are legally bound to provide pupils with the same curricular options as state schools , with the only difference being compulsory religious education for an average of two hours each week .
hermann believes his son is getting a good deal . " christianity is helpful in learning to understand our culture and it equips children to better understand art and history as well , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young children practice their abc and that is not all .
according to frank , children at evangelical schools in germany learn to read and write better than their state school counterparts . " a study we carried out after the publication of the pisa report revealed that the educational climate at christian schools is better than in state schools , and that the quality on offer at demoninational schools genuinely does live up to its reputation , " he said . indeed , that reputation appears to have run away with the imagination of some determined and diligent parents .
since the fall of the berlin wall , the church has given its blessing to the founding of some 70 new evangelical schools and there are 50 more would-be 's waiting in the wings .
but getting such a venture off the ground is no easy feat . " we have to clear a lot of hurdles , many of them financial , before a new school can be founded , " frank said . hurdles to new beginnings new school initiatives receive a grant from the evangelical church to see them through the first three or four years until the government starts paying an annual subsistence worth some 90 percent of the regular state school budget .
but frank says church funds are running dry . " we used to pay start-up schools some 240,000 euros -lrb- $ 309,000 -rrb- for those first few years , but now with so many waiting , we ca n't afford to do that , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children can be non-denominational and still attend a protestant school most of these projects depend very heavily on the driving parental force behind them , not only to put sponsorship or financing in place , but to find and renovate premises , to interview and hire staff , and of course to handpick the protégées . the selection criteria vary from school to school , state to state and church to church .
in the case of catholics , the emphasis is on accepting children who are being brought up within the framework of the faith , whereas the evangelical church takes a more relaxed approach to the religious background of its recruits . what they want to achieve , they say , is a good social mix . but is it illusory to think that 's really possible in schools that require tuition ?
frank says that although parents who send their children to evangelical schools are expected to pay a monthly fee of between 40 and 120 euros - based on what they earn - those who ca n't afford it are exempt without a battle .
but that said , he thinks germans should be prepared to dig deeper into their pockets for a good education . " it 's horrifying how little people are prepared to invest in learning , " he said . " they spend ten times more on entertainment than they do on education .

" every type of religion class comes with its own version of history , " explained peter schreiner , president of the intereuropean commission for church and school -lrb- iccs -rrb- .
" you can make comparisons , but there wo n't ever be a pan-european approach . " for now , he pointed out , each country decides itself how to organize classes , develop the syllabus and select teaching materials , train teachers - as well as providing options for students unwilling to attend religion classes . the way the topic of religion is treated varies widely across the continent .
in southern and eastern europe , finland , italy , austria and germany , religion classes are divided according to denomination . in other countries , including belgium , luxembourg , portugal and spain , students can opt for non-denominational alternatives , such as ethics , philosophy or values classes . germany and austria compulsory religion classes across germany 's states is a principle enshrined in the german constitution or ' grundgesetz ' , with one small opt-out clause , known as the " bremer clause " for certain states with a different legal status .
bremen and berlin , for example , are not governed by the legal obligation to provide religious education , as legislation already in existence when the ' grundgesetz ' was drawn up in 1949 takes precedence .
instead , these states offer ' biblical history ' and a discipline known as ler - ' life , ethics and religion . '
berlin , moreover , is the only german state where religion classes are the responsibility of the church rather than the state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in austria , students ca n't complain of lack of choice , with catholic , protestant , orthodox , new apostolic , jewish , islam and budhist classes available .
religion , whichever it is , is a compulsory subject in schools , while an alternative , non-denominational option has been also been available since 1997 . italy and greece catholic classes , not surprisingly , are a guaranteed fixture of the italian education system .
available to children from all backgrounds , religion became a voluntary subject in 1984 . other classes are also provided , but need to be paid for privately if sufficient pupils express interest .
alternatively , students can attend ' civic and human rights ' classes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek-orthodox priests before an easter baptism ceremony , river jordan , israel greece takes the opposite approach . here , orthodox classes are compulsory , regardless of personal faith . learning about religion in northern europe , england , wales and scotland , pupils can take religion - or a class in which they learn about the world 's different religions .

dw-world : work-life balance gets boost in germany dw-world : encouraging germans to have more kids dw-world : the dumbing down of germany dw-world : study : men in germany are scared to start families current affairs -pipe- 14.04.2005 gerd 's family policy gets down to business großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor wants to see more germans starting families by 2020 , germany will have europe 's lowest percentage of young people .
wednesday 's conference on family policy took a close look at the economic repercussions of the declining birth rate . as germany struggles to maintain the viability of its state pension scheme amid an imminent demographic crunch caused by falling birth rates and an ageing population , chancellor gerhard schröder on wednesday renewed his commitment to encouraging families to have children and outlined new initiatives which would provide financial and job benefits to working germans who decide to start a family or expand an existing one . children are our future , " said chancellor gerhard schröder at the conference called " family - success factor for the economy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " they are our future workforce , consumers and parents .
our future , our pensions and the economic strength of our country , rests in the hands of our children . " the family challenge the number of children born in germany has fallen a dramatic 50 per cent from 1.4 million in 1964 to just 700,000 in 2005 .
as the country 's unemployment figures continue to swell , to many , the prospect of raising a family seems just too challenging .
given the nation 's nagging economic woes , women in particular see the difficulty of combining child-rearing and career as too much of a deterrent . it 's a trend germany ca n't afford to let develop . " creating good conditions for families became an economic issue a long time ago , " said schröder .
a reduced younger generation means a declining workforce , lack of innovation and ever fewer consumers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we can not allow a woman to decide against having children because she 's reluctant to have to choose between having a child or having a career , " stressed schröder .
" we can not allow a family on a normal income to decide against another child for financial reasons . in future , family policy has to create conditions which enable more people to have children . " benefits for both sides in 2003 , the government joined forces with business to form the alliance for family policy , which aimed to develop improved work-family reconciliation policies . but despite the government 's efforts to provide day care and tax relief for families , germany is still short of some 1.2 million nursery places for children under three .
schröder pledged once again to increase day care for working families . " flexible working hours and family-friendly employment policies are good , because both sides reap benefits , " he insisted . throwing out the three-year job guarantee he also said industry should do more to support employees with children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but president of the german employers association , dieter hundt , pointed out that two thirds of all firms already offer their employees flexible schedules and that business should n't be blamed for the problem .
he contended that it was the state which has to reform its policies regarding families . for now , mothers are allowed to take up to six months of paid maternity leave and unpaid leave of up to three years . " something needs to change " " as far as employers are concerned , we need to take a new look at reducing parental leave , " said hundt .
" so far , our relatively generous family support of € 150 billion has led to neither higher birth rates nor improved integration of parents within the labor market .
something needs to change . " hundt believes that parents need to return to the work faster than is currently the norm , because the german economy simply ca n't afford to forfeit qualified workers with know-how . the government largely agrees .
its latest proposal , outlined at the conference by minister for family affairs renate schmidt , would introduce a sliding scale benefit scheme dependent on income . but as schröder said wednesday , the issue is by no means purely financial .
" parents need more infrastructures , not just more money , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : work-life balance gets boost in germany in germany , where kids are seen as career killers , over 40 percent of highly qualified women choose to remain childless .

dw-world : work-life balance gets boost in germany dw-world : encouraging germans to have more kids dw-world : the dumbing down of germany dw-world : study : men in germany are scared to start families current affairs -pipe- 14.04.2005 gerd 's family policy gets down to business großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor wants to see more germans starting families by 2020 , germany will have europe 's lowest percentage of young people .
wednesday 's conference on family policy took a close look at the economic repercussions of the declining birth rate . as germany struggles to maintain the viability of its state pension scheme amid an imminent demographic crunch caused by falling birth rates and an ageing population , chancellor gerhard schröder on wednesday renewed his commitment to encouraging families to have children and outlined new initiatives which would provide financial and job benefits to working germans who decide to start a family or expand an existing one . children are our future , " said chancellor gerhard schröder at the conference called " family - success factor for the economy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " they are our future workforce , consumers and parents .
our future , our pensions and the economic strength of our country , rests in the hands of our children . " the family challenge the number of children born in germany has fallen a dramatic 50 per cent from 1.4 million in 1964 to just 700,000 in 2005 .
as the country 's unemployment figures continue to swell , to many , the prospect of raising a family seems just too challenging .
given the nation 's nagging economic woes , women in particular see the difficulty of combining child-rearing and career as too much of a deterrent . it 's a trend germany ca n't afford to let develop . " creating good conditions for families became an economic issue a long time ago , " said schröder .
a reduced younger generation means a declining workforce , lack of innovation and ever fewer consumers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we can not allow a woman to decide against having children because she 's reluctant to have to choose between having a child or having a career , " stressed schröder .
" we can not allow a family on a normal income to decide against another child for financial reasons . in future , family policy has to create conditions which enable more people to have children . " benefits for both sides in 2003 , the government joined forces with business to form the alliance for family policy , which aimed to develop improved work-family reconciliation policies . but despite the government 's efforts to provide day care and tax relief for families , germany is still short of some 1.2 million nursery places for children under three .
schröder pledged once again to increase day care for working families . " flexible working hours and family-friendly employment policies are good , because both sides reap benefits , " he insisted . throwing out the three-year job guarantee he also said industry should do more to support employees with children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but president of the german employers association , dieter hundt , pointed out that two thirds of all firms already offer their employees flexible schedules and that business should n't be blamed for the problem .
he contended that it was the state which has to reform its policies regarding families . for now , mothers are allowed to take up to six months of paid maternity leave and unpaid leave of up to three years . " something needs to change " " as far as employers are concerned , we need to take a new look at reducing parental leave , " said hundt .
" so far , our relatively generous family support of € 150 billion has led to neither higher birth rates nor improved integration of parents within the labor market .
something needs to change . " hundt believes that parents need to return to the work faster than is currently the norm , because the german economy simply ca n't afford to forfeit qualified workers with know-how . the government largely agrees .
its latest proposal , outlined at the conference by minister for family affairs renate schmidt , would introduce a sliding scale benefit scheme dependent on income . but as schröder said wednesday , the issue is by no means purely financial .
" parents need more infrastructures , not just more money , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : work-life balance gets boost in germany in germany , where kids are seen as career killers , over 40 percent of highly qualified women choose to remain childless .
but a competition to find the nation 's most family-friendly companies is hoping to change that .

lessons organized by the churches would only be optional and would not free students of the obligation to attend the new ethics classes . the decision by berlin ’ s spd leadership has infuriated numerous federal politicians particularly from the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and bavaria ’ s arch-conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- . during a special parliamentary session in the federal parliament on wednesday , the cdu 's education spokespeople called berlin ’ s plan to introduce mandatory ethics lessons an aggressive assault on the christian faith in german society . the party ’ s hermann kues said the new lessons to be introduced in 2006 smacked too much of the anti-religious approach that teachers in former communist east germany preferred : a question of choice " the freedom of religion is one of our highest values , " kues said .
" i believe that the new ethics lessons as intended by berlin are not suitable to give school students a fair choice of whether to become believers or atheists .
there are references to god in our constitution or basic law , and we must not let anyone neglect values which in our society are so much based on christian faith . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang huber needless to say , the christian churches themselves have joined the critics ' chorus .
the head of germany 's protestant church council , wolfgang huber -lrb- photo -rrb- , declared that everything had to be done to prevent berlin from becoming godless . but wilhelm schmidt from the social democrat faction in the bundestag accused his political rivals of hypocrisy " no one prevents anyone from taking lessons in the religion of their choice , " schmidt complained .
" so why all the fuss now ?
none of the opponents of the berlin plan , he argued , ever complained about the fact that only a meager 20 percent of school students have taken part in voluntary lessons in christianity in the past few decades .
" and now all of a sudden you ’ re making such a fuss " , he told conservative mps . brandenburg success a template ethics lessons , which berlin is poised to make compulsory , were introduced in neighboring brandenburg as early as 1996 .
and according to the head of the region 's institute for education , jan hofmann , the subject has been a success . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students whose parent object will be in the minoroty , says jan hofmann " there ’ s only a very small group of school students whose parents categorically object to these lessons , " he said .
" and then there are those who have opted for lessons in religion offered by either the catholic or protestant church .
these children do not have to attend ethics classes .
i think that despite initial criticism our system has worked quite well and might serve as a model for other federal states . " it is possible that berlin may have to soften the compulsory status of its planned general ethics lessons , because germany ’ s conservative parties are intending to bring the issue before the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe . hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : back to belief in german schools last week 's emotional outpouring following the pope 's death has sparked excited calls from the faithful that christianity is back ' in ' .

a trend towards christian schooling in germany might just substantiate that belief . it 's a fact that both catholic and evangelical schools in germany are flourishing .
there are almost 2,000 christian schools scattered across the country and an increasing number of children waiting patiently to be given one of the highly coveted places .

but is the upturn really a reflection of a born-again faith ? the answer is no , at least not exclusively .
in fact it seems to have more to do with a belief in a better education than a belief in god .
jürgen frank , head of education for the evangelical church of germany says there are three main reasons for the recent rise in enthusiasm for christian schooling . " firstly , families are generally smaller and parents want to provide their children with a good education .
secondly , they want the education their children receive to meet their individual needs , and thirdly they want a progressive , modern education system , " he said . popular values ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from incense to wine , catholic children have a lot to learn andreas verhülsdonk , an expert on religious education in the catholic church , says that parents are drawn to catholicism because they know their children will be taught values and morality . " we run a project called " compassion " in which pupils spend three weeks with homeless or sick people , " he said .
" the point is not just to help the needy but to give the children the chance to see the world through the eyes of people living on the fringes of society . " but christoph hermann , who sends his son to an evangelical school in berlin says it is simply important to make christianity a part of daily life . " i would n't consider myself particularly religious , but the christian faith was a part of my upbringing and that is what i want for my son , " hermann said . " we live in an increasingly secular society and i do n't want him to grow up seeing christianity as something fundamental because he has n't been exposed to it in an everyday kind of way . " there 's more to it than just religion that , however , is not to say that denominational schools neglect reading , writing and arithmetic .
in fact they are legally bound to provide pupils with the same curricular options as state schools , with the only difference being compulsory religious education for an average of two hours each week .
hermann believes his son is getting a good deal . " christianity is helpful in learning to understand our culture and it equips children to better understand art and history as well , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young children practice their abc and that is not all .
according to frank , children at evangelical schools in germany learn to read and write better than their state school counterparts . " a study we carried out after the publication of the pisa report revealed that the educational climate at christian schools is better than in state schools , and that the quality on offer at demoninational schools genuinely does live up to its reputation , " he said . indeed , that reputation appears to have run away with the imagination of some determined and diligent parents .
since the fall of the berlin wall , the church has given its blessing to the founding of some 70 new evangelical schools and there are 50 more would-be 's waiting in the wings .
but getting such a venture off the ground is no easy feat . " we have to clear a lot of hurdles , many of them financial , before a new school can be founded , " frank said . hurdles to new beginnings new school initiatives receive a grant from the evangelical church to see them through the first three or four years until the government starts paying an annual subsistence worth some 90 percent of the regular state school budget .
but frank says church funds are running dry . " we used to pay start-up schools some 240,000 euros -lrb- $ 309,000 -rrb- for those first few years , but now with so many waiting , we ca n't afford to do that , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children can be non-denominational and still attend a protestant school most of these projects depend very heavily on the driving parental force behind them , not only to put sponsorship or financing in place , but to find and renovate premises , to interview and hire staff , and of course to handpick the protégées . the selection criteria vary from school to school , state to state and church to church .
in the case of catholics , the emphasis is on accepting children who are being brought up within the framework of the faith , whereas the evangelical church takes a more relaxed approach to the religious background of its recruits . what they want to achieve , they say , is a good social mix . but is it illusory to think that 's really possible in schools that require tuition ?

lessons organized by the churches would only be optional and would not free students of the obligation to attend the new ethics classes . the decision by berlin ’ s spd leadership has infuriated numerous federal politicians particularly from the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and bavaria ’ s arch-conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- . during a special parliamentary session in the federal parliament on wednesday , the cdu 's education spokespeople called berlin ’ s plan to introduce mandatory ethics lessons an aggressive assault on the christian faith in german society . the party ’ s hermann kues said the new lessons to be introduced in 2006 smacked too much of the anti-religious approach that teachers in former communist east germany preferred : a question of choice " the freedom of religion is one of our highest values , " kues said .
" i believe that the new ethics lessons as intended by berlin are not suitable to give school students a fair choice of whether to become believers or atheists .
there are references to god in our constitution or basic law , and we must not let anyone neglect values which in our society are so much based on christian faith . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang huber needless to say , the christian churches themselves have joined the critics ' chorus .
the head of germany 's protestant church council , wolfgang huber -lrb- photo -rrb- , declared that everything had to be done to prevent berlin from becoming godless . but wilhelm schmidt from the social democrat faction in the bundestag accused his political rivals of hypocrisy " no one prevents anyone from taking lessons in the religion of their choice , " schmidt complained .
" so why all the fuss now ?
none of the opponents of the berlin plan , he argued , ever complained about the fact that only a meager 20 percent of school students have taken part in voluntary lessons in christianity in the past few decades .
" and now all of a sudden you ’ re making such a fuss " , he told conservative mps . brandenburg success a template ethics lessons , which berlin is poised to make compulsory , were introduced in neighboring brandenburg as early as 1996 .
and according to the head of the region 's institute for education , jan hofmann , the subject has been a success . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students whose parent object will be in the minoroty , says jan hofmann " there ’ s only a very small group of school students whose parents categorically object to these lessons , " he said .
" and then there are those who have opted for lessons in religion offered by either the catholic or protestant church .
these children do not have to attend ethics classes .
i think that despite initial criticism our system has worked quite well and might serve as a model for other federal states . " it is possible that berlin may have to soften the compulsory status of its planned general ethics lessons , because germany ’ s conservative parties are intending to bring the issue before the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe . hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : back to belief in german schools last week 's emotional outpouring following the pope 's death has sparked excited calls from the faithful that christianity is back ' in ' .
a trend towards christian schooling in germany might just substantiate that belief .

researchers found nearly a third fewer women in the south asian community in england and wales develop breast cancer than among all other ethnic groups .
the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine team also found more south asians survived for five years after diagnosis than other groups .
but the researchers were unable to pinpoint the reason for the findings .
report co-author michel coleman said it was " difficult to explain " , suggesting diet and lifestyle could play a role .
and dr coleman added : " we can speculate that differential access to treatment or differences in tumour biology , or both , may contribute to the differences in survival . "
" previous studies have shown that migrants from low risk countries are likely to acquire the risk of their host country within two generations " nicola o 'connor , of cancer research uk however , dr coleman said the results could play an important role in developing health services for the south asian population , which is the largest ethnic minority group in the uk , making up 3 % of the population .
" data on cancer incidence , survival , and mortality are vital to address the public health concerns of ethnic minorities , but such data remains sparse in the uk . "
the team analysed data on 116,000 women who were diagnosed with breast cancer between 1986 and 1990 .
the annual rate of breast cancer diagnosis among south asian women was 40.5 per 100,000 , compared to 57.4 per 100,000 for the rest of the population .
survival researchers also found 70 % of south asian women were alive five years after diagnosis , while 67 % of women from other groups were .
the study , published in the journal of epidemiology and community health , also found survival rates were 9 % higher for the most affluent groups , but south asian women were still more likely to survive .
us studies on breast cancer have also found similar results .
nicola o 'connor , information manager at cancer research uk , said : " incidence rates vary considerably from country to country and between different ethnic groups .
" understanding the reasons for these variations is an important area of research and this study presents a number of interesting findings on breast cancer incidence and survival in south asian women living in the uk .
" we know that south asia has some of the lowest rates of breast cancer in the world while the uk has some of the highest . "
" previous studies have shown that migrants from low risk countries are likely to acquire the risk of their host country within two generations . "
she said demographic influences , such as deprivation and access to treatment , were major influences on disease and survival rates .

a gold pocket watch which stopped ticking in the atlantic will also be on sale , as will a poster promoting the ship 's return trip from new york .
thursday marks the 93rd anniversary of the sinking of the belfast-built liner on 14 april 1912 .
the auction will take place in a museum in massachusetts on 1 may .
the watch belonged to a woman who was visiting her mother in limerick .
nora keane , an irish immigrant , lived in harrisburg , pennsylvania , with her brothers and sisters .
following a four-month visit to her mother in castle connell , county limerick , nora decided to return on the maiden voyage of rms titanic , boarding at queenstown .
she was rescued in a lifeboat and the watch was with her at the time .
it suffered from water damage when the lifeboat passed under the ship 's pump discharge .
its gilt face has some rust staining , but it is still expected to fetch £ 2,600-3,600 .
original poster perhaps the rarest of items to be sold will be the menu from the ship .
it details the meals available on the day the ship sank on one side of the card , whilst the reverse carries pencil annotations of the passengers on board .
breakfast that day consisted of oatmeal , porridge and milk , smoked herrings , jacket potatoes , ham and eggs , fresh bread & butter , marmalade , swedish bread , tea and coffee dinner was rice soup , fresh bread , cabin biscuits , roast beef and brown gravy , sweet corn , boiled potatoes , plum pudding , sweet sauce and fruit .
tea was cold meat , cheese and pickles , fresh bread and butter , stewed figs and rice , and tea .
sheet music supper consisted of gruel , cabin biscuits and cheese .
the menu survived the disaster in the handbag of 3rd class passenger , sarah roth .
also up for auction is an original poster prepared by white star line 's new york office to promote the return titanic trip from new york on 20 april .
following the disaster , the posters were withdrawn and surviving examples are extremely rare .
they are estimated to be worth between £ 10,600 and £ 15,300 .
also up for sale are letters from passengers , theatre programmes of special charity performances to benefit titanic disaster charities and even a collection of sheet music .
the auction by bonhams & butterfields will take place at the larz anderson auto museum in brookline , massachusetts .

unlike health and education , which are devolved to the welsh assembly , policy on crime and policing remains fully in the hands of the uk government .
however , the four main welsh parties have issued their own policies on law and order .
it means that crime remains a key welsh electoral battleground ahead of 5 may .
according to the latest figures , crime in wales is generally lower than in england as a whole , with only drugs offences at higher levels in wales than across the border .

while burglary , robbery and vehicle crime occur less in wales , there has , in common with other areas of the uk , been a perceived rise in anti-social behaviour .
the uk government introduced anti social behaviour orders -lrb- asbos -rrb- in 1999 to tackle persistent nuisance behaviour , with further powers introduced under the 2003 anti-social behaviour act .
asbos were not widely used at first , but in some areas , they have become a popular means of tackling problems such as drunkenness , intimidation , verbal abuse and nuisance neighbours .
burglary in wales total offences - 8,204 offences per 1,000 population - 2.8 offences per 1,000 england / wales population - 3.7 source : home office , jan-march 2004 however , the four welsh police force areas have seen the use of asbos more sparingly than some of their counterparts in england .
across wales , just 67 asbos were issued during the first nine months of 2004 compared to 279 in the greater manchester force area alone .
in cases which have resulted in asbos being issued , victims of anti-social behaviour said the legislation had helped end disorder in their communities .
gangs of youths in 2004 , cardiff 's bayside estate saw an order issued to disperse gangs of youths who had caused problems for residents .
june johnson , who lives on the estate , said this week : " for 16 months we had gangs of youths just running rampant , causing a lot of harassment and displaying a heck of a lot of anti-social behaviour .
fewer burglaries take place in wales according to official figures " they smashed streetlights , smashed water mains , burned out cars , wrecked the children 's play area and made sure that no-one could go out of their homes after 8pm because of fear of harassment , intimidation and even violence .
" we fought to get this anti-social behaviour terminated .
" asbos are totally beneficial to us .
without that order , a lot more damage would have been done on bayside . "
but not all agencies involved in tackling crime in wales believe using asbos represent the answer to all nuisance behaviour .
in swansea , the city 's youth offending team favour early intervention in youth offending , rather than the final resort of an asbo .
inspector bryan heard , of south wales police 's community safety department , said : " where we 've taken the system in swansea is looking at the underlying problems and trying to eradicate them .

eddie isles , the city 's youth offending team manager , added : " we 've been very careful about the use of asbos in wales .
" an example would be leeds where 50 asbos were imposed in one day in the youth courts .
" realistically this could be just a badge to a youngster .
this could be just a statement that they 've made it . "
in wales , labour , the conservatives and the lib dems have all pledged to continue the use of asbos , while plaid cymru added the problem of anti-social behaviour should be tackled by tackling the wider causes of nuisance behaviour .

policing and how it is paid for labour labour said its eight years in government have seen a record number of police officers patrolling the streets of wales , with 850 more recruited since 1997 .
labour has pledged to introduce high-visibility " local policing teams " in every community to try to lessen fear of crime .
labour also said it had reduced paperwork with 7,700 forms now obsolete and promised to reduce bureaucracy further , freeing up thousands more officers by 2008 .
the conservatives have pledged to recruit 5,000 new police officers each year across wales and england .
they have also unveiled plans to cut paperwork and introduce elected police commissioners to give communities " a say over police priorities " .
they would focus on " zero tolerance " measures , adding that freeing police from " unnecessary bureaucracy " would mean more officers would be available to walk the beat .
liberal democrats the party plans to put 500 more police " on top of labour 's plans " on the streets of wales to cut crime and the fear of crime .
the lib dems have pledged to abandon " labour 's expensive , illiberal and ineffective id card scheme " allowing them to pay for the extra officers .
plaid cymru plaid cymru has called for control of the criminal justice system and powers over police to be devolved to the welsh assembly .
the party has said more police are needed on the streets of wales and has proposed reducing the amount of time officers have to spend acting as witnesses in court and cutting bureaucracy by employing more civilians to handle paperwork .
plaid has also said that known " trouble spots " should be targeted using specially-trained officers .
prison vs community sentencing labour the party has pledged to " continue to re-balance the criminal justice system in favour of the victim of crime rather than the perpetrators of crime " .
it has also promised to introduce " tougher sentences " for carrying replica guns , for those involved in serious knife crime and for those convicted of assaulting workers serving the public .
it added : " life will mean life for the worst murderers . "
the party said non-custodial sentences would be " rigorously adhered to " and that it would renew public confidence by " renewing the emphasis on offenders paying back society for the crime they have committed " through unpaid community work .
the welsh tories ' view is that " prison is necessary " .
the party has pledged 20,000 extra prison places in england and wales .
it also plans to introduce a policy which will see criminals serving the full sentence handed down by the court .
rehabilitation " will take place behind bars " .
lib dems the welsh lib dems have emphasised rehabilitation as part of their crime policy .
non-violent criminals would be required to do " tough community work instead of jail " .
the party claims that this approach reduces re-offending , gives offenders skills for legitimate work and means that they pay back to the community .
" community justice panels " would be set up to give people more say in the punishment offenders carry out - for example , by making them clean up graffiti or repair damage to victims ' property .
plaid cymru plaid cymru has called for funding to be targeted at " an effective , rehabilitation-oriented system " .
according to plaid , sentencing is " too often out of proportion to the crime committed -lrb- with -rrb- women in particular often jailed for minor offences where a fine or community sentence would be more appropriate . "
while focusing on rehabilitation and on expanding community sentences , the party said it recognised that prisons are essential and planned " two new prisons in wales , one specifically for women and one for north wales " .
the party has also pledged a stronger emphasis on rehabilitation in the prison system .
anti social behaviour orders labour labour said the 144 asbos enforced across wales since the scheme 's introduction had made " a real difference " to communities affected by nuisance behaviour .
the party said the introduction of asbos , together with dispersal orders to move on gangs and on-the-spot fines meant police and local councils had the " power to deal effectively with the problems of anti-social behaviour " .
labour said tackling anti-social behaviour would continue to be a priority in a third term .
the conservatives have pledged extra police officers to ensure that those who breach the terms of asbos are arrested and prosecuted .
the party said that anti-social behaviour such as vandalism , graffiti , binge-drinking and threatening behaviour requires " active community policing and a relentless focus on catching , convicting and punishing criminals . "
lib dems the lib dems in wales have said they would continue to use asbos to tackle low-level crime , along with other measures .
they said : " unacceptable noise and offensive behaviour will be tackled with ' acceptable behaviour contracts ' agreed between the individual , their family , the police and the local authority . "
where people do not co-operate , the party said it would use asbos , plus " appropriate measures to tackle underlying causes " .
plaid cymru plaid cymru has pledged an all-agency approach to problems of anti-social behaviour .
plaid said the causes of problems such as vandalism , littering and graffiti should be dealt with by " improvements to the economy , education , housing and social justice , and providing facilities in the community that offer alternatives to criminal or other harmful activities " .
drink and drugs and related crime labour the party said it had introduced powers to clamp down on " the thuggish minority of drinkers " giving police the power to object to licence applications , more powers to close rowdy premises and to impose tougher penalties for selling alcohol to drunks or to children .
labour said the introduction of flexible licensing laws would " help reduce alcohol-related crime when large numbers of customers are on the streets immediately following fixed closing times " .
labour has also pledged to introduce " compulsory drug-testing at arrest for all property and drug offenders , " with compulsory treatment assessment for those testing positive .
labour added it would invest in more drug rehabilitation services .
welsh conservative policy is to " break the link between drugs and crime " .
the party pledged to expand drug treatment programmes and give young users of hard drugs a choice - effective treatment or appearing in court .
the tories have also promised to reverse the reclassification of cannabis , changing it from a class c to a class b drug .
the party 's view on drink-related crime is that " a great deal of disorder is fuelled by excessive drinking , which makes many of our town and city centres dangerous places at night " .
the tories have said they will ensure pubs and clubs which sell alcohol to minors or those who are already drunk are closed .
lib dems the lib dems ' drugs policy would see police effort concentrated on " tackling drug traffickers and those drug users who resort to crime to feed their habits , rather than on criminalising people possessing cannabis only for their own personal use " .
the party has pledged to crack down on problems related to binge drinking by targeting licensees who serve people alcohol when they are drunk or underage .
the lib dems have also proposed charging late-night venues for policing costs .
plaid cymru according to plaid cymru , the uk government 's " 30-year war on drugs has failed miserably " .
plaid has pledged to tackle social problems that result from drug and alcohol misuse and said rehabilitation programmes were the most effective way of dealing with them .
plaid also said it opposed new licensing laws permitting 24-hour drinking adding that it would place " heavy additional burdens on the police " .
the party has pledged to enforce current licensing laws , to back legislation holding pub and club owners responsible costs arising from customers ' behaviour , stricter controls on how drinks are advertised and compulsory health warnings on alcoholic drinks .

while crime is an area which is not devolved , the parties in wales have developed their own policies to put before the voters .
below is a comparison of what labour , the conservatives , the liberal democrats and plaid cymru would do to tackle four key areas of law and order if each was in power .
policing and how it is paid for prison vs community sentencing anti-social behaviour orders drink and drugs and related crime policing and how it is paid for labour labour said its eight years in government have seen a record number of police officers patrolling the streets of wales , with 850 more recruited since 1997 .
labour has pledged to introduce high-visibility " local policing teams " in every community to try to lessen fear of crime .
labour also said it had reduced paperwork with 7,700 forms now obsolete and promised to reduce bureaucracy further , freeing up thousands more officers by 2008 .
conservatives the conservatives have pledged to recruit 5,000 new police officers each year across wales and england .
they have also unveiled plans to cut paperwork and introduce elected police commissioners to give communities " a say over police priorities " .
they would focus on " zero tolerance " measures , adding that freeing police from " unnecessary bureaucracy " would mean more officers would be available to walk the beat .
liberal democrats the party plans to put 500 more police " on top of labour 's plans " on the streets of wales to cut crime and the fear of crime .
the lib dems have pledged to abandon " labour 's expensive , illiberal and ineffective id card scheme " allowing them to pay for the extra officers .
plaid cymru plaid cymru has called for control of the criminal justice system and powers over police to be devolved to the welsh assembly .
the party has said more police are needed on the streets of wales and has proposed reducing the amount of time officers have to spend acting as witnesses in court and cutting bureaucracy by employing more civilians to handle paperwork .
plaid has also said that known " trouble spots " should be targeted using specially-trained officers .
back to top prison vs community sentencing labour the party has pledged to " continue to re-balance the criminal justice system in favour of the victim of crime rather than the perpetrators of crime " .
it has also promised to introduce " tougher sentences " for carrying replica guns , for those involved in serious knife crime and for those convicted of assaulting workers serving the public .
it added : " life will mean life for the worst murderers . "
the party said non-custodial sentences would be " rigorously adhered to " and that it would renew public confidence by " renewing the emphasis on offenders paying back society for the crime they have committed " through unpaid community work .
conservatives the welsh tories ' view is that " prison is necessary " .
the party has pledged 20,000 extra prison places in england and wales .
it also plans to introduce a policy which will see criminals serving the full sentence handed down by the court .
rehabilitation " will take place behind bars " .
lib dems the welsh lib dems have emphasised rehabilitation as part of their crime policy .
non-violent criminals would be required to do " tough community work instead of jail " .
the party claims that this approach reduces re-offending , gives offenders skills for legitimate work and means that they pay back to the community .
" community justice panels " would be set up to give people more say in the punishment offenders carry out - for example , by making them clean up graffiti or repair damage to victims ' property .
plaid cymru plaid cymru has called for funding to be targeted at " an effective , rehabilitation-oriented system " .
according to plaid , sentencing is " too often out of proportion to the crime committed -lrb- with -rrb- women in particular often jailed for minor offences where a fine or community sentence would be more appropriate . "
while focusing on rehabilitation and on expanding community sentences , the party said it recognised that prisons are essential and planned " two new prisons in wales , one specifically for women and one for north wales " .
the party has also pledged a stronger emphasis on rehabilitation in the prison system .
back to top anti social behaviour orders labour labour said the 144 asbos enforced across wales since the scheme 's introduction had made " a real difference " to communities affected by nuisance behaviour .
the party said the introduction of asbos , together with dispersal orders to move on gangs and on-the-spot fines meant police and local councils had the " power to deal effectively with the problems of anti-social behaviour " .
labour said tackling anti-social behaviour would continue to be a priority in a third term .
conservatives the conservatives have pledged extra police officers to ensure that those who breach the terms of asbos are arrested and prosecuted .
the party said that anti-social behaviour such as vandalism , graffiti , binge-drinking and threatening behaviour requires " active community policing and a relentless focus on catching , convicting and punishing criminals . "
lib dems the lib dems in wales have said they would continue to use asbos to tackle low-level crime , along with other measures .
they said : " unacceptable noise and offensive behaviour will be tackled with ' acceptable behaviour contracts ' agreed between the individual , their family , the police and the local authority . "
where people do not co-operate , the party said it would use asbos , plus " appropriate measures to tackle underlying causes " .

while crime is an area which is not devolved , the parties in wales have developed their own policies to put before the voters .
below is a comparison of what labour , the conservatives , the liberal democrats and plaid cymru would do to tackle four key areas of law and order if each was in power .
policing and how it is paid for prison vs community sentencing anti-social behaviour orders drink and drugs and related crime policing and how it is paid for labour labour said its eight years in government have seen a record number of police officers patrolling the streets of wales , with 850 more recruited since 1997 .
labour has pledged to introduce high-visibility " local policing teams " in every community to try to lessen fear of crime .
labour also said it had reduced paperwork with 7,700 forms now obsolete and promised to reduce bureaucracy further , freeing up thousands more officers by 2008 .
conservatives the conservatives have pledged to recruit 5,000 new police officers each year across wales and england .
they have also unveiled plans to cut paperwork and introduce elected police commissioners to give communities " a say over police priorities " .
they would focus on " zero tolerance " measures , adding that freeing police from " unnecessary bureaucracy " would mean more officers would be available to walk the beat .
liberal democrats the party plans to put 500 more police " on top of labour 's plans " on the streets of wales to cut crime and the fear of crime .
the lib dems have pledged to abandon " labour 's expensive , illiberal and ineffective id card scheme " allowing them to pay for the extra officers .
plaid cymru plaid cymru has called for control of the criminal justice system and powers over police to be devolved to the welsh assembly .
the party has said more police are needed on the streets of wales and has proposed reducing the amount of time officers have to spend acting as witnesses in court and cutting bureaucracy by employing more civilians to handle paperwork .
plaid has also said that known " trouble spots " should be targeted using specially-trained officers .
back to top prison vs community sentencing labour the party has pledged to " continue to re-balance the criminal justice system in favour of the victim of crime rather than the perpetrators of crime " .
it has also promised to introduce " tougher sentences " for carrying replica guns , for those involved in serious knife crime and for those convicted of assaulting workers serving the public .
it added : " life will mean life for the worst murderers . "
the party said non-custodial sentences would be " rigorously adhered to " and that it would renew public confidence by " renewing the emphasis on offenders paying back society for the crime they have committed " through unpaid community work .
conservatives the welsh tories ' view is that " prison is necessary " .
the party has pledged 20,000 extra prison places in england and wales .
it also plans to introduce a policy which will see criminals serving the full sentence handed down by the court .
rehabilitation " will take place behind bars " .
lib dems the welsh lib dems have emphasised rehabilitation as part of their crime policy .
non-violent criminals would be required to do " tough community work instead of jail " .
the party claims that this approach reduces re-offending , gives offenders skills for legitimate work and means that they pay back to the community .
" community justice panels " would be set up to give people more say in the punishment offenders carry out - for example , by making them clean up graffiti or repair damage to victims ' property .
plaid cymru plaid cymru has called for funding to be targeted at " an effective , rehabilitation-oriented system " .
according to plaid , sentencing is " too often out of proportion to the crime committed -lrb- with -rrb- women in particular often jailed for minor offences where a fine or community sentence would be more appropriate . "
while focusing on rehabilitation and on expanding community sentences , the party said it recognised that prisons are essential and planned " two new prisons in wales , one specifically for women and one for north wales " .
the party has also pledged a stronger emphasis on rehabilitation in the prison system .
back to top anti social behaviour orders labour labour said the 144 asbos enforced across wales since the scheme 's introduction had made " a real difference " to communities affected by nuisance behaviour .
the party said the introduction of asbos , together with dispersal orders to move on gangs and on-the-spot fines meant police and local councils had the " power to deal effectively with the problems of anti-social behaviour " .
labour said tackling anti-social behaviour would continue to be a priority in a third term .
conservatives the conservatives have pledged extra police officers to ensure that those who breach the terms of asbos are arrested and prosecuted .
the party said that anti-social behaviour such as vandalism , graffiti , binge-drinking and threatening behaviour requires " active community policing and a relentless focus on catching , convicting and punishing criminals . "
lib dems the lib dems in wales have said they would continue to use asbos to tackle low-level crime , along with other measures .
they said : " unacceptable noise and offensive behaviour will be tackled with ' acceptable behaviour contracts ' agreed between the individual , their family , the police and the local authority . "
where people do not co-operate , the party said it would use asbos , plus " appropriate measures to tackle underlying causes " .
plaid cymru plaid cymru has pledged an all-agency approach to problems of anti-social behaviour .
plaid said the causes of problems such as vandalism , littering and graffiti should be dealt with by " improvements to the economy , education , housing and social justice , and providing facilities in the community that offer alternatives to criminal or other harmful activities " .
back to top drink and drugs and related crime labour the party said it had introduced powers to clamp down on " the thuggish minority of drinkers " giving police the power to object to licence applications , more powers to close rowdy premises and to impose tougher penalties for selling alcohol to drunks or to children .
labour said the introduction of flexible licensing laws would " help reduce alcohol-related crime when large numbers of customers are on the streets immediately following fixed closing times " .
labour has also pledged to introduce " compulsory drug-testing at arrest for all property and drug offenders , " with compulsory treatment assessment for those testing positive .
labour added it would invest in more drug rehabilitation services .
conservatives welsh conservative policy is to " break the link between drugs and crime " .
the party pledged to expand drug treatment programmes and give young users of hard drugs a choice - effective treatment or appearing in court .
the tories have also promised to reverse the reclassification of cannabis , changing it from a class c to a class b drug .
the party 's view on drink-related crime is that " a great deal of disorder is fuelled by excessive drinking , which makes many of our town and city centres dangerous places at night " .
the tories have said they will ensure pubs and clubs which sell alcohol to minors or those who are already drunk are closed .
lib dems the lib dems ' drugs policy would see police effort concentrated on " tackling drug traffickers and those drug users who resort to crime to feed their habits , rather than on criminalising people possessing cannabis only for their own personal use " .
the party has pledged to crack down on problems related to binge drinking by targeting licensees who serve people alcohol when they are drunk or underage .
the lib dems have also proposed charging late-night venues for policing costs .
plaid cymru according to plaid cymru , the uk government 's " 30-year war on drugs has failed miserably " .
plaid has pledged to tackle social problems that result from drug and alcohol misuse and said rehabilitation programmes were the most effective way of dealing with them .
plaid also said it opposed new licensing laws permitting 24-hour drinking adding that it would place " heavy additional burdens on the police " .
the party has pledged to enforce current licensing laws , to back legislation holding pub and club owners responsible costs arising from customers ' behaviour , stricter controls on how drinks are advertised and compulsory health warnings on alcoholic drinks .

policing and how it is paid for prison vs community sentencing anti-social behaviour orders drink and drugs and related crime policing and how it is paid for labour labour said its eight years in government have seen a record number of police officers patrolling the streets of wales , with 850 more recruited since 1997 .
labour has pledged to introduce high-visibility " local policing teams " in every community to try to lessen fear of crime .
labour also said it had reduced paperwork with 7,700 forms now obsolete and promised to reduce bureaucracy further , freeing up thousands more officers by 2008 .
conservatives the conservatives have pledged to recruit 5,000 new police officers each year across wales and england .
they have also unveiled plans to cut paperwork and introduce elected police commissioners to give communities " a say over police priorities " .
they would focus on " zero tolerance " measures , adding that freeing police from " unnecessary bureaucracy " would mean more officers would be available to walk the beat .
liberal democrats the party plans to put 500 more police " on top of labour 's plans " on the streets of wales to cut crime and the fear of crime .
the lib dems have pledged to abandon " labour 's expensive , illiberal and ineffective id card scheme " allowing them to pay for the extra officers .
plaid cymru plaid cymru has called for control of the criminal justice system and powers over police to be devolved to the welsh assembly .
the party has said more police are needed on the streets of wales and has proposed reducing the amount of time officers have to spend acting as witnesses in court and cutting bureaucracy by employing more civilians to handle paperwork .
plaid has also said that known " trouble spots " should be targeted using specially-trained officers .
back to top prison vs community sentencing labour the party has pledged to " continue to re-balance the criminal justice system in favour of the victim of crime rather than the perpetrators of crime " .
it has also promised to introduce " tougher sentences " for carrying replica guns , for those involved in serious knife crime and for those convicted of assaulting workers serving the public .
it added : " life will mean life for the worst murderers . "
the party said non-custodial sentences would be " rigorously adhered to " and that it would renew public confidence by " renewing the emphasis on offenders paying back society for the crime they have committed " through unpaid community work .
conservatives the welsh tories ' view is that " prison is necessary " .
the party has pledged 20,000 extra prison places in england and wales .
it also plans to introduce a policy which will see criminals serving the full sentence handed down by the court .
rehabilitation " will take place behind bars " .
lib dems the welsh lib dems have emphasised rehabilitation as part of their crime policy .
non-violent criminals would be required to do " tough community work instead of jail " .
the party claims that this approach reduces re-offending , gives offenders skills for legitimate work and means that they pay back to the community .
" community justice panels " would be set up to give people more say in the punishment offenders carry out - for example , by making them clean up graffiti or repair damage to victims ' property .
plaid cymru plaid cymru has called for funding to be targeted at " an effective , rehabilitation-oriented system " .
according to plaid , sentencing is " too often out of proportion to the crime committed -lrb- with -rrb- women in particular often jailed for minor offences where a fine or community sentence would be more appropriate . "
while focusing on rehabilitation and on expanding community sentences , the party said it recognised that prisons are essential and planned " two new prisons in wales , one specifically for women and one for north wales " .
the party has also pledged a stronger emphasis on rehabilitation in the prison system .
back to top anti social behaviour orders labour labour said the 144 asbos enforced across wales since the scheme 's introduction had made " a real difference " to communities affected by nuisance behaviour .
the party said the introduction of asbos , together with dispersal orders to move on gangs and on-the-spot fines meant police and local councils had the " power to deal effectively with the problems of anti-social behaviour " .
labour said tackling anti-social behaviour would continue to be a priority in a third term .
conservatives the conservatives have pledged extra police officers to ensure that those who breach the terms of asbos are arrested and prosecuted .
the party said that anti-social behaviour such as vandalism , graffiti , binge-drinking and threatening behaviour requires " active community policing and a relentless focus on catching , convicting and punishing criminals . "
lib dems the lib dems in wales have said they would continue to use asbos to tackle low-level crime , along with other measures .
they said : " unacceptable noise and offensive behaviour will be tackled with ' acceptable behaviour contracts ' agreed between the individual , their family , the police and the local authority . "
where people do not co-operate , the party said it would use asbos , plus " appropriate measures to tackle underlying causes " .
plaid cymru plaid cymru has pledged an all-agency approach to problems of anti-social behaviour .
plaid said the causes of problems such as vandalism , littering and graffiti should be dealt with by " improvements to the economy , education , housing and social justice , and providing facilities in the community that offer alternatives to criminal or other harmful activities " .
back to top drink and drugs and related crime labour the party said it had introduced powers to clamp down on " the thuggish minority of drinkers " giving police the power to object to licence applications , more powers to close rowdy premises and to impose tougher penalties for selling alcohol to drunks or to children .
labour said the introduction of flexible licensing laws would " help reduce alcohol-related crime when large numbers of customers are on the streets immediately following fixed closing times " .
labour has also pledged to introduce " compulsory drug-testing at arrest for all property and drug offenders , " with compulsory treatment assessment for those testing positive .
labour added it would invest in more drug rehabilitation services .
conservatives welsh conservative policy is to " break the link between drugs and crime " .
the party pledged to expand drug treatment programmes and give young users of hard drugs a choice - effective treatment or appearing in court .
the tories have also promised to reverse the reclassification of cannabis , changing it from a class c to a class b drug .
the party 's view on drink-related crime is that " a great deal of disorder is fuelled by excessive drinking , which makes many of our town and city centres dangerous places at night " .
the tories have said they will ensure pubs and clubs which sell alcohol to minors or those who are already drunk are closed .
lib dems the lib dems ' drugs policy would see police effort concentrated on " tackling drug traffickers and those drug users who resort to crime to feed their habits , rather than on criminalising people possessing cannabis only for their own personal use " .
the party has pledged to crack down on problems related to binge drinking by targeting licensees who serve people alcohol when they are drunk or underage .
the lib dems have also proposed charging late-night venues for policing costs .
plaid cymru according to plaid cymru , the uk government 's " 30-year war on drugs has failed miserably " .
plaid has pledged to tackle social problems that result from drug and alcohol misuse and said rehabilitation programmes were the most effective way of dealing with them .
plaid also said it opposed new licensing laws permitting 24-hour drinking adding that it would place " heavy additional burdens on the police " .
the party has pledged to enforce current licensing laws , to back legislation holding pub and club owners responsible costs arising from customers ' behaviour , stricter controls on how drinks are advertised and compulsory health warnings on alcoholic drinks .

the yorkshire wolds and coast primary care trust has overshot its budget by £ 7m , prompting the need for a review .
conservative and lib dem candidates say the alfred bean hospital in driffield , hornsea cottage hospital and withernsea community hospital are under threat .
labour says none of them will close and claims services will actually improve .
' sheer incompetence ' graham stuart , conservative candidate for beverley and holderness , is calling for assurances that the community hospitals under the primary care trust -lrb- pct -rrb- will not be closed .
" only recently a resident of hornsea wrote to me to ask for my help because she was frightened of what will happen to her if the hornsea community hospital closes down , " he said .
" i am proud that these hospitals received nothing but investment and support in the 18 years of conservative government and yet now , with taxes going through the roof , labour 's sheer incompetence has led to big deficits at the pct and now this threat to vital hospital services . "
mr stuart said that if he was elected he would call for an immediate debate on the trust 's future .
labour candidate george mcmanus said there were " no plans whatsoever " to close any of the community hospitals in the area .
he said : " in fact , the government has allocated an additional £ 30m to the primary care trust budget .
" saying hospitals are to close is scare-mongering and preys on the vulnerable members of the community .
the results of the review will not be announced until after the election " yes , services are being reviewed by the pct but this is because they now have more money .
" and no , the pct will not give guarantees about the future because there is the review .
but labour can guarantee services will only but improve . "
however , liberal democrat candidate stewart willie believes there is a strong possibility that at least one of the three hospitals will close .
" the main question should not be is a hospital going to close , but is it being run in a proper manner , and in my opinion the answer is no .
" on a number of consecutive years the pct has gone into overspend and has been unable to get back into balance .
" now the review is looking at closing one or more of the three hospitals under the pct .
in a wider context , people could quite easily blame the government for that , but to lay all the blame at its door is blatant politics and a means to score points .
" if elected i will be working with all interested parties to ensure a solution to keep the hospitals open and ensure services remain .
" if one of the three was to close , the favourite , i think , would be hornsea which would be devastating to the people in that area , meaning residents in rural areas would have to travel miles to use services that they are entitled to . "
