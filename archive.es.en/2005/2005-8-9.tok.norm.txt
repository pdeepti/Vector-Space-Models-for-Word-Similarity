now , the american sec is investigating possible wrongdoing by daimlerchrysler in connection with the program . the growing list of german corporations involved in scandals - bmw , infineon , volkswagen , commerzbank - got a little longer after reports surfaced that the united states security and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- is investigating whether german carmaker daimlerchrysler was involved in corrupt deals in the un oil-for-food program .
the company confirmed the sec probe on german public radio .
" we are working on this matter together with the sec and will send them the results of our investigations , " a company spokesperson said .
under investigation is whether daimlerchrysler deliveries to iraq under then-dictator saddam hussein violated us anti-corruption laws .
the sec has demanded files and bank documents from the carmaker .
vehicles shipped to iraq via russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benon sevan , former head of un humanitarian programs in iraq , has been accused of corruption the un 's oil-for-food program , designed to allow the iraqi population access to food despite strict un sanctions , was in operation from 1996 to 2003 .
it has since come under heavy fire for widespread corruption in its ranks .
the accusations range from money laundering to kickbacks and conspiracy .
on tuesday , a leading figure in the program , alexander yakovlev , admitted to money laundering and other charges .
an independent panel led by paul volcker , former us federal reserve bank chair , has also accused the former head of the program , benon sevan , of receiving kickbacks .
the german newsmagazine stern is planning to report in its next issue that the sec is looking into the sale of daimlerchrysler actros trucks -lrb- photo -rrb- .
in 2002 , iraq had ordered 150 of the vehicles , 50 of which were delivered via moscow .
the daimler branch in russia sold them to the " russian engineering company " which in turn sold them to the iraqi state-controlled gamco .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes trucks like this one , the actros , were delivered to iraq all sales within the framework of the oil-for-food program were first approved by the un .
then the geneva-based company cotecna arranged both shipment and payment .
a german businessman told stern that the cotecna was a bottleneck in the transactions and that companies often had to stand in line waiting for execution of their contracts .
reportedly , companies could " buy " their way up to the front of the line .
the sec wants to know if daimlerchrysler might have also paid a bribe to move up to the head of the queue .
since daimlerchrysler is listed on the new york stock exchange , the sec can investigate the carmaker , although it is a german company .
more than one scandal but the oil-for-food program is not the only worry on daimlerchrysler 's mind .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general kofi annan has come under fire because his son worked for cotecna , which was involved in the oil-for-food program for over a year , the us justice department has been examining the allegations of a former chrysler accountant that the company maintained secret bank accounts to bribe foreign officials .
german authorities have also joined the investigations into the stuttgart automaker after the july 22 suicide of rudi kornmayer , a 53-year-old managing director of the company 's plant in nigeria who shot himself in esslingen , germany .
sources close to the case said that his suicide note made reference to the bribery investigation , which is scrutinizing daimlerchrysler operations in latin america and africa .

now , the american sec is investigating possible wrongdoing by daimlerchrysler in connection with the program . the growing list of german corporations involved in scandals - bmw , infineon , volkswagen , commerzbank - got a little longer after reports surfaced that the united states security and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- is investigating whether german carmaker daimlerchrysler was involved in corrupt deals in the un oil-for-food program .
the company confirmed the sec probe on german public radio .
" we are working on this matter together with the sec and will send them the results of our investigations , " a company spokesperson said .
under investigation is whether daimlerchrysler deliveries to iraq under then-dictator saddam hussein violated us anti-corruption laws .
the sec has demanded files and bank documents from the carmaker .
vehicles shipped to iraq via russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benon sevan , former head of un humanitarian programs in iraq , has been accused of corruption the un 's oil-for-food program , designed to allow the iraqi population access to food despite strict un sanctions , was in operation from 1996 to 2003 .
it has since come under heavy fire for widespread corruption in its ranks .
the accusations range from money laundering to kickbacks and conspiracy .
on tuesday , a leading figure in the program , alexander yakovlev , admitted to money laundering and other charges .
an independent panel led by paul volcker , former us federal reserve bank chair , has also accused the former head of the program , benon sevan , of receiving kickbacks .
the german newsmagazine stern is planning to report in its next issue that the sec is looking into the sale of daimlerchrysler actros trucks -lrb- photo -rrb- .
in 2002 , iraq had ordered 150 of the vehicles , 50 of which were delivered via moscow .
the daimler branch in russia sold them to the " russian engineering company " which in turn sold them to the iraqi state-controlled gamco .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes trucks like this one , the actros , were delivered to iraq all sales within the framework of the oil-for-food program were first approved by the un .
then the geneva-based company cotecna arranged both shipment and payment .
a german businessman told stern that the cotecna was a bottleneck in the transactions and that companies often had to stand in line waiting for execution of their contracts .
reportedly , companies could " buy " their way up to the front of the line .
the sec wants to know if daimlerchrysler might have also paid a bribe to move up to the head of the queue .
since daimlerchrysler is listed on the new york stock exchange , the sec can investigate the carmaker , although it is a german company .
more than one scandal but the oil-for-food program is not the only worry on daimlerchrysler 's mind .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general kofi annan has come under fire because his son worked for cotecna , which was involved in the oil-for-food program for over a year , the us justice department has been examining the allegations of a former chrysler accountant that the company maintained secret bank accounts to bribe foreign officials .
german authorities have also joined the investigations into the stuttgart automaker after the july 22 suicide of rudi kornmayer , a 53-year-old managing director of the company 's plant in nigeria who shot himself in esslingen , germany .
sources close to the case said that his suicide note made reference to the bribery investigation , which is scrutinizing daimlerchrysler operations in latin america and africa .

much has been made of the east german roots of angela merkel , christian democratic party head and possibly germany 's first female chancellor .
but in the area she grew up in , she does n't enjoy any hometown advantage . along the main street of tiny crawford , texas , where us president george w. bush has his ranch , there are only a handful of shops , but at least three of them are souvenir stores .
they stock a cornucopia of bush paraphernalia , from dishes and coffee mugs emblazoned with the president 's portrait to bumper stickers and bush-themed chili . but in templin , the small german town north of berlin where angela merkel grew up , visitors are lucky to find much of anything about her anywhere .
last week , the only campaign poster up in the town 's picturesque market square was for a candidate from the party she 's looking to beat - the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel bios are n't exactly selling like hotcakes in her hometown of templin in the bookstore on the square , the owner had to hunt around for her new , much-talked-about biography , or in fact , any book about her .
in the end he found one , hidden behind the counter . " we 'd stock more if they sold , " said owner gerd pistorius .
" they 're not exactly harry potter . " walking through this town of 18,000 , one could easily remain ignorant to the fact that merkel , who could make history in probable elections on september 18 by becoming germany 's first woman chancellor , spent the first decades of her life here .
in fact , while there is some pride about the hometown girl who got to the top , her party wo n't likely win the vote in her own backyard , even though , nationwide , the cdu leads the spd by 13 percentage points in some polls . " i reject her completely , even though she comes from here , " said a woman walking with friends who gave her first name as gerda and her age as somewhere around 75 . angela merkel actually comes from western germany , since she was born in hamburg in 1954 .
but just months after her birth , her father moved the family to east germany , where he took a position as pastor .
in 1957 , the family moved to templin , where angela dorothea kasner lived and attended school until leaving for the university of leipzig in 1973 . bildunterschrift : templin 's market square turned her back ? in the national media , merkel 's eastern roots have been played up .
but for many in templin itself , merkel is seen as someone who turned her back on the east by joining the cdu , a party that is largely perceived here as one run by rich , western men .
even her recent makeover , where she was given a new hairstyle and wardrobe to counter an image that has been rather dowdy up to now , is seen as a kind of betrayal . " she 's forgotten where she comes from , " said gerda . disillusioned by years of economic stagnation -lrb- the region has no industry to speak of and the unemployment rate hovers around 25 percent -rrb- , for many , merkel is just another politician from a party which considers the east a lost cause , and who wo n't likely be able to do anything to lift eastern germany out of its chronic malaise . " i could imagine that people in templin would prefer another candidate for chancellor , " said ulrich schoeneich , templin 's mayor and member of a small left-of-center party .
he does not think that a relative newcomer to politics - merkel did n't become active in politics until just after the fall of the berlin wall - could have the answers to eastern germany 's problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : her support for george w. bush has also aroused suspicions among locals .
" she 's not my dream choice , " schoeneich said . tourist draw ? merkel 's candidacy might seem like a dream come true for templin 's small tourism office , nestled up against the town 's intact city wall dating from the 14th century .
tourism is one of the few potential growth sectors for the town , and as merkel 's profile has risen in germany , more tourists have been arriving asking about some of the landmarks of her life , such as the local schools she went to . " well , if the demand is really there , then maybe we 'll do it , " said tourism director sabine hertrich , but with little enthusiasm in her voice .
asked what she thought of the person who might be considered perfect for the role of the town 's favorite daughter , she paused before deadpanning : " i met her at an opening once .
she 's a nice woman . " bildunterschrift : templin city wall according to joachim löwe , who heads the local cdu chapter , this reluctance to embrace merkel has less to do with personal animus than with unfamiliarity .
she has not lived in the town since the late 70s , only returning for the occasional weekend to visit her parents .
in addition , the cdu does not have a lot of support in the region , coming in third behind the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the successors to east germany 's communists , the pds . " that could change if her policies start changing the economic situation here , " he said , but added that he does not expect the commemorative plate to be unveiled anytime soon .

it 's just not the way we express things , " he said . get the balance right for the cdu , constructing angela merkel 's image and talking about her origins has been a delicate balancing act .
according to uwe andersen , a professor of political science at the ruhr university in bochum , there were concerns in the party that she might be considered too much of a representative of purely eastern interests , thereby alienating the larger pool of voters in the west .
therefore a strategy was developed to boost her appeal in western germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel - pre-makeover " and it worked , but perhaps too well , and it ended up limiting her support in the former east germany " he said .
" now she 's lost some of the automatic bonus she might have gotten in the east simply for having come from there . " but not everyone takes such a dim view .
ulrike zündorf , who owns a gift shop in templin , said she does not understand why people tend to be so negative about merkel .
she said she 's hoping merkel takes up residency in the chancellery in late september . " one , because she 's an east german , and two , because she 's a woman , " zündorf said .

much has been made of the east german roots of angela merkel , christian democratic party head and possibly germany 's first female chancellor .
but in the area she grew up in , she does n't enjoy any hometown advantage . along the main street of tiny crawford , texas , where us president george w. bush has his ranch , there are only a handful of shops , but at least three of them are souvenir stores .
they stock a cornucopia of bush paraphernalia , from dishes and coffee mugs emblazoned with the president 's portrait to bumper stickers and bush-themed chili . but in templin , the small german town north of berlin where angela merkel grew up , visitors are lucky to find much of anything about her anywhere .
last week , the only campaign poster up in the town 's picturesque market square was for a candidate from the party she 's looking to beat - the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel bios are n't exactly selling like hotcakes in her hometown of templin in the bookstore on the square , the owner had to hunt around for her new , much-talked-about biography , or in fact , any book about her .
in the end he found one , hidden behind the counter . " we 'd stock more if they sold , " said owner gerd pistorius .
" they 're not exactly harry potter . " walking through this town of 18,000 , one could easily remain ignorant to the fact that merkel , who could make history in probable elections on september 18 by becoming germany 's first woman chancellor , spent the first decades of her life here .
in fact , while there is some pride about the hometown girl who got to the top , her party wo n't likely win the vote in her own backyard , even though , nationwide , the cdu leads the spd by 13 percentage points in some polls . " i reject her completely , even though she comes from here , " said a woman walking with friends who gave her first name as gerda and her age as somewhere around 75 . angela merkel actually comes from western germany , since she was born in hamburg in 1954 .
but just months after her birth , her father moved the family to east germany , where he took a position as pastor .
in 1957 , the family moved to templin , where angela dorothea kasner lived and attended school until leaving for the university of leipzig in 1973 . bildunterschrift : templin 's market square turned her back ? in the national media , merkel 's eastern roots have been played up .
but for many in templin itself , merkel is seen as someone who turned her back on the east by joining the cdu , a party that is largely perceived here as one run by rich , western men .
even her recent makeover , where she was given a new hairstyle and wardrobe to counter an image that has been rather dowdy up to now , is seen as a kind of betrayal . " she 's forgotten where she comes from , " said gerda . disillusioned by years of economic stagnation -lrb- the region has no industry to speak of and the unemployment rate hovers around 25 percent -rrb- , for many , merkel is just another politician from a party which considers the east a lost cause , and who wo n't likely be able to do anything to lift eastern germany out of its chronic malaise . " i could imagine that people in templin would prefer another candidate for chancellor , " said ulrich schoeneich , templin 's mayor and member of a small left-of-center party .
he does not think that a relative newcomer to politics - merkel did n't become active in politics until just after the fall of the berlin wall - could have the answers to eastern germany 's problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : her support for george w. bush has also aroused suspicions among locals .
" she 's not my dream choice , " schoeneich said . tourist draw ? merkel 's candidacy might seem like a dream come true for templin 's small tourism office , nestled up against the town 's intact city wall dating from the 14th century .
tourism is one of the few potential growth sectors for the town , and as merkel 's profile has risen in germany , more tourists have been arriving asking about some of the landmarks of her life , such as the local schools she went to . " well , if the demand is really there , then maybe we 'll do it , " said tourism director sabine hertrich , but with little enthusiasm in her voice .
asked what she thought of the person who might be considered perfect for the role of the town 's favorite daughter , she paused before deadpanning : " i met her at an opening once .
she 's a nice woman . " bildunterschrift : templin city wall according to joachim löwe , who heads the local cdu chapter , this reluctance to embrace merkel has less to do with personal animus than with unfamiliarity .
she has not lived in the town since the late 70s , only returning for the occasional weekend to visit her parents .
in addition , the cdu does not have a lot of support in the region , coming in third behind the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the successors to east germany 's communists , the pds . " that could change if her policies start changing the economic situation here , " he said , but added that he does not expect the commemorative plate to be unveiled anytime soon .

it 's just not the way we express things , " he said . get the balance right for the cdu , constructing angela merkel 's image and talking about her origins has been a delicate balancing act .
according to uwe andersen , a professor of political science at the ruhr university in bochum , there were concerns in the party that she might be considered too much of a representative of purely eastern interests , thereby alienating the larger pool of voters in the west .
therefore a strategy was developed to boost her appeal in western germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel - pre-makeover " and it worked , but perhaps too well , and it ended up limiting her support in the former east germany " he said .
" now she 's lost some of the automatic bonus she might have gotten in the east simply for having come from there . " but not everyone takes such a dim view .
ulrike zündorf , who owns a gift shop in templin , said she does not understand why people tend to be so negative about merkel .
she said she 's hoping merkel takes up residency in the chancellery in late september . " one , because she 's an east german , and two , because she 's a woman , " zündorf said .

in 1957 , the family moved to templin , where angela dorothea kasner lived and attended school until leaving for the university of leipzig in 1973 . bildunterschrift : templin 's market square turned her back ? in the national media , merkel 's eastern roots have been played up .
but for many in templin itself , merkel is seen as someone who turned her back on the east by joining the cdu , a party that is largely perceived here as one run by rich , western men .
even her recent makeover , where she was given a new hairstyle and wardrobe to counter an image that has been rather dowdy up to now , is seen as a kind of betrayal . " she 's forgotten where she comes from , " said gerda . disillusioned by years of economic stagnation -lrb- the region has no industry to speak of and the unemployment rate hovers around 25 percent -rrb- , for many , merkel is just another politician from a party which considers the east a lost cause , and who wo n't likely be able to do anything to lift eastern germany out of its chronic malaise . " i could imagine that people in templin would prefer another candidate for chancellor , " said ulrich schoeneich , templin 's mayor and member of a small left-of-center party .
he does not think that a relative newcomer to politics - merkel did n't become active in politics until just after the fall of the berlin wall - could have the answers to eastern germany 's problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : her support for george w. bush has also aroused suspicions among locals .
" she 's not my dream choice , " schoeneich said . tourist draw ? merkel 's candidacy might seem like a dream come true for templin 's small tourism office , nestled up against the town 's intact city wall dating from the 14th century .
tourism is one of the few potential growth sectors for the town , and as merkel 's profile has risen in germany , more tourists have been arriving asking about some of the landmarks of her life , such as the local schools she went to . " well , if the demand is really there , then maybe we 'll do it , " said tourism director sabine hertrich , but with little enthusiasm in her voice .
asked what she thought of the person who might be considered perfect for the role of the town 's favorite daughter , she paused before deadpanning : " i met her at an opening once .
she 's a nice woman . " bildunterschrift : templin city wall according to joachim löwe , who heads the local cdu chapter , this reluctance to embrace merkel has less to do with personal animus than with unfamiliarity .
she has not lived in the town since the late 70s , only returning for the occasional weekend to visit her parents .
in addition , the cdu does not have a lot of support in the region , coming in third behind the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the successors to east germany 's communists , the pds . " that could change if her policies start changing the economic situation here , " he said , but added that he does not expect the commemorative plate to be unveiled anytime soon .
" i doubt people here will ever start wearing -lrb- merkel -rrb- t-shirts .
it 's just not the way we express things , " he said . get the balance right for the cdu , constructing angela merkel 's image and talking about her origins has been a delicate balancing act .
according to uwe andersen , a professor of political science at the ruhr university in bochum , there were concerns in the party that she might be considered too much of a representative of purely eastern interests , thereby alienating the larger pool of voters in the west .
therefore a strategy was developed to boost her appeal in western germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel - pre-makeover " and it worked , but perhaps too well , and it ended up limiting her support in the former east germany " he said .
" now she 's lost some of the automatic bonus she might have gotten in the east simply for having come from there . " but not everyone takes such a dim view .
ulrike zündorf , who owns a gift shop in templin , said she does not understand why people tend to be so negative about merkel .
she said she 's hoping merkel takes up residency in the chancellery in late september . " one , because she 's an east german , and two , because she 's a woman , " zündorf said .

much has been made of the east german roots of angela merkel , christian democratic party head and possibly germany 's first female chancellor .
but in the area she grew up in , she does n't enjoy any hometown advantage . along the main street of tiny crawford , texas , where us president george w. bush has his ranch , there are only a handful of shops , but at least three of them are souvenir stores .
they stock a cornucopia of bush paraphernalia , from dishes and coffee mugs emblazoned with the president 's portrait to bumper stickers and bush-themed chili . but in templin , the small german town north of berlin where angela merkel grew up , visitors are lucky to find much of anything about her anywhere .
last week , the only campaign poster up in the town 's picturesque market square was for a candidate from the party she 's looking to beat - the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel bios are n't exactly selling like hotcakes in her hometown of templin in the bookstore on the square , the owner had to hunt around for her new , much-talked-about biography , or in fact , any book about her .
in the end he found one , hidden behind the counter . " we 'd stock more if they sold , " said owner gerd pistorius .
" they 're not exactly harry potter . " walking through this town of 18,000 , one could easily remain ignorant to the fact that merkel , who could make history in probable elections on september 18 by becoming germany 's first woman chancellor , spent the first decades of her life here .
in fact , while there is some pride about the hometown girl who got to the top , her party wo n't likely win the vote in her own backyard , even though , nationwide , the cdu leads the spd by 13 percentage points in some polls . " i reject her completely , even though she comes from here , " said a woman walking with friends who gave her first name as gerda and her age as somewhere around 75 . angela merkel actually comes from western germany , since she was born in hamburg in 1954 .
but just months after her birth , her father moved the family to east germany , where he took a position as pastor .

" she 's forgotten where she comes from , " said gerda . disillusioned by years of economic stagnation -lrb- the region has no industry to speak of and the unemployment rate hovers around 25 percent -rrb- , for many , merkel is just another politician from a party which considers the east a lost cause , and who wo n't likely be able to do anything to lift eastern germany out of its chronic malaise . " i could imagine that people in templin would prefer another candidate for chancellor , " said ulrich schoeneich , templin 's mayor and member of a small left-of-center party .

" well , if the demand is really there , then maybe we 'll do it , " said tourism director sabine hertrich , but with little enthusiasm in her voice .

much has been made of the east german roots of angela merkel , christian democratic party head and possibly germany 's first female chancellor .
but in the area she grew up in , she does n't enjoy any hometown advantage . along the main street of tiny crawford , texas , where us president george w. bush has his ranch , there are only a handful of shops , but at least three of them are souvenir stores .
they stock a cornucopia of bush paraphernalia , from dishes and coffee mugs emblazoned with the president 's portrait to bumper stickers and bush-themed chili . but in templin , the small german town north of berlin where angela merkel grew up , visitors are lucky to find much of anything about her anywhere .

much has been made of the east german roots of angela merkel , christian democratic party head and possibly germany 's first female chancellor .
but in the area she grew up in , she does n't enjoy any hometown advantage . along the main street of tiny crawford , texas , where us president george w. bush has his ranch , there are only a handful of shops , but at least three of them are souvenir stores .
they stock a cornucopia of bush paraphernalia , from dishes and coffee mugs emblazoned with the president 's portrait to bumper stickers and bush-themed chili . but in templin , the small german town north of berlin where angela merkel grew up , visitors are lucky to find much of anything about her anywhere .
last week , the only campaign poster up in the town 's picturesque market square was for a candidate from the party she 's looking to beat - the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel bios are n't exactly selling like hotcakes in her hometown of templin in the bookstore on the square , the owner had to hunt around for her new , much-talked-about biography , or in fact , any book about her .
in the end he found one , hidden behind the counter . " we 'd stock more if they sold , " said owner gerd pistorius .
" they 're not exactly harry potter . " walking through this town of 18,000 , one could easily remain ignorant to the fact that merkel , who could make history in probable elections on september 18 by becoming germany 's first woman chancellor , spent the first decades of her life here .
in fact , while there is some pride about the hometown girl who got to the top , her party wo n't likely win the vote in her own backyard , even though , nationwide , the cdu leads the spd by 13 percentage points in some polls . " i reject her completely , even though she comes from here , " said a woman walking with friends who gave her first name as gerda and her age as somewhere around 75 . angela merkel actually comes from western germany , since she was born in hamburg in 1954 .
but just months after her birth , her father moved the family to east germany , where he took a position as pastor .
in 1957 , the family moved to templin , where angela dorothea kasner lived and attended school until leaving for the university of leipzig in 1973 . bildunterschrift : templin 's market square turned her back ? in the national media , merkel 's eastern roots have been played up .
but for many in templin itself , merkel is seen as someone who turned her back on the east by joining the cdu , a party that is largely perceived here as one run by rich , western men .
even her recent makeover , where she was given a new hairstyle and wardrobe to counter an image that has been rather dowdy up to now , is seen as a kind of betrayal . " she 's forgotten where she comes from , " said gerda . disillusioned by years of economic stagnation -lrb- the region has no industry to speak of and the unemployment rate hovers around 25 percent -rrb- , for many , merkel is just another politician from a party which considers the east a lost cause , and who wo n't likely be able to do anything to lift eastern germany out of its chronic malaise . " i could imagine that people in templin would prefer another candidate for chancellor , " said ulrich schoeneich , templin 's mayor and member of a small left-of-center party .
he does not think that a relative newcomer to politics - merkel did n't become active in politics until just after the fall of the berlin wall - could have the answers to eastern germany 's problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : her support for george w. bush has also aroused suspicions among locals .
" she 's not my dream choice , " schoeneich said . tourist draw ? merkel 's candidacy might seem like a dream come true for templin 's small tourism office , nestled up against the town 's intact city wall dating from the 14th century .
tourism is one of the few potential growth sectors for the town , and as merkel 's profile has risen in germany , more tourists have been arriving asking about some of the landmarks of her life , such as the local schools she went to . " well , if the demand is really there , then maybe we 'll do it , " said tourism director sabine hertrich , but with little enthusiasm in her voice .
asked what she thought of the person who might be considered perfect for the role of the town 's favorite daughter , she paused before deadpanning : " i met her at an opening once .
she 's a nice woman . " bildunterschrift : templin city wall according to joachim löwe , who heads the local cdu chapter , this reluctance to embrace merkel has less to do with personal animus than with unfamiliarity .
she has not lived in the town since the late 70s , only returning for the occasional weekend to visit her parents .
in addition , the cdu does not have a lot of support in the region , coming in third behind the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the successors to east germany 's communists , the pds . " that could change if her policies start changing the economic situation here , " he said , but added that he does not expect the commemorative plate to be unveiled anytime soon .

now , the american sec is investigating possible wrongdoing by daimlerchrysler in connection with the program . the growing list of german corporations involved in scandals - bmw , infineon , volkswagen , commerzbank - got a little longer after reports surfaced that the united states security and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- is investigating whether german carmaker daimlerchrysler was involved in corrupt deals in the un oil-for-food program .
the company confirmed the sec probe on german public radio .
" we are working on this matter together with the sec and will send them the results of our investigations , " a company spokesperson said .
under investigation is whether daimlerchrysler deliveries to iraq under then-dictator saddam hussein violated us anti-corruption laws .
the sec has demanded files and bank documents from the carmaker .
vehicles shipped to iraq via russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benon sevan , former head of un humanitarian programs in iraq , has been accused of corruption the un 's oil-for-food program , designed to allow the iraqi population access to food despite strict un sanctions , was in operation from 1996 to 2003 .
it has since come under heavy fire for widespread corruption in its ranks .
the accusations range from money laundering to kickbacks and conspiracy .
on tuesday , a leading figure in the program , alexander yakovlev , admitted to money laundering and other charges .
an independent panel led by paul volcker , former us federal reserve bank chair , has also accused the former head of the program , benon sevan , of receiving kickbacks .
the german newsmagazine stern is planning to report in its next issue that the sec is looking into the sale of daimlerchrysler actros trucks -lrb- photo -rrb- .
in 2002 , iraq had ordered 150 of the vehicles , 50 of which were delivered via moscow .
the daimler branch in russia sold them to the " russian engineering company " which in turn sold them to the iraqi state-controlled gamco .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes trucks like this one , the actros , were delivered to iraq all sales within the framework of the oil-for-food program were first approved by the un .
then the geneva-based company cotecna arranged both shipment and payment .
a german businessman told stern that the cotecna was a bottleneck in the transactions and that companies often had to stand in line waiting for execution of their contracts .
reportedly , companies could " buy " their way up to the front of the line .
the sec wants to know if daimlerchrysler might have also paid a bribe to move up to the head of the queue .
since daimlerchrysler is listed on the new york stock exchange , the sec can investigate the carmaker , although it is a german company .
more than one scandal but the oil-for-food program is not the only worry on daimlerchrysler 's mind .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general kofi annan has come under fire because his son worked for cotecna , which was involved in the oil-for-food program for over a year , the us justice department has been examining the allegations of a former chrysler accountant that the company maintained secret bank accounts to bribe foreign officials .
german authorities have also joined the investigations into the stuttgart automaker after the july 22 suicide of rudi kornmayer , a 53-year-old managing director of the company 's plant in nigeria who shot himself in esslingen , germany .
sources close to the case said that his suicide note made reference to the bribery investigation , which is scrutinizing daimlerchrysler operations in latin america and africa .

the company confirmed the sec probe on german public radio .
" we are working on this matter together with the sec and will send them the results of our investigations , " a company spokesperson said .
under investigation is whether daimlerchrysler deliveries to iraq under then-dictator saddam hussein violated us anti-corruption laws .
the sec has demanded files and bank documents from the carmaker .

it has since come under heavy fire for widespread corruption in its ranks .
the accusations range from money laundering to kickbacks and conspiracy .
on tuesday , a leading figure in the program , alexander yakovlev , admitted to money laundering and other charges .
an independent panel led by paul volcker , former us federal reserve bank chair , has also accused the former head of the program , benon sevan , of receiving kickbacks .
the german newsmagazine stern is planning to report in its next issue that the sec is looking into the sale of daimlerchrysler actros trucks -lrb- photo -rrb- .
in 2002 , iraq had ordered 150 of the vehicles , 50 of which were delivered via moscow .

reportedly , companies could " buy " their way up to the front of the line .
the sec wants to know if daimlerchrysler might have also paid a bribe to move up to the head of the queue .
since daimlerchrysler is listed on the new york stock exchange , the sec can investigate the carmaker , although it is a german company .
more than one scandal but the oil-for-food program is not the only worry on daimlerchrysler 's mind .

much has been made of the east german roots of angela merkel , christian democratic party head and possibly germany 's first female chancellor .
but in the area she grew up in , she does n't enjoy any hometown advantage . along the main street of tiny crawford , texas , where us president george w. bush has his ranch , there are only a handful of shops , but at least three of them are souvenir stores .
they stock a cornucopia of bush paraphernalia , from dishes and coffee mugs emblazoned with the president 's portrait to bumper stickers and bush-themed chili . but in templin , the small german town north of berlin where angela merkel grew up , visitors are lucky to find much of anything about her anywhere .
last week , the only campaign poster up in the town 's picturesque market square was for a candidate from the party she 's looking to beat - the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel bios are n't exactly selling like hotcakes in her hometown of templin in the bookstore on the square , the owner had to hunt around for her new , much-talked-about biography , or in fact , any book about her .

" they 're not exactly harry potter . " walking through this town of 18,000 , one could easily remain ignorant to the fact that merkel , who could make history in probable elections on september 18 by becoming germany 's first woman chancellor , spent the first decades of her life here .
in fact , while there is some pride about the hometown girl who got to the top , her party wo n't likely win the vote in her own backyard , even though , nationwide , the cdu leads the spd by 13 percentage points in some polls . " i reject her completely , even though she comes from here , " said a woman walking with friends who gave her first name as gerda and her age as somewhere around 75 . angela merkel actually comes from western germany , since she was born in hamburg in 1954 .

" she 's forgotten where she comes from , " said gerda . disillusioned by years of economic stagnation -lrb- the region has no industry to speak of and the unemployment rate hovers around 25 percent -rrb- , for many , merkel is just another politician from a party which considers the east a lost cause , and who wo n't likely be able to do anything to lift eastern germany out of its chronic malaise .

much has been made of the east german roots of angela merkel , christian democratic party head and possibly germany 's first female chancellor .
but in the area she grew up in , she does n't enjoy any hometown advantage . along the main street of tiny crawford , texas , where us president george w. bush has his ranch , there are only a handful of shops , but at least three of them are souvenir stores .
they stock a cornucopia of bush paraphernalia , from dishes and coffee mugs emblazoned with the president 's portrait to bumper stickers and bush-themed chili . but in templin , the small german town north of berlin where angela merkel grew up , visitors are lucky to find much of anything about her anywhere .
last week , the only campaign poster up in the town 's picturesque market square was for a candidate from the party she 's looking to beat - the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel bios are n't exactly selling like hotcakes in her hometown of templin in the bookstore on the square , the owner had to hunt around for her new , much-talked-about biography , or in fact , any book about her .
in the end he found one , hidden behind the counter . " we 'd stock more if they sold , " said owner gerd pistorius .
" they 're not exactly harry potter . " walking through this town of 18,000 , one could easily remain ignorant to the fact that merkel , who could make history in probable elections on september 18 by becoming germany 's first woman chancellor , spent the first decades of her life here .
in fact , while there is some pride about the hometown girl who got to the top , her party wo n't likely win the vote in her own backyard , even though , nationwide , the cdu leads the spd by 13 percentage points in some polls . " i reject her completely , even though she comes from here , " said a woman walking with friends who gave her first name as gerda and her age as somewhere around 75 . angela merkel actually comes from western germany , since she was born in hamburg in 1954 .
but just months after her birth , her father moved the family to east germany , where he took a position as pastor .
in 1957 , the family moved to templin , where angela dorothea kasner lived and attended school until leaving for the university of leipzig in 1973 . bildunterschrift : templin 's market square turned her back ? in the national media , merkel 's eastern roots have been played up .
but for many in templin itself , merkel is seen as someone who turned her back on the east by joining the cdu , a party that is largely perceived here as one run by rich , western men .
even her recent makeover , where she was given a new hairstyle and wardrobe to counter an image that has been rather dowdy up to now , is seen as a kind of betrayal . " she 's forgotten where she comes from , " said gerda . disillusioned by years of economic stagnation -lrb- the region has no industry to speak of and the unemployment rate hovers around 25 percent -rrb- , for many , merkel is just another politician from a party which considers the east a lost cause , and who wo n't likely be able to do anything to lift eastern germany out of its chronic malaise . " i could imagine that people in templin would prefer another candidate for chancellor , " said ulrich schoeneich , templin 's mayor and member of a small left-of-center party .
he does not think that a relative newcomer to politics - merkel did n't become active in politics until just after the fall of the berlin wall - could have the answers to eastern germany 's problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : her support for george w. bush has also aroused suspicions among locals .
" she 's not my dream choice , " schoeneich said . tourist draw ? merkel 's candidacy might seem like a dream come true for templin 's small tourism office , nestled up against the town 's intact city wall dating from the 14th century .
tourism is one of the few potential growth sectors for the town , and as merkel 's profile has risen in germany , more tourists have been arriving asking about some of the landmarks of her life , such as the local schools she went to . " well , if the demand is really there , then maybe we 'll do it , " said tourism director sabine hertrich , but with little enthusiasm in her voice .
asked what she thought of the person who might be considered perfect for the role of the town 's favorite daughter , she paused before deadpanning : " i met her at an opening once .
she 's a nice woman . " bildunterschrift : templin city wall according to joachim löwe , who heads the local cdu chapter , this reluctance to embrace merkel has less to do with personal animus than with unfamiliarity .
she has not lived in the town since the late 70s , only returning for the occasional weekend to visit her parents .
in addition , the cdu does not have a lot of support in the region , coming in third behind the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the successors to east germany 's communists , the pds . " that could change if her policies start changing the economic situation here , " he said , but added that he does not expect the commemorative plate to be unveiled anytime soon .
" i doubt people here will ever start wearing -lrb- merkel -rrb- t-shirts .
it 's just not the way we express things , " he said . get the balance right for the cdu , constructing angela merkel 's image and talking about her origins has been a delicate balancing act .
according to uwe andersen , a professor of political science at the ruhr university in bochum , there were concerns in the party that she might be considered too much of a representative of purely eastern interests , thereby alienating the larger pool of voters in the west .
therefore a strategy was developed to boost her appeal in western germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel - pre-makeover " and it worked , but perhaps too well , and it ended up limiting her support in the former east germany " he said .
" now she 's lost some of the automatic bonus she might have gotten in the east simply for having come from there . " but not everyone takes such a dim view .
ulrike zündorf , who owns a gift shop in templin , said she does not understand why people tend to be so negative about merkel .
she said she 's hoping merkel takes up residency in the chancellery in late september . " one , because she 's an east german , and two , because she 's a woman , " zündorf said .

the wild untamed nature of the eifel remains in the form of an accessible but thrilling modern wilderness . among germany 's low mountain ranges , the eifel occupies a very special place in the country 's geography .
grandiose rock formations with mysterious bat caves and eerie phosphorescent mosses tower above deep wooded ravines where rivers flow as idyllic mountain streams or raging torrents .
spectacular waterfalls thunder down into the valleys , wreathing the forests in shrouding mists .
in winter , the cliffs can transform themselves into ice palaces shimmering with a million lights .
in spring , the river meadows are a sea of flowers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stretches of heath with magnificent juniper stands remind visitors in summer that until 200 years ago , when reafforestation with conifers first began , the eifel presented a very different appearance .
everywhere , there is evidence of the region 's fascinating geological past .
the cones of huge volcanoes rear up out of the gently undulating eifel plateau .
poisonous gases swirl up from subterranean sources , a fatal hazard for many animals .

now , the american sec is investigating possible wrongdoing by daimlerchrysler in connection with the program . the growing list of german corporations involved in scandals - bmw , infineon , volkswagen , commerzbank - got a little longer after reports surfaced that the united states security and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- is investigating whether german carmaker daimlerchrysler was involved in corrupt deals in the un oil-for-food program .
the company confirmed the sec probe on german public radio .
" we are working on this matter together with the sec and will send them the results of our investigations , " a company spokesperson said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 09.08.2005 daimlerchrysler probed in oil-for-food scandal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler 's actions regarding the un program are under scrutiny germany has had little to do with the scandals around the un 's scandal-plagued oil-for-food program .
now , the american sec is investigating possible wrongdoing by daimlerchrysler in connection with the program . the growing list of german corporations involved in scandals - bmw , infineon , volkswagen , commerzbank - got a little longer after reports surfaced that the united states security and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- is investigating whether german carmaker daimlerchrysler was involved in corrupt deals in the un oil-for-food program .
the company confirmed the sec probe on german public radio .
" we are working on this matter together with the sec and will send them the results of our investigations , " a company spokesperson said .
under investigation is whether daimlerchrysler deliveries to iraq under then-dictator saddam hussein violated us anti-corruption laws .
the sec has demanded files and bank documents from the carmaker .
vehicles shipped to iraq via russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benon sevan , former head of un humanitarian programs in iraq , has been accused of corruption the un 's oil-for-food program , designed to allow the iraqi population access to food despite strict un sanctions , was in operation from 1996 to 2003 .
it has since come under heavy fire for widespread corruption in its ranks .
the accusations range from money laundering to kickbacks and conspiracy .
on tuesday , a leading figure in the program , alexander yakovlev , admitted to money laundering and other charges .
an independent panel led by paul volcker , former us federal reserve bank chair , has also accused the former head of the program , benon sevan , of receiving kickbacks .
the german newsmagazine stern is planning to report in its next issue that the sec is looking into the sale of daimlerchrysler actros trucks -lrb- photo -rrb- .
in 2002 , iraq had ordered 150 of the vehicles , 50 of which were delivered via moscow .
the daimler branch in russia sold them to the " russian engineering company " which in turn sold them to the iraqi state-controlled gamco .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes trucks like this one , the actros , were delivered to iraq all sales within the framework of the oil-for-food program were first approved by the un .
then the geneva-based company cotecna arranged both shipment and payment .
a german businessman told stern that the cotecna was a bottleneck in the transactions and that companies often had to stand in line waiting for execution of their contracts .
reportedly , companies could " buy " their way up to the front of the line .
the sec wants to know if daimlerchrysler might have also paid a bribe to move up to the head of the queue .
since daimlerchrysler is listed on the new york stock exchange , the sec can investigate the carmaker , although it is a german company .
more than one scandal but the oil-for-food program is not the only worry on daimlerchrysler 's mind .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general kofi annan has come under fire because his son worked for cotecna , which was involved in the oil-for-food program for over a year , the us justice department has been examining the allegations of a former chrysler accountant that the company maintained secret bank accounts to bribe foreign officials .
german authorities have also joined the investigations into the stuttgart automaker after the july 22 suicide of rudi kornmayer , a 53-year-old managing director of the company 's plant in nigeria who shot himself in esslingen , germany .
sources close to the case said that his suicide note made reference to the bribery investigation , which is scrutinizing daimlerchrysler operations in latin america and africa .
representatives on both sides of the atlantic have refused to comment on the suicide . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how corrupt is german business ?
corporate scandals at tv network ard , carmaker volkswagen and chipmaker infineon are dominating headlines and leaving many wondering if germany , once thought squeaky clean , is becoming increasingly corrupt .
-lrb- july 23 , 2005 -rrb- infineon bosses under investigation the headquarters of german semi-conductor giant infineon and the homes of several company directors were searched by munich 's public prosecutor friday , a company spokesman said .

the " august 13 working group " , named for the day the communist state closed the border in 1961 to halt a mass exodus to the west , unveiled fresh findings about those shot by border guards or otherwise killed trying to flee .
the organization 's director , alexandra hildebrandt , said 70 previously unrecorded deaths had been uncovered in the past year , bringing the new total to 1,135 .
nearly 16 years after the berlin wall tumbled , german historians say the true number of border victims may never be known .
berlin prosecutors put the official total at 270 while the official central investigating group for government and unification crime cites 421 cases in which armed east german border guards are believed to have killed people trying to breach the wall .
the figure cited by the working group , which is based next to the former us-controlled checkpoint charlie border crossing at a berlin wall museum , includes deaths between the end of world war ii in 1945 when the soviets claimed control of east germany and the fall of the berlin wall on november 9 , 1989 .
the organization includes on its list east german border guards who were shot by people attempting to escape , killed by fellow soldiers , or who had committed suicide in response to orders to shoot their compatriots . dw-world.de the berlin wall goes online although very little remains of the berlin wall , a new government web site details where visitors can find parts of the despised cold war barrier and many other remnants of the city 's divided past .

much has been made of the east german roots of angela merkel , christian democratic party head and possibly germany 's first female chancellor .
but in the area she grew up in , she does n't enjoy any hometown advantage . along the main street of tiny crawford , texas , where us president george w. bush has his ranch , there are only a handful of shops , but at least three of them are souvenir stores .
they stock a cornucopia of bush paraphernalia , from dishes and coffee mugs emblazoned with the president 's portrait to bumper stickers and bush-themed chili . but in templin , the small german town north of berlin where angela merkel grew up , visitors are lucky to find much of anything about her anywhere .
last week , the only campaign poster up in the town 's picturesque market square was for a candidate from the party she 's looking to beat - the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel bios are n't exactly selling like hotcakes in her hometown of templin in the bookstore on the square , the owner had to hunt around for her new , much-talked-about biography , or in fact , any book about her .
in the end he found one , hidden behind the counter . " we 'd stock more if they sold , " said owner gerd pistorius .
" they 're not exactly harry potter . " walking through this town of 18,000 , one could easily remain ignorant to the fact that merkel , who could make history in probable elections on september 18 by becoming germany 's first woman chancellor , spent the first decades of her life here .
in fact , while there is some pride about the hometown girl who got to the top , her party wo n't likely win the vote in her own backyard , even though , nationwide , the cdu leads the spd by 13 percentage points in some polls . " i reject her completely , even though she comes from here , " said a woman walking with friends who gave her first name as gerda and her age as somewhere around 75 . angela merkel actually comes from western germany , since she was born in hamburg in 1954 .
but just months after her birth , her father moved the family to east germany , where he took a position as pastor .
in 1957 , the family moved to templin , where angela dorothea kasner lived and attended school until leaving for the university of leipzig in 1973 . bildunterschrift : templin 's market square turned her back ? in the national media , merkel 's eastern roots have been played up .
but for many in templin itself , merkel is seen as someone who turned her back on the east by joining the cdu , a party that is largely perceived here as one run by rich , western men .
even her recent makeover , where she was given a new hairstyle and wardrobe to counter an image that has been rather dowdy up to now , is seen as a kind of betrayal . " she 's forgotten where she comes from , " said gerda . disillusioned by years of economic stagnation -lrb- the region has no industry to speak of and the unemployment rate hovers around 25 percent -rrb- , for many , merkel is just another politician from a party which considers the east a lost cause , and who wo n't likely be able to do anything to lift eastern germany out of its chronic malaise . " i could imagine that people in templin would prefer another candidate for chancellor , " said ulrich schoeneich , templin 's mayor and member of a small left-of-center party .
he does not think that a relative newcomer to politics - merkel did n't become active in politics until just after the fall of the berlin wall - could have the answers to eastern germany 's problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : her support for george w. bush has also aroused suspicions among locals .
" she 's not my dream choice , " schoeneich said . tourist draw ? merkel 's candidacy might seem like a dream come true for templin 's small tourism office , nestled up against the town 's intact city wall dating from the 14th century .
tourism is one of the few potential growth sectors for the town , and as merkel 's profile has risen in germany , more tourists have been arriving asking about some of the landmarks of her life , such as the local schools she went to . " well , if the demand is really there , then maybe we 'll do it , " said tourism director sabine hertrich , but with little enthusiasm in her voice .
asked what she thought of the person who might be considered perfect for the role of the town 's favorite daughter , she paused before deadpanning : " i met her at an opening once .
she 's a nice woman . " bildunterschrift : templin city wall according to joachim löwe , who heads the local cdu chapter , this reluctance to embrace merkel has less to do with personal animus than with unfamiliarity .
she has not lived in the town since the late 70s , only returning for the occasional weekend to visit her parents .
in addition , the cdu does not have a lot of support in the region , coming in third behind the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the successors to east germany 's communists , the pds . " that could change if her policies start changing the economic situation here , " he said , but added that he does not expect the commemorative plate to be unveiled anytime soon .
" i doubt people here will ever start wearing -lrb- merkel -rrb- t-shirts .
it 's just not the way we express things , " he said . get the balance right for the cdu , constructing angela merkel 's image and talking about her origins has been a delicate balancing act .
according to uwe andersen , a professor of political science at the ruhr university in bochum , there were concerns in the party that she might be considered too much of a representative of purely eastern interests , thereby alienating the larger pool of voters in the west .
therefore a strategy was developed to boost her appeal in western germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel - pre-makeover " and it worked , but perhaps too well , and it ended up limiting her support in the former east germany " he said .
" now she 's lost some of the automatic bonus she might have gotten in the east simply for having come from there . " but not everyone takes such a dim view .
ulrike zündorf , who owns a gift shop in templin , said she does not understand why people tend to be so negative about merkel .
she said she 's hoping merkel takes up residency in the chancellery in late september . " one , because she 's an east german , and two , because she 's a woman , " zündorf said .

now , the american sec is investigating possible wrongdoing by daimlerchrysler in connection with the program . the growing list of german corporations involved in scandals - bmw , infineon , volkswagen , commerzbank - got a little longer after reports surfaced that the united states security and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- is investigating whether german carmaker daimlerchrysler was involved in corrupt deals in the un oil-for-food program .
the company confirmed the sec probe on german public radio .
" we are working on this matter together with the sec and will send them the results of our investigations , " a company spokesperson said .
under investigation is whether daimlerchrysler deliveries to iraq under then-dictator saddam hussein violated us anti-corruption laws .
the sec has demanded files and bank documents from the carmaker .
vehicles shipped to iraq via russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benon sevan , former head of un humanitarian programs in iraq , has been accused of corruption the un 's oil-for-food program , designed to allow the iraqi population access to food despite strict un sanctions , was in operation from 1996 to 2003 .
it has since come under heavy fire for widespread corruption in its ranks .
the accusations range from money laundering to kickbacks and conspiracy .
on tuesday , a leading figure in the program , alexander yakovlev , admitted to money laundering and other charges .
an independent panel led by paul volcker , former us federal reserve bank chair , has also accused the former head of the program , benon sevan , of receiving kickbacks .
the german newsmagazine stern is planning to report in its next issue that the sec is looking into the sale of daimlerchrysler actros trucks -lrb- photo -rrb- .
in 2002 , iraq had ordered 150 of the vehicles , 50 of which were delivered via moscow .
the daimler branch in russia sold them to the " russian engineering company " which in turn sold them to the iraqi state-controlled gamco .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes trucks like this one , the actros , were delivered to iraq all sales within the framework of the oil-for-food program were first approved by the un .
then the geneva-based company cotecna arranged both shipment and payment .
a german businessman told stern that the cotecna was a bottleneck in the transactions and that companies often had to stand in line waiting for execution of their contracts .
reportedly , companies could " buy " their way up to the front of the line .
the sec wants to know if daimlerchrysler might have also paid a bribe to move up to the head of the queue .
since daimlerchrysler is listed on the new york stock exchange , the sec can investigate the carmaker , although it is a german company .
more than one scandal but the oil-for-food program is not the only worry on daimlerchrysler 's mind .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general kofi annan has come under fire because his son worked for cotecna , which was involved in the oil-for-food program for over a year , the us justice department has been examining the allegations of a former chrysler accountant that the company maintained secret bank accounts to bribe foreign officials .
german authorities have also joined the investigations into the stuttgart automaker after the july 22 suicide of rudi kornmayer , a 53-year-old managing director of the company 's plant in nigeria who shot himself in esslingen , germany .
sources close to the case said that his suicide note made reference to the bribery investigation , which is scrutinizing daimlerchrysler operations in latin america and africa .
representatives on both sides of the atlantic have refused to comment on the suicide . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how corrupt is german business ?

now , the american sec is investigating possible wrongdoing by daimlerchrysler in connection with the program . the growing list of german corporations involved in scandals - bmw , infineon , volkswagen , commerzbank - got a little longer after reports surfaced that the united states security and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- is investigating whether german carmaker daimlerchrysler was involved in corrupt deals in the un oil-for-food program .
the company confirmed the sec probe on german public radio .
" we are working on this matter together with the sec and will send them the results of our investigations , " a company spokesperson said .
under investigation is whether daimlerchrysler deliveries to iraq under then-dictator saddam hussein violated us anti-corruption laws .
the sec has demanded files and bank documents from the carmaker .

it has since come under heavy fire for widespread corruption in its ranks .
the accusations range from money laundering to kickbacks and conspiracy .
on tuesday , a leading figure in the program , alexander yakovlev , admitted to money laundering and other charges .
an independent panel led by paul volcker , former us federal reserve bank chair , has also accused the former head of the program , benon sevan , of receiving kickbacks .
the german newsmagazine stern is planning to report in its next issue that the sec is looking into the sale of daimlerchrysler actros trucks -lrb- photo -rrb- .
in 2002 , iraq had ordered 150 of the vehicles , 50 of which were delivered via moscow .

a german businessman told stern that the cotecna was a bottleneck in the transactions and that companies often had to stand in line waiting for execution of their contracts .
reportedly , companies could " buy " their way up to the front of the line .
the sec wants to know if daimlerchrysler might have also paid a bribe to move up to the head of the queue .
since daimlerchrysler is listed on the new york stock exchange , the sec can investigate the carmaker , although it is a german company .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.08.2005 -pipe- 14:00 utc more than 1,100 berlin wall victims more than 1,100 people died trying to escape the former east germany , according to new research by a prominent victims group presented tuesday ahead of the 44th anniversary of the building of the berlin wall .
the " august 13 working group " , named for the day the communist state closed the border in 1961 to halt a mass exodus to the west , unveiled fresh findings about those shot by border guards or otherwise killed trying to flee .
the organization 's director , alexandra hildebrandt , said 70 previously unrecorded deaths had been uncovered in the past year , bringing the new total to 1,135 .
nearly 16 years after the berlin wall tumbled , german historians say the true number of border victims may never be known .
berlin prosecutors put the official total at 270 while the official central investigating group for government and unification crime cites 421 cases in which armed east german border guards are believed to have killed people trying to breach the wall .
the figure cited by the working group , which is based next to the former us-controlled checkpoint charlie border crossing at a berlin wall museum , includes deaths between the end of world war ii in 1945 when the soviets claimed control of east germany and the fall of the berlin wall on november 9 , 1989 .
the organization includes on its list east german border guards who were shot by people attempting to escape , killed by fellow soldiers , or who had committed suicide in response to orders to shoot their compatriots . dw-world.de the berlin wall goes online although very little remains of the berlin wall , a new government web site details where visitors can find parts of the despised cold war barrier and many other remnants of the city 's divided past .

the " august 13 working group " , named for the day the communist state closed the border in 1961 to halt a mass exodus to the west , unveiled fresh findings about those shot by border guards or otherwise killed trying to flee .
the organization 's director , alexandra hildebrandt , said 70 previously unrecorded deaths had been uncovered in the past year , bringing the new total to 1,135 .
nearly 16 years after the berlin wall tumbled , german historians say the true number of border victims may never be known .
berlin prosecutors put the official total at 270 while the official central investigating group for government and unification crime cites 421 cases in which armed east german border guards are believed to have killed people trying to breach the wall .
the figure cited by the working group , which is based next to the former us-controlled checkpoint charlie border crossing at a berlin wall museum , includes deaths between the end of world war ii in 1945 when the soviets claimed control of east germany and the fall of the berlin wall on november 9 , 1989 .
the organization includes on its list east german border guards who were shot by people attempting to escape , killed by fellow soldiers , or who had committed suicide in response to orders to shoot their compatriots . dw-world.de the berlin wall goes online although very little remains of the berlin wall , a new government web site details where visitors can find parts of the despised cold war barrier and many other remnants of the city 's divided past .

the organizers are working with the german foreign ministry to resolve the issues . hundreds of would-be pilgrims from asia and africa are still waiting for german visas to be able to attend catholic world youth day -lrb- wyd -rrb- celebrations next week , organizers said monday , since worries over illegal immigration were holding up applications in german consulates abroad . " we 're particularly worried about cameroon , togo and the philippines , " said world youth day spokesman matthias kopp in the western german city of cologne , citing scores of rejected or delayed applications . kopp said organizers had contacted the german foreign ministry in berlin in the hope of expediting the process . a fair procedure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german foreign promisses fair procedures , but no miracles a spokesperson for the foreign ministry said the ministry had agreed with world youth day officials on a procedure for processing the applications with the aim of ensuring the greatest participation possible while thwarting attempts at illegal immigration . he stressed that everybody wanted germany to be " a good and cosmopolitan host , " but also warned that the visa applications which did not meet the necessary requirements would have to be rejected . individual complaints would be " carefully and conscientiously reviewed , " the spokesperson said . a mega event the world youth day , running aug .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the players curtain falls on media chancellor joschka fischer , popular radical " kohl 's girl " makes good guido westerwelle , the liberals ' top gun election 2005 -pipe- 09.08.2005 eastern germans not crazy about angela großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is merkel still eastern enough for the east ?
much has been made of the east german roots of angela merkel , christian democratic party head and possibly germany 's first female chancellor .
but in the area she grew up in , she does n't enjoy any hometown advantage . along the main street of tiny crawford , texas , where us president george w. bush has his ranch , there are only a handful of shops , but at least three of them are souvenir stores .
they stock a cornucopia of bush paraphernalia , from dishes and coffee mugs emblazoned with the president 's portrait to bumper stickers and bush-themed chili . but in templin , the small german town north of berlin where angela merkel grew up , visitors are lucky to find much of anything about her anywhere .
last week , the only campaign poster up in the town 's picturesque market square was for a candidate from the party she 's looking to beat - the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel bios are n't exactly selling like hotcakes in her hometown of templin in the bookstore on the square , the owner had to hunt around for her new , much-talked-about biography , or in fact , any book about her .
in the end he found one , hidden behind the counter . " we 'd stock more if they sold , " said owner gerd pistorius .
" they 're not exactly harry potter . " walking through this town of 18,000 , one could easily remain ignorant to the fact that merkel , who could make history in probable elections on september 18 by becoming germany 's first woman chancellor , spent the first decades of her life here .
in fact , while there is some pride about the hometown girl who got to the top , her party wo n't likely win the vote in her own backyard , even though , nationwide , the cdu leads the spd by 13 percentage points in some polls . " i reject her completely , even though she comes from here , " said a woman walking with friends who gave her first name as gerda and her age as somewhere around 75 . angela merkel actually comes from western germany , since she was born in hamburg in 1954 .
but just months after her birth , her father moved the family to east germany , where he took a position as pastor .
in 1957 , the family moved to templin , where angela dorothea kasner lived and attended school until leaving for the university of leipzig in 1973 . bildunterschrift : templin 's market square turned her back ? in the national media , merkel 's eastern roots have been played up .
but for many in templin itself , merkel is seen as someone who turned her back on the east by joining the cdu , a party that is largely perceived here as one run by rich , western men .
even her recent makeover , where she was given a new hairstyle and wardrobe to counter an image that has been rather dowdy up to now , is seen as a kind of betrayal .

much has been made of the east german roots of angela merkel , christian democratic party head and possibly germany 's first female chancellor .
but in the area she grew up in , she does n't enjoy any hometown advantage . along the main street of tiny crawford , texas , where us president george w. bush has his ranch , there are only a handful of shops , but at least three of them are souvenir stores .
they stock a cornucopia of bush paraphernalia , from dishes and coffee mugs emblazoned with the president 's portrait to bumper stickers and bush-themed chili . but in templin , the small german town north of berlin where angela merkel grew up , visitors are lucky to find much of anything about her anywhere .
last week , the only campaign poster up in the town 's picturesque market square was for a candidate from the party she 's looking to beat - the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel bios are n't exactly selling like hotcakes in her hometown of templin in the bookstore on the square , the owner had to hunt around for her new , much-talked-about biography , or in fact , any book about her .
in the end he found one , hidden behind the counter . " we 'd stock more if they sold , " said owner gerd pistorius .
" they 're not exactly harry potter . " walking through this town of 18,000 , one could easily remain ignorant to the fact that merkel , who could make history in probable elections on september 18 by becoming germany 's first woman chancellor , spent the first decades of her life here .
in fact , while there is some pride about the hometown girl who got to the top , her party wo n't likely win the vote in her own backyard , even though , nationwide , the cdu leads the spd by 13 percentage points in some polls . " i reject her completely , even though she comes from here , " said a woman walking with friends who gave her first name as gerda and her age as somewhere around 75 . angela merkel actually comes from western germany , since she was born in hamburg in 1954 .
but just months after her birth , her father moved the family to east germany , where he took a position as pastor .
in 1957 , the family moved to templin , where angela dorothea kasner lived and attended school until leaving for the university of leipzig in 1973 . bildunterschrift : templin 's market square turned her back ? in the national media , merkel 's eastern roots have been played up .
but for many in templin itself , merkel is seen as someone who turned her back on the east by joining the cdu , a party that is largely perceived here as one run by rich , western men .
even her recent makeover , where she was given a new hairstyle and wardrobe to counter an image that has been rather dowdy up to now , is seen as a kind of betrayal . " she 's forgotten where she comes from , " said gerda . disillusioned by years of economic stagnation -lrb- the region has no industry to speak of and the unemployment rate hovers around 25 percent -rrb- , for many , merkel is just another politician from a party which considers the east a lost cause , and who wo n't likely be able to do anything to lift eastern germany out of its chronic malaise .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 09.08.2005 daimlerchrysler probed in oil-for-food scandal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler 's actions regarding the un program are under scrutiny germany has had little to do with the scandals around the un 's scandal-plagued oil-for-food program .
now , the american sec is investigating possible wrongdoing by daimlerchrysler in connection with the program . the growing list of german corporations involved in scandals - bmw , infineon , volkswagen , commerzbank - got a little longer after reports surfaced that the united states security and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- is investigating whether german carmaker daimlerchrysler was involved in corrupt deals in the un oil-for-food program .
the company confirmed the sec probe on german public radio .
" we are working on this matter together with the sec and will send them the results of our investigations , " a company spokesperson said .
under investigation is whether daimlerchrysler deliveries to iraq under then-dictator saddam hussein violated us anti-corruption laws .
the sec has demanded files and bank documents from the carmaker .
vehicles shipped to iraq via russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benon sevan , former head of un humanitarian programs in iraq , has been accused of corruption the un 's oil-for-food program , designed to allow the iraqi population access to food despite strict un sanctions , was in operation from 1996 to 2003 .
it has since come under heavy fire for widespread corruption in its ranks .
the accusations range from money laundering to kickbacks and conspiracy .
on tuesday , a leading figure in the program , alexander yakovlev , admitted to money laundering and other charges .
an independent panel led by paul volcker , former us federal reserve bank chair , has also accused the former head of the program , benon sevan , of receiving kickbacks .
the german newsmagazine stern is planning to report in its next issue that the sec is looking into the sale of daimlerchrysler actros trucks -lrb- photo -rrb- .
in 2002 , iraq had ordered 150 of the vehicles , 50 of which were delivered via moscow .
the daimler branch in russia sold them to the " russian engineering company " which in turn sold them to the iraqi state-controlled gamco .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes trucks like this one , the actros , were delivered to iraq all sales within the framework of the oil-for-food program were first approved by the un .
then the geneva-based company cotecna arranged both shipment and payment .
a german businessman told stern that the cotecna was a bottleneck in the transactions and that companies often had to stand in line waiting for execution of their contracts .
reportedly , companies could " buy " their way up to the front of the line .
the sec wants to know if daimlerchrysler might have also paid a bribe to move up to the head of the queue .
since daimlerchrysler is listed on the new york stock exchange , the sec can investigate the carmaker , although it is a german company .
more than one scandal but the oil-for-food program is not the only worry on daimlerchrysler 's mind .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general kofi annan has come under fire because his son worked for cotecna , which was involved in the oil-for-food program for over a year , the us justice department has been examining the allegations of a former chrysler accountant that the company maintained secret bank accounts to bribe foreign officials .
german authorities have also joined the investigations into the stuttgart automaker after the july 22 suicide of rudi kornmayer , a 53-year-old managing director of the company 's plant in nigeria who shot himself in esslingen , germany .
sources close to the case said that his suicide note made reference to the bribery investigation , which is scrutinizing daimlerchrysler operations in latin america and africa .
representatives on both sides of the atlantic have refused to comment on the suicide . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how corrupt is german business ?
corporate scandals at tv network ard , carmaker volkswagen and chipmaker infineon are dominating headlines and leaving many wondering if germany , once thought squeaky clean , is becoming increasingly corrupt .
-lrb- july 23 , 2005 -rrb- infineon bosses under investigation the headquarters of german semi-conductor giant infineon and the homes of several company directors were searched by munich 's public prosecutor friday , a company spokesman said .
-lrb- july 16 , 2005 -rrb- transparency needed to crush corruption in its 2005 global corruption report , transparency international reveals how corruption in the construction sector undermines economic development , and of the potential for crooked dealings in the reconstruction of iraq .

the company confirmed the sec probe on german public radio .
" we are working on this matter together with the sec and will send them the results of our investigations , " a company spokesperson said .
under investigation is whether daimlerchrysler deliveries to iraq under then-dictator saddam hussein violated us anti-corruption laws .
the sec has demanded files and bank documents from the carmaker .

it has since come under heavy fire for widespread corruption in its ranks .
the accusations range from money laundering to kickbacks and conspiracy .
on tuesday , a leading figure in the program , alexander yakovlev , admitted to money laundering and other charges .
an independent panel led by paul volcker , former us federal reserve bank chair , has also accused the former head of the program , benon sevan , of receiving kickbacks .
the german newsmagazine stern is planning to report in its next issue that the sec is looking into the sale of daimlerchrysler actros trucks -lrb- photo -rrb- .
in 2002 , iraq had ordered 150 of the vehicles , 50 of which were delivered via moscow .

a german businessman told stern that the cotecna was a bottleneck in the transactions and that companies often had to stand in line waiting for execution of their contracts .
reportedly , companies could " buy " their way up to the front of the line .
the sec wants to know if daimlerchrysler might have also paid a bribe to move up to the head of the queue .
since daimlerchrysler is listed on the new york stock exchange , the sec can investigate the carmaker , although it is a german company .
more than one scandal but the oil-for-food program is not the only worry on daimlerchrysler 's mind .

german authorities have also joined the investigations into the stuttgart automaker after the july 22 suicide of rudi kornmayer , a 53-year-old managing director of the company 's plant in nigeria who shot himself in esslingen , germany .

much has been made of the east german roots of angela merkel , christian democratic party head and possibly germany 's first female chancellor .
but in the area she grew up in , she does n't enjoy any hometown advantage . along the main street of tiny crawford , texas , where us president george w. bush has his ranch , there are only a handful of shops , but at least three of them are souvenir stores .
they stock a cornucopia of bush paraphernalia , from dishes and coffee mugs emblazoned with the president 's portrait to bumper stickers and bush-themed chili . but in templin , the small german town north of berlin where angela merkel grew up , visitors are lucky to find much of anything about her anywhere .
last week , the only campaign poster up in the town 's picturesque market square was for a candidate from the party she 's looking to beat - the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel bios are n't exactly selling like hotcakes in her hometown of templin in the bookstore on the square , the owner had to hunt around for her new , much-talked-about biography , or in fact , any book about her .
in the end he found one , hidden behind the counter . " we 'd stock more if they sold , " said owner gerd pistorius .
" they 're not exactly harry potter . " walking through this town of 18,000 , one could easily remain ignorant to the fact that merkel , who could make history in probable elections on september 18 by becoming germany 's first woman chancellor , spent the first decades of her life here .
in fact , while there is some pride about the hometown girl who got to the top , her party wo n't likely win the vote in her own backyard , even though , nationwide , the cdu leads the spd by 13 percentage points in some polls . " i reject her completely , even though she comes from here , " said a woman walking with friends who gave her first name as gerda and her age as somewhere around 75 . angela merkel actually comes from western germany , since she was born in hamburg in 1954 .
but just months after her birth , her father moved the family to east germany , where he took a position as pastor .
in 1957 , the family moved to templin , where angela dorothea kasner lived and attended school until leaving for the university of leipzig in 1973 . bildunterschrift : templin 's market square turned her back ? in the national media , merkel 's eastern roots have been played up .
but for many in templin itself , merkel is seen as someone who turned her back on the east by joining the cdu , a party that is largely perceived here as one run by rich , western men .
even her recent makeover , where she was given a new hairstyle and wardrobe to counter an image that has been rather dowdy up to now , is seen as a kind of betrayal . " she 's forgotten where she comes from , " said gerda . disillusioned by years of economic stagnation -lrb- the region has no industry to speak of and the unemployment rate hovers around 25 percent -rrb- , for many , merkel is just another politician from a party which considers the east a lost cause , and who wo n't likely be able to do anything to lift eastern germany out of its chronic malaise . " i could imagine that people in templin would prefer another candidate for chancellor , " said ulrich schoeneich , templin 's mayor and member of a small left-of-center party .
he does not think that a relative newcomer to politics - merkel did n't become active in politics until just after the fall of the berlin wall - could have the answers to eastern germany 's problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : her support for george w. bush has also aroused suspicions among locals .
" she 's not my dream choice , " schoeneich said . tourist draw ? merkel 's candidacy might seem like a dream come true for templin 's small tourism office , nestled up against the town 's intact city wall dating from the 14th century .
tourism is one of the few potential growth sectors for the town , and as merkel 's profile has risen in germany , more tourists have been arriving asking about some of the landmarks of her life , such as the local schools she went to . " well , if the demand is really there , then maybe we 'll do it , " said tourism director sabine hertrich , but with little enthusiasm in her voice .
asked what she thought of the person who might be considered perfect for the role of the town 's favorite daughter , she paused before deadpanning : " i met her at an opening once .
she 's a nice woman . " bildunterschrift : templin city wall according to joachim löwe , who heads the local cdu chapter , this reluctance to embrace merkel has less to do with personal animus than with unfamiliarity .
she has not lived in the town since the late 70s , only returning for the occasional weekend to visit her parents .
in addition , the cdu does not have a lot of support in the region , coming in third behind the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the successors to east germany 's communists , the pds . " that could change if her policies start changing the economic situation here , " he said , but added that he does not expect the commemorative plate to be unveiled anytime soon .
" i doubt people here will ever start wearing -lrb- merkel -rrb- t-shirts .
it 's just not the way we express things , " he said . get the balance right for the cdu , constructing angela merkel 's image and talking about her origins has been a delicate balancing act .
according to uwe andersen , a professor of political science at the ruhr university in bochum , there were concerns in the party that she might be considered too much of a representative of purely eastern interests , thereby alienating the larger pool of voters in the west .
therefore a strategy was developed to boost her appeal in western germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel - pre-makeover " and it worked , but perhaps too well , and it ended up limiting her support in the former east germany " he said .
" now she 's lost some of the automatic bonus she might have gotten in the east simply for having come from there . " but not everyone takes such a dim view .
ulrike zündorf , who owns a gift shop in templin , said she does not understand why people tend to be so negative about merkel .
she said she 's hoping merkel takes up residency in the chancellery in late september . " one , because she 's an east german , and two , because she 's a woman , " zündorf said .

much has been made of the east german roots of angela merkel , christian democratic party head and possibly germany 's first female chancellor .
but in the area she grew up in , she does n't enjoy any hometown advantage . along the main street of tiny crawford , texas , where us president george w. bush has his ranch , there are only a handful of shops , but at least three of them are souvenir stores .
they stock a cornucopia of bush paraphernalia , from dishes and coffee mugs emblazoned with the president 's portrait to bumper stickers and bush-themed chili . but in templin , the small german town north of berlin where angela merkel grew up , visitors are lucky to find much of anything about her anywhere .
last week , the only campaign poster up in the town 's picturesque market square was for a candidate from the party she 's looking to beat - the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel bios are n't exactly selling like hotcakes in her hometown of templin in the bookstore on the square , the owner had to hunt around for her new , much-talked-about biography , or in fact , any book about her .
in the end he found one , hidden behind the counter . " we 'd stock more if they sold , " said owner gerd pistorius .
" they 're not exactly harry potter . " walking through this town of 18,000 , one could easily remain ignorant to the fact that merkel , who could make history in probable elections on september 18 by becoming germany 's first woman chancellor , spent the first decades of her life here .
in fact , while there is some pride about the hometown girl who got to the top , her party wo n't likely win the vote in her own backyard , even though , nationwide , the cdu leads the spd by 13 percentage points in some polls . " i reject her completely , even though she comes from here , " said a woman walking with friends who gave her first name as gerda and her age as somewhere around 75 . angela merkel actually comes from western germany , since she was born in hamburg in 1954 .
but just months after her birth , her father moved the family to east germany , where he took a position as pastor .
in 1957 , the family moved to templin , where angela dorothea kasner lived and attended school until leaving for the university of leipzig in 1973 . bildunterschrift : templin 's market square turned her back ? in the national media , merkel 's eastern roots have been played up .
but for many in templin itself , merkel is seen as someone who turned her back on the east by joining the cdu , a party that is largely perceived here as one run by rich , western men .
even her recent makeover , where she was given a new hairstyle and wardrobe to counter an image that has been rather dowdy up to now , is seen as a kind of betrayal . " she 's forgotten where she comes from , " said gerda . disillusioned by years of economic stagnation -lrb- the region has no industry to speak of and the unemployment rate hovers around 25 percent -rrb- , for many , merkel is just another politician from a party which considers the east a lost cause , and who wo n't likely be able to do anything to lift eastern germany out of its chronic malaise . " i could imagine that people in templin would prefer another candidate for chancellor , " said ulrich schoeneich , templin 's mayor and member of a small left-of-center party .
he does not think that a relative newcomer to politics - merkel did n't become active in politics until just after the fall of the berlin wall - could have the answers to eastern germany 's problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : her support for george w. bush has also aroused suspicions among locals .
" she 's not my dream choice , " schoeneich said . tourist draw ? merkel 's candidacy might seem like a dream come true for templin 's small tourism office , nestled up against the town 's intact city wall dating from the 14th century .
tourism is one of the few potential growth sectors for the town , and as merkel 's profile has risen in germany , more tourists have been arriving asking about some of the landmarks of her life , such as the local schools she went to . " well , if the demand is really there , then maybe we 'll do it , " said tourism director sabine hertrich , but with little enthusiasm in her voice .
asked what she thought of the person who might be considered perfect for the role of the town 's favorite daughter , she paused before deadpanning : " i met her at an opening once .
she 's a nice woman . " bildunterschrift : templin city wall according to joachim löwe , who heads the local cdu chapter , this reluctance to embrace merkel has less to do with personal animus than with unfamiliarity .
she has not lived in the town since the late 70s , only returning for the occasional weekend to visit her parents .
in addition , the cdu does not have a lot of support in the region , coming in third behind the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the successors to east germany 's communists , the pds . " that could change if her policies start changing the economic situation here , " he said , but added that he does not expect the commemorative plate to be unveiled anytime soon .
" i doubt people here will ever start wearing -lrb- merkel -rrb- t-shirts .

much has been made of the east german roots of angela merkel , christian democratic party head and possibly germany 's first female chancellor .
but in the area she grew up in , she does n't enjoy any hometown advantage . along the main street of tiny crawford , texas , where us president george w. bush has his ranch , there are only a handful of shops , but at least three of them are souvenir stores .
they stock a cornucopia of bush paraphernalia , from dishes and coffee mugs emblazoned with the president 's portrait to bumper stickers and bush-themed chili . but in templin , the small german town north of berlin where angela merkel grew up , visitors are lucky to find much of anything about her anywhere .
last week , the only campaign poster up in the town 's picturesque market square was for a candidate from the party she 's looking to beat - the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel bios are n't exactly selling like hotcakes in her hometown of templin in the bookstore on the square , the owner had to hunt around for her new , much-talked-about biography , or in fact , any book about her .
in the end he found one , hidden behind the counter . " we 'd stock more if they sold , " said owner gerd pistorius .
" they 're not exactly harry potter . " walking through this town of 18,000 , one could easily remain ignorant to the fact that merkel , who could make history in probable elections on september 18 by becoming germany 's first woman chancellor , spent the first decades of her life here .
in fact , while there is some pride about the hometown girl who got to the top , her party wo n't likely win the vote in her own backyard , even though , nationwide , the cdu leads the spd by 13 percentage points in some polls . " i reject her completely , even though she comes from here , " said a woman walking with friends who gave her first name as gerda and her age as somewhere around 75 . angela merkel actually comes from western germany , since she was born in hamburg in 1954 .
but just months after her birth , her father moved the family to east germany , where he took a position as pastor .
in 1957 , the family moved to templin , where angela dorothea kasner lived and attended school until leaving for the university of leipzig in 1973 . bildunterschrift : templin 's market square turned her back ? in the national media , merkel 's eastern roots have been played up .
but for many in templin itself , merkel is seen as someone who turned her back on the east by joining the cdu , a party that is largely perceived here as one run by rich , western men .
even her recent makeover , where she was given a new hairstyle and wardrobe to counter an image that has been rather dowdy up to now , is seen as a kind of betrayal . " she 's forgotten where she comes from , " said gerda . disillusioned by years of economic stagnation -lrb- the region has no industry to speak of and the unemployment rate hovers around 25 percent -rrb- , for many , merkel is just another politician from a party which considers the east a lost cause , and who wo n't likely be able to do anything to lift eastern germany out of its chronic malaise . " i could imagine that people in templin would prefer another candidate for chancellor , " said ulrich schoeneich , templin 's mayor and member of a small left-of-center party .
he does not think that a relative newcomer to politics - merkel did n't become active in politics until just after the fall of the berlin wall - could have the answers to eastern germany 's problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : her support for george w. bush has also aroused suspicions among locals .
" she 's not my dream choice , " schoeneich said . tourist draw ? merkel 's candidacy might seem like a dream come true for templin 's small tourism office , nestled up against the town 's intact city wall dating from the 14th century .
tourism is one of the few potential growth sectors for the town , and as merkel 's profile has risen in germany , more tourists have been arriving asking about some of the landmarks of her life , such as the local schools she went to . " well , if the demand is really there , then maybe we 'll do it , " said tourism director sabine hertrich , but with little enthusiasm in her voice .
asked what she thought of the person who might be considered perfect for the role of the town 's favorite daughter , she paused before deadpanning : " i met her at an opening once .
she 's a nice woman . " bildunterschrift : templin city wall according to joachim löwe , who heads the local cdu chapter , this reluctance to embrace merkel has less to do with personal animus than with unfamiliarity .
she has not lived in the town since the late 70s , only returning for the occasional weekend to visit her parents .
in addition , the cdu does not have a lot of support in the region , coming in third behind the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the successors to east germany 's communists , the pds . " that could change if her policies start changing the economic situation here , " he said , but added that he does not expect the commemorative plate to be unveiled anytime soon .
" i doubt people here will ever start wearing -lrb- merkel -rrb- t-shirts .
it 's just not the way we express things , " he said . get the balance right for the cdu , constructing angela merkel 's image and talking about her origins has been a delicate balancing act .
according to uwe andersen , a professor of political science at the ruhr university in bochum , there were concerns in the party that she might be considered too much of a representative of purely eastern interests , thereby alienating the larger pool of voters in the west .
therefore a strategy was developed to boost her appeal in western germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel - pre-makeover " and it worked , but perhaps too well , and it ended up limiting her support in the former east germany " he said .
" now she 's lost some of the automatic bonus she might have gotten in the east simply for having come from there . " but not everyone takes such a dim view .
ulrike zündorf , who owns a gift shop in templin , said she does not understand why people tend to be so negative about merkel .
she said she 's hoping merkel takes up residency in the chancellery in late september . " one , because she 's an east german , and two , because she 's a woman , " zündorf said .
" men have tried to get it right a long time and look where we are now .
i could imagine that a woman could do it better .

but in the area she grew up in , she does n't enjoy any hometown advantage . along the main street of tiny crawford , texas , where us president george w. bush has his ranch , there are only a handful of shops , but at least three of them are souvenir stores .
they stock a cornucopia of bush paraphernalia , from dishes and coffee mugs emblazoned with the president 's portrait to bumper stickers and bush-themed chili . but in templin , the small german town north of berlin where angela merkel grew up , visitors are lucky to find much of anything about her anywhere .
last week , the only campaign poster up in the town 's picturesque market square was for a candidate from the party she 's looking to beat - the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel bios are n't exactly selling like hotcakes in her hometown of templin in the bookstore on the square , the owner had to hunt around for her new , much-talked-about biography , or in fact , any book about her .
in the end he found one , hidden behind the counter . " we 'd stock more if they sold , " said owner gerd pistorius .
" they 're not exactly harry potter . " walking through this town of 18,000 , one could easily remain ignorant to the fact that merkel , who could make history in probable elections on september 18 by becoming germany 's first woman chancellor , spent the first decades of her life here .
in fact , while there is some pride about the hometown girl who got to the top , her party wo n't likely win the vote in her own backyard , even though , nationwide , the cdu leads the spd by 13 percentage points in some polls . " i reject her completely , even though she comes from here , " said a woman walking with friends who gave her first name as gerda and her age as somewhere around 75 . angela merkel actually comes from western germany , since she was born in hamburg in 1954 .
but just months after her birth , her father moved the family to east germany , where he took a position as pastor .
in 1957 , the family moved to templin , where angela dorothea kasner lived and attended school until leaving for the university of leipzig in 1973 . bildunterschrift : templin 's market square turned her back ? in the national media , merkel 's eastern roots have been played up .
but for many in templin itself , merkel is seen as someone who turned her back on the east by joining the cdu , a party that is largely perceived here as one run by rich , western men .
even her recent makeover , where she was given a new hairstyle and wardrobe to counter an image that has been rather dowdy up to now , is seen as a kind of betrayal . " she 's forgotten where she comes from , " said gerda . disillusioned by years of economic stagnation -lrb- the region has no industry to speak of and the unemployment rate hovers around 25 percent -rrb- , for many , merkel is just another politician from a party which considers the east a lost cause , and who wo n't likely be able to do anything to lift eastern germany out of its chronic malaise . " i could imagine that people in templin would prefer another candidate for chancellor , " said ulrich schoeneich , templin 's mayor and member of a small left-of-center party .
he does not think that a relative newcomer to politics - merkel did n't become active in politics until just after the fall of the berlin wall - could have the answers to eastern germany 's problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : her support for george w. bush has also aroused suspicions among locals .
" she 's not my dream choice , " schoeneich said . tourist draw ? merkel 's candidacy might seem like a dream come true for templin 's small tourism office , nestled up against the town 's intact city wall dating from the 14th century .
tourism is one of the few potential growth sectors for the town , and as merkel 's profile has risen in germany , more tourists have been arriving asking about some of the landmarks of her life , such as the local schools she went to . " well , if the demand is really there , then maybe we 'll do it , " said tourism director sabine hertrich , but with little enthusiasm in her voice .
asked what she thought of the person who might be considered perfect for the role of the town 's favorite daughter , she paused before deadpanning : " i met her at an opening once .
she 's a nice woman . " bildunterschrift : templin city wall according to joachim löwe , who heads the local cdu chapter , this reluctance to embrace merkel has less to do with personal animus than with unfamiliarity .
she has not lived in the town since the late 70s , only returning for the occasional weekend to visit her parents .
in addition , the cdu does not have a lot of support in the region , coming in third behind the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the successors to east germany 's communists , the pds . " that could change if her policies start changing the economic situation here , " he said , but added that he does not expect the commemorative plate to be unveiled anytime soon .
" i doubt people here will ever start wearing -lrb- merkel -rrb- t-shirts .
it 's just not the way we express things , " he said . get the balance right for the cdu , constructing angela merkel 's image and talking about her origins has been a delicate balancing act .
according to uwe andersen , a professor of political science at the ruhr university in bochum , there were concerns in the party that she might be considered too much of a representative of purely eastern interests , thereby alienating the larger pool of voters in the west .
therefore a strategy was developed to boost her appeal in western germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel - pre-makeover " and it worked , but perhaps too well , and it ended up limiting her support in the former east germany " he said .
" now she 's lost some of the automatic bonus she might have gotten in the east simply for having come from there . " but not everyone takes such a dim view .
ulrike zündorf , who owns a gift shop in templin , said she does not understand why people tend to be so negative about merkel .
she said she 's hoping merkel takes up residency in the chancellery in late september . " one , because she 's an east german , and two , because she 's a woman , " zündorf said .

" she 's not my dream choice , " schoeneich said . tourist draw ? merkel 's candidacy might seem like a dream come true for templin 's small tourism office , nestled up against the town 's intact city wall dating from the 14th century .
tourism is one of the few potential growth sectors for the town , and as merkel 's profile has risen in germany , more tourists have been arriving asking about some of the landmarks of her life , such as the local schools she went to . " well , if the demand is really there , then maybe we 'll do it , " said tourism director sabine hertrich , but with little enthusiasm in her voice .
asked what she thought of the person who might be considered perfect for the role of the town 's favorite daughter , she paused before deadpanning : " i met her at an opening once .
she 's a nice woman . " bildunterschrift : templin city wall according to joachim löwe , who heads the local cdu chapter , this reluctance to embrace merkel has less to do with personal animus than with unfamiliarity .
she has not lived in the town since the late 70s , only returning for the occasional weekend to visit her parents .
in addition , the cdu does not have a lot of support in the region , coming in third behind the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the successors to east germany 's communists , the pds . " that could change if her policies start changing the economic situation here , " he said , but added that he does not expect the commemorative plate to be unveiled anytime soon .
" i doubt people here will ever start wearing -lrb- merkel -rrb- t-shirts .
it 's just not the way we express things , " he said . get the balance right for the cdu , constructing angela merkel 's image and talking about her origins has been a delicate balancing act .
according to uwe andersen , a professor of political science at the ruhr university in bochum , there were concerns in the party that she might be considered too much of a representative of purely eastern interests , thereby alienating the larger pool of voters in the west .
therefore a strategy was developed to boost her appeal in western germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel - pre-makeover " and it worked , but perhaps too well , and it ended up limiting her support in the former east germany " he said .
" now she 's lost some of the automatic bonus she might have gotten in the east simply for having come from there . " but not everyone takes such a dim view .
ulrike zündorf , who owns a gift shop in templin , said she does not understand why people tend to be so negative about merkel .
she said she 's hoping merkel takes up residency in the chancellery in late september . " one , because she 's an east german , and two , because she 's a woman , " zündorf said .
" men have tried to get it right a long time and look where we are now .
i could imagine that a woman could do it better .

the " august 13 working group " , named for the day the communist state closed the border in 1961 to halt a mass exodus to the west , unveiled fresh findings about those shot by border guards or otherwise killed trying to flee .
the organization 's director , alexandra hildebrandt , said 70 previously unrecorded deaths had been uncovered in the past year , bringing the new total to 1,135 .
nearly 16 years after the berlin wall tumbled , german historians say the true number of border victims may never be known .
berlin prosecutors put the official total at 270 while the official central investigating group for government and unification crime cites 421 cases in which armed east german border guards are believed to have killed people trying to breach the wall .
the figure cited by the working group , which is based next to the former us-controlled checkpoint charlie border crossing at a berlin wall museum , includes deaths between the end of world war ii in 1945 when the soviets claimed control of east germany and the fall of the berlin wall on november 9 , 1989 .
the organization includes on its list east german border guards who were shot by people attempting to escape , killed by fellow soldiers , or who had committed suicide in response to orders to shoot their compatriots . dw-world.de the berlin wall goes online although very little remains of the berlin wall , a new government web site details where visitors can find parts of the despised cold war barrier and many other remnants of the city 's divided past .

now , the american sec is investigating possible wrongdoing by daimlerchrysler in connection with the program . the growing list of german corporations involved in scandals - bmw , infineon , volkswagen , commerzbank - got a little longer after reports surfaced that the united states security and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- is investigating whether german carmaker daimlerchrysler was involved in corrupt deals in the un oil-for-food program .
the company confirmed the sec probe on german public radio .
" we are working on this matter together with the sec and will send them the results of our investigations , " a company spokesperson said .
under investigation is whether daimlerchrysler deliveries to iraq under then-dictator saddam hussein violated us anti-corruption laws .
the sec has demanded files and bank documents from the carmaker .
vehicles shipped to iraq via russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benon sevan , former head of un humanitarian programs in iraq , has been accused of corruption the un 's oil-for-food program , designed to allow the iraqi population access to food despite strict un sanctions , was in operation from 1996 to 2003 .
it has since come under heavy fire for widespread corruption in its ranks .
the accusations range from money laundering to kickbacks and conspiracy .
on tuesday , a leading figure in the program , alexander yakovlev , admitted to money laundering and other charges .
an independent panel led by paul volcker , former us federal reserve bank chair , has also accused the former head of the program , benon sevan , of receiving kickbacks .
the german newsmagazine stern is planning to report in its next issue that the sec is looking into the sale of daimlerchrysler actros trucks -lrb- photo -rrb- .
in 2002 , iraq had ordered 150 of the vehicles , 50 of which were delivered via moscow .

a german businessman told stern that the cotecna was a bottleneck in the transactions and that companies often had to stand in line waiting for execution of their contracts .
reportedly , companies could " buy " their way up to the front of the line .
the sec wants to know if daimlerchrysler might have also paid a bribe to move up to the head of the queue .
since daimlerchrysler is listed on the new york stock exchange , the sec can investigate the carmaker , although it is a german company .
more than one scandal but the oil-for-food program is not the only worry on daimlerchrysler 's mind .

now , the american sec is investigating possible wrongdoing by daimlerchrysler in connection with the program . the growing list of german corporations involved in scandals - bmw , infineon , volkswagen , commerzbank - got a little longer after reports surfaced that the united states security and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- is investigating whether german carmaker daimlerchrysler was involved in corrupt deals in the un oil-for-food program .
the company confirmed the sec probe on german public radio .
" we are working on this matter together with the sec and will send them the results of our investigations , " a company spokesperson said .
under investigation is whether daimlerchrysler deliveries to iraq under then-dictator saddam hussein violated us anti-corruption laws .
the sec has demanded files and bank documents from the carmaker .
vehicles shipped to iraq via russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benon sevan , former head of un humanitarian programs in iraq , has been accused of corruption the un 's oil-for-food program , designed to allow the iraqi population access to food despite strict un sanctions , was in operation from 1996 to 2003 .
it has since come under heavy fire for widespread corruption in its ranks .
the accusations range from money laundering to kickbacks and conspiracy .
on tuesday , a leading figure in the program , alexander yakovlev , admitted to money laundering and other charges .
an independent panel led by paul volcker , former us federal reserve bank chair , has also accused the former head of the program , benon sevan , of receiving kickbacks .
the german newsmagazine stern is planning to report in its next issue that the sec is looking into the sale of daimlerchrysler actros trucks -lrb- photo -rrb- .
in 2002 , iraq had ordered 150 of the vehicles , 50 of which were delivered via moscow .
the daimler branch in russia sold them to the " russian engineering company " which in turn sold them to the iraqi state-controlled gamco .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes trucks like this one , the actros , were delivered to iraq all sales within the framework of the oil-for-food program were first approved by the un .
then the geneva-based company cotecna arranged both shipment and payment .
a german businessman told stern that the cotecna was a bottleneck in the transactions and that companies often had to stand in line waiting for execution of their contracts .
reportedly , companies could " buy " their way up to the front of the line .
the sec wants to know if daimlerchrysler might have also paid a bribe to move up to the head of the queue .
since daimlerchrysler is listed on the new york stock exchange , the sec can investigate the carmaker , although it is a german company .
more than one scandal but the oil-for-food program is not the only worry on daimlerchrysler 's mind .

the " august 13 working group " , named for the day the communist state closed the border in 1961 to halt a mass exodus to the west , unveiled fresh findings about those shot by border guards or otherwise killed trying to flee .
the organization 's director , alexandra hildebrandt , said 70 previously unrecorded deaths had been uncovered in the past year , bringing the new total to 1,135 .

berlin prosecutors put the official total at 270 while the official central investigating group for government and unification crime cites 421 cases in which armed east german border guards are believed to have killed people trying to breach the wall .
the figure cited by the working group , which is based next to the former us-controlled checkpoint charlie border crossing at a berlin wall museum , includes deaths between the end of world war ii in 1945 when the soviets claimed control of east germany and the fall of the berlin wall on november 9 , 1989 .

the " august 13 working group " , named for the day the communist state closed the border in 1961 to halt a mass exodus to the west , unveiled fresh findings about those shot by border guards or otherwise killed trying to flee .
the organization 's director , alexandra hildebrandt , said 70 previously unrecorded deaths had been uncovered in the past year , bringing the new total to 1,135 .
nearly 16 years after the berlin wall tumbled , german historians say the true number of border victims may never be known .
berlin prosecutors put the official total at 270 while the official central investigating group for government and unification crime cites 421 cases in which armed east german border guards are believed to have killed people trying to breach the wall .
the figure cited by the working group , which is based next to the former us-controlled checkpoint charlie border crossing at a berlin wall museum , includes deaths between the end of world war ii in 1945 when the soviets claimed control of east germany and the fall of the berlin wall on november 9 , 1989 .
the organization includes on its list east german border guards who were shot by people attempting to escape , killed by fellow soldiers , or who had committed suicide in response to orders to shoot their compatriots . dw-world.de the berlin wall goes online although very little remains of the berlin wall , a new government web site details where visitors can find parts of the despised cold war barrier and many other remnants of the city 's divided past .

much has been made of the east german roots of angela merkel , christian democratic party head and possibly germany 's first female chancellor .
but in the area she grew up in , she does n't enjoy any hometown advantage . along the main street of tiny crawford , texas , where us president george w. bush has his ranch , there are only a handful of shops , but at least three of them are souvenir stores .
they stock a cornucopia of bush paraphernalia , from dishes and coffee mugs emblazoned with the president 's portrait to bumper stickers and bush-themed chili . but in templin , the small german town north of berlin where angela merkel grew up , visitors are lucky to find much of anything about her anywhere .
last week , the only campaign poster up in the town 's picturesque market square was for a candidate from the party she 's looking to beat - the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel bios are n't exactly selling like hotcakes in her hometown of templin in the bookstore on the square , the owner had to hunt around for her new , much-talked-about biography , or in fact , any book about her .
in the end he found one , hidden behind the counter . " we 'd stock more if they sold , " said owner gerd pistorius .
" they 're not exactly harry potter . " walking through this town of 18,000 , one could easily remain ignorant to the fact that merkel , who could make history in probable elections on september 18 by becoming germany 's first woman chancellor , spent the first decades of her life here .
in fact , while there is some pride about the hometown girl who got to the top , her party wo n't likely win the vote in her own backyard , even though , nationwide , the cdu leads the spd by 13 percentage points in some polls . " i reject her completely , even though she comes from here , " said a woman walking with friends who gave her first name as gerda and her age as somewhere around 75 . angela merkel actually comes from western germany , since she was born in hamburg in 1954 .
but just months after her birth , her father moved the family to east germany , where he took a position as pastor .
in 1957 , the family moved to templin , where angela dorothea kasner lived and attended school until leaving for the university of leipzig in 1973 . bildunterschrift : templin 's market square turned her back ? in the national media , merkel 's eastern roots have been played up .
but for many in templin itself , merkel is seen as someone who turned her back on the east by joining the cdu , a party that is largely perceived here as one run by rich , western men .
even her recent makeover , where she was given a new hairstyle and wardrobe to counter an image that has been rather dowdy up to now , is seen as a kind of betrayal . " she 's forgotten where she comes from , " said gerda . disillusioned by years of economic stagnation -lrb- the region has no industry to speak of and the unemployment rate hovers around 25 percent -rrb- , for many , merkel is just another politician from a party which considers the east a lost cause , and who wo n't likely be able to do anything to lift eastern germany out of its chronic malaise . " i could imagine that people in templin would prefer another candidate for chancellor , " said ulrich schoeneich , templin 's mayor and member of a small left-of-center party .
he does not think that a relative newcomer to politics - merkel did n't become active in politics until just after the fall of the berlin wall - could have the answers to eastern germany 's problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : her support for george w. bush has also aroused suspicions among locals .
" she 's not my dream choice , " schoeneich said . tourist draw ? merkel 's candidacy might seem like a dream come true for templin 's small tourism office , nestled up against the town 's intact city wall dating from the 14th century .
tourism is one of the few potential growth sectors for the town , and as merkel 's profile has risen in germany , more tourists have been arriving asking about some of the landmarks of her life , such as the local schools she went to . " well , if the demand is really there , then maybe we 'll do it , " said tourism director sabine hertrich , but with little enthusiasm in her voice .
asked what she thought of the person who might be considered perfect for the role of the town 's favorite daughter , she paused before deadpanning : " i met her at an opening once .
she 's a nice woman . " bildunterschrift : templin city wall according to joachim löwe , who heads the local cdu chapter , this reluctance to embrace merkel has less to do with personal animus than with unfamiliarity .
she has not lived in the town since the late 70s , only returning for the occasional weekend to visit her parents .
in addition , the cdu does not have a lot of support in the region , coming in third behind the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the successors to east germany 's communists , the pds . " that could change if her policies start changing the economic situation here , " he said , but added that he does not expect the commemorative plate to be unveiled anytime soon .
" i doubt people here will ever start wearing -lrb- merkel -rrb- t-shirts .
it 's just not the way we express things , " he said . get the balance right for the cdu , constructing angela merkel 's image and talking about her origins has been a delicate balancing act .
according to uwe andersen , a professor of political science at the ruhr university in bochum , there were concerns in the party that she might be considered too much of a representative of purely eastern interests , thereby alienating the larger pool of voters in the west .
therefore a strategy was developed to boost her appeal in western germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel - pre-makeover " and it worked , but perhaps too well , and it ended up limiting her support in the former east germany " he said .
" now she 's lost some of the automatic bonus she might have gotten in the east simply for having come from there . " but not everyone takes such a dim view .
ulrike zündorf , who owns a gift shop in templin , said she does not understand why people tend to be so negative about merkel .
she said she 's hoping merkel takes up residency in the chancellery in late september . " one , because she 's an east german , and two , because she 's a woman , " zündorf said .

much has been made of the east german roots of angela merkel , christian democratic party head and possibly germany 's first female chancellor .
but in the area she grew up in , she does n't enjoy any hometown advantage . along the main street of tiny crawford , texas , where us president george w. bush has his ranch , there are only a handful of shops , but at least three of them are souvenir stores .
they stock a cornucopia of bush paraphernalia , from dishes and coffee mugs emblazoned with the president 's portrait to bumper stickers and bush-themed chili . but in templin , the small german town north of berlin where angela merkel grew up , visitors are lucky to find much of anything about her anywhere .
last week , the only campaign poster up in the town 's picturesque market square was for a candidate from the party she 's looking to beat - the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel bios are n't exactly selling like hotcakes in her hometown of templin in the bookstore on the square , the owner had to hunt around for her new , much-talked-about biography , or in fact , any book about her .
in the end he found one , hidden behind the counter . " we 'd stock more if they sold , " said owner gerd pistorius .
" they 're not exactly harry potter . " walking through this town of 18,000 , one could easily remain ignorant to the fact that merkel , who could make history in probable elections on september 18 by becoming germany 's first woman chancellor , spent the first decades of her life here .
in fact , while there is some pride about the hometown girl who got to the top , her party wo n't likely win the vote in her own backyard , even though , nationwide , the cdu leads the spd by 13 percentage points in some polls . " i reject her completely , even though she comes from here , " said a woman walking with friends who gave her first name as gerda and her age as somewhere around 75 . angela merkel actually comes from western germany , since she was born in hamburg in 1954 .
but just months after her birth , her father moved the family to east germany , where he took a position as pastor .
in 1957 , the family moved to templin , where angela dorothea kasner lived and attended school until leaving for the university of leipzig in 1973 . bildunterschrift : templin 's market square turned her back ? in the national media , merkel 's eastern roots have been played up .
but for many in templin itself , merkel is seen as someone who turned her back on the east by joining the cdu , a party that is largely perceived here as one run by rich , western men .
even her recent makeover , where she was given a new hairstyle and wardrobe to counter an image that has been rather dowdy up to now , is seen as a kind of betrayal . " she 's forgotten where she comes from , " said gerda . disillusioned by years of economic stagnation -lrb- the region has no industry to speak of and the unemployment rate hovers around 25 percent -rrb- , for many , merkel is just another politician from a party which considers the east a lost cause , and who wo n't likely be able to do anything to lift eastern germany out of its chronic malaise . " i could imagine that people in templin would prefer another candidate for chancellor , " said ulrich schoeneich , templin 's mayor and member of a small left-of-center party .
he does not think that a relative newcomer to politics - merkel did n't become active in politics until just after the fall of the berlin wall - could have the answers to eastern germany 's problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : her support for george w. bush has also aroused suspicions among locals .
" she 's not my dream choice , " schoeneich said . tourist draw ? merkel 's candidacy might seem like a dream come true for templin 's small tourism office , nestled up against the town 's intact city wall dating from the 14th century .
tourism is one of the few potential growth sectors for the town , and as merkel 's profile has risen in germany , more tourists have been arriving asking about some of the landmarks of her life , such as the local schools she went to . " well , if the demand is really there , then maybe we 'll do it , " said tourism director sabine hertrich , but with little enthusiasm in her voice .
asked what she thought of the person who might be considered perfect for the role of the town 's favorite daughter , she paused before deadpanning : " i met her at an opening once .
she 's a nice woman . " bildunterschrift : templin city wall according to joachim löwe , who heads the local cdu chapter , this reluctance to embrace merkel has less to do with personal animus than with unfamiliarity .
she has not lived in the town since the late 70s , only returning for the occasional weekend to visit her parents .
in addition , the cdu does not have a lot of support in the region , coming in third behind the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the successors to east germany 's communists , the pds . " that could change if her policies start changing the economic situation here , " he said , but added that he does not expect the commemorative plate to be unveiled anytime soon .
" i doubt people here will ever start wearing -lrb- merkel -rrb- t-shirts .
it 's just not the way we express things , " he said . get the balance right for the cdu , constructing angela merkel 's image and talking about her origins has been a delicate balancing act .
according to uwe andersen , a professor of political science at the ruhr university in bochum , there were concerns in the party that she might be considered too much of a representative of purely eastern interests , thereby alienating the larger pool of voters in the west .
therefore a strategy was developed to boost her appeal in western germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel - pre-makeover " and it worked , but perhaps too well , and it ended up limiting her support in the former east germany " he said .
" now she 's lost some of the automatic bonus she might have gotten in the east simply for having come from there . " but not everyone takes such a dim view .
ulrike zündorf , who owns a gift shop in templin , said she does not understand why people tend to be so negative about merkel .
she said she 's hoping merkel takes up residency in the chancellery in late september . " one , because she 's an east german , and two , because she 's a woman , " zündorf said .

vets at northampton 's the people 's dispensary for sick animals -lrb- pdsa -rrb- say parvovirus causes bleeding diarrhoea , vomiting and affects the intestines .
three suspected cases of the virus have been treated at the hospital in monks pond street in the last few weeks .
vets say if a dog shows symptoms it should be taken to its local veterinary practice immediately .
canine parvovirus is a highly contagious disease which can be spread through contact with the faeces of infected dogs and every day objects such as clothing .
there are no drugs available to combat the viral infection , so seriously ill patients may need intensive treatments such as intra-venous fluids .
a vaccination against the virus is available .

about a million acres , a fifth of wales , was opened up to walkers for the first time in may this year .
the call was made on tuesday at the start of the two-day anglesey show at mona near gwalchmai .
organisers are hoping for record numbers of visitors , with more livestock entries than ever before .
the show , the largest in north wales , hopes to break its 60,000 visitor barrier for the first time .
some hope that increased number of entries in the livestock section is a reflection of a farming industry being in a buoyant mood .
but farming unions have pointed out that low milk prices at the farm gate and a slump in beef prices remain a cause for concern .
show organisers hope to attract an attendance of 60,000 against this background , the country landowners ' association -lrb- cla wales -rrb- has called on the welsh assembly government to think carefully before going ahead with any plans to map wales for new right-to-roam areas .
the organisation said the assembly government needed to prove there was a need for extra access to land owned by its members rather than to assume there was one .
the countryside council for wales is to present a report to the assembly government in spring next year on the options for extending access to coastal land by 2009 .
coastal path david alexander , anglesey chairman of the cla , said : " we 're involved in the consultation process and we 're not convinced that there is widespread demand for any more coastal access .
" we think there is already satisfaction with the coastal footpaths and existing voluntary arrangements .
" why burden the taxpayer with another expense for something for which there is no established need ?
what are the benefits ?
the statistics show that very few people ever walk more than a short distance from their car . "
walkers make an estimated 33m trips to wales each year , bringing in more than £ 500m .
an estimated 300,000 people use anglesey 's 125-mile coastal path , which was established prior to the right-to-roam legislation .
beverley penney , director of the ramblers ' association in wales said she " strongly disagreed " with the cla 's call and said much more work was needed to open coastal routes .
" we believe there is a real public demand to see access to the coast increased , extending the current system of coastal paths to a broad ribbon of cliff top land where people can go and walk and enjoy the wonderful sea views without worrying about being too near the cliff edge , " she said .
the association said more than 1,000 people joined the annual ynys mon walking festival in june .
ms penney added : " in spite of this popularity , even on anglesey there are several significant gaps in the coastal walking routes that require action .
the plas newydd and bodorgan estates have no coastal access , and on the nearby mainland there is a marked gap around penrhyn castle estate " .
organisers opened an overflow carpark to deal with the queues of show-goers arriving .
there was also a three mile tailback on the a55 heading west to anglesey .

cheam channy , a senior member of the sam rainsy party , had denied the charges against him .
he was arrested in february after being stripped of his parliamentary immunity .
two other party members - leader sam rainsy and mp chea poch - were also stripped of their immunity in february and immediately left the country .
human rights activists have strongly criticised cheam channy 's trial , seeing it as a move by the government to stifle political dissent .
' completely unfair ' judge ney thol announced on tuesday that cheam channy had been found guilty of " trying to build up covert forces " .
" his main objective was to collect military intelligence and cause damage to the existing government 's military , " the judge said .
cheam channy was also found guilty of soliciting money in return for positions of authority within the rebel group he is said to have formed .
sam rainsy has been an outspoken government critic " this verdict is completely unfair to me , " cheam channy is reported to have said as he was led off to jail .
khom piseth , another member of the sam rainsy party , was convicted in absentia and sentenced to five years in jail .
the new-york based group human rights watch also condemned the verdicts .
" the trial was a complete sham , " said brad adams , the group 's asia director .
" once again , cambodia 's politicised judiciary has been used as a tool to silence the opposition . "
speaking to the associated press before the verdict , sam rainsy said the charges against cheam channy were " politically motivated " .
he said they were being used by prime minister hun sen 's ruling party " to crack down - through a corrupt and politicised court - on its challenger at the next general election " .
sam rainsy himself faces three lawsuits charging him of defamation and slander , which stem from his claims that the government plotted to kill its political rivals , and that coalition partner prince ranariddh took bribes to join the government .
he fled to paris earlier this year after he , too , was stripped of parliamentary immunity .

dov hikind 's argument for " terrorist profiling " sparked furore it is the latest twist in a week which has seen public debate in the city become increasingly frenzied over the issue of racial or ethnic profiling .
at one end of the spectrum stands the new york civil liberties union , which argues that random checks on the city 's huge subway system are ineffective , and will always be discriminatory - creating the potential for targeting young , brown-skinned men .
at the other end are a handful of city politicians who argue that these are precisely the kind of people who police should be subjecting to a stop-and-search policy .
the orthodox jewish state assemblyman , dov hikind , created a furore last weekend when he called a press conference in his brooklyn constituency .
he brandished mug-shots of the largely middle eastern men from the fbi 's " most wanted " list , saying that all recent terrorists " look basically like this " .
i do n't mind being singled out , because i 've got nothing to hide billy adams it is illegal for police in new york to conduct searches based on racial profiling , and they maintain that random searching is effective , and a good deterrent .
mr hikind denies that he is arguing for racial profiling , preferring the phrase " terrorist profiling " .
he told me that he agreed with the head of the british transport police , that stopping elderly women was a " politically correct " waste of time .
" the police officer should n't be constrained by saying , if i check too many people of middle eastern descent , somebody 's going to be looking over my back - that 's crazy , " he said .
' we need unity ' but a group of five new york city council members - who represent the most ethnically diverse electorate in the world - held their own mid-week press conference on the steps of city hall .
they support police policy , and warn against profiling of any kind .
it came to the point where i was thinking about leaving this country babir sultan , 22 " we can not start to do this , " said robert jackson , who represents a mainly black and hispanic district around harlem .
" we will divide our country and the city of new york , and right now we need unity - for all of us to stand together . "
despite the passionate defence of civil liberties by city lawmakers , it seems that some new york commuters who belong to ethnic minorities are less concerned at the idea of being singled out in these times of high alert .
billy adams was one of several young black men i spoke to on the concourse of pennsylvania station , in midtown manhattan .
" the police should do whatever it takes .
coming from the ' hood that i live in , we 're used to -lsb- being stopped -rsb- , " he said .
" now is a new era , and it 's about stopping something much more dangerous .
i do n't mind being singled out , because i 've got nothing to hide , " he said .
several young muslims i spoke to said they had not been stopped and were confident that their religious dress was not an issue on the subway .
the low-level nature of the genuinely random police checks may be reassuring .
but for plenty of muslims living around new york , the wider issue of profiling and its destabilising effect has been all too apparent .
american ' nightmare ' babir sultan is a 22-year-old of kashmiri descent who has been an american citizen for more than 10 years now .
immediately after 11 september 2001 , he believed that some american muslims were being over-sensitive when they complained about being profiled at airports .
commuters are being hit by the new random bag-search policy all that changed following two separate encounters with counter-terrorism officers - the second of which involved being questioned aggressively at home and his workplace .
he claims that federal agents threatened him with a four-year stint in jail , all because somebody had reported seeing him using a camcorder on a new york highway earlier this year .
he had been making a video for his niece 's birthday party and was not charged , he said .
the " american dream " for him has become a nightmare .
he finds it hard to sleep and he looks on the verge of nervous exhaustion .
" it came to the point where i was thinking about leaving this country .
i was born in england but after those bomb incidents and a person getting shot ...
there 's no escape from it , " he said .
if you talk to arab or muslim americans , the stories of routine harassment by various authority figures - based on their names and appearance - are legion .
as the public debate continues apace over how best to avoid london 's fate , many here are beginning to wonder whether the same sense of alienation and disengagement on the part of young muslims can really be avoided .
the strong sense of american social inclusiveness will not be enough to counter growing feelings of fear and rejection that go way beyond protecting the subway .

the evils were want , squalor , idleness , ignorance and disease .
it was powerful stuff : the report , which was written by the economist william beveridge , helped bring about the post-war welfare state .
but it did little to eradicate fuel poverty .
frozen plight looking at modern britain you could legitimately add fuel poverty to the original list .
the rough and ready definition of fuel poverty is of someone who spends more than 10 % of their income on keeping themselves warm .
however , fuel poverty is not just about low incomes .
it is part of a complex picture , linked to multiple deprivation , unaffordable fuel prices and poor housing stock characterised by inadequate insulation and inefficient heating systems .
disconnections while fuel poverty has of course always been around , it emerged as a serious social concern in the mid-1970s , born out of the oil crisis .
britain has the highest number of avoidable deaths due to winter cold in western europe by 1986 , household gas and electricity disconnections due to debt ran at a peak of 160,000 a year .
since then , companies have introduced " safety net " policies to make sure vulnerable customers are not disconnected .
but the latest figures suggest there are currently over two million households across the uk that can not afford to keep adequately warm at a reasonable cost .
as energy prices rise , this number will go up .
yet , 34 % of people would not ask for financial assistance if they could not afford to heat their home throughout the winter , according to a recent survey .
the consequences are enormous .
fuel poverty can and does kill .
britain has the highest number of avoidable deaths due to winter cold in western europe .
it is estimated that 24,000 older people will perish this winter because they often ca n't afford to heat or from ill health linked to cold , damp living conditions .
as for children , fuel poverty can lead to educational under-achievement , social exclusion , physical and psychological ill health .
liberal markets unlike being ill , people who are fuel poor do not necessarily know that they are .
as such , they are not a group that is easily identifiable .
the government 's target of eradicating fuel poverty by 2016 will be in serious jeopardy if energy price rises go ahead how to change energy supplier yet it is clear that since 1996 , the liberalised energy markets has helped bring energy prices down and with it the number of fuel poor , and prices are still cheaper in real terms than before privatisation .
in 1991 there were 7.3 million households that were either fuel poor or were considered vulnerable to suffering fuel poverty .
by 2002 this figure had fallen to just over two million .
but double-digit hikes in energy prices in the past 18 months - 21 % in gas and 18 % in electricity - put this progress at risk .
the government 's target of eradicating fuel poverty by 2016 will be in serious jeopardy if energy price continue to rise .
back into poverty the government-sponsored fuel poverty advisory group has suggested that a 10 % price rise across the board will condemn as many as 400,000 consumers back to living in fuel poverty .
guide to uk poverty how is it that nearly one in five britons live in poverty ?
in detail for many of those already paying more than 10 % of their income on energy , the impact will be more than they can bear .
the situation can be most acute for those who pay for their energy through a pre-payment meter .
while having a pre-payment meter imposed by a supplier is preferable to being without heating or hot water , these consumers have to pay more for their energy , sometimes up to double , than those paying by direct debit .
pre-payment meters increase the chances of living in fuel poverty .
decrepit housing tackling fuel poverty is not just about reducing the price of energy , it is also about improving energy efficiency .
fighting fuel poverty now has to go hand in hand with being more energy efficient .
too much of britain 's housing stock is decrepit and close to being unfit to live in .
the government and the power firms have invested about £ 400m a year in insulating the homes of the fuel poor , and some suppliers have introduced special tariffs and trust funds for vulnerable groups , such as the elderly .
the energy smart campaign , which is sponsored by community groups , public bodies and energywatch , aims to encourage consumers to save on their bills by switching supplier , changing payment method and being energy efficient .

in 1991 there were 7.3 million households that were either fuel poor or were considered vulnerable to suffering fuel poverty .
by 2002 this figure had fallen to just over two million .
but double-digit hikes in energy prices in the past 18 months - 21 % in gas and 18 % in electricity - put this progress at risk .
the government 's target of eradicating fuel poverty by 2016 will be in serious jeopardy if energy price continue to rise .
back into poverty the government-sponsored fuel poverty advisory group has suggested that a 10 % price rise across the board will condemn as many as 400,000 consumers back to living in fuel poverty .
for many of those already paying more than 10 % of their income on energy , the impact will be more than they can bear .
the situation can be most acute for those who pay for their energy through a pre-payment meter .
while having a pre-payment meter imposed by a supplier is preferable to being without heating or hot water , these consumers have to pay more for their energy , sometimes up to double , than those paying by direct debit .
pre-payment meters increase the chances of living in fuel poverty .
decrepit housing tackling fuel poverty is not just about reducing the price of energy , it is also about improving energy efficiency .
fighting fuel poverty now has to go hand in hand with being more energy efficient .
too much of britain 's housing stock is decrepit and close to being unfit to live in .
the government and the power firms have invested about £ 400m a year in insulating the homes of the fuel poor , and some suppliers have introduced special tariffs and trust funds for vulnerable groups , such as the elderly .
the energy smart campaign , which is sponsored by community groups , public bodies and energywatch , aims to encourage consumers to save on their bills by switching supplier , changing payment method and being energy efficient .
companies like british gas provide free energy-efficiency measures like the warm-a-life scheme which provides free insulation and energy saving measures for people on income-related benefits .
and other energy companies , like powergen , have a target of removing 250,000 households from fuel poverty by 2010 .
all in all , though , the welfare state 's universal approach to fighting social evils 60 years ago has levelled up society .
but universalism is no longer the weapon for fighting fuel poverty in the 21st century .
the challenge now is to dispense the tailor-made help to those who really need it - from benefit maximisation to energy efficiency grants and making bills more manageable .

there had been speculation the base could have been used for some other military purpose .
but defence minister don touhig told local mps norman lamb and keith simpson that raf coltishall was " surplus to defence requirements " .
other government departments now have 40 days to declare an interest in it .
keith simpson , mp for mid-norfolk , has been one of those campaigning for the government to make a speedy decision over the future of the base .
he thought it unlikely any other government department would show an interest in the airbase .
innovative plans " the good news is that they have actually told us now rather than faffing around and making a decision close to christmas , " he told the bbc .
" it 's going to put real pressure on all of us to look at what the alternatives are .
" the government wants us to be as innovative and flexible as possible in considering alternative uses for coltishall .
" we 're looking forward to getting in and developing the planning that has already been done . "
the 740-acre site has been home to jaguar jets since 1974 .
