whoever wants to keep new orleans as a city , must accept the fact that every meter a dam is raised , the city will be in greater danger .

humans may think they have the technology to conquer nature but that is a constitutive error of civilization , without which humans would not be what they are . "
" it is too much .
we are sick of catastrophes .
it is superfluous to argue what influence mankind has on natural catastrophes .
one thing is certain : there have always been extreme weather events , but now they happen in a more densely-populated world and the extent of the disaster is spread quickly through the mass media .
because of globalization , the catastrophe on the mississippi threatens the world 's economy .

there 's also hardly a hint of criticism towards president bush 's climate policies .

they see that nature is more powerful , so americans decide that there is nothing left to do but to take the licking , roll up their sleeves and start rebuilding .

" us president george w. bush again stands in the crossfire of criticism from environmentalists .
he stubbornly refuses to sign the kyoto climate protection treaty .
he prefers to listen to the business lobbies who preach ad infinitum that climate protection slows down economic growth .
nature , however , is more powerful than the economy .

spd presents election manifesto election 2005 -pipe- 01.09.2005 turkish-german vote anything but certain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social democrat müntefering gets chummy in kreuzberg german politicians are busy wooing turkish-germans .
but , disenchanted with both the conservatives ' anti-turkish rhetoric and the social democrats ' unpopular reforms , the group is proving politically unpredictable . in recent weeks , kreuzberg - berlin 's heavily turkish and alternative district , marked by a laid-back air , entrepreneurial spirit , and the smell of kebabs and lattes - has been witnessing a burst of activity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians in a turkish restaurant in kreuzberg as federal elections loom , politicians of all stripes have been dropping in on the colorful neighborhood 's numerous small shops and cafés , visiting kindergartens and schools where almost 90 percent of the children are of foreign origin . most kreuzbergers are unfazed by the spectacle . on a sunny morning this week , gülcan aydemir , a housewife and mother of three , who came to germany from turkey at the age of four , put her heavy shopping bags down in front of an election poster of ahmet iyidirli , the local social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- candidate . " never seen him before , " the 41-year-old said .
" it ’ s the same thing each time . the politicians only think of us turks when elections are around the corner . " turkish vote could prove decisive but politicians do have good reason to woo turkish-germans .
of the 2.6 million turks living in germany - the country 's biggest group of immigrants - an estimated 600,000 have been naturalized and are entitled to vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish grocers in cologne though that number may seem insignificant in a voting population of about 61.5 million , it is enough to tip the scales when the parties are neck-and-neck at the polls - as happened during the last elections in 2002 .

spd presents election manifesto election 2005 -pipe- 01.09.2005 turkish-german vote anything but certain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social democrat müntefering gets chummy in kreuzberg german politicians are busy wooing turkish-germans .
but , disenchanted with both the conservatives ' anti-turkish rhetoric and the social democrats ' unpopular reforms , the group is proving politically unpredictable . in recent weeks , kreuzberg - berlin 's heavily turkish and alternative district , marked by a laid-back air , entrepreneurial spirit , and the smell of kebabs and lattes - has been witnessing a burst of activity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians in a turkish restaurant in kreuzberg as federal elections loom , politicians of all stripes have been dropping in on the colorful neighborhood 's numerous small shops and cafés , visiting kindergartens and schools where almost 90 percent of the children are of foreign origin . most kreuzbergers are unfazed by the spectacle . on a sunny morning this week , gülcan aydemir , a housewife and mother of three , who came to germany from turkey at the age of four , put her heavy shopping bags down in front of an election poster of ahmet iyidirli , the local social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- candidate . " never seen him before , " the 41-year-old said .
" it ’ s the same thing each time . the politicians only think of us turks when elections are around the corner . " turkish vote could prove decisive but politicians do have good reason to woo turkish-germans .
of the 2.6 million turks living in germany - the country 's biggest group of immigrants - an estimated 600,000 have been naturalized and are entitled to vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish grocers in cologne though that number may seem insignificant in a voting population of about 61.5 million , it is enough to tip the scales when the parties are neck-and-neck at the polls - as happened during the last elections in 2002 . " we had a really slim majority at the time and the few thousand turkish-german votes proved very valuable and helped us to win , " said ozan ceyhun , in charge of organizing a campaign to get the " foreign vote " for chancellor schröder 's spd . spd traditionally popular political preferences among germany 's turks have been clear-cut so far .
the large majority has traditionally voted for the spd .
according to one study , upwards of 65 percent now back the spd ; the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- enjoy support of around 9 percent . those political leanings are reflected in the german parliament , which currently has one turkish-german member each for the spd and the green party , but none from the cdu or the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor schröder , right with turkish prime minister erdogan dirk halm of the essen-based center for turkish studies traces the spd 's popularity among germany 's turks to the party 's working-class origins . " the first contact between the spd and many turks who came as guest workers to germany in the 1950s and 60s was through trade unions , and it was a strong political and cultural connection that lasted generations , " halm said . cdu 's turkey policy not popular however , the cdu does attract some turkish-germans , especially members of the business community , to its ranks .
according to some , the party 's traditional support of family values and business-friendly policies do have the potential to resonate with the turkish-german community . " most turks in germany are very conservative and the cdu would seem to be their natural choice .
but the cdu continues to turn them off with its anti-turkish politics and rhetoric , " özcan mutlu , a green party candidate from kreuzberg and a member of the berlin state parliament told spiegel online . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is strongly opposed to turkey 's eu bid this time seems to be no different .
the conservatives under the leadership of angela merkel have taken a vehement stance against turkey joining the european union , offering it a so-called " privileged partnership " instead . the position has predictably irked and further alienated many turks in germany , according to ozan ceyhun of the spd . " the thinking among turks is that ' if they -lrb- the cdu -rrb- do n't want my country of origin in the eu , then they do n't want me here in germany either . '
it 's definitely perceived as discriminatory , " ceyhun said . disillusioned by the spd too despite the obvious political preferences , experts warn that turkish-germans are far from having made up their minds about which box to check on the ballot on sept .
18 . many are said to be disillusioned with the spd on account of a new regulation in the naturalization law which has led to some 50,000 turkish-germans losing their german citizenship . hakki keskin , the first turkish-born german to be elected to the german parliament and who left the spd after 30 years and is now campaigning for the fledgling left party , said many were also " bitterly disappointed " by the spd 's " neo-liberal " social and economic reforms which have hit poorer turks . " the reforms are far removed from the social justice that the spd is supposed to stand for .
i 'm not the only one turning away from the party , " keskin said . jobs the crunch factor disenchantment with both the big mainstream political parties in germany may have made the turkish-germans politically unpredictable this election .
but in the end the crunch issues of jobs and economy will decide the vote , according to some . " so much has changed since the last general election .
work is the key concern now and the turkish community is particularly affected by unemployment , " said dirk halm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in kreuzberg , where the jobless rate is more than 20 percent and every third teenager drops out of school , that theory seems to hold especially true . mesut yatci , 22 , who works in a travel agency , said he could n't care less about politics . " whether turkey makes it into the eu or not isn ’ t important to me , " said yatci , who is of turkish origin and born in germany .
" i 'll vote for the party that really does something to fight unemployment and create more jobs , " he said . sonia phalnikar , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : merkel 's turkish delight chancellor candidate angela merkel has renewed her efforts to kibosh turkey 's bid to join the eu .

" turkey is a key political issue , " said one british official ahead of the eu talks .
" we know that there are concerns , but that does n't change the fact the talks are going to start in october .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.09.2005 germany prepared to help the us großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has shown sympathy for the regions affected by katrina while us emergency teams are working around the clock in the mostly submerged city of new orleans , the german government , although highly critical of us environmental policies , is offering its help . the german government is " ready to offer its help and support toward controlling this appalling natural catastrophe and remedying its consequences , " said fischer . " we must show solidarity for those affected , " he added the german foreign ministry has set up a 24-hour hotline in an attempt to coordinate aid efforts -lrb- + 49-30-5000-2000 -rrb- .
the german embassy in washington , d.c. is also constantly updating the information on its web site . germany 's foreign minister joschka fischer said thursday there were no german casualties in the areas affected by hurricane katrina .
the german embassy in washington and german consulates in houston and atlanta are closely cooperating with us authorities on helping german citizens and looking for the missing persons . lengthy recovery us president george w. bush said wednesday it would take years to recover from the deadly ravages of hurricane katrina , which he branded one of the worst national disasters in us history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush looking out the window of air force one bush made the comments after cutting short his vacation in texas and flying over the stricken area in air force one before returning to washington to oversee the massive rescue and relief effort . " we 're dealing with one of the worst natural disasters in our nation 's history , " he told reporters in the white house rose garden . " this recovery will take years , " he said , pledging the full support of the us government in rescuing and giving assistance to the tens of thousands people made homeless by the storm . the president laid down three priorities : saving lives and evacuating endangered survivors , providing adequate food , water and shelter for dislocated people and launching a comprehensive recovery effort . bush 's environmental policy under attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin , germany 's minister of the environment , is not known for his diplomatic skills german enviroment minister jürgen trittin , in an editorial published in the daily frankfurter rundschau on tuesday , sharply criticizing president bush for " closing his eyes " to environmental problems and the dangers of global warming .
american readers responded in anger to the chastising editorial , which offered no words of sympathy for the united states , but the minister has remained unapologetic . trittin 's spokesman , michael schrören , said on wednesday that " trittin 's comments were true and he wrote what he meant . " trittin , however , is not the only critic of the us environmental policy in germany .
reinhard bütikofer , who heads the german green party , of which foreign minister is also a member , called bush an " eco-reactionary . " " bush conducts his environmental policy from the perspective of oil and nuclear lobby , " said bütikofer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karsten voigt of the german foreign ministry karsten voigt , foreign ministry coordinator for german-us cooperation , tried to strike a balance between being critical of us policies and showing sympathy for the united states by saying that tritten 's comments were accurate but badly timed . " one should be more diplomatic than mr. trittin was , but there is general consensus in germany that climate change is a major issue , " voigt said . too rich to ask for help ? germans donated in record numbers in the aftermath of the asian tsunami eight months ago .
but the situation is different today : the us government has made no call for international aid , and german charity organizations have so far not pledged financial aid for the hurricane-affected regions . " we are at the moment planning no call for help , " said fredrik barkenhammar of the german red cross . according to barkenhammar , the american red cross is financially very well positioned and has , therefore , not asked for outside help .
should the german red cross receive any public or private donations for the american disaster relief , the money will be transferred to the us red cross , he said . bildunterschrift : freies bildformat not exactly a catastrophe ? damage caused by hurricane katrina will certainly have international consequences , according to swiss re , the world 's second largest insurance company .
the firm said wednesday that katrina would cost the insurance industry alone about $ 20 billion -lrb- 16.2 billion euros -rrb- . many believe , however , that the scope of the disaster is such that the us government , which has one of the most sophisticated crisis management systems in the world at its disposal , should be able to respond to it adequately . " catastrophe means that a society can not cope with a situation , " said achim reinke , spokesperson for the catholic aid organization caritas . " we need to stay balanced , " reinke said , pointing out that there are other crisis regions in the world , like sudan 's war-torn darfur region , that should n't be forgotten . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de katrina could swamp german economy germany 's economy minister has said he fears hurricane katrina , which has devastated the southern us coast , could lead to a further rise in oil prices and dampen already weak domestic spending in germany .

but though the high-tech television is exciting some companies , german broadcasters remain hesitant . it 's being called a " quantum leap " and the next big development in television since the move from the black and white box .
the euphoria surrounding high-definition television can hardly be contained at this weekend 's consumer electronics fair ifa in berlin . " hdtv is the most important development in the world-wide television industry in the coming years , " said georg kofler , head of the resurgent digital pay-tv broadcaster premiere . the technology uses a 16:9 aspect ration which basically means that television images are shown in a far higher resolution than normal analog television , or dvds .
a host of major companies , like korea 's samsung and holland 's philips , have already brought several different hdtv models on the market .
major consumer electronics markets like the us and japan are already far ahead of germany and the rest of europe in adapting the new technology . cooperation to increase visibility ahead of the start of ifa , premiere announced a cooperative effort with philips and samsung and a long-term link-up with the discovery channel aimed at bringing the quality of hdtv programming to a wider audience . all 64 world cup games in germany this year will be shown on premiere in hdtv format .

the two major public stations , ard and zdf , said they plan on waiting longer with hdtv format , citing high costs and insufficient users . zdf said high-definition television will have to wait until germany 's homes make the switch from analog to digital , something they predict wo n't happen before 2010 .
rtl , europe 's largest broadcaster , said it will wait as well . " hdtv brings with it much higher costs , " said an rtl spokesman .
one television ceo estimated the broadcast cost 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 12,456 -rrb- an hour , according to the german daily handelsblatt . there is also the cost of the televisions themselves , which start at around 1,000 euros and can go as high as 5,000 euros .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.09.2005 merkel and the female question großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is not exactly a feminist dream come true with less than three weeks to go to the elections , germany is wondering what it will mean to have its first woman chancellor .
angela merkel , however , is not promising a feminist or even a particularly feminine future . angela merkel has come a long way from her early days in politics when former chancellor helmut kohl referred to her as his " girl . "
and although the plainly dressed 51-year-old , now a chancellor candidate for the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is unlikely to bring gender into politics , her party is trying to capitalize on the fact that merkel is a woman . " we support her because she is a woman and as chancellor she will bring new perspectives and emotional intelligence to politics , " said emilia müller of the cdu women 's league at a meeting in berlin this week . " merkel has made it clear , women are no longer standing on the sidelines ; they have seized power .
we want the future to be female , and in many ways , " said another league official . feminists remain unconvinced the political left is distinctly skeptical that merkel will put women 's issues at the forefront of her reform plans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alice schwarzer does not believe that merkel will do much for women 's issues " she has not shown any enthusiasm for so-called woman 's politics , " germany 's best-known feminist , alice schwarzer , remarked recently . although merkel holds a commanding lead in the polls , they also show that the large percentage of voters who are still undecided ahead of the september 18 election are unlikely to be swayed for merkel simply because she is a woman . in interviews and speeches , merkel rarely misses an opportunity to mention the importance of the family and has promised to improve the plight of working mothers in a bid to raise germany 's low birth rate . but beyond that she has not courted the female vote , just as she has refused to play on her roots in former communist eastern germany . german iron lady ? merkel bristles at the inevitable comparisons with britain 's iron lady margaret thatcher , saying there are " limited " similarities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : limited similarity : margaret thatcher but like thatcher , merkel is a woman leading a conservative party and faces perhaps the added constraint of looking to govern a country that has only gradually shed the notion of women 's traditional role involving the so-called three k 's - kinder , küche and kirche -lrb- children , kitchen , church -rrb- . figures published by the electoral commission on wednesday showed that one third of candidates put up by all parties are women , but the greens and chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats are miles ahead of the christian union in terms of gender representation . schröder on wednesday at his party 's congress reached for the gender card , telling supporters that the policies of many of merkel 's closest aides on women 's issues " date from the 19th century . " criticism , woman to woman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doris schröder-köpf , the wife of the german chancellor , is highly critical of merkel schröder 's wife , on the other hand , dared what nobody else has so far and pointed out that , being childless , merkel did not know what she was talking about when she championed the plight of women . " ms. merkel 's life is not such that she can represent the experiences of the majority of women , " doris schröder-köpf , who has one biological and one adopted daughter , told the weekly newspaper die zeit . " they are busy trying to juggle a family and a career , or deciding whether to spend a few years at home after having a baby or wondering how best to bring up their children .
this is not angela merkel 's world , " she said . mrs. schröder-köpf said that merkel 's policies while she was family minister in kohl 's cabinet in the early 1990s " are to blame for the low birth rates we have today . " merkel recently conceded that she would not have achieved what she did in politics if she had had children , but sought to use that as an argument for her new policies . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election 2005 click here for dw-world 's 2005 election dossier .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 01.09.2005 new wto chief faces daunting task großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lamy does n't want to come away from talks empty-handed the task facing pascal lamy as head of the world trade organization is indeed daunting .
the doha round of talks has stalled and officials are doubtful it can be revived . the task placed on lamy 's lap is so overwhelming that , according to one official , the frenchman would have to be " pascal zorro " to succeed .
in only three months a global trade summit in hong kong begins and the word amongst some close to the talks is , to put it gently , one of cautious criticism .
" i think we have to lower expectations because the talks have lagged , " us trade representative rob portman said .
summit about subsidies and tariffs when wto trade representatives meet in hong kong in december , lamy will assume a difficult legacy from his predecessor , thailand 's supachai panitchpakdi .
before taking office , lamy recently stated that he wanted an agreement to be reached at the end of the year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farm subsidies , particularly for the eu and the us , are one sticking point in the doha round " we all know the destination , it is the conclusion of the round with a crucially important stop at the end of the year in hong kong .
i will be 100 percent invested in this .
i will be , as soon as possible , meeting with the chairs of the different negotiating groups , " he said .
the passionate jogger will need endurance for the difficult agenda he faces , which includes slashing farm subsidies and liberalizing world trade markets .
in 2003 at cancun , mexico , the continuation of the doha round from 2001 ended in failure after the eu , the us , canada and japan faced intense opposition from the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- headed by then new member china together with brazil , india , south africa and 16 other countries .
lamy was the eu 's chief negotiator at cancun .
now , he must bring all the sides together and hammer out an agreement .
" pascal lamy will bring a new aggressiveness to the job , " portman said recently .
yet , no matter how skillfully the 58-year-old frenchman may negotiate , the will must be there on the part of wto members .
" he has no magic wand .
the bottom line is that there will only be progress if countries want there to be .
and it is not clear they do , " india 's trade ambassador , ujal singh bhatia , told reuters .
little power at his disposal the wto director-general has little executive power so diplomats are placing their hopes on his experience as the eu 's trade boss .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lower trade tariffs are another goal of the wto negotiations in hong kong exactly these close ties to europe lead groups critical of gloabalization , like attac , to believe that despite the lack of real authority , lamy will not work in the interests of developing countries .
whatever happens , all agree that an agreement , whether weak or strong , must be signed in december so that an end of 2006 deadline can be reached and doha can finally be put into force . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's lamy named new wto leader after a process lasting several months , pascal lamy has been appointed director-general of the world trade organization .
the 58-year-old frenchman has some tough challenges ahead of him .
-lrb- may 26 , 2005 -rrb- wto talks collapse in cancun disappointment reigned among the world 's richer countries after world trade organization talks in cancun collapsed .
but delegates from poorer countries celebrated their ability to block proposals from the eu and others .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 01.09.2005 television 's new buzz word großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : full speed ahead for technology , but not for most broadcasters the buzz word coursing through the international electronics fair ifa in berlin this weekend is hdtv .
but though the high-tech television is exciting some companies , german broadcasters remain hesitant . it 's being called a " quantum leap " and the next big development in television since the move from the black and white box .
the euphoria surrounding high-definition television can hardly be contained at this weekend 's consumer electronics fair ifa in berlin . " hdtv is the most important development in the world-wide television industry in the coming years , " said georg kofler , head of the resurgent digital pay-tv broadcaster premiere . the technology uses a 16:9 aspect ration which basically means that television images are shown in a far higher resolution than normal analog television , or dvds .
a host of major companies , like korea 's samsung and holland 's philips , have already brought several different hdtv models on the market .
major consumer electronics markets like the us and japan are already far ahead of germany and the rest of europe in adapting the new technology . cooperation to increase visibility ahead of the start of ifa , premiere announced a cooperative effort with philips and samsung and a long-term link-up with the discovery channel aimed at bringing the quality of hdtv programming to a wider audience . all 64 world cup games in germany this year will be shown on premiere in hdtv format .
beginning in november , germany 's only pay-tv broadcaster will introduce three different 24-hour hdtv channels into their channel list . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premiere viewers with hdtv televisions will get all the world cup action delivered to them in the high-definition format . prosiebensat.1 , recently bought up by the axel springer publishing house , plans to be on air with hdtv content even earlier .
they plan on broadcasting their prosieben and sat.1 channels in hdtv format beginning at the end of october . " hdtv is a quantum leap , " said ceo guillaume de posch . still too expensive but the rest of the german broadcasting landscape is not as excited .
the two major public stations , ard and zdf , said they plan on waiting longer with hdtv format , citing high costs and insufficient users . zdf said high-definition television will have to wait until germany 's homes make the switch from analog to digital , something they predict wo n't happen before 2010 .
rtl , europe 's largest broadcaster , said it will wait as well . " hdtv brings with it much higher costs , " said an rtl spokesman .
one television ceo estimated the broadcast cost 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 12,456 -rrb- an hour , according to the german daily handelsblatt . there is also the cost of the televisions themselves , which start at around 1,000 euros and can go as high as 5,000 euros .
in 2005 , fewer than 1 million sold and analysts do not expect to reach the one million mark before the end of 2006 . bildunterschrift : hdtv sets can cost upwards of 5,000 euros or more branch analysts expect hdtv sales to make up more than 10 percent of total sets sold only in 2008 .
" we 'll start planning when 10 to 15 percent of the viewers own hdtv , " said an rtl spokesperson . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german tv looks to us for salvation on tuesday , the us hit tv series “ desperate housewives ” hits the airwaves in germany .

spd presents election manifesto election 2005 -pipe- 01.09.2005 turkish-german vote anything but certain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social democrat müntefering gets chummy in kreuzberg german politicians are busy wooing turkish-germans .
but , disenchanted with both the conservatives ' anti-turkish rhetoric and the social democrats ' unpopular reforms , the group is proving politically unpredictable . in recent weeks , kreuzberg - berlin 's heavily turkish and alternative district , marked by a laid-back air , entrepreneurial spirit , and the smell of kebabs and lattes - has been witnessing a burst of activity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians in a turkish restaurant in kreuzberg as federal elections loom , politicians of all stripes have been dropping in on the colorful neighborhood 's numerous small shops and cafés , visiting kindergartens and schools where almost 90 percent of the children are of foreign origin . most kreuzbergers are unfazed by the spectacle . on a sunny morning this week , gülcan aydemir , a housewife and mother of three , who came to germany from turkey at the age of four , put her heavy shopping bags down in front of an election poster of ahmet iyidirli , the local social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- candidate . " never seen him before , " the 41-year-old said .
" it ’ s the same thing each time . the politicians only think of us turks when elections are around the corner . " turkish vote could prove decisive but politicians do have good reason to woo turkish-germans .
of the 2.6 million turks living in germany - the country 's biggest group of immigrants - an estimated 600,000 have been naturalized and are entitled to vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish grocers in cologne though that number may seem insignificant in a voting population of about 61.5 million , it is enough to tip the scales when the parties are neck-and-neck at the polls - as happened during the last elections in 2002 . " we had a really slim majority at the time and the few thousand turkish-german votes proved very valuable and helped us to win , " said ozan ceyhun , in charge of organizing a campaign to get the " foreign vote " for chancellor schröder 's spd . spd traditionally popular political preferences among germany 's turks have been clear-cut so far .
the large majority has traditionally voted for the spd .
according to one study , upwards of 65 percent now back the spd ; the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- enjoy support of around 9 percent . those political leanings are reflected in the german parliament , which currently has one turkish-german member each for the spd and the green party , but none from the cdu or the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor schröder , right with turkish prime minister erdogan dirk halm of the essen-based center for turkish studies traces the spd 's popularity among germany 's turks to the party 's working-class origins . " the first contact between the spd and many turks who came as guest workers to germany in the 1950s and 60s was through trade unions , and it was a strong political and cultural connection that lasted generations , " halm said . cdu 's turkey policy not popular however , the cdu does attract some turkish-germans , especially members of the business community , to its ranks .
according to some , the party 's traditional support of family values and business-friendly policies do have the potential to resonate with the turkish-german community . " most turks in germany are very conservative and the cdu would seem to be their natural choice .
but the cdu continues to turn them off with its anti-turkish politics and rhetoric , " özcan mutlu , a green party candidate from kreuzberg and a member of the berlin state parliament told spiegel online . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is strongly opposed to turkey 's eu bid this time seems to be no different .
the conservatives under the leadership of angela merkel have taken a vehement stance against turkey joining the european union , offering it a so-called " privileged partnership " instead . the position has predictably irked and further alienated many turks in germany , according to ozan ceyhun of the spd . " the thinking among turks is that ' if they -lrb- the cdu -rrb- do n't want my country of origin in the eu , then they do n't want me here in germany either . '
it 's definitely perceived as discriminatory , " ceyhun said . disillusioned by the spd too despite the obvious political preferences , experts warn that turkish-germans are far from having made up their minds about which box to check on the ballot on sept .
18 . many are said to be disillusioned with the spd on account of a new regulation in the naturalization law which has led to some 50,000 turkish-germans losing their german citizenship . hakki keskin , the first turkish-born german to be elected to the german parliament and who left the spd after 30 years and is now campaigning for the fledgling left party , said many were also " bitterly disappointed " by the spd 's " neo-liberal " social and economic reforms which have hit poorer turks . " the reforms are far removed from the social justice that the spd is supposed to stand for .
i 'm not the only one turning away from the party , " keskin said . jobs the crunch factor disenchantment with both the big mainstream political parties in germany may have made the turkish-germans politically unpredictable this election .
but in the end the crunch issues of jobs and economy will decide the vote , according to some . " so much has changed since the last general election .
work is the key concern now and the turkish community is particularly affected by unemployment , " said dirk halm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in kreuzberg , where the jobless rate is more than 20 percent and every third teenager drops out of school , that theory seems to hold especially true . mesut yatci , 22 , who works in a travel agency , said he could n't care less about politics . " whether turkey makes it into the eu or not isn ’ t important to me , " said yatci , who is of turkish origin and born in germany .

of the 2.6 million turks living in germany - the country 's biggest group of immigrants - an estimated 600,000 have been naturalized and are entitled to vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish grocers in cologne though that number may seem insignificant in a voting population of about 61.5 million , it is enough to tip the scales when the parties are neck-and-neck at the polls - as happened during the last elections in 2002 . " we had a really slim majority at the time and the few thousand turkish-german votes proved very valuable and helped us to win , " said ozan ceyhun , in charge of organizing a campaign to get the " foreign vote " for chancellor schröder 's spd . spd traditionally popular political preferences among germany 's turks have been clear-cut so far .
the large majority has traditionally voted for the spd .
according to one study , upwards of 65 percent now back the spd ; the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- enjoy support of around 9 percent . those political leanings are reflected in the german parliament , which currently has one turkish-german member each for the spd and the green party , but none from the cdu or the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor schröder , right with turkish prime minister erdogan dirk halm of the essen-based center for turkish studies traces the spd 's popularity among germany 's turks to the party 's working-class origins . " the first contact between the spd and many turks who came as guest workers to germany in the 1950s and 60s was through trade unions , and it was a strong political and cultural connection that lasted generations , " halm said . cdu 's turkey policy not popular however , the cdu does attract some turkish-germans , especially members of the business community , to its ranks .
according to some , the party 's traditional support of family values and business-friendly policies do have the potential to resonate with the turkish-german community . " most turks in germany are very conservative and the cdu would seem to be their natural choice .
but the cdu continues to turn them off with its anti-turkish politics and rhetoric , " özcan mutlu , a green party candidate from kreuzberg and a member of the berlin state parliament told spiegel online . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is strongly opposed to turkey 's eu bid this time seems to be no different .
the conservatives under the leadership of angela merkel have taken a vehement stance against turkey joining the european union , offering it a so-called " privileged partnership " instead . the position has predictably irked and further alienated many turks in germany , according to ozan ceyhun of the spd . " the thinking among turks is that ' if they -lrb- the cdu -rrb- do n't want my country of origin in the eu , then they do n't want me here in germany either . '
it 's definitely perceived as discriminatory , " ceyhun said . disillusioned by the spd too despite the obvious political preferences , experts warn that turkish-germans are far from having made up their minds about which box to check on the ballot on sept .
18 . many are said to be disillusioned with the spd on account of a new regulation in the naturalization law which has led to some 50,000 turkish-germans losing their german citizenship . hakki keskin , the first turkish-born german to be elected to the german parliament and who left the spd after 30 years and is now campaigning for the fledgling left party , said many were also " bitterly disappointed " by the spd 's " neo-liberal " social and economic reforms which have hit poorer turks . " the reforms are far removed from the social justice that the spd is supposed to stand for .
i 'm not the only one turning away from the party , " keskin said . jobs the crunch factor disenchantment with both the big mainstream political parties in germany may have made the turkish-germans politically unpredictable this election .
but in the end the crunch issues of jobs and economy will decide the vote , according to some . " so much has changed since the last general election .
work is the key concern now and the turkish community is particularly affected by unemployment , " said dirk halm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in kreuzberg , where the jobless rate is more than 20 percent and every third teenager drops out of school , that theory seems to hold especially true . mesut yatci , 22 , who works in a travel agency , said he could n't care less about politics . " whether turkey makes it into the eu or not isn ’ t important to me , " said yatci , who is of turkish origin and born in germany .

but though the high-tech television is exciting some companies , german broadcasters remain hesitant . it 's being called a " quantum leap " and the next big development in television since the move from the black and white box .
the euphoria surrounding high-definition television can hardly be contained at this weekend 's consumer electronics fair ifa in berlin . " hdtv is the most important development in the world-wide television industry in the coming years , " said georg kofler , head of the resurgent digital pay-tv broadcaster premiere . the technology uses a 16:9 aspect ration which basically means that television images are shown in a far higher resolution than normal analog television , or dvds .
a host of major companies , like korea 's samsung and holland 's philips , have already brought several different hdtv models on the market .
major consumer electronics markets like the us and japan are already far ahead of germany and the rest of europe in adapting the new technology . cooperation to increase visibility ahead of the start of ifa , premiere announced a cooperative effort with philips and samsung and a long-term link-up with the discovery channel aimed at bringing the quality of hdtv programming to a wider audience . all 64 world cup games in germany this year will be shown on premiere in hdtv format .

the two major public stations , ard and zdf , said they plan on waiting longer with hdtv format , citing high costs and insufficient users . zdf said high-definition television will have to wait until germany 's homes make the switch from analog to digital , something they predict wo n't happen before 2010 .
rtl , europe 's largest broadcaster , said it will wait as well . " hdtv brings with it much higher costs , " said an rtl spokesman .
one television ceo estimated the broadcast cost 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 12,456 -rrb- an hour , according to the german daily handelsblatt . there is also the cost of the televisions themselves , which start at around 1,000 euros and can go as high as 5,000 euros .

but though the high-tech television is exciting some companies , german broadcasters remain hesitant . it 's being called a " quantum leap " and the next big development in television since the move from the black and white box .
the euphoria surrounding high-definition television can hardly be contained at this weekend 's consumer electronics fair ifa in berlin . " hdtv is the most important development in the world-wide television industry in the coming years , " said georg kofler , head of the resurgent digital pay-tv broadcaster premiere . the technology uses a 16:9 aspect ration which basically means that television images are shown in a far higher resolution than normal analog television , or dvds .
a host of major companies , like korea 's samsung and holland 's philips , have already brought several different hdtv models on the market .
major consumer electronics markets like the us and japan are already far ahead of germany and the rest of europe in adapting the new technology . cooperation to increase visibility ahead of the start of ifa , premiere announced a cooperative effort with philips and samsung and a long-term link-up with the discovery channel aimed at bringing the quality of hdtv programming to a wider audience . all 64 world cup games in germany this year will be shown on premiere in hdtv format .
beginning in november , germany 's only pay-tv broadcaster will introduce three different 24-hour hdtv channels into their channel list . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premiere viewers with hdtv televisions will get all the world cup action delivered to them in the high-definition format . prosiebensat.1 , recently bought up by the axel springer publishing house , plans to be on air with hdtv content even earlier .
they plan on broadcasting their prosieben and sat.1 channels in hdtv format beginning at the end of october . " hdtv is a quantum leap , " said ceo guillaume de posch . still too expensive but the rest of the german broadcasting landscape is not as excited .
the two major public stations , ard and zdf , said they plan on waiting longer with hdtv format , citing high costs and insufficient users . zdf said high-definition television will have to wait until germany 's homes make the switch from analog to digital , something they predict wo n't happen before 2010 .
rtl , europe 's largest broadcaster , said it will wait as well . " hdtv brings with it much higher costs , " said an rtl spokesman .
one television ceo estimated the broadcast cost 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 12,456 -rrb- an hour , according to the german daily handelsblatt . there is also the cost of the televisions themselves , which start at around 1,000 euros and can go as high as 5,000 euros .
in 2005 , fewer than 1 million sold and analysts do not expect to reach the one million mark before the end of 2006 . bildunterschrift : hdtv sets can cost upwards of 5,000 euros or more branch analysts expect hdtv sales to make up more than 10 percent of total sets sold only in 2008 .
" we 'll start planning when 10 to 15 percent of the viewers own hdtv , " said an rtl spokesperson . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german tv looks to us for salvation on tuesday , the us hit tv series “ desperate housewives ” hits the airwaves in germany .

today , premiere is readying itself for the stock exchange , having completed one of the most impressive turnarounds in european media .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.09.2005 germany prepared to help the us großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has shown sympathy for the regions affected by katrina while us emergency teams are working around the clock in the mostly submerged city of new orleans , the german government , although highly critical of us environmental policies , is offering its help . the german government is " ready to offer its help and support toward controlling this appalling natural catastrophe and remedying its consequences , " said fischer . " we must show solidarity for those affected , " he added the german foreign ministry has set up a 24-hour hotline in an attempt to coordinate aid efforts -lrb- + 49-30-5000-2000 -rrb- .
the german embassy in washington , d.c. is also constantly updating the information on its web site . germany 's foreign minister joschka fischer said thursday there were no german casualties in the areas affected by hurricane katrina .
the german embassy in washington and german consulates in houston and atlanta are closely cooperating with us authorities on helping german citizens and looking for the missing persons . lengthy recovery us president george w. bush said wednesday it would take years to recover from the deadly ravages of hurricane katrina , which he branded one of the worst national disasters in us history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush looking out the window of air force one bush made the comments after cutting short his vacation in texas and flying over the stricken area in air force one before returning to washington to oversee the massive rescue and relief effort . " we 're dealing with one of the worst natural disasters in our nation 's history , " he told reporters in the white house rose garden . " this recovery will take years , " he said , pledging the full support of the us government in rescuing and giving assistance to the tens of thousands people made homeless by the storm . the president laid down three priorities : saving lives and evacuating endangered survivors , providing adequate food , water and shelter for dislocated people and launching a comprehensive recovery effort . bush 's environmental policy under attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin , germany 's minister of the environment , is not known for his diplomatic skills german enviroment minister jürgen trittin , in an editorial published in the daily frankfurter rundschau on tuesday , sharply criticizing president bush for " closing his eyes " to environmental problems and the dangers of global warming .
american readers responded in anger to the chastising editorial , which offered no words of sympathy for the united states , but the minister has remained unapologetic . trittin 's spokesman , michael schrören , said on wednesday that " trittin 's comments were true and he wrote what he meant . " trittin , however , is not the only critic of the us environmental policy in germany .
reinhard bütikofer , who heads the german green party , of which foreign minister is also a member , called bush an " eco-reactionary . " " bush conducts his environmental policy from the perspective of oil and nuclear lobby , " said bütikofer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karsten voigt of the german foreign ministry karsten voigt , foreign ministry coordinator for german-us cooperation , tried to strike a balance between being critical of us policies and showing sympathy for the united states by saying that tritten 's comments were accurate but badly timed . " one should be more diplomatic than mr. trittin was , but there is general consensus in germany that climate change is a major issue , " voigt said . too rich to ask for help ? germans donated in record numbers in the aftermath of the asian tsunami eight months ago .
but the situation is different today : the us government has made no call for international aid , and german charity organizations have so far not pledged financial aid for the hurricane-affected regions . " we are at the moment planning no call for help , " said fredrik barkenhammar of the german red cross . according to barkenhammar , the american red cross is financially very well positioned and has , therefore , not asked for outside help .
should the german red cross receive any public or private donations for the american disaster relief , the money will be transferred to the us red cross , he said . bildunterschrift : freies bildformat not exactly a catastrophe ? damage caused by hurricane katrina will certainly have international consequences , according to swiss re , the world 's second largest insurance company .
the firm said wednesday that katrina would cost the insurance industry alone about $ 20 billion -lrb- 16.2 billion euros -rrb- . many believe , however , that the scope of the disaster is such that the us government , which has one of the most sophisticated crisis management systems in the world at its disposal , should be able to respond to it adequately . " catastrophe means that a society can not cope with a situation , " said achim reinke , spokesperson for the catholic aid organization caritas . " we need to stay balanced , " reinke said , pointing out that there are other crisis regions in the world , like sudan 's war-torn darfur region , that should n't be forgotten . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de katrina could swamp german economy germany 's economy minister has said he fears hurricane katrina , which has devastated the southern us coast , could lead to a further rise in oil prices and dampen already weak domestic spending in germany .

well , quite so , according to the majority of foreign correspondents dw-world interviewed ahead of the general election that 's just weeks away .
the country 's economy has seen better days and five million unemployed are not to be taken lightly , yet the mood appears gloomier than the situation warrants , they say .
germans are beset by " katastrophalismus " and seem to think " they live in bangladesh " the foreign observers said .
people in other countries endure unemployment several times higher yet " do n't let this get in the way of their ability to be happy . " nevertheless reform is needed to address the real problems .
the still large , yet somewhat diminished economic strength , the " tremendous infrastructure " and highly skilled and educated workforce are a basis on which to build recovery , they said .
but neither chancellor gerhard schröder of the ruling social democrats nor his challenger angela merkel from the christian democrats are seen as having the decidedly better program to move germany forward .
with german politics being " too consensual , " the contenders can not afford to put forward any daring new policy proposals . yet , a change of government in itself could signal change for the country .

" turkey is a key political issue , " said one british official ahead of the eu talks .
" we know that there are concerns , but that does n't change the fact the talks are going to start in october . " eu leaders gave the vast muslim state a green light last december to start entry talks despite its refusal to recognize the government of cyprus , which was among 10 countries that joined the eu last year . but its hopes of one day joining the bloc were dealt a severe blow in may when french and dutch voters - many citing opposition to turkish eu entry - sparked an unprecedented crisis by rejecting the eu constitution . cyprus tension surfaces again ankara fueled fresh concern after it appended a declaration to its signature of an amended customs accord with the enlarged eu in july , underlining that it still does not recognize cyprus .
the island has been divided since 1974 when the turkish military occupied the northern third of the island in reaction to a pro-greek coup in the south . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac has sought to soften the hardline position adopted by his prime minister leading the expressions of caution about turkey and the eu has been france , whose prime minister dominique de villepin said on august 2 that talks could not start with turkey until it recognizes cyprus . paris seems to have softened its position since then , with president jacques chirac saying he will stick by commitments .
but diplomats say france is still pushing for " more binding language " demanding that turkey recognize cyprus . eu diplomats said that the ministers were likely to issue a declaration making it clear that the customs union had to be implemented without discrimination by member states . " there will probably be a discussion tomorrow by ministers , probably on the basis of a text , " one said .
" we will see if -lrb- the declaration -rrb- is more precise , " said another , particularly on " access to ports " for cypriot ships . merkel 's " partnership " angers turks , allies the talks will no doubt be further complicated by fresh criticism from german chancellor candidate angela merkel , who favors a " privileged partnership " with turkey , but not full membership . turkish foreign minister abdullah gul wednesday dismissed the idea as " illegitimate and immoral " in a newspaper interview and said ankara would not accept anything less than full membership his country got full backing from britain , which has argued both on economic and geopolitical reasons for including turkey in the eu . " we will open accession negotiations with turkey " on oct .

foreign ministers will also be discussing iran , which this month resumed nuclear activities in defiance of an agreement with european negotiators , and immediate eu expansion talks for croatia . croatian foreign minister kolinda grabar-kitarovic , whose country 's hopes of starting eu entry talks in march were delayed due to lack of help in finding a key fugitive war crimes suspect . there has been some suggestion that the british eu presidency - which plans to hold a new " task force " meeting on croatia this month - might be willing to soften the stance on zagreb in exchange for less pressure over turkey . a spokesman denied any such linkage .

" turkey is a key political issue , " said one british official ahead of the eu talks .
" we know that there are concerns , but that does n't change the fact the talks are going to start in october . " eu leaders gave the vast muslim state a green light last december to start entry talks despite its refusal to recognize the government of cyprus , which was among 10 countries that joined the eu last year . but its hopes of one day joining the bloc were dealt a severe blow in may when french and dutch voters - many citing opposition to turkish eu entry - sparked an unprecedented crisis by rejecting the eu constitution . cyprus tension surfaces again ankara fueled fresh concern after it appended a declaration to its signature of an amended customs accord with the enlarged eu in july , underlining that it still does not recognize cyprus .
the island has been divided since 1974 when the turkish military occupied the northern third of the island in reaction to a pro-greek coup in the south . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac has sought to soften the hardline position adopted by his prime minister leading the expressions of caution about turkey and the eu has been france , whose prime minister dominique de villepin said on august 2 that talks could not start with turkey until it recognizes cyprus . paris seems to have softened its position since then , with president jacques chirac saying he will stick by commitments .
but diplomats say france is still pushing for " more binding language " demanding that turkey recognize cyprus . eu diplomats said that the ministers were likely to issue a declaration making it clear that the customs union had to be implemented without discrimination by member states . " there will probably be a discussion tomorrow by ministers , probably on the basis of a text , " one said .
" we will see if -lrb- the declaration -rrb- is more precise , " said another , particularly on " access to ports " for cypriot ships . merkel 's " partnership " angers turks , allies the talks will no doubt be further complicated by fresh criticism from german chancellor candidate angela merkel , who favors a " privileged partnership " with turkey , but not full membership . turkish foreign minister abdullah gul wednesday dismissed the idea as " illegitimate and immoral " in a newspaper interview and said ankara would not accept anything less than full membership his country got full backing from britain , which has argued both on economic and geopolitical reasons for including turkey in the eu . " we will open accession negotiations with turkey " on oct .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 01.09.2005 new wto chief faces daunting task großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lamy does n't want to come away from talks empty-handed the task facing pascal lamy as head of the world trade organization is indeed daunting .
the doha round of talks has stalled and officials are doubtful it can be revived . the task placed on lamy 's lap is so overwhelming that , according to one official , the frenchman would have to be " pascal zorro " to succeed .
in only three months a global trade summit in hong kong begins and the word amongst some close to the talks is , to put it gently , one of cautious criticism .
" i think we have to lower expectations because the talks have lagged , " us trade representative rob portman said .
summit about subsidies and tariffs when wto trade representatives meet in hong kong in december , lamy will assume a difficult legacy from his predecessor , thailand 's supachai panitchpakdi .
before taking office , lamy recently stated that he wanted an agreement to be reached at the end of the year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farm subsidies , particularly for the eu and the us , are one sticking point in the doha round " we all know the destination , it is the conclusion of the round with a crucially important stop at the end of the year in hong kong .
i will be 100 percent invested in this .
i will be , as soon as possible , meeting with the chairs of the different negotiating groups , " he said .
the passionate jogger will need endurance for the difficult agenda he faces , which includes slashing farm subsidies and liberalizing world trade markets .
in 2003 at cancun , mexico , the continuation of the doha round from 2001 ended in failure after the eu , the us , canada and japan faced intense opposition from the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- headed by then new member china together with brazil , india , south africa and 16 other countries .
lamy was the eu 's chief negotiator at cancun .
now , he must bring all the sides together and hammer out an agreement .
" pascal lamy will bring a new aggressiveness to the job , " portman said recently .
yet , no matter how skillfully the 58-year-old frenchman may negotiate , the will must be there on the part of wto members .
" he has no magic wand .
the bottom line is that there will only be progress if countries want there to be .
and it is not clear they do , " india 's trade ambassador , ujal singh bhatia , told reuters .
little power at his disposal the wto director-general has little executive power so diplomats are placing their hopes on his experience as the eu 's trade boss .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lower trade tariffs are another goal of the wto negotiations in hong kong exactly these close ties to europe lead groups critical of gloabalization , like attac , to believe that despite the lack of real authority , lamy will not work in the interests of developing countries .
whatever happens , all agree that an agreement , whether weak or strong , must be signed in december so that an end of 2006 deadline can be reached and doha can finally be put into force . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's lamy named new wto leader after a process lasting several months , pascal lamy has been appointed director-general of the world trade organization .
the 58-year-old frenchman has some tough challenges ahead of him .
-lrb- may 26 , 2005 -rrb- wto talks collapse in cancun disappointment reigned among the world 's richer countries after world trade organization talks in cancun collapsed .
but delegates from poorer countries celebrated their ability to block proposals from the eu and others .

spd presents election manifesto election 2005 -pipe- 01.09.2005 turkish-german vote anything but certain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social democrat müntefering gets chummy in kreuzberg german politicians are busy wooing turkish-germans .
but , disenchanted with both the conservatives ' anti-turkish rhetoric and the social democrats ' unpopular reforms , the group is proving politically unpredictable . in recent weeks , kreuzberg - berlin 's heavily turkish and alternative district , marked by a laid-back air , entrepreneurial spirit , and the smell of kebabs and lattes - has been witnessing a burst of activity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians in a turkish restaurant in kreuzberg as federal elections loom , politicians of all stripes have been dropping in on the colorful neighborhood 's numerous small shops and cafés , visiting kindergartens and schools where almost 90 percent of the children are of foreign origin . most kreuzbergers are unfazed by the spectacle . on a sunny morning this week , gülcan aydemir , a housewife and mother of three , who came to germany from turkey at the age of four , put her heavy shopping bags down in front of an election poster of ahmet iyidirli , the local social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- candidate . " never seen him before , " the 41-year-old said .
" it ’ s the same thing each time . the politicians only think of us turks when elections are around the corner . " turkish vote could prove decisive but politicians do have good reason to woo turkish-germans .
of the 2.6 million turks living in germany - the country 's biggest group of immigrants - an estimated 600,000 have been naturalized and are entitled to vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish grocers in cologne though that number may seem insignificant in a voting population of about 61.5 million , it is enough to tip the scales when the parties are neck-and-neck at the polls - as happened during the last elections in 2002 . " we had a really slim majority at the time and the few thousand turkish-german votes proved very valuable and helped us to win , " said ozan ceyhun , in charge of organizing a campaign to get the " foreign vote " for chancellor schröder 's spd . spd traditionally popular political preferences among germany 's turks have been clear-cut so far .
the large majority has traditionally voted for the spd .
according to one study , upwards of 65 percent now back the spd ; the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- enjoy support of around 9 percent . those political leanings are reflected in the german parliament , which currently has one turkish-german member each for the spd and the green party , but none from the cdu or the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor schröder , right with turkish prime minister erdogan dirk halm of the essen-based center for turkish studies traces the spd 's popularity among germany 's turks to the party 's working-class origins . " the first contact between the spd and many turks who came as guest workers to germany in the 1950s and 60s was through trade unions , and it was a strong political and cultural connection that lasted generations , " halm said . cdu 's turkey policy not popular however , the cdu does attract some turkish-germans , especially members of the business community , to its ranks .
according to some , the party 's traditional support of family values and business-friendly policies do have the potential to resonate with the turkish-german community . " most turks in germany are very conservative and the cdu would seem to be their natural choice .
but the cdu continues to turn them off with its anti-turkish politics and rhetoric , " özcan mutlu , a green party candidate from kreuzberg and a member of the berlin state parliament told spiegel online . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is strongly opposed to turkey 's eu bid this time seems to be no different .
the conservatives under the leadership of angela merkel have taken a vehement stance against turkey joining the european union , offering it a so-called " privileged partnership " instead . the position has predictably irked and further alienated many turks in germany , according to ozan ceyhun of the spd .

spd presents election manifesto election 2005 -pipe- 01.09.2005 turkish-german vote anything but certain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social democrat müntefering gets chummy in kreuzberg german politicians are busy wooing turkish-germans .
but , disenchanted with both the conservatives ' anti-turkish rhetoric and the social democrats ' unpopular reforms , the group is proving politically unpredictable . in recent weeks , kreuzberg - berlin 's heavily turkish and alternative district , marked by a laid-back air , entrepreneurial spirit , and the smell of kebabs and lattes - has been witnessing a burst of activity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians in a turkish restaurant in kreuzberg as federal elections loom , politicians of all stripes have been dropping in on the colorful neighborhood 's numerous small shops and cafés , visiting kindergartens and schools where almost 90 percent of the children are of foreign origin . most kreuzbergers are unfazed by the spectacle . on a sunny morning this week , gülcan aydemir , a housewife and mother of three , who came to germany from turkey at the age of four , put her heavy shopping bags down in front of an election poster of ahmet iyidirli , the local social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- candidate . " never seen him before , " the 41-year-old said .
" it ’ s the same thing each time . the politicians only think of us turks when elections are around the corner . " turkish vote could prove decisive but politicians do have good reason to woo turkish-germans .

the large majority has traditionally voted for the spd .
according to one study , upwards of 65 percent now back the spd ; the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- enjoy support of around 9 percent . those political leanings are reflected in the german parliament , which currently has one turkish-german member each for the spd and the green party , but none from the cdu or the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor schröder , right with turkish prime minister erdogan dirk halm of the essen-based center for turkish studies traces the spd 's popularity among germany 's turks to the party 's working-class origins .

" whoever wants to keep new orleans as a city has to build higher dams .
after the next hurricane or storm , even higher ones .
whoever wants to keep new orleans as a city , must accept the fact that every meter a dam is raised , the city will be in greater danger .
neither hurricanes nor a river like the mississippi can be controlled - particularly not in times of climate change .
humans may think they have the technology to conquer nature but that is a constitutive error of civilization , without which humans would not be what they are . "
" it is too much .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.09.2005 german papers criticize us over katrina großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consequences of lax environmental policies as the sheer extent of destruction of property and lives left behind by hurricane katrina becomes more apparent , german newspaper editors commented on thursday that global warming played a key role in the disaster . the berliner zeitung was of the opinion that human beings march ever-more forwards .
" whoever wants to keep new orleans as a city has to build higher dams .
after the next hurricane or storm , even higher ones .
whoever wants to keep new orleans as a city , must accept the fact that every meter a dam is raised , the city will be in greater danger .
neither hurricanes nor a river like the mississippi can be controlled - particularly not in times of climate change .
humans may think they have the technology to conquer nature but that is a constitutive error of civilization , without which humans would not be what they are . "
" it is too much .
we are sick of catastrophes .
it is superfluous to argue what influence mankind has on natural catastrophes .
one thing is certain : there have always been extreme weather events , but now they happen in a more densely-populated world and the extent of the disaster is spread quickly through the mass media .
because of globalization , the catastrophe on the mississippi threatens the world 's economy .
the hurricane and flood destroyed economic goods and growth not only in the usa .
we also feel that the events affect us also .
" the big easy " has disappeared , " commented the braunschweiger zeitung .
bildunterschrift : people walk along interstate 10 near the louisiana superdome as their future remains future " is this the key to the widespread religiosity in the usa that so many europeans think is exaggerated ? " asked the tagesspiegel in berlin .
" all across the country , americans have sympathized with those who have lost loved ones after having to let go of a husband 's , wife 's or child 's hand .
and they have celebrated the heroes who told incredible tales of survival .
yet nobody seems to believe that such catastrophes can be avoided if we work together properly with nature .
there 's also hardly a hint of criticism towards president bush 's climate policies .
yet without a blink the media compare the disaster to the tsunami , or hiroshima or nagasaki - leaving some europeans wondering .
they see that nature is more powerful , so americans decide that there is nothing left to do but to take the licking , roll up their sleeves and start rebuilding .
the country , as paradoxical as it may sound , gathers its belief in light of the humbling experience that it is a true world power . "
" us president george w. bush again stands in the crossfire of criticism from environmentalists .
he stubbornly refuses to sign the kyoto climate protection treaty .
he prefers to listen to the business lobbies who preach ad infinitum that climate protection slows down economic growth .
nature , however , is more powerful than the economy .
she has her own laws , " commented the hamburger morgenpost .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george w. bush looks out the window of air force one over new orleans " the dams have broken in new orleans - and not just literally .
the flood - a cultural symbol for chaos throughout the history of mankind - brought with it the anarchy of looters , " wrote the heilbronner stimme .
" those areas of society where the collective was already fragile to begin with were swept away along with public order by mother nature like a prefabricated house .
the us government then reacts with martial law in response .
oh , how eden-like it is here in germany , where soldiers can concentrate on carrying sandbags during a flood . "
" the environmental and climate policies in the usa have to be equated with energy policies , " wrote the süddeutsche zeitung in munich .
" the best regulatory means is , first of all , the price of gasoline .
next best is the global competition on the commodities market .
washington has taken notice of china 's attempts to access the american energy market with alarm .
the oil lobby has , however , satisfied the us congress again and avoided drastic cuts in the energy bill .
all of these are the twitches of an energy-based political dinosaur .

" whoever wants to keep new orleans as a city has to build higher dams .
after the next hurricane or storm , even higher ones .
whoever wants to keep new orleans as a city , must accept the fact that every meter a dam is raised , the city will be in greater danger .
neither hurricanes nor a river like the mississippi can be controlled - particularly not in times of climate change .
humans may think they have the technology to conquer nature but that is a constitutive error of civilization , without which humans would not be what they are . "
" it is too much .
we are sick of catastrophes .
it is superfluous to argue what influence mankind has on natural catastrophes .
one thing is certain : there have always been extreme weather events , but now they happen in a more densely-populated world and the extent of the disaster is spread quickly through the mass media .
because of globalization , the catastrophe on the mississippi threatens the world 's economy .
the hurricane and flood destroyed economic goods and growth not only in the usa .
we also feel that the events affect us also .
" the big easy " has disappeared , " commented the braunschweiger zeitung .
bildunterschrift : people walk along interstate 10 near the louisiana superdome as their future remains future " is this the key to the widespread religiosity in the usa that so many europeans think is exaggerated ? " asked the tagesspiegel in berlin .
" all across the country , americans have sympathized with those who have lost loved ones after having to let go of a husband 's , wife 's or child 's hand .
and they have celebrated the heroes who told incredible tales of survival .
yet nobody seems to believe that such catastrophes can be avoided if we work together properly with nature .
there 's also hardly a hint of criticism towards president bush 's climate policies .
yet without a blink the media compare the disaster to the tsunami , or hiroshima or nagasaki - leaving some europeans wondering .
they see that nature is more powerful , so americans decide that there is nothing left to do but to take the licking , roll up their sleeves and start rebuilding .
the country , as paradoxical as it may sound , gathers its belief in light of the humbling experience that it is a true world power . "
" us president george w. bush again stands in the crossfire of criticism from environmentalists .
he stubbornly refuses to sign the kyoto climate protection treaty .
he prefers to listen to the business lobbies who preach ad infinitum that climate protection slows down economic growth .
nature , however , is more powerful than the economy .
she has her own laws , " commented the hamburger morgenpost .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george w. bush looks out the window of air force one over new orleans " the dams have broken in new orleans - and not just literally .
the flood - a cultural symbol for chaos throughout the history of mankind - brought with it the anarchy of looters , " wrote the heilbronner stimme .
" those areas of society where the collective was already fragile to begin with were swept away along with public order by mother nature like a prefabricated house .

" the environmental and climate policies in the usa have to be equated with energy policies , " wrote the süddeutsche zeitung in munich .
" the best regulatory means is , first of all , the price of gasoline .
next best is the global competition on the commodities market .

" turkey is a key political issue , " said one british official ahead of the eu talks .
" we know that there are concerns , but that does n't change the fact the talks are going to start in october . " eu leaders gave the vast muslim state a green light last december to start entry talks despite its refusal to recognize the government of cyprus , which was among 10 countries that joined the eu last year . but its hopes of one day joining the bloc were dealt a severe blow in may when french and dutch voters - many citing opposition to turkish eu entry - sparked an unprecedented crisis by rejecting the eu constitution . cyprus tension surfaces again ankara fueled fresh concern after it appended a declaration to its signature of an amended customs accord with the enlarged eu in july , underlining that it still does not recognize cyprus .
the island has been divided since 1974 when the turkish military occupied the northern third of the island in reaction to a pro-greek coup in the south . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac has sought to soften the hardline position adopted by his prime minister leading the expressions of caution about turkey and the eu has been france , whose prime minister dominique de villepin said on august 2 that talks could not start with turkey until it recognizes cyprus . paris seems to have softened its position since then , with president jacques chirac saying he will stick by commitments .
but diplomats say france is still pushing for " more binding language " demanding that turkey recognize cyprus . eu diplomats said that the ministers were likely to issue a declaration making it clear that the customs union had to be implemented without discrimination by member states . " there will probably be a discussion tomorrow by ministers , probably on the basis of a text , " one said .
" we will see if -lrb- the declaration -rrb- is more precise , " said another , particularly on " access to ports " for cypriot ships . merkel 's " partnership " angers turks , allies the talks will no doubt be further complicated by fresh criticism from german chancellor candidate angela merkel , who favors a " privileged partnership " with turkey , but not full membership . turkish foreign minister abdullah gul wednesday dismissed the idea as " illegitimate and immoral " in a newspaper interview and said ankara would not accept anything less than full membership his country got full backing from britain , which has argued both on economic and geopolitical reasons for including turkey in the eu . " we will open accession negotiations with turkey " on oct .

well , quite so , according to the majority of foreign correspondents dw-world interviewed ahead of the general election that 's just weeks away .
the country 's economy has seen better days and five million unemployed are not to be taken lightly , yet the mood appears gloomier than the situation warrants , they say .
germans are beset by " katastrophalismus " and seem to think " they live in bangladesh " the foreign observers said .
people in other countries endure unemployment several times higher yet " do n't let this get in the way of their ability to be happy . " nevertheless reform is needed to address the real problems .
the still large , yet somewhat diminished economic strength , the " tremendous infrastructure " and highly skilled and educated workforce are a basis on which to build recovery , they said .
but neither chancellor gerhard schröder of the ruling social democrats nor his challenger angela merkel from the christian democrats are seen as having the decidedly better program to move germany forward .
with german politics being " too consensual , " the contenders can not afford to put forward any daring new policy proposals . yet , a change of government in itself could signal change for the country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 01.09.2005 television 's new buzz word großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : full speed ahead for technology , but not for most broadcasters the buzz word coursing through the international electronics fair ifa in berlin this weekend is hdtv .
but though the high-tech television is exciting some companies , german broadcasters remain hesitant . it 's being called a " quantum leap " and the next big development in television since the move from the black and white box .
the euphoria surrounding high-definition television can hardly be contained at this weekend 's consumer electronics fair ifa in berlin . " hdtv is the most important development in the world-wide television industry in the coming years , " said georg kofler , head of the resurgent digital pay-tv broadcaster premiere . the technology uses a 16:9 aspect ration which basically means that television images are shown in a far higher resolution than normal analog television , or dvds .
a host of major companies , like korea 's samsung and holland 's philips , have already brought several different hdtv models on the market .
major consumer electronics markets like the us and japan are already far ahead of germany and the rest of europe in adapting the new technology . cooperation to increase visibility ahead of the start of ifa , premiere announced a cooperative effort with philips and samsung and a long-term link-up with the discovery channel aimed at bringing the quality of hdtv programming to a wider audience . all 64 world cup games in germany this year will be shown on premiere in hdtv format .
beginning in november , germany 's only pay-tv broadcaster will introduce three different 24-hour hdtv channels into their channel list . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premiere viewers with hdtv televisions will get all the world cup action delivered to them in the high-definition format . prosiebensat.1 , recently bought up by the axel springer publishing house , plans to be on air with hdtv content even earlier .
they plan on broadcasting their prosieben and sat.1 channels in hdtv format beginning at the end of october . " hdtv is a quantum leap , " said ceo guillaume de posch . still too expensive but the rest of the german broadcasting landscape is not as excited .
the two major public stations , ard and zdf , said they plan on waiting longer with hdtv format , citing high costs and insufficient users . zdf said high-definition television will have to wait until germany 's homes make the switch from analog to digital , something they predict wo n't happen before 2010 .
rtl , europe 's largest broadcaster , said it will wait as well . " hdtv brings with it much higher costs , " said an rtl spokesman .
one television ceo estimated the broadcast cost 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 12,456 -rrb- an hour , according to the german daily handelsblatt . there is also the cost of the televisions themselves , which start at around 1,000 euros and can go as high as 5,000 euros .
in 2005 , fewer than 1 million sold and analysts do not expect to reach the one million mark before the end of 2006 . bildunterschrift : hdtv sets can cost upwards of 5,000 euros or more branch analysts expect hdtv sales to make up more than 10 percent of total sets sold only in 2008 .
" we 'll start planning when 10 to 15 percent of the viewers own hdtv , " said an rtl spokesperson . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german tv looks to us for salvation on tuesday , the us hit tv series “ desperate housewives ” hits the airwaves in germany .

angela merkel , however , is not promising a feminist or even a particularly feminine future . angela merkel has come a long way from her early days in politics when former chancellor helmut kohl referred to her as his " girl . "
and although the plainly dressed 51-year-old , now a chancellor candidate for the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is unlikely to bring gender into politics , her party is trying to capitalize on the fact that merkel is a woman . " we support her because she is a woman and as chancellor she will bring new perspectives and emotional intelligence to politics , " said emilia müller of the cdu women 's league at a meeting in berlin this week . " merkel has made it clear , women are no longer standing on the sidelines ; they have seized power .
we want the future to be female , and in many ways , " said another league official . feminists remain unconvinced the political left is distinctly skeptical that merkel will put women 's issues at the forefront of her reform plans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alice schwarzer does not believe that merkel will do much for women 's issues " she has not shown any enthusiasm for so-called woman 's politics , " germany 's best-known feminist , alice schwarzer , remarked recently . although merkel holds a commanding lead in the polls , they also show that the large percentage of voters who are still undecided ahead of the september 18 election are unlikely to be swayed for merkel simply because she is a woman . in interviews and speeches , merkel rarely misses an opportunity to mention the importance of the family and has promised to improve the plight of working mothers in a bid to raise germany 's low birth rate . but beyond that she has not courted the female vote , just as she has refused to play on her roots in former communist eastern germany . german iron lady ? merkel bristles at the inevitable comparisons with britain 's iron lady margaret thatcher , saying there are " limited " similarities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : limited similarity : margaret thatcher but like thatcher , merkel is a woman leading a conservative party and faces perhaps the added constraint of looking to govern a country that has only gradually shed the notion of women 's traditional role involving the so-called three k 's - kinder , küche and kirche -lrb- children , kitchen , church -rrb- . figures published by the electoral commission on wednesday showed that one third of candidates put up by all parties are women , but the greens and chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats are miles ahead of the christian union in terms of gender representation . schröder on wednesday at his party 's congress reached for the gender card , telling supporters that the policies of many of merkel 's closest aides on women 's issues " date from the 19th century . " criticism , woman to woman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doris schröder-köpf , the wife of the german chancellor , is highly critical of merkel schröder 's wife , on the other hand , dared what nobody else has so far and pointed out that , being childless , merkel did not know what she was talking about when she championed the plight of women . " ms. merkel 's life is not such that she can represent the experiences of the majority of women , " doris schröder-köpf , who has one biological and one adopted daughter , told the weekly newspaper die zeit . " they are busy trying to juggle a family and a career , or deciding whether to spend a few years at home after having a baby or wondering how best to bring up their children .
this is not angela merkel 's world , " she said . mrs. schröder-köpf said that merkel 's policies while she was family minister in kohl 's cabinet in the early 1990s " are to blame for the low birth rates we have today . " merkel recently conceded that she would not have achieved what she did in politics if she had had children , but sought to use that as an argument for her new policies . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election 2005 click here for dw-world 's 2005 election dossier .

but others see blogs as little more than online diaries that are an extension of backroom rumor and gossip , where everyone gets to say whatever they want without any checking on the details . there 's no doubt in syrian blogger ammar abdalhamid 's mind that weblogs have established themselves as weapons against totalitarian regimes and in countries that do not enjoy a robust and free press . " this is the way we are able to communicate and give our opinions about any topics without it passing through government censors , " he said of weblogs .
" without turning back the clock to earlier times , there 's no way for governments to control the internet 's virtual arena . there will always be pressure a writer and blogger , abdalhamid lives in damascus , where the local government keeps a close eye on him and what he publishes in his blog .
he also leads the tharwa project , an independent initiative that tries to increase civic awareness in the middle east and north africa , and has long been a thorn in the side of the syrian government . " i 've made a lot of trouble for myself , but there 's no getting around it , " he said .
" there will always be pressure from above , and our role in the game is to keep going regardless of what the government bans or censors .

the doha round of talks has stalled and officials are doubtful it can be revived . the task placed on lamy 's lap is so overwhelming that , according to one official , the frenchman would have to be " pascal zorro " to succeed .
in only three months a global trade summit in hong kong begins and the word amongst some close to the talks is , to put it gently , one of cautious criticism .
" i think we have to lower expectations because the talks have lagged , " us trade representative rob portman said .
summit about subsidies and tariffs when wto trade representatives meet in hong kong in december , lamy will assume a difficult legacy from his predecessor , thailand 's supachai panitchpakdi .
before taking office , lamy recently stated that he wanted an agreement to be reached at the end of the year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farm subsidies , particularly for the eu and the us , are one sticking point in the doha round " we all know the destination , it is the conclusion of the round with a crucially important stop at the end of the year in hong kong .
i will be 100 percent invested in this .
i will be , as soon as possible , meeting with the chairs of the different negotiating groups , " he said .
the passionate jogger will need endurance for the difficult agenda he faces , which includes slashing farm subsidies and liberalizing world trade markets .
in 2003 at cancun , mexico , the continuation of the doha round from 2001 ended in failure after the eu , the us , canada and japan faced intense opposition from the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- headed by then new member china together with brazil , india , south africa and 16 other countries .
lamy was the eu 's chief negotiator at cancun .
now , he must bring all the sides together and hammer out an agreement .
" pascal lamy will bring a new aggressiveness to the job , " portman said recently .
yet , no matter how skillfully the 58-year-old frenchman may negotiate , the will must be there on the part of wto members .
" he has no magic wand .
the bottom line is that there will only be progress if countries want there to be .
and it is not clear they do , " india 's trade ambassador , ujal singh bhatia , told reuters .
little power at his disposal the wto director-general has little executive power so diplomats are placing their hopes on his experience as the eu 's trade boss .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lower trade tariffs are another goal of the wto negotiations in hong kong exactly these close ties to europe lead groups critical of gloabalization , like attac , to believe that despite the lack of real authority , lamy will not work in the interests of developing countries .
whatever happens , all agree that an agreement , whether weak or strong , must be signed in december so that an end of 2006 deadline can be reached and doha can finally be put into force . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's lamy named new wto leader after a process lasting several months , pascal lamy has been appointed director-general of the world trade organization .
the 58-year-old frenchman has some tough challenges ahead of him .

but though the high-tech television is exciting some companies , german broadcasters remain hesitant . it 's being called a " quantum leap " and the next big development in television since the move from the black and white box .
the euphoria surrounding high-definition television can hardly be contained at this weekend 's consumer electronics fair ifa in berlin . " hdtv is the most important development in the world-wide television industry in the coming years , " said georg kofler , head of the resurgent digital pay-tv broadcaster premiere . the technology uses a 16:9 aspect ration which basically means that television images are shown in a far higher resolution than normal analog television , or dvds .
a host of major companies , like korea 's samsung and holland 's philips , have already brought several different hdtv models on the market .
major consumer electronics markets like the us and japan are already far ahead of germany and the rest of europe in adapting the new technology . cooperation to increase visibility ahead of the start of ifa , premiere announced a cooperative effort with philips and samsung and a long-term link-up with the discovery channel aimed at bringing the quality of hdtv programming to a wider audience . all 64 world cup games in germany this year will be shown on premiere in hdtv format .

they plan on broadcasting their prosieben and sat.1 channels in hdtv format beginning at the end of october . " hdtv is a quantum leap , " said ceo guillaume de posch . still too expensive but the rest of the german broadcasting landscape is not as excited .
the two major public stations , ard and zdf , said they plan on waiting longer with hdtv format , citing high costs and insufficient users . zdf said high-definition television will have to wait until germany 's homes make the switch from analog to digital , something they predict wo n't happen before 2010 .
rtl , europe 's largest broadcaster , said it will wait as well . " hdtv brings with it much higher costs , " said an rtl spokesman .
one television ceo estimated the broadcast cost 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 12,456 -rrb- an hour , according to the german daily handelsblatt . there is also the cost of the televisions themselves , which start at around 1,000 euros and can go as high as 5,000 euros .
in 2005 , fewer than 1 million sold and analysts do not expect to reach the one million mark before the end of 2006 . bildunterschrift : hdtv sets can cost upwards of 5,000 euros or more branch analysts expect hdtv sales to make up more than 10 percent of total sets sold only in 2008 .

pfahls served as state secretary for defence from 1987 to 1992 under then chancellor helmut kohl .
former chancellor kohl saved pfahls from a tougher sentence by testifying that pfahls had had no influence over his controversial decision to sell saudi arabia 36 armoured vehicles during the 1991 gulf war , based on a request by the us government . dw-world.de german ex-minister gets prison time a german court on friday sentenced ludwig-holger pfahls , a former deputy defense minister , to 27 months in prison on bribery and tax evasion charges in an arms deal .

the german embassy in washington and german consulates in houston and atlanta are closely cooperating with us authorities on helping german citizens and looking for the missing persons . lengthy recovery us president george w. bush said wednesday it would take years to recover from the deadly ravages of hurricane katrina , which he branded one of the worst national disasters in us history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush looking out the window of air force one bush made the comments after cutting short his vacation in texas and flying over the stricken area in air force one before returning to washington to oversee the massive rescue and relief effort . " we 're dealing with one of the worst natural disasters in our nation 's history , " he told reporters in the white house rose garden . " this recovery will take years , " he said , pledging the full support of the us government in rescuing and giving assistance to the tens of thousands people made homeless by the storm . the president laid down three priorities : saving lives and evacuating endangered survivors , providing adequate food , water and shelter for dislocated people and launching a comprehensive recovery effort . bush 's environmental policy under attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin , germany 's minister of the environment , is not known for his diplomatic skills german enviroment minister jürgen trittin , in an editorial published in the daily frankfurter rundschau on tuesday , sharply criticizing president bush for " closing his eyes " to environmental problems and the dangers of global warming .
american readers responded in anger to the chastising editorial , which offered no words of sympathy for the united states , but the minister has remained unapologetic . trittin 's spokesman , michael schrören , said on wednesday that " trittin 's comments were true and he wrote what he meant . " trittin , however , is not the only critic of the us environmental policy in germany .
reinhard bütikofer , who heads the german green party , of which foreign minister is also a member , called bush an " eco-reactionary . " " bush conducts his environmental policy from the perspective of oil and nuclear lobby , " said bütikofer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karsten voigt of the german foreign ministry karsten voigt , foreign ministry coordinator for german-us cooperation , tried to strike a balance between being critical of us policies and showing sympathy for the united states by saying that tritten 's comments were accurate but badly timed . " one should be more diplomatic than mr. trittin was , but there is general consensus in germany that climate change is a major issue , " voigt said . too rich to ask for help ? germans donated in record numbers in the aftermath of the asian tsunami eight months ago .
but the situation is different today : the us government has made no call for international aid , and german charity organizations have so far not pledged financial aid for the hurricane-affected regions . " we are at the moment planning no call for help , " said fredrik barkenhammar of the german red cross . according to barkenhammar , the american red cross is financially very well positioned and has , therefore , not asked for outside help .
should the german red cross receive any public or private donations for the american disaster relief , the money will be transferred to the us red cross , he said . bildunterschrift : freies bildformat not exactly a catastrophe ? damage caused by hurricane katrina will certainly have international consequences , according to swiss re , the world 's second largest insurance company .
the firm said wednesday that katrina would cost the insurance industry alone about $ 20 billion -lrb- 16.2 billion euros -rrb- . many believe , however , that the scope of the disaster is such that the us government , which has one of the most sophisticated crisis management systems in the world at its disposal , should be able to respond to it adequately . " catastrophe means that a society can not cope with a situation , " said achim reinke , spokesperson for the catholic aid organization caritas .

ludwig-holger pfahls , 62 , was sentenced earlier this month for accepting about two million euros -lrb- $ 2.5 million -rrb- in kickbacks from the deal and failing to declare the income .
but a court in augsburg ruled on tuesday he should be released because he was in custody for more than one year before he was sentenced .
under the conditions of his release , pfahls is not allowed to leave germany and is required to take up residence in the country as well report to police every week .
pfahls served as state secretary for defence from 1987 to 1992 under then chancellor helmut kohl .
former chancellor kohl saved pfahls from a tougher sentence by testifying that pfahls had had no influence over his controversial decision to sell saudi arabia 36 armoured vehicles during the 1991 gulf war , based on a request by the us government . dw-world.de german ex-minister gets prison time a german court on friday sentenced ludwig-holger pfahls , a former deputy defense minister , to 27 months in prison on bribery and tax evasion charges in an arms deal .

spd presents election manifesto election 2005 -pipe- 01.09.2005 turkish-german vote anything but certain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social democrat müntefering gets chummy in kreuzberg german politicians are busy wooing turkish-germans .
but , disenchanted with both the conservatives ' anti-turkish rhetoric and the social democrats ' unpopular reforms , the group is proving politically unpredictable . in recent weeks , kreuzberg - berlin 's heavily turkish and alternative district , marked by a laid-back air , entrepreneurial spirit , and the smell of kebabs and lattes - has been witnessing a burst of activity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians in a turkish restaurant in kreuzberg as federal elections loom , politicians of all stripes have been dropping in on the colorful neighborhood 's numerous small shops and cafés , visiting kindergartens and schools where almost 90 percent of the children are of foreign origin . most kreuzbergers are unfazed by the spectacle . on a sunny morning this week , gülcan aydemir , a housewife and mother of three , who came to germany from turkey at the age of four , put her heavy shopping bags down in front of an election poster of ahmet iyidirli , the local social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- candidate . " never seen him before , " the 41-year-old said .
" it ’ s the same thing each time . the politicians only think of us turks when elections are around the corner . " turkish vote could prove decisive but politicians do have good reason to woo turkish-germans .
of the 2.6 million turks living in germany - the country 's biggest group of immigrants - an estimated 600,000 have been naturalized and are entitled to vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish grocers in cologne though that number may seem insignificant in a voting population of about 61.5 million , it is enough to tip the scales when the parties are neck-and-neck at the polls - as happened during the last elections in 2002 . " we had a really slim majority at the time and the few thousand turkish-german votes proved very valuable and helped us to win , " said ozan ceyhun , in charge of organizing a campaign to get the " foreign vote " for chancellor schröder 's spd . spd traditionally popular political preferences among germany 's turks have been clear-cut so far .
the large majority has traditionally voted for the spd .
according to one study , upwards of 65 percent now back the spd ; the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- enjoy support of around 9 percent . those political leanings are reflected in the german parliament , which currently has one turkish-german member each for the spd and the green party , but none from the cdu or the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor schröder , right with turkish prime minister erdogan dirk halm of the essen-based center for turkish studies traces the spd 's popularity among germany 's turks to the party 's working-class origins . " the first contact between the spd and many turks who came as guest workers to germany in the 1950s and 60s was through trade unions , and it was a strong political and cultural connection that lasted generations , " halm said . cdu 's turkey policy not popular however , the cdu does attract some turkish-germans , especially members of the business community , to its ranks .
according to some , the party 's traditional support of family values and business-friendly policies do have the potential to resonate with the turkish-german community . " most turks in germany are very conservative and the cdu would seem to be their natural choice .
but the cdu continues to turn them off with its anti-turkish politics and rhetoric , " özcan mutlu , a green party candidate from kreuzberg and a member of the berlin state parliament told spiegel online . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is strongly opposed to turkey 's eu bid this time seems to be no different .
the conservatives under the leadership of angela merkel have taken a vehement stance against turkey joining the european union , offering it a so-called " privileged partnership " instead . the position has predictably irked and further alienated many turks in germany , according to ozan ceyhun of the spd . " the thinking among turks is that ' if they -lrb- the cdu -rrb- do n't want my country of origin in the eu , then they do n't want me here in germany either . '
it 's definitely perceived as discriminatory , " ceyhun said . disillusioned by the spd too despite the obvious political preferences , experts warn that turkish-germans are far from having made up their minds about which box to check on the ballot on sept .
18 . many are said to be disillusioned with the spd on account of a new regulation in the naturalization law which has led to some 50,000 turkish-germans losing their german citizenship . hakki keskin , the first turkish-born german to be elected to the german parliament and who left the spd after 30 years and is now campaigning for the fledgling left party , said many were also " bitterly disappointed " by the spd 's " neo-liberal " social and economic reforms which have hit poorer turks . " the reforms are far removed from the social justice that the spd is supposed to stand for .
i 'm not the only one turning away from the party , " keskin said . jobs the crunch factor disenchantment with both the big mainstream political parties in germany may have made the turkish-germans politically unpredictable this election .

" the first contact between the spd and many turks who came as guest workers to germany in the 1950s and 60s was through trade unions , and it was a strong political and cultural connection that lasted generations , " halm said . cdu 's turkey policy not popular however , the cdu does attract some turkish-germans , especially members of the business community , to its ranks .
according to some , the party 's traditional support of family values and business-friendly policies do have the potential to resonate with the turkish-german community . " most turks in germany are very conservative and the cdu would seem to be their natural choice .
but the cdu continues to turn them off with its anti-turkish politics and rhetoric , " özcan mutlu , a green party candidate from kreuzberg and a member of the berlin state parliament told spiegel online . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is strongly opposed to turkey 's eu bid this time seems to be no different .
the conservatives under the leadership of angela merkel have taken a vehement stance against turkey joining the european union , offering it a so-called " privileged partnership " instead . the position has predictably irked and further alienated many turks in germany , according to ozan ceyhun of the spd . " the thinking among turks is that ' if they -lrb- the cdu -rrb- do n't want my country of origin in the eu , then they do n't want me here in germany either . '
it 's definitely perceived as discriminatory , " ceyhun said . disillusioned by the spd too despite the obvious political preferences , experts warn that turkish-germans are far from having made up their minds about which box to check on the ballot on sept .
18 . many are said to be disillusioned with the spd on account of a new regulation in the naturalization law which has led to some 50,000 turkish-germans losing their german citizenship . hakki keskin , the first turkish-born german to be elected to the german parliament and who left the spd after 30 years and is now campaigning for the fledgling left party , said many were also " bitterly disappointed " by the spd 's " neo-liberal " social and economic reforms which have hit poorer turks . " the reforms are far removed from the social justice that the spd is supposed to stand for .
i 'm not the only one turning away from the party , " keskin said . jobs the crunch factor disenchantment with both the big mainstream political parties in germany may have made the turkish-germans politically unpredictable this election .
but in the end the crunch issues of jobs and economy will decide the vote , according to some . " so much has changed since the last general election .
work is the key concern now and the turkish community is particularly affected by unemployment , " said dirk halm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in kreuzberg , where the jobless rate is more than 20 percent and every third teenager drops out of school , that theory seems to hold especially true . mesut yatci , 22 , who works in a travel agency , said he could n't care less about politics . " whether turkey makes it into the eu or not isn ’ t important to me , " said yatci , who is of turkish origin and born in germany .

but though the high-tech television is exciting some companies , german broadcasters remain hesitant . it 's being called a " quantum leap " and the next big development in television since the move from the black and white box .
the euphoria surrounding high-definition television can hardly be contained at this weekend 's consumer electronics fair ifa in berlin . " hdtv is the most important development in the world-wide television industry in the coming years , " said georg kofler , head of the resurgent digital pay-tv broadcaster premiere . the technology uses a 16:9 aspect ration which basically means that television images are shown in a far higher resolution than normal analog television , or dvds .
a host of major companies , like korea 's samsung and holland 's philips , have already brought several different hdtv models on the market .
major consumer electronics markets like the us and japan are already far ahead of germany and the rest of europe in adapting the new technology . cooperation to increase visibility ahead of the start of ifa , premiere announced a cooperative effort with philips and samsung and a long-term link-up with the discovery channel aimed at bringing the quality of hdtv programming to a wider audience . all 64 world cup games in germany this year will be shown on premiere in hdtv format .
beginning in november , germany 's only pay-tv broadcaster will introduce three different 24-hour hdtv channels into their channel list . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premiere viewers with hdtv televisions will get all the world cup action delivered to them in the high-definition format . prosiebensat.1 , recently bought up by the axel springer publishing house , plans to be on air with hdtv content even earlier .
they plan on broadcasting their prosieben and sat.1 channels in hdtv format beginning at the end of october . " hdtv is a quantum leap , " said ceo guillaume de posch . still too expensive but the rest of the german broadcasting landscape is not as excited .
the two major public stations , ard and zdf , said they plan on waiting longer with hdtv format , citing high costs and insufficient users . zdf said high-definition television will have to wait until germany 's homes make the switch from analog to digital , something they predict wo n't happen before 2010 .
rtl , europe 's largest broadcaster , said it will wait as well . " hdtv brings with it much higher costs , " said an rtl spokesman .
one television ceo estimated the broadcast cost 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 12,456 -rrb- an hour , according to the german daily handelsblatt . there is also the cost of the televisions themselves , which start at around 1,000 euros and can go as high as 5,000 euros .
in 2005 , fewer than 1 million sold and analysts do not expect to reach the one million mark before the end of 2006 . bildunterschrift : hdtv sets can cost upwards of 5,000 euros or more branch analysts expect hdtv sales to make up more than 10 percent of total sets sold only in 2008 .
" we 'll start planning when 10 to 15 percent of the viewers own hdtv , " said an rtl spokesperson . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german tv looks to us for salvation on tuesday , the us hit tv series “ desperate housewives ” hits the airwaves in germany .

we want the future to be female , and in many ways , " said another league official . feminists remain unconvinced the political left is distinctly skeptical that merkel will put women 's issues at the forefront of her reform plans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alice schwarzer does not believe that merkel will do much for women 's issues " she has not shown any enthusiasm for so-called woman 's politics , " germany 's best-known feminist , alice schwarzer , remarked recently . although merkel holds a commanding lead in the polls , they also show that the large percentage of voters who are still undecided ahead of the september 18 election are unlikely to be swayed for merkel simply because she is a woman . in interviews and speeches , merkel rarely misses an opportunity to mention the importance of the family and has promised to improve the plight of working mothers in a bid to raise germany 's low birth rate . but beyond that she has not courted the female vote , just as she has refused to play on her roots in former communist eastern germany . german iron lady ? merkel bristles at the inevitable comparisons with britain 's iron lady margaret thatcher , saying there are " limited " similarities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : limited similarity : margaret thatcher but like thatcher , merkel is a woman leading a conservative party and faces perhaps the added constraint of looking to govern a country that has only gradually shed the notion of women 's traditional role involving the so-called three k 's - kinder , küche and kirche -lrb- children , kitchen , church -rrb- . figures published by the electoral commission on wednesday showed that one third of candidates put up by all parties are women , but the greens and chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats are miles ahead of the christian union in terms of gender representation . schröder on wednesday at his party 's congress reached for the gender card , telling supporters that the policies of many of merkel 's closest aides on women 's issues " date from the 19th century . " criticism , woman to woman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doris schröder-köpf , the wife of the german chancellor , is highly critical of merkel schröder 's wife , on the other hand , dared what nobody else has so far and pointed out that , being childless , merkel did not know what she was talking about when she championed the plight of women . " ms. merkel 's life is not such that she can represent the experiences of the majority of women , " doris schröder-köpf , who has one biological and one adopted daughter , told the weekly newspaper die zeit . " they are busy trying to juggle a family and a career , or deciding whether to spend a few years at home after having a baby or wondering how best to bring up their children .
this is not angela merkel 's world , " she said . mrs. schröder-köpf said that merkel 's policies while she was family minister in kohl 's cabinet in the early 1990s " are to blame for the low birth rates we have today . " merkel recently conceded that she would not have achieved what she did in politics if she had had children , but sought to use that as an argument for her new policies . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election 2005 click here for dw-world 's 2005 election dossier .

" we know that there are concerns , but that does n't change the fact the talks are going to start in october .

" turkey is a key political issue , " said one british official ahead of the eu talks .
" we know that there are concerns , but that does n't change the fact the talks are going to start in october . " eu leaders gave the vast muslim state a green light last december to start entry talks despite its refusal to recognize the government of cyprus , which was among 10 countries that joined the eu last year . but its hopes of one day joining the bloc were dealt a severe blow in may when french and dutch voters - many citing opposition to turkish eu entry - sparked an unprecedented crisis by rejecting the eu constitution . cyprus tension surfaces again ankara fueled fresh concern after it appended a declaration to its signature of an amended customs accord with the enlarged eu in july , underlining that it still does not recognize cyprus .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.09.2005 merkel , allies unveil german coalition plans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the big three the german conservative opposition of angela merkel and her favored coalition partners presented a united front on thursday in a bid to persuade voters they could rule germany alone . merkel said that only a combination of the christian union and the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- could drag the country out of its economic standstill and dismissed gerhard schröder 's social democrats as " belonging to the past . " with polls showing the christian union is heading for a clear victory over the social democrats on september 18 , the burning question now is whether it will gain enough votes along with the free democrats to secure a majority in the bundestag lower house of parliament . the alternative is a so-called grand coalition including the social democrats , which none of the parties says it wants . after a meeting with the free democrats ' leader guido westerwelle , merkel told a press conference that the parties had put their names to a shared manifesto which puts job creation and promoting families at the centre of their strategy . bildunterschrift : angela merkel and edmund stoiber at a cdu party convention in dortmund on august 28 . " with the union and the fdp together , germany will have a different style than under red-green , " she said , using the nickname for the current coalition of social democrats and greens . seven years of rule by schröder 's coalition have been " disastrous " , and a speech by schröder at a congress of the social democrats on wednesday produced " no new proposals " for getting the country 's 4.7 million unemployed back to work , she said . " that was the past ; we stand for the future , " merkel said , promising that coalition negotiations after the election would be wrapped up quickly . free-market liberals firmly on board standing alongside merkel , westerwelle agreed that his party was in broad agreement with the christian union . bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle " we want to rule together because this country needs a new start , " he said . edmund stoiber , leader of the christian social union , the bavarian sister party of merkel 's christian democratic union , said a coalition with the free democrats was " the only political alternative . " people should know what they are voting for , stoiber said - a cross on the ballot paper for the social democrats could produce a ragtag coalition including the greens and the former communists , although this constellation has been repeatedly ruled out by the current governing parties . coalitions of christian democrats and free democrats have led germany for the majority of the post-world war ii period " and we have led well because we have experience of leading " , said stoiber , who was beaten by schröder in the race to be chancellor in 2002 . gaining a majority is not a foregone conclusion , as an opinion poll carried out by the infratest institute and released on thursday showed the christian union scoring between 42 and 43 percent and the free democrats on six to seven percent . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder steels spd for the final charge chancellor gerhard schröder is at his best when his back is against the wall .

turkish foreign minister abdullah gul rejected the conservative christian union bloc 's proposal of a " privileged partnership " with the eu instead of full membership as " illegitimate and immoral . "
friedbert pflüger , one of the christian union 's spokesmen on foreign affairs , said gul 's tone was " completely unacceptable . "

eu foreign ministers were due to begin two days of talks in wales on thursday about how to put pressure on turkey to meet the conditions for membership just weeks before it is due to start accession talks .
ankara 's persistent refusal to recognize the government of eu member cyprus is one of the major stumbling blocks .
the german government of chancellor gerhard schröder strongly backs turkey 's bid to become an eu member .
but the christian union bloc , which is set to win the general election on september 18 , claims turkey is not ready to become part of the eu because it claims the predominantly muslim country lacks european traditions . dw-world.de conservatives say no to turkey again in a letter to conservative eu heads of state ahead of a sept .

" merkel has made it clear , women are no longer standing on the sidelines ; they have seized power .

" whoever wants to keep new orleans as a city has to build higher dams .
after the next hurricane or storm , even higher ones .
whoever wants to keep new orleans as a city , must accept the fact that every meter a dam is raised , the city will be in greater danger .
neither hurricanes nor a river like the mississippi can be controlled - particularly not in times of climate change .
humans may think they have the technology to conquer nature but that is a constitutive error of civilization , without which humans would not be what they are . "
" it is too much .
we are sick of catastrophes .
it is superfluous to argue what influence mankind has on natural catastrophes .
one thing is certain : there have always been extreme weather events , but now they happen in a more densely-populated world and the extent of the disaster is spread quickly through the mass media .
because of globalization , the catastrophe on the mississippi threatens the world 's economy .
the hurricane and flood destroyed economic goods and growth not only in the usa .
we also feel that the events affect us also .
" the big easy " has disappeared , " commented the braunschweiger zeitung .
bildunterschrift : people walk along interstate 10 near the louisiana superdome as their future remains future " is this the key to the widespread religiosity in the usa that so many europeans think is exaggerated ? " asked the tagesspiegel in berlin .
" all across the country , americans have sympathized with those who have lost loved ones after having to let go of a husband 's , wife 's or child 's hand .
and they have celebrated the heroes who told incredible tales of survival .
yet nobody seems to believe that such catastrophes can be avoided if we work together properly with nature .
there 's also hardly a hint of criticism towards president bush 's climate policies .
yet without a blink the media compare the disaster to the tsunami , or hiroshima or nagasaki - leaving some europeans wondering .
they see that nature is more powerful , so americans decide that there is nothing left to do but to take the licking , roll up their sleeves and start rebuilding .
the country , as paradoxical as it may sound , gathers its belief in light of the humbling experience that it is a true world power . "
" us president george w. bush again stands in the crossfire of criticism from environmentalists .
he stubbornly refuses to sign the kyoto climate protection treaty .
he prefers to listen to the business lobbies who preach ad infinitum that climate protection slows down economic growth .
nature , however , is more powerful than the economy .
she has her own laws , " commented the hamburger morgenpost .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george w. bush looks out the window of air force one over new orleans " the dams have broken in new orleans - and not just literally .
the flood - a cultural symbol for chaos throughout the history of mankind - brought with it the anarchy of looters , " wrote the heilbronner stimme .
" those areas of society where the collective was already fragile to begin with were swept away along with public order by mother nature like a prefabricated house .
the us government then reacts with martial law in response .
oh , how eden-like it is here in germany , where soldiers can concentrate on carrying sandbags during a flood . "
" the environmental and climate policies in the usa have to be equated with energy policies , " wrote the süddeutsche zeitung in munich .
" the best regulatory means is , first of all , the price of gasoline .
next best is the global competition on the commodities market .
washington has taken notice of china 's attempts to access the american energy market with alarm .

but though the high-tech television is exciting some companies , german broadcasters remain hesitant . it 's being called a " quantum leap " and the next big development in television since the move from the black and white box .
the euphoria surrounding high-definition television can hardly be contained at this weekend 's consumer electronics fair ifa in berlin . " hdtv is the most important development in the world-wide television industry in the coming years , " said georg kofler , head of the resurgent digital pay-tv broadcaster premiere . the technology uses a 16:9 aspect ration which basically means that television images are shown in a far higher resolution than normal analog television , or dvds .
a host of major companies , like korea 's samsung and holland 's philips , have already brought several different hdtv models on the market .
major consumer electronics markets like the us and japan are already far ahead of germany and the rest of europe in adapting the new technology . cooperation to increase visibility ahead of the start of ifa , premiere announced a cooperative effort with philips and samsung and a long-term link-up with the discovery channel aimed at bringing the quality of hdtv programming to a wider audience . all 64 world cup games in germany this year will be shown on premiere in hdtv format .

rtl , europe 's largest broadcaster , said it will wait as well . " hdtv brings with it much higher costs , " said an rtl spokesman .
one television ceo estimated the broadcast cost 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 12,456 -rrb- an hour , according to the german daily handelsblatt . there is also the cost of the televisions themselves , which start at around 1,000 euros and can go as high as 5,000 euros .

ludwig-holger pfahls , 62 , was sentenced earlier this month for accepting about two million euros -lrb- $ 2.5 million -rrb- in kickbacks from the deal and failing to declare the income .
but a court in augsburg ruled on tuesday he should be released because he was in custody for more than one year before he was sentenced .
under the conditions of his release , pfahls is not allowed to leave germany and is required to take up residence in the country as well report to police every week .
pfahls served as state secretary for defence from 1987 to 1992 under then chancellor helmut kohl .

the german embassy in washington , d.c. is also constantly updating the information on its web site . germany 's foreign minister joschka fischer said thursday there were no german casualties in the areas affected by hurricane katrina .
the german embassy in washington and german consulates in houston and atlanta are closely cooperating with us authorities on helping german citizens and looking for the missing persons . lengthy recovery us president george w. bush said wednesday it would take years to recover from the deadly ravages of hurricane katrina , which he branded one of the worst national disasters in us history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush looking out the window of air force one bush made the comments after cutting short his vacation in texas and flying over the stricken area in air force one before returning to washington to oversee the massive rescue and relief effort .

" this recovery will take years , " he said , pledging the full support of the us government in rescuing and giving assistance to the tens of thousands people made homeless by the storm . the president laid down three priorities : saving lives and evacuating endangered survivors , providing adequate food , water and shelter for dislocated people and launching a comprehensive recovery effort . bush 's environmental policy under attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin , germany 's minister of the environment , is not known for his diplomatic skills german enviroment minister jürgen trittin , in an editorial published in the daily frankfurter rundschau on tuesday , sharply criticizing president bush for " closing his eyes " to environmental problems and the dangers of global warming .
american readers responded in anger to the chastising editorial , which offered no words of sympathy for the united states , but the minister has remained unapologetic . trittin 's spokesman , michael schrören , said on wednesday that " trittin 's comments were true and he wrote what he meant . " trittin , however , is not the only critic of the us environmental policy in germany .
reinhard bütikofer , who heads the german green party , of which foreign minister is also a member , called bush an " eco-reactionary . " " bush conducts his environmental policy from the perspective of oil and nuclear lobby , " said bütikofer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karsten voigt of the german foreign ministry karsten voigt , foreign ministry coordinator for german-us cooperation , tried to strike a balance between being critical of us policies and showing sympathy for the united states by saying that tritten 's comments were accurate but badly timed . " one should be more diplomatic than mr. trittin was , but there is general consensus in germany that climate change is a major issue , " voigt said . too rich to ask for help ? germans donated in record numbers in the aftermath of the asian tsunami eight months ago .
but the situation is different today : the us government has made no call for international aid , and german charity organizations have so far not pledged financial aid for the hurricane-affected regions . " we are at the moment planning no call for help , " said fredrik barkenhammar of the german red cross . according to barkenhammar , the american red cross is financially very well positioned and has , therefore , not asked for outside help .
should the german red cross receive any public or private donations for the american disaster relief , the money will be transferred to the us red cross , he said . bildunterschrift : freies bildformat not exactly a catastrophe ? damage caused by hurricane katrina will certainly have international consequences , according to swiss re , the world 's second largest insurance company .
the firm said wednesday that katrina would cost the insurance industry alone about $ 20 billion -lrb- 16.2 billion euros -rrb- . many believe , however , that the scope of the disaster is such that the us government , which has one of the most sophisticated crisis management systems in the world at its disposal , should be able to respond to it adequately . " catastrophe means that a society can not cope with a situation , " said achim reinke , spokesperson for the catholic aid organization caritas . " we need to stay balanced , " reinke said , pointing out that there are other crisis regions in the world , like sudan 's war-torn darfur region , that should n't be forgotten . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de katrina could swamp german economy germany 's economy minister has said he fears hurricane katrina , which has devastated the southern us coast , could lead to a further rise in oil prices and dampen already weak domestic spending in germany .

angela merkel , however , is not promising a feminist or even a particularly feminine future . angela merkel has come a long way from her early days in politics when former chancellor helmut kohl referred to her as his " girl . "
and although the plainly dressed 51-year-old , now a chancellor candidate for the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is unlikely to bring gender into politics , her party is trying to capitalize on the fact that merkel is a woman . " we support her because she is a woman and as chancellor she will bring new perspectives and emotional intelligence to politics , " said emilia müller of the cdu women 's league at a meeting in berlin this week . " merkel has made it clear , women are no longer standing on the sidelines ; they have seized power .
we want the future to be female , and in many ways , " said another league official . feminists remain unconvinced the political left is distinctly skeptical that merkel will put women 's issues at the forefront of her reform plans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alice schwarzer does not believe that merkel will do much for women 's issues " she has not shown any enthusiasm for so-called woman 's politics , " germany 's best-known feminist , alice schwarzer , remarked recently . although merkel holds a commanding lead in the polls , they also show that the large percentage of voters who are still undecided ahead of the september 18 election are unlikely to be swayed for merkel simply because she is a woman . in interviews and speeches , merkel rarely misses an opportunity to mention the importance of the family and has promised to improve the plight of working mothers in a bid to raise germany 's low birth rate . but beyond that she has not courted the female vote , just as she has refused to play on her roots in former communist eastern germany . german iron lady ? merkel bristles at the inevitable comparisons with britain 's iron lady margaret thatcher , saying there are " limited " similarities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : limited similarity : margaret thatcher but like thatcher , merkel is a woman leading a conservative party and faces perhaps the added constraint of looking to govern a country that has only gradually shed the notion of women 's traditional role involving the so-called three k 's - kinder , küche and kirche -lrb- children , kitchen , church -rrb- . figures published by the electoral commission on wednesday showed that one third of candidates put up by all parties are women , but the greens and chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats are miles ahead of the christian union in terms of gender representation . schröder on wednesday at his party 's congress reached for the gender card , telling supporters that the policies of many of merkel 's closest aides on women 's issues " date from the 19th century . " criticism , woman to woman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doris schröder-köpf , the wife of the german chancellor , is highly critical of merkel schröder 's wife , on the other hand , dared what nobody else has so far and pointed out that , being childless , merkel did not know what she was talking about when she championed the plight of women . " ms. merkel 's life is not such that she can represent the experiences of the majority of women , " doris schröder-köpf , who has one biological and one adopted daughter , told the weekly newspaper die zeit . " they are busy trying to juggle a family and a career , or deciding whether to spend a few years at home after having a baby or wondering how best to bring up their children .
this is not angela merkel 's world , " she said . mrs. schröder-köpf said that merkel 's policies while she was family minister in kohl 's cabinet in the early 1990s " are to blame for the low birth rates we have today . " merkel recently conceded that she would not have achieved what she did in politics if she had had children , but sought to use that as an argument for her new policies . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election 2005 click here for dw-world 's 2005 election dossier .

" we must show solidarity for those affected , " he added the german foreign ministry has set up a 24-hour hotline in an attempt to coordinate aid efforts -lrb- + 49-30-5000-2000 -rrb- .
the german embassy in washington , d.c. is also constantly updating the information on its web site . germany 's foreign minister joschka fischer said thursday there were no german casualties in the areas affected by hurricane katrina .
the german embassy in washington and german consulates in houston and atlanta are closely cooperating with us authorities on helping german citizens and looking for the missing persons . lengthy recovery us president george w. bush said wednesday it would take years to recover from the deadly ravages of hurricane katrina , which he branded one of the worst national disasters in us history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush looking out the window of air force one bush made the comments after cutting short his vacation in texas and flying over the stricken area in air force one before returning to washington to oversee the massive rescue and relief effort . " we 're dealing with one of the worst natural disasters in our nation 's history , " he told reporters in the white house rose garden . " this recovery will take years , " he said , pledging the full support of the us government in rescuing and giving assistance to the tens of thousands people made homeless by the storm . the president laid down three priorities : saving lives and evacuating endangered survivors , providing adequate food , water and shelter for dislocated people and launching a comprehensive recovery effort . bush 's environmental policy under attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin , germany 's minister of the environment , is not known for his diplomatic skills german enviroment minister jürgen trittin , in an editorial published in the daily frankfurter rundschau on tuesday , sharply criticizing president bush for " closing his eyes " to environmental problems and the dangers of global warming .
american readers responded in anger to the chastising editorial , which offered no words of sympathy for the united states , but the minister has remained unapologetic . trittin 's spokesman , michael schrören , said on wednesday that " trittin 's comments were true and he wrote what he meant . " trittin , however , is not the only critic of the us environmental policy in germany .
reinhard bütikofer , who heads the german green party , of which foreign minister is also a member , called bush an " eco-reactionary . " " bush conducts his environmental policy from the perspective of oil and nuclear lobby , " said bütikofer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karsten voigt of the german foreign ministry karsten voigt , foreign ministry coordinator for german-us cooperation , tried to strike a balance between being critical of us policies and showing sympathy for the united states by saying that tritten 's comments were accurate but badly timed . " one should be more diplomatic than mr. trittin was , but there is general consensus in germany that climate change is a major issue , " voigt said . too rich to ask for help ? germans donated in record numbers in the aftermath of the asian tsunami eight months ago .
but the situation is different today : the us government has made no call for international aid , and german charity organizations have so far not pledged financial aid for the hurricane-affected regions . " we are at the moment planning no call for help , " said fredrik barkenhammar of the german red cross . according to barkenhammar , the american red cross is financially very well positioned and has , therefore , not asked for outside help .
should the german red cross receive any public or private donations for the american disaster relief , the money will be transferred to the us red cross , he said . bildunterschrift : freies bildformat not exactly a catastrophe ? damage caused by hurricane katrina will certainly have international consequences , according to swiss re , the world 's second largest insurance company .
the firm said wednesday that katrina would cost the insurance industry alone about $ 20 billion -lrb- 16.2 billion euros -rrb- . many believe , however , that the scope of the disaster is such that the us government , which has one of the most sophisticated crisis management systems in the world at its disposal , should be able to respond to it adequately . " catastrophe means that a society can not cope with a situation , " said achim reinke , spokesperson for the catholic aid organization caritas . " we need to stay balanced , " reinke said , pointing out that there are other crisis regions in the world , like sudan 's war-torn darfur region , that should n't be forgotten . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de katrina could swamp german economy germany 's economy minister has said he fears hurricane katrina , which has devastated the southern us coast , could lead to a further rise in oil prices and dampen already weak domestic spending in germany .

the doha round of talks has stalled and officials are doubtful it can be revived . the task placed on lamy 's lap is so overwhelming that , according to one official , the frenchman would have to be " pascal zorro " to succeed .
in only three months a global trade summit in hong kong begins and the word amongst some close to the talks is , to put it gently , one of cautious criticism .
" i think we have to lower expectations because the talks have lagged , " us trade representative rob portman said .
summit about subsidies and tariffs when wto trade representatives meet in hong kong in december , lamy will assume a difficult legacy from his predecessor , thailand 's supachai panitchpakdi .
before taking office , lamy recently stated that he wanted an agreement to be reached at the end of the year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farm subsidies , particularly for the eu and the us , are one sticking point in the doha round " we all know the destination , it is the conclusion of the round with a crucially important stop at the end of the year in hong kong .
i will be 100 percent invested in this .
i will be , as soon as possible , meeting with the chairs of the different negotiating groups , " he said .
the passionate jogger will need endurance for the difficult agenda he faces , which includes slashing farm subsidies and liberalizing world trade markets .
in 2003 at cancun , mexico , the continuation of the doha round from 2001 ended in failure after the eu , the us , canada and japan faced intense opposition from the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- headed by then new member china together with brazil , india , south africa and 16 other countries .
lamy was the eu 's chief negotiator at cancun .
now , he must bring all the sides together and hammer out an agreement .
" pascal lamy will bring a new aggressiveness to the job , " portman said recently .
yet , no matter how skillfully the 58-year-old frenchman may negotiate , the will must be there on the part of wto members .
" he has no magic wand .
the bottom line is that there will only be progress if countries want there to be .
and it is not clear they do , " india 's trade ambassador , ujal singh bhatia , told reuters .
little power at his disposal the wto director-general has little executive power so diplomats are placing their hopes on his experience as the eu 's trade boss .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lower trade tariffs are another goal of the wto negotiations in hong kong exactly these close ties to europe lead groups critical of gloabalization , like attac , to believe that despite the lack of real authority , lamy will not work in the interests of developing countries .
whatever happens , all agree that an agreement , whether weak or strong , must be signed in december so that an end of 2006 deadline can be reached and doha can finally be put into force . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's lamy named new wto leader after a process lasting several months , pascal lamy has been appointed director-general of the world trade organization .
the 58-year-old frenchman has some tough challenges ahead of him .
-lrb- may 26 , 2005 -rrb- wto talks collapse in cancun disappointment reigned among the world 's richer countries after world trade organization talks in cancun collapsed .
but delegates from poorer countries celebrated their ability to block proposals from the eu and others .

the doha round of talks has stalled and officials are doubtful it can be revived . the task placed on lamy 's lap is so overwhelming that , according to one official , the frenchman would have to be " pascal zorro " to succeed .
in only three months a global trade summit in hong kong begins and the word amongst some close to the talks is , to put it gently , one of cautious criticism .
" i think we have to lower expectations because the talks have lagged , " us trade representative rob portman said .
summit about subsidies and tariffs when wto trade representatives meet in hong kong in december , lamy will assume a difficult legacy from his predecessor , thailand 's supachai panitchpakdi .
before taking office , lamy recently stated that he wanted an agreement to be reached at the end of the year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farm subsidies , particularly for the eu and the us , are one sticking point in the doha round " we all know the destination , it is the conclusion of the round with a crucially important stop at the end of the year in hong kong .
i will be 100 percent invested in this .
i will be , as soon as possible , meeting with the chairs of the different negotiating groups , " he said .
the passionate jogger will need endurance for the difficult agenda he faces , which includes slashing farm subsidies and liberalizing world trade markets .
in 2003 at cancun , mexico , the continuation of the doha round from 2001 ended in failure after the eu , the us , canada and japan faced intense opposition from the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- headed by then new member china together with brazil , india , south africa and 16 other countries .
lamy was the eu 's chief negotiator at cancun .
now , he must bring all the sides together and hammer out an agreement .
" pascal lamy will bring a new aggressiveness to the job , " portman said recently .
yet , no matter how skillfully the 58-year-old frenchman may negotiate , the will must be there on the part of wto members .
" he has no magic wand .
the bottom line is that there will only be progress if countries want there to be .
and it is not clear they do , " india 's trade ambassador , ujal singh bhatia , told reuters .
little power at his disposal the wto director-general has little executive power so diplomats are placing their hopes on his experience as the eu 's trade boss .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lower trade tariffs are another goal of the wto negotiations in hong kong exactly these close ties to europe lead groups critical of gloabalization , like attac , to believe that despite the lack of real authority , lamy will not work in the interests of developing countries .
whatever happens , all agree that an agreement , whether weak or strong , must be signed in december so that an end of 2006 deadline can be reached and doha can finally be put into force . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's lamy named new wto leader after a process lasting several months , pascal lamy has been appointed director-general of the world trade organization .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.09.2005 merkel and the female question großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is not exactly a feminist dream come true with less than three weeks to go to the elections , germany is wondering what it will mean to have its first woman chancellor .
angela merkel , however , is not promising a feminist or even a particularly feminine future . angela merkel has come a long way from her early days in politics when former chancellor helmut kohl referred to her as his " girl . "
and although the plainly dressed 51-year-old , now a chancellor candidate for the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is unlikely to bring gender into politics , her party is trying to capitalize on the fact that merkel is a woman . " we support her because she is a woman and as chancellor she will bring new perspectives and emotional intelligence to politics , " said emilia müller of the cdu women 's league at a meeting in berlin this week . " merkel has made it clear , women are no longer standing on the sidelines ; they have seized power .
we want the future to be female , and in many ways , " said another league official . feminists remain unconvinced the political left is distinctly skeptical that merkel will put women 's issues at the forefront of her reform plans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alice schwarzer does not believe that merkel will do much for women 's issues " she has not shown any enthusiasm for so-called woman 's politics , " germany 's best-known feminist , alice schwarzer , remarked recently . although merkel holds a commanding lead in the polls , they also show that the large percentage of voters who are still undecided ahead of the september 18 election are unlikely to be swayed for merkel simply because she is a woman . in interviews and speeches , merkel rarely misses an opportunity to mention the importance of the family and has promised to improve the plight of working mothers in a bid to raise germany 's low birth rate . but beyond that she has not courted the female vote , just as she has refused to play on her roots in former communist eastern germany . german iron lady ? merkel bristles at the inevitable comparisons with britain 's iron lady margaret thatcher , saying there are " limited " similarities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : limited similarity : margaret thatcher but like thatcher , merkel is a woman leading a conservative party and faces perhaps the added constraint of looking to govern a country that has only gradually shed the notion of women 's traditional role involving the so-called three k 's - kinder , küche and kirche -lrb- children , kitchen , church -rrb- . figures published by the electoral commission on wednesday showed that one third of candidates put up by all parties are women , but the greens and chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats are miles ahead of the christian union in terms of gender representation . schröder on wednesday at his party 's congress reached for the gender card , telling supporters that the policies of many of merkel 's closest aides on women 's issues " date from the 19th century . " criticism , woman to woman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doris schröder-köpf , the wife of the german chancellor , is highly critical of merkel schröder 's wife , on the other hand , dared what nobody else has so far and pointed out that , being childless , merkel did not know what she was talking about when she championed the plight of women . " ms. merkel 's life is not such that she can represent the experiences of the majority of women , " doris schröder-köpf , who has one biological and one adopted daughter , told the weekly newspaper die zeit .

there 's also hardly a hint of criticism towards president bush 's climate policies .

the doha round of talks has stalled and officials are doubtful it can be revived . the task placed on lamy 's lap is so overwhelming that , according to one official , the frenchman would have to be " pascal zorro " to succeed .
in only three months a global trade summit in hong kong begins and the word amongst some close to the talks is , to put it gently , one of cautious criticism .
" i think we have to lower expectations because the talks have lagged , " us trade representative rob portman said .
summit about subsidies and tariffs when wto trade representatives meet in hong kong in december , lamy will assume a difficult legacy from his predecessor , thailand 's supachai panitchpakdi .
before taking office , lamy recently stated that he wanted an agreement to be reached at the end of the year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farm subsidies , particularly for the eu and the us , are one sticking point in the doha round " we all know the destination , it is the conclusion of the round with a crucially important stop at the end of the year in hong kong .
i will be 100 percent invested in this .
i will be , as soon as possible , meeting with the chairs of the different negotiating groups , " he said .
the passionate jogger will need endurance for the difficult agenda he faces , which includes slashing farm subsidies and liberalizing world trade markets .
in 2003 at cancun , mexico , the continuation of the doha round from 2001 ended in failure after the eu , the us , canada and japan faced intense opposition from the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- headed by then new member china together with brazil , india , south africa and 16 other countries .
lamy was the eu 's chief negotiator at cancun .
now , he must bring all the sides together and hammer out an agreement .
" pascal lamy will bring a new aggressiveness to the job , " portman said recently .
yet , no matter how skillfully the 58-year-old frenchman may negotiate , the will must be there on the part of wto members .
" he has no magic wand .
the bottom line is that there will only be progress if countries want there to be .
and it is not clear they do , " india 's trade ambassador , ujal singh bhatia , told reuters .
little power at his disposal the wto director-general has little executive power so diplomats are placing their hopes on his experience as the eu 's trade boss .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lower trade tariffs are another goal of the wto negotiations in hong kong exactly these close ties to europe lead groups critical of gloabalization , like attac , to believe that despite the lack of real authority , lamy will not work in the interests of developing countries .
whatever happens , all agree that an agreement , whether weak or strong , must be signed in december so that an end of 2006 deadline can be reached and doha can finally be put into force . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's lamy named new wto leader after a process lasting several months , pascal lamy has been appointed director-general of the world trade organization .

neither hurricanes nor a river like the mississippi can be controlled - particularly not in times of climate change .
humans may think they have the technology to conquer nature but that is a constitutive error of civilization , without which humans would not be what they are . "
" it is too much .
we are sick of catastrophes .
it is superfluous to argue what influence mankind has on natural catastrophes .
one thing is certain : there have always been extreme weather events , but now they happen in a more densely-populated world and the extent of the disaster is spread quickly through the mass media .
because of globalization , the catastrophe on the mississippi threatens the world 's economy .
the hurricane and flood destroyed economic goods and growth not only in the usa .
we also feel that the events affect us also .
" the big easy " has disappeared , " commented the braunschweiger zeitung .
bildunterschrift : people walk along interstate 10 near the louisiana superdome as their future remains future " is this the key to the widespread religiosity in the usa that so many europeans think is exaggerated ? " asked the tagesspiegel in berlin .
" all across the country , americans have sympathized with those who have lost loved ones after having to let go of a husband 's , wife 's or child 's hand .
and they have celebrated the heroes who told incredible tales of survival .
yet nobody seems to believe that such catastrophes can be avoided if we work together properly with nature .
there 's also hardly a hint of criticism towards president bush 's climate policies .
yet without a blink the media compare the disaster to the tsunami , or hiroshima or nagasaki - leaving some europeans wondering .
they see that nature is more powerful , so americans decide that there is nothing left to do but to take the licking , roll up their sleeves and start rebuilding .
the country , as paradoxical as it may sound , gathers its belief in light of the humbling experience that it is a true world power . "
" us president george w. bush again stands in the crossfire of criticism from environmentalists .
he stubbornly refuses to sign the kyoto climate protection treaty .
he prefers to listen to the business lobbies who preach ad infinitum that climate protection slows down economic growth .
nature , however , is more powerful than the economy .
she has her own laws , " commented the hamburger morgenpost .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george w. bush looks out the window of air force one over new orleans " the dams have broken in new orleans - and not just literally .
the flood - a cultural symbol for chaos throughout the history of mankind - brought with it the anarchy of looters , " wrote the heilbronner stimme .
" those areas of society where the collective was already fragile to begin with were swept away along with public order by mother nature like a prefabricated house .
the us government then reacts with martial law in response .
oh , how eden-like it is here in germany , where soldiers can concentrate on carrying sandbags during a flood . "
" the environmental and climate policies in the usa have to be equated with energy policies , " wrote the süddeutsche zeitung in munich .
" the best regulatory means is , first of all , the price of gasoline .
next best is the global competition on the commodities market .
washington has taken notice of china 's attempts to access the american energy market with alarm .
the oil lobby has , however , satisfied the us congress again and avoided drastic cuts in the energy bill .
all of these are the twitches of an energy-based political dinosaur .

spd presents election manifesto election 2005 -pipe- 01.09.2005 turkish-german vote anything but certain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social democrat müntefering gets chummy in kreuzberg german politicians are busy wooing turkish-germans .
but , disenchanted with both the conservatives ' anti-turkish rhetoric and the social democrats ' unpopular reforms , the group is proving politically unpredictable . in recent weeks , kreuzberg - berlin 's heavily turkish and alternative district , marked by a laid-back air , entrepreneurial spirit , and the smell of kebabs and lattes - has been witnessing a burst of activity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians in a turkish restaurant in kreuzberg as federal elections loom , politicians of all stripes have been dropping in on the colorful neighborhood 's numerous small shops and cafés , visiting kindergartens and schools where almost 90 percent of the children are of foreign origin . most kreuzbergers are unfazed by the spectacle . on a sunny morning this week , gülcan aydemir , a housewife and mother of three , who came to germany from turkey at the age of four , put her heavy shopping bags down in front of an election poster of ahmet iyidirli , the local social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- candidate . " never seen him before , " the 41-year-old said .
" it ’ s the same thing each time . the politicians only think of us turks when elections are around the corner . " turkish vote could prove decisive but politicians do have good reason to woo turkish-germans .
of the 2.6 million turks living in germany - the country 's biggest group of immigrants - an estimated 600,000 have been naturalized and are entitled to vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish grocers in cologne though that number may seem insignificant in a voting population of about 61.5 million , it is enough to tip the scales when the parties are neck-and-neck at the polls - as happened during the last elections in 2002 . " we had a really slim majority at the time and the few thousand turkish-german votes proved very valuable and helped us to win , " said ozan ceyhun , in charge of organizing a campaign to get the " foreign vote " for chancellor schröder 's spd . spd traditionally popular political preferences among germany 's turks have been clear-cut so far .
the large majority has traditionally voted for the spd .
according to one study , upwards of 65 percent now back the spd ; the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- enjoy support of around 9 percent . those political leanings are reflected in the german parliament , which currently has one turkish-german member each for the spd and the green party , but none from the cdu or the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor schröder , right with turkish prime minister erdogan dirk halm of the essen-based center for turkish studies traces the spd 's popularity among germany 's turks to the party 's working-class origins . " the first contact between the spd and many turks who came as guest workers to germany in the 1950s and 60s was through trade unions , and it was a strong political and cultural connection that lasted generations , " halm said . cdu 's turkey policy not popular however , the cdu does attract some turkish-germans , especially members of the business community , to its ranks .
according to some , the party 's traditional support of family values and business-friendly policies do have the potential to resonate with the turkish-german community . " most turks in germany are very conservative and the cdu would seem to be their natural choice .
but the cdu continues to turn them off with its anti-turkish politics and rhetoric , " özcan mutlu , a green party candidate from kreuzberg and a member of the berlin state parliament told spiegel online . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is strongly opposed to turkey 's eu bid this time seems to be no different .
the conservatives under the leadership of angela merkel have taken a vehement stance against turkey joining the european union , offering it a so-called " privileged partnership " instead . the position has predictably irked and further alienated many turks in germany , according to ozan ceyhun of the spd . " the thinking among turks is that ' if they -lrb- the cdu -rrb- do n't want my country of origin in the eu , then they do n't want me here in germany either . '
it 's definitely perceived as discriminatory , " ceyhun said . disillusioned by the spd too despite the obvious political preferences , experts warn that turkish-germans are far from having made up their minds about which box to check on the ballot on sept .
18 . many are said to be disillusioned with the spd on account of a new regulation in the naturalization law which has led to some 50,000 turkish-germans losing their german citizenship . hakki keskin , the first turkish-born german to be elected to the german parliament and who left the spd after 30 years and is now campaigning for the fledgling left party , said many were also " bitterly disappointed " by the spd 's " neo-liberal " social and economic reforms which have hit poorer turks . " the reforms are far removed from the social justice that the spd is supposed to stand for .
i 'm not the only one turning away from the party , " keskin said . jobs the crunch factor disenchantment with both the big mainstream political parties in germany may have made the turkish-germans politically unpredictable this election .
but in the end the crunch issues of jobs and economy will decide the vote , according to some . " so much has changed since the last general election .
work is the key concern now and the turkish community is particularly affected by unemployment , " said dirk halm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in kreuzberg , where the jobless rate is more than 20 percent and every third teenager drops out of school , that theory seems to hold especially true . mesut yatci , 22 , who works in a travel agency , said he could n't care less about politics . " whether turkey makes it into the eu or not isn ’ t important to me , " said yatci , who is of turkish origin and born in germany .
" i 'll vote for the party that really does something to fight unemployment and create more jobs , " he said . sonia phalnikar , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : merkel 's turkish delight chancellor candidate angela merkel has renewed her efforts to kibosh turkey 's bid to join the eu .

" ms. merkel 's life is not such that she can represent the experiences of the majority of women , " doris schröder-köpf , who has one biological and one adopted daughter , told the weekly newspaper die zeit . " they are busy trying to juggle a family and a career , or deciding whether to spend a few years at home after having a baby or wondering how best to bring up their children .
this is not angela merkel 's world , " she said . mrs. schröder-köpf said that merkel 's policies while she was family minister in kohl 's cabinet in the early 1990s " are to blame for the low birth rates we have today . " merkel recently conceded that she would not have achieved what she did in politics if she had had children , but sought to use that as an argument for her new policies . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election 2005 click here for dw-world 's 2005 election dossier .

the doha round of talks has stalled and officials are doubtful it can be revived . the task placed on lamy 's lap is so overwhelming that , according to one official , the frenchman would have to be " pascal zorro " to succeed .
in only three months a global trade summit in hong kong begins and the word amongst some close to the talks is , to put it gently , one of cautious criticism .
" i think we have to lower expectations because the talks have lagged , " us trade representative rob portman said .
summit about subsidies and tariffs when wto trade representatives meet in hong kong in december , lamy will assume a difficult legacy from his predecessor , thailand 's supachai panitchpakdi .
before taking office , lamy recently stated that he wanted an agreement to be reached at the end of the year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farm subsidies , particularly for the eu and the us , are one sticking point in the doha round " we all know the destination , it is the conclusion of the round with a crucially important stop at the end of the year in hong kong .
i will be 100 percent invested in this .
i will be , as soon as possible , meeting with the chairs of the different negotiating groups , " he said .
the passionate jogger will need endurance for the difficult agenda he faces , which includes slashing farm subsidies and liberalizing world trade markets .
in 2003 at cancun , mexico , the continuation of the doha round from 2001 ended in failure after the eu , the us , canada and japan faced intense opposition from the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- headed by then new member china together with brazil , india , south africa and 16 other countries .
lamy was the eu 's chief negotiator at cancun .
now , he must bring all the sides together and hammer out an agreement .
" pascal lamy will bring a new aggressiveness to the job , " portman said recently .
yet , no matter how skillfully the 58-year-old frenchman may negotiate , the will must be there on the part of wto members .
" he has no magic wand .
the bottom line is that there will only be progress if countries want there to be .
and it is not clear they do , " india 's trade ambassador , ujal singh bhatia , told reuters .
little power at his disposal the wto director-general has little executive power so diplomats are placing their hopes on his experience as the eu 's trade boss .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lower trade tariffs are another goal of the wto negotiations in hong kong exactly these close ties to europe lead groups critical of gloabalization , like attac , to believe that despite the lack of real authority , lamy will not work in the interests of developing countries .
whatever happens , all agree that an agreement , whether weak or strong , must be signed in december so that an end of 2006 deadline can be reached and doha can finally be put into force . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's lamy named new wto leader after a process lasting several months , pascal lamy has been appointed director-general of the world trade organization .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.09.2005 merkel and the female question großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is not exactly a feminist dream come true with less than three weeks to go to the elections , germany is wondering what it will mean to have its first woman chancellor .
angela merkel , however , is not promising a feminist or even a particularly feminine future . angela merkel has come a long way from her early days in politics when former chancellor helmut kohl referred to her as his " girl . "
and although the plainly dressed 51-year-old , now a chancellor candidate for the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is unlikely to bring gender into politics , her party is trying to capitalize on the fact that merkel is a woman . " we support her because she is a woman and as chancellor she will bring new perspectives and emotional intelligence to politics , " said emilia müller of the cdu women 's league at a meeting in berlin this week . " merkel has made it clear , women are no longer standing on the sidelines ; they have seized power .
we want the future to be female , and in many ways , " said another league official . feminists remain unconvinced the political left is distinctly skeptical that merkel will put women 's issues at the forefront of her reform plans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alice schwarzer does not believe that merkel will do much for women 's issues " she has not shown any enthusiasm for so-called woman 's politics , " germany 's best-known feminist , alice schwarzer , remarked recently . although merkel holds a commanding lead in the polls , they also show that the large percentage of voters who are still undecided ahead of the september 18 election are unlikely to be swayed for merkel simply because she is a woman . in interviews and speeches , merkel rarely misses an opportunity to mention the importance of the family and has promised to improve the plight of working mothers in a bid to raise germany 's low birth rate . but beyond that she has not courted the female vote , just as she has refused to play on her roots in former communist eastern germany . german iron lady ? merkel bristles at the inevitable comparisons with britain 's iron lady margaret thatcher , saying there are " limited " similarities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : limited similarity : margaret thatcher but like thatcher , merkel is a woman leading a conservative party and faces perhaps the added constraint of looking to govern a country that has only gradually shed the notion of women 's traditional role involving the so-called three k 's - kinder , küche and kirche -lrb- children , kitchen , church -rrb- . figures published by the electoral commission on wednesday showed that one third of candidates put up by all parties are women , but the greens and chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats are miles ahead of the christian union in terms of gender representation . schröder on wednesday at his party 's congress reached for the gender card , telling supporters that the policies of many of merkel 's closest aides on women 's issues " date from the 19th century . " criticism , woman to woman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doris schröder-köpf , the wife of the german chancellor , is highly critical of merkel schröder 's wife , on the other hand , dared what nobody else has so far and pointed out that , being childless , merkel did not know what she was talking about when she championed the plight of women . " ms. merkel 's life is not such that she can represent the experiences of the majority of women , " doris schröder-köpf , who has one biological and one adopted daughter , told the weekly newspaper die zeit . " they are busy trying to juggle a family and a career , or deciding whether to spend a few years at home after having a baby or wondering how best to bring up their children .
this is not angela merkel 's world , " she said . mrs. schröder-köpf said that merkel 's policies while she was family minister in kohl 's cabinet in the early 1990s " are to blame for the low birth rates we have today . " merkel recently conceded that she would not have achieved what she did in politics if she had had children , but sought to use that as an argument for her new policies . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election 2005 click here for dw-world 's 2005 election dossier .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 01.09.2005 television 's new buzz word großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : full speed ahead for technology , but not for most broadcasters the buzz word coursing through the international electronics fair ifa in berlin this weekend is hdtv .
but though the high-tech television is exciting some companies , german broadcasters remain hesitant . it 's being called a " quantum leap " and the next big development in television since the move from the black and white box .
the euphoria surrounding high-definition television can hardly be contained at this weekend 's consumer electronics fair ifa in berlin . " hdtv is the most important development in the world-wide television industry in the coming years , " said georg kofler , head of the resurgent digital pay-tv broadcaster premiere . the technology uses a 16:9 aspect ration which basically means that television images are shown in a far higher resolution than normal analog television , or dvds .
a host of major companies , like korea 's samsung and holland 's philips , have already brought several different hdtv models on the market .
major consumer electronics markets like the us and japan are already far ahead of germany and the rest of europe in adapting the new technology . cooperation to increase visibility ahead of the start of ifa , premiere announced a cooperative effort with philips and samsung and a long-term link-up with the discovery channel aimed at bringing the quality of hdtv programming to a wider audience . all 64 world cup games in germany this year will be shown on premiere in hdtv format .
beginning in november , germany 's only pay-tv broadcaster will introduce three different 24-hour hdtv channels into their channel list . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premiere viewers with hdtv televisions will get all the world cup action delivered to them in the high-definition format . prosiebensat.1 , recently bought up by the axel springer publishing house , plans to be on air with hdtv content even earlier .
they plan on broadcasting their prosieben and sat.1 channels in hdtv format beginning at the end of october . " hdtv is a quantum leap , " said ceo guillaume de posch . still too expensive but the rest of the german broadcasting landscape is not as excited .
the two major public stations , ard and zdf , said they plan on waiting longer with hdtv format , citing high costs and insufficient users . zdf said high-definition television will have to wait until germany 's homes make the switch from analog to digital , something they predict wo n't happen before 2010 .
rtl , europe 's largest broadcaster , said it will wait as well . " hdtv brings with it much higher costs , " said an rtl spokesman .
one television ceo estimated the broadcast cost 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 12,456 -rrb- an hour , according to the german daily handelsblatt . there is also the cost of the televisions themselves , which start at around 1,000 euros and can go as high as 5,000 euros .
in 2005 , fewer than 1 million sold and analysts do not expect to reach the one million mark before the end of 2006 . bildunterschrift : hdtv sets can cost upwards of 5,000 euros or more branch analysts expect hdtv sales to make up more than 10 percent of total sets sold only in 2008 .
" we 'll start planning when 10 to 15 percent of the viewers own hdtv , " said an rtl spokesperson . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german tv looks to us for salvation on tuesday , the us hit tv series “ desperate housewives ” hits the airwaves in germany .

but though the high-tech television is exciting some companies , german broadcasters remain hesitant . it 's being called a " quantum leap " and the next big development in television since the move from the black and white box .
the euphoria surrounding high-definition television can hardly be contained at this weekend 's consumer electronics fair ifa in berlin . " hdtv is the most important development in the world-wide television industry in the coming years , " said georg kofler , head of the resurgent digital pay-tv broadcaster premiere . the technology uses a 16:9 aspect ration which basically means that television images are shown in a far higher resolution than normal analog television , or dvds .
a host of major companies , like korea 's samsung and holland 's philips , have already brought several different hdtv models on the market .
major consumer electronics markets like the us and japan are already far ahead of germany and the rest of europe in adapting the new technology . cooperation to increase visibility ahead of the start of ifa , premiere announced a cooperative effort with philips and samsung and a long-term link-up with the discovery channel aimed at bringing the quality of hdtv programming to a wider audience . all 64 world cup games in germany this year will be shown on premiere in hdtv format .
beginning in november , germany 's only pay-tv broadcaster will introduce three different 24-hour hdtv channels into their channel list . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premiere viewers with hdtv televisions will get all the world cup action delivered to them in the high-definition format . prosiebensat.1 , recently bought up by the axel springer publishing house , plans to be on air with hdtv content even earlier .
they plan on broadcasting their prosieben and sat.1 channels in hdtv format beginning at the end of october . " hdtv is a quantum leap , " said ceo guillaume de posch . still too expensive but the rest of the german broadcasting landscape is not as excited .
the two major public stations , ard and zdf , said they plan on waiting longer with hdtv format , citing high costs and insufficient users . zdf said high-definition television will have to wait until germany 's homes make the switch from analog to digital , something they predict wo n't happen before 2010 .
rtl , europe 's largest broadcaster , said it will wait as well . " hdtv brings with it much higher costs , " said an rtl spokesman .
one television ceo estimated the broadcast cost 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 12,456 -rrb- an hour , according to the german daily handelsblatt . there is also the cost of the televisions themselves , which start at around 1,000 euros and can go as high as 5,000 euros .
in 2005 , fewer than 1 million sold and analysts do not expect to reach the one million mark before the end of 2006 . bildunterschrift : hdtv sets can cost upwards of 5,000 euros or more branch analysts expect hdtv sales to make up more than 10 percent of total sets sold only in 2008 .
" we 'll start planning when 10 to 15 percent of the viewers own hdtv , " said an rtl spokesperson . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german tv looks to us for salvation on tuesday , the us hit tv series “ desperate housewives ” hits the airwaves in germany .

but though the high-tech television is exciting some companies , german broadcasters remain hesitant . it 's being called a " quantum leap " and the next big development in television since the move from the black and white box .
the euphoria surrounding high-definition television can hardly be contained at this weekend 's consumer electronics fair ifa in berlin . " hdtv is the most important development in the world-wide television industry in the coming years , " said georg kofler , head of the resurgent digital pay-tv broadcaster premiere . the technology uses a 16:9 aspect ration which basically means that television images are shown in a far higher resolution than normal analog television , or dvds .
a host of major companies , like korea 's samsung and holland 's philips , have already brought several different hdtv models on the market .
major consumer electronics markets like the us and japan are already far ahead of germany and the rest of europe in adapting the new technology . cooperation to increase visibility ahead of the start of ifa , premiere announced a cooperative effort with philips and samsung and a long-term link-up with the discovery channel aimed at bringing the quality of hdtv programming to a wider audience . all 64 world cup games in germany this year will be shown on premiere in hdtv format .
beginning in november , germany 's only pay-tv broadcaster will introduce three different 24-hour hdtv channels into their channel list . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premiere viewers with hdtv televisions will get all the world cup action delivered to them in the high-definition format . prosiebensat.1 , recently bought up by the axel springer publishing house , plans to be on air with hdtv content even earlier .
they plan on broadcasting their prosieben and sat.1 channels in hdtv format beginning at the end of october . " hdtv is a quantum leap , " said ceo guillaume de posch . still too expensive but the rest of the german broadcasting landscape is not as excited .
the two major public stations , ard and zdf , said they plan on waiting longer with hdtv format , citing high costs and insufficient users . zdf said high-definition television will have to wait until germany 's homes make the switch from analog to digital , something they predict wo n't happen before 2010 .
rtl , europe 's largest broadcaster , said it will wait as well . " hdtv brings with it much higher costs , " said an rtl spokesman .
one television ceo estimated the broadcast cost 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 12,456 -rrb- an hour , according to the german daily handelsblatt . there is also the cost of the televisions themselves , which start at around 1,000 euros and can go as high as 5,000 euros .
in 2005 , fewer than 1 million sold and analysts do not expect to reach the one million mark before the end of 2006 . bildunterschrift : hdtv sets can cost upwards of 5,000 euros or more branch analysts expect hdtv sales to make up more than 10 percent of total sets sold only in 2008 .

" turkey is a key political issue , " said one british official ahead of the eu talks .
" we know that there are concerns , but that does n't change the fact the talks are going to start in october . " eu leaders gave the vast muslim state a green light last december to start entry talks despite its refusal to recognize the government of cyprus , which was among 10 countries that joined the eu last year . but its hopes of one day joining the bloc were dealt a severe blow in may when french and dutch voters - many citing opposition to turkish eu entry - sparked an unprecedented crisis by rejecting the eu constitution . cyprus tension surfaces again ankara fueled fresh concern after it appended a declaration to its signature of an amended customs accord with the enlarged eu in july , underlining that it still does not recognize cyprus .

but diplomats say france is still pushing for " more binding language " demanding that turkey recognize cyprus . eu diplomats said that the ministers were likely to issue a declaration making it clear that the customs union had to be implemented without discrimination by member states . " there will probably be a discussion tomorrow by ministers , probably on the basis of a text , " one said .

the doha round of talks has stalled and officials are doubtful it can be revived . the task placed on lamy 's lap is so overwhelming that , according to one official , the frenchman would have to be " pascal zorro " to succeed .
in only three months a global trade summit in hong kong begins and the word amongst some close to the talks is , to put it gently , one of cautious criticism .
" i think we have to lower expectations because the talks have lagged , " us trade representative rob portman said .
summit about subsidies and tariffs when wto trade representatives meet in hong kong in december , lamy will assume a difficult legacy from his predecessor , thailand 's supachai panitchpakdi .
before taking office , lamy recently stated that he wanted an agreement to be reached at the end of the year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farm subsidies , particularly for the eu and the us , are one sticking point in the doha round " we all know the destination , it is the conclusion of the round with a crucially important stop at the end of the year in hong kong .
i will be 100 percent invested in this .
i will be , as soon as possible , meeting with the chairs of the different negotiating groups , " he said .
the passionate jogger will need endurance for the difficult agenda he faces , which includes slashing farm subsidies and liberalizing world trade markets .
in 2003 at cancun , mexico , the continuation of the doha round from 2001 ended in failure after the eu , the us , canada and japan faced intense opposition from the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- headed by then new member china together with brazil , india , south africa and 16 other countries .
lamy was the eu 's chief negotiator at cancun .
now , he must bring all the sides together and hammer out an agreement .
" pascal lamy will bring a new aggressiveness to the job , " portman said recently .
yet , no matter how skillfully the 58-year-old frenchman may negotiate , the will must be there on the part of wto members .
" he has no magic wand .
the bottom line is that there will only be progress if countries want there to be .
and it is not clear they do , " india 's trade ambassador , ujal singh bhatia , told reuters .
little power at his disposal the wto director-general has little executive power so diplomats are placing their hopes on his experience as the eu 's trade boss .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lower trade tariffs are another goal of the wto negotiations in hong kong exactly these close ties to europe lead groups critical of gloabalization , like attac , to believe that despite the lack of real authority , lamy will not work in the interests of developing countries .
whatever happens , all agree that an agreement , whether weak or strong , must be signed in december so that an end of 2006 deadline can be reached and doha can finally be put into force . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's lamy named new wto leader after a process lasting several months , pascal lamy has been appointed director-general of the world trade organization .

angela merkel , however , is not promising a feminist or even a particularly feminine future . angela merkel has come a long way from her early days in politics when former chancellor helmut kohl referred to her as his " girl . "
and although the plainly dressed 51-year-old , now a chancellor candidate for the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is unlikely to bring gender into politics , her party is trying to capitalize on the fact that merkel is a woman . " we support her because she is a woman and as chancellor she will bring new perspectives and emotional intelligence to politics , " said emilia müller of the cdu women 's league at a meeting in berlin this week . " merkel has made it clear , women are no longer standing on the sidelines ; they have seized power .
we want the future to be female , and in many ways , " said another league official . feminists remain unconvinced the political left is distinctly skeptical that merkel will put women 's issues at the forefront of her reform plans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alice schwarzer does not believe that merkel will do much for women 's issues " she has not shown any enthusiasm for so-called woman 's politics , " germany 's best-known feminist , alice schwarzer , remarked recently . although merkel holds a commanding lead in the polls , they also show that the large percentage of voters who are still undecided ahead of the september 18 election are unlikely to be swayed for merkel simply because she is a woman . in interviews and speeches , merkel rarely misses an opportunity to mention the importance of the family and has promised to improve the plight of working mothers in a bid to raise germany 's low birth rate . but beyond that she has not courted the female vote , just as she has refused to play on her roots in former communist eastern germany . german iron lady ? merkel bristles at the inevitable comparisons with britain 's iron lady margaret thatcher , saying there are " limited " similarities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : limited similarity : margaret thatcher but like thatcher , merkel is a woman leading a conservative party and faces perhaps the added constraint of looking to govern a country that has only gradually shed the notion of women 's traditional role involving the so-called three k 's - kinder , küche and kirche -lrb- children , kitchen , church -rrb- . figures published by the electoral commission on wednesday showed that one third of candidates put up by all parties are women , but the greens and chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats are miles ahead of the christian union in terms of gender representation . schröder on wednesday at his party 's congress reached for the gender card , telling supporters that the policies of many of merkel 's closest aides on women 's issues " date from the 19th century . " criticism , woman to woman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doris schröder-köpf , the wife of the german chancellor , is highly critical of merkel schröder 's wife , on the other hand , dared what nobody else has so far and pointed out that , being childless , merkel did not know what she was talking about when she championed the plight of women . " ms. merkel 's life is not such that she can represent the experiences of the majority of women , " doris schröder-köpf , who has one biological and one adopted daughter , told the weekly newspaper die zeit . " they are busy trying to juggle a family and a career , or deciding whether to spend a few years at home after having a baby or wondering how best to bring up their children .
this is not angela merkel 's world , " she said . mrs. schröder-köpf said that merkel 's policies while she was family minister in kohl 's cabinet in the early 1990s " are to blame for the low birth rates we have today . " merkel recently conceded that she would not have achieved what she did in politics if she had had children , but sought to use that as an argument for her new policies . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election 2005 click here for dw-world 's 2005 election dossier .
" kohl 's girl " makes good angela merkel 's quiet but determined rise to the top of german politics shows that it 's not necessarily a disadvantage to be underestimated by political opponents or inner-party rivals .

" whoever wants to keep new orleans as a city has to build higher dams .
after the next hurricane or storm , even higher ones .
whoever wants to keep new orleans as a city , must accept the fact that every meter a dam is raised , the city will be in greater danger .
neither hurricanes nor a river like the mississippi can be controlled - particularly not in times of climate change .
humans may think they have the technology to conquer nature but that is a constitutive error of civilization , without which humans would not be what they are . "
" it is too much .
we are sick of catastrophes .
it is superfluous to argue what influence mankind has on natural catastrophes .
one thing is certain : there have always been extreme weather events , but now they happen in a more densely-populated world and the extent of the disaster is spread quickly through the mass media .
because of globalization , the catastrophe on the mississippi threatens the world 's economy .
the hurricane and flood destroyed economic goods and growth not only in the usa .
we also feel that the events affect us also .

spd presents election manifesto election 2005 -pipe- 01.09.2005 turkish-german vote anything but certain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social democrat müntefering gets chummy in kreuzberg german politicians are busy wooing turkish-germans .
but , disenchanted with both the conservatives ' anti-turkish rhetoric and the social democrats ' unpopular reforms , the group is proving politically unpredictable . in recent weeks , kreuzberg - berlin 's heavily turkish and alternative district , marked by a laid-back air , entrepreneurial spirit , and the smell of kebabs and lattes - has been witnessing a burst of activity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians in a turkish restaurant in kreuzberg as federal elections loom , politicians of all stripes have been dropping in on the colorful neighborhood 's numerous small shops and cafés , visiting kindergartens and schools where almost 90 percent of the children are of foreign origin . most kreuzbergers are unfazed by the spectacle . on a sunny morning this week , gülcan aydemir , a housewife and mother of three , who came to germany from turkey at the age of four , put her heavy shopping bags down in front of an election poster of ahmet iyidirli , the local social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- candidate . " never seen him before , " the 41-year-old said .
" it ’ s the same thing each time . the politicians only think of us turks when elections are around the corner . " turkish vote could prove decisive but politicians do have good reason to woo turkish-germans .
of the 2.6 million turks living in germany - the country 's biggest group of immigrants - an estimated 600,000 have been naturalized and are entitled to vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish grocers in cologne though that number may seem insignificant in a voting population of about 61.5 million , it is enough to tip the scales when the parties are neck-and-neck at the polls - as happened during the last elections in 2002 . " we had a really slim majority at the time and the few thousand turkish-german votes proved very valuable and helped us to win , " said ozan ceyhun , in charge of organizing a campaign to get the " foreign vote " for chancellor schröder 's spd . spd traditionally popular political preferences among germany 's turks have been clear-cut so far .
the large majority has traditionally voted for the spd .
according to one study , upwards of 65 percent now back the spd ; the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- enjoy support of around 9 percent . those political leanings are reflected in the german parliament , which currently has one turkish-german member each for the spd and the green party , but none from the cdu or the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor schröder , right with turkish prime minister erdogan dirk halm of the essen-based center for turkish studies traces the spd 's popularity among germany 's turks to the party 's working-class origins . " the first contact between the spd and many turks who came as guest workers to germany in the 1950s and 60s was through trade unions , and it was a strong political and cultural connection that lasted generations , " halm said . cdu 's turkey policy not popular however , the cdu does attract some turkish-germans , especially members of the business community , to its ranks .
according to some , the party 's traditional support of family values and business-friendly policies do have the potential to resonate with the turkish-german community . " most turks in germany are very conservative and the cdu would seem to be their natural choice .
but the cdu continues to turn them off with its anti-turkish politics and rhetoric , " özcan mutlu , a green party candidate from kreuzberg and a member of the berlin state parliament told spiegel online . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is strongly opposed to turkey 's eu bid this time seems to be no different .
the conservatives under the leadership of angela merkel have taken a vehement stance against turkey joining the european union , offering it a so-called " privileged partnership " instead . the position has predictably irked and further alienated many turks in germany , according to ozan ceyhun of the spd . " the thinking among turks is that ' if they -lrb- the cdu -rrb- do n't want my country of origin in the eu , then they do n't want me here in germany either . '
it 's definitely perceived as discriminatory , " ceyhun said . disillusioned by the spd too despite the obvious political preferences , experts warn that turkish-germans are far from having made up their minds about which box to check on the ballot on sept .
18 . many are said to be disillusioned with the spd on account of a new regulation in the naturalization law which has led to some 50,000 turkish-germans losing their german citizenship . hakki keskin , the first turkish-born german to be elected to the german parliament and who left the spd after 30 years and is now campaigning for the fledgling left party , said many were also " bitterly disappointed " by the spd 's " neo-liberal " social and economic reforms which have hit poorer turks . " the reforms are far removed from the social justice that the spd is supposed to stand for .
i 'm not the only one turning away from the party , " keskin said . jobs the crunch factor disenchantment with both the big mainstream political parties in germany may have made the turkish-germans politically unpredictable this election .
but in the end the crunch issues of jobs and economy will decide the vote , according to some . " so much has changed since the last general election .
work is the key concern now and the turkish community is particularly affected by unemployment , " said dirk halm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in kreuzberg , where the jobless rate is more than 20 percent and every third teenager drops out of school , that theory seems to hold especially true . mesut yatci , 22 , who works in a travel agency , said he could n't care less about politics . " whether turkey makes it into the eu or not isn ’ t important to me , " said yatci , who is of turkish origin and born in germany .

the doha round of talks has stalled and officials are doubtful it can be revived . the task placed on lamy 's lap is so overwhelming that , according to one official , the frenchman would have to be " pascal zorro " to succeed .
in only three months a global trade summit in hong kong begins and the word amongst some close to the talks is , to put it gently , one of cautious criticism .
" i think we have to lower expectations because the talks have lagged , " us trade representative rob portman said .
summit about subsidies and tariffs when wto trade representatives meet in hong kong in december , lamy will assume a difficult legacy from his predecessor , thailand 's supachai panitchpakdi .
before taking office , lamy recently stated that he wanted an agreement to be reached at the end of the year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farm subsidies , particularly for the eu and the us , are one sticking point in the doha round " we all know the destination , it is the conclusion of the round with a crucially important stop at the end of the year in hong kong .
i will be 100 percent invested in this .
i will be , as soon as possible , meeting with the chairs of the different negotiating groups , " he said .
the passionate jogger will need endurance for the difficult agenda he faces , which includes slashing farm subsidies and liberalizing world trade markets .
in 2003 at cancun , mexico , the continuation of the doha round from 2001 ended in failure after the eu , the us , canada and japan faced intense opposition from the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- headed by then new member china together with brazil , india , south africa and 16 other countries .
lamy was the eu 's chief negotiator at cancun .
now , he must bring all the sides together and hammer out an agreement .
" pascal lamy will bring a new aggressiveness to the job , " portman said recently .
yet , no matter how skillfully the 58-year-old frenchman may negotiate , the will must be there on the part of wto members .
" he has no magic wand .
the bottom line is that there will only be progress if countries want there to be .
and it is not clear they do , " india 's trade ambassador , ujal singh bhatia , told reuters .
little power at his disposal the wto director-general has little executive power so diplomats are placing their hopes on his experience as the eu 's trade boss .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lower trade tariffs are another goal of the wto negotiations in hong kong exactly these close ties to europe lead groups critical of gloabalization , like attac , to believe that despite the lack of real authority , lamy will not work in the interests of developing countries .
whatever happens , all agree that an agreement , whether weak or strong , must be signed in december so that an end of 2006 deadline can be reached and doha can finally be put into force . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's lamy named new wto leader after a process lasting several months , pascal lamy has been appointed director-general of the world trade organization .

spd presents election manifesto election 2005 -pipe- 01.09.2005 turkish-german vote anything but certain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social democrat müntefering gets chummy in kreuzberg german politicians are busy wooing turkish-germans .
but , disenchanted with both the conservatives ' anti-turkish rhetoric and the social democrats ' unpopular reforms , the group is proving politically unpredictable . in recent weeks , kreuzberg - berlin 's heavily turkish and alternative district , marked by a laid-back air , entrepreneurial spirit , and the smell of kebabs and lattes - has been witnessing a burst of activity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians in a turkish restaurant in kreuzberg as federal elections loom , politicians of all stripes have been dropping in on the colorful neighborhood 's numerous small shops and cafés , visiting kindergartens and schools where almost 90 percent of the children are of foreign origin . most kreuzbergers are unfazed by the spectacle . on a sunny morning this week , gülcan aydemir , a housewife and mother of three , who came to germany from turkey at the age of four , put her heavy shopping bags down in front of an election poster of ahmet iyidirli , the local social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- candidate . " never seen him before , " the 41-year-old said .
" it ’ s the same thing each time . the politicians only think of us turks when elections are around the corner . " turkish vote could prove decisive but politicians do have good reason to woo turkish-germans .
of the 2.6 million turks living in germany - the country 's biggest group of immigrants - an estimated 600,000 have been naturalized and are entitled to vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish grocers in cologne though that number may seem insignificant in a voting population of about 61.5 million , it is enough to tip the scales when the parties are neck-and-neck at the polls - as happened during the last elections in 2002 . " we had a really slim majority at the time and the few thousand turkish-german votes proved very valuable and helped us to win , " said ozan ceyhun , in charge of organizing a campaign to get the " foreign vote " for chancellor schröder 's spd . spd traditionally popular political preferences among germany 's turks have been clear-cut so far .
the large majority has traditionally voted for the spd .
according to one study , upwards of 65 percent now back the spd ; the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- enjoy support of around 9 percent . those political leanings are reflected in the german parliament , which currently has one turkish-german member each for the spd and the green party , but none from the cdu or the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor schröder , right with turkish prime minister erdogan dirk halm of the essen-based center for turkish studies traces the spd 's popularity among germany 's turks to the party 's working-class origins . " the first contact between the spd and many turks who came as guest workers to germany in the 1950s and 60s was through trade unions , and it was a strong political and cultural connection that lasted generations , " halm said . cdu 's turkey policy not popular however , the cdu does attract some turkish-germans , especially members of the business community , to its ranks .
according to some , the party 's traditional support of family values and business-friendly policies do have the potential to resonate with the turkish-german community . " most turks in germany are very conservative and the cdu would seem to be their natural choice .
but the cdu continues to turn them off with its anti-turkish politics and rhetoric , " özcan mutlu , a green party candidate from kreuzberg and a member of the berlin state parliament told spiegel online . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is strongly opposed to turkey 's eu bid this time seems to be no different .
the conservatives under the leadership of angela merkel have taken a vehement stance against turkey joining the european union , offering it a so-called " privileged partnership " instead . the position has predictably irked and further alienated many turks in germany , according to ozan ceyhun of the spd . " the thinking among turks is that ' if they -lrb- the cdu -rrb- do n't want my country of origin in the eu , then they do n't want me here in germany either . '
it 's definitely perceived as discriminatory , " ceyhun said . disillusioned by the spd too despite the obvious political preferences , experts warn that turkish-germans are far from having made up their minds about which box to check on the ballot on sept .
18 . many are said to be disillusioned with the spd on account of a new regulation in the naturalization law which has led to some 50,000 turkish-germans losing their german citizenship . hakki keskin , the first turkish-born german to be elected to the german parliament and who left the spd after 30 years and is now campaigning for the fledgling left party , said many were also " bitterly disappointed " by the spd 's " neo-liberal " social and economic reforms which have hit poorer turks . " the reforms are far removed from the social justice that the spd is supposed to stand for .

but , disenchanted with both the conservatives ' anti-turkish rhetoric and the social democrats ' unpopular reforms , the group is proving politically unpredictable . in recent weeks , kreuzberg - berlin 's heavily turkish and alternative district , marked by a laid-back air , entrepreneurial spirit , and the smell of kebabs and lattes - has been witnessing a burst of activity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians in a turkish restaurant in kreuzberg as federal elections loom , politicians of all stripes have been dropping in on the colorful neighborhood 's numerous small shops and cafés , visiting kindergartens and schools where almost 90 percent of the children are of foreign origin . most kreuzbergers are unfazed by the spectacle . on a sunny morning this week , gülcan aydemir , a housewife and mother of three , who came to germany from turkey at the age of four , put her heavy shopping bags down in front of an election poster of ahmet iyidirli , the local social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- candidate . " never seen him before , " the 41-year-old said .
" it ’ s the same thing each time . the politicians only think of us turks when elections are around the corner . " turkish vote could prove decisive but politicians do have good reason to woo turkish-germans .
of the 2.6 million turks living in germany - the country 's biggest group of immigrants - an estimated 600,000 have been naturalized and are entitled to vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish grocers in cologne though that number may seem insignificant in a voting population of about 61.5 million , it is enough to tip the scales when the parties are neck-and-neck at the polls - as happened during the last elections in 2002 . " we had a really slim majority at the time and the few thousand turkish-german votes proved very valuable and helped us to win , " said ozan ceyhun , in charge of organizing a campaign to get the " foreign vote " for chancellor schröder 's spd . spd traditionally popular political preferences among germany 's turks have been clear-cut so far .
the large majority has traditionally voted for the spd .
according to one study , upwards of 65 percent now back the spd ; the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- enjoy support of around 9 percent . those political leanings are reflected in the german parliament , which currently has one turkish-german member each for the spd and the green party , but none from the cdu or the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor schröder , right with turkish prime minister erdogan dirk halm of the essen-based center for turkish studies traces the spd 's popularity among germany 's turks to the party 's working-class origins . " the first contact between the spd and many turks who came as guest workers to germany in the 1950s and 60s was through trade unions , and it was a strong political and cultural connection that lasted generations , " halm said . cdu 's turkey policy not popular however , the cdu does attract some turkish-germans , especially members of the business community , to its ranks .
according to some , the party 's traditional support of family values and business-friendly policies do have the potential to resonate with the turkish-german community . " most turks in germany are very conservative and the cdu would seem to be their natural choice .
but the cdu continues to turn them off with its anti-turkish politics and rhetoric , " özcan mutlu , a green party candidate from kreuzberg and a member of the berlin state parliament told spiegel online . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is strongly opposed to turkey 's eu bid this time seems to be no different .
the conservatives under the leadership of angela merkel have taken a vehement stance against turkey joining the european union , offering it a so-called " privileged partnership " instead . the position has predictably irked and further alienated many turks in germany , according to ozan ceyhun of the spd . " the thinking among turks is that ' if they -lrb- the cdu -rrb- do n't want my country of origin in the eu , then they do n't want me here in germany either . '
it 's definitely perceived as discriminatory , " ceyhun said . disillusioned by the spd too despite the obvious political preferences , experts warn that turkish-germans are far from having made up their minds about which box to check on the ballot on sept .
18 . many are said to be disillusioned with the spd on account of a new regulation in the naturalization law which has led to some 50,000 turkish-germans losing their german citizenship . hakki keskin , the first turkish-born german to be elected to the german parliament and who left the spd after 30 years and is now campaigning for the fledgling left party , said many were also " bitterly disappointed " by the spd 's " neo-liberal " social and economic reforms which have hit poorer turks .

spd presents election manifesto election 2005 -pipe- 01.09.2005 turkish-german vote anything but certain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social democrat müntefering gets chummy in kreuzberg german politicians are busy wooing turkish-germans .
but , disenchanted with both the conservatives ' anti-turkish rhetoric and the social democrats ' unpopular reforms , the group is proving politically unpredictable . in recent weeks , kreuzberg - berlin 's heavily turkish and alternative district , marked by a laid-back air , entrepreneurial spirit , and the smell of kebabs and lattes - has been witnessing a burst of activity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians in a turkish restaurant in kreuzberg as federal elections loom , politicians of all stripes have been dropping in on the colorful neighborhood 's numerous small shops and cafés , visiting kindergartens and schools where almost 90 percent of the children are of foreign origin . most kreuzbergers are unfazed by the spectacle . on a sunny morning this week , gülcan aydemir , a housewife and mother of three , who came to germany from turkey at the age of four , put her heavy shopping bags down in front of an election poster of ahmet iyidirli , the local social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- candidate . " never seen him before , " the 41-year-old said .
" it ’ s the same thing each time . the politicians only think of us turks when elections are around the corner . " turkish vote could prove decisive but politicians do have good reason to woo turkish-germans .
of the 2.6 million turks living in germany - the country 's biggest group of immigrants - an estimated 600,000 have been naturalized and are entitled to vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish grocers in cologne though that number may seem insignificant in a voting population of about 61.5 million , it is enough to tip the scales when the parties are neck-and-neck at the polls - as happened during the last elections in 2002 . " we had a really slim majority at the time and the few thousand turkish-german votes proved very valuable and helped us to win , " said ozan ceyhun , in charge of organizing a campaign to get the " foreign vote " for chancellor schröder 's spd . spd traditionally popular political preferences among germany 's turks have been clear-cut so far .
the large majority has traditionally voted for the spd .
according to one study , upwards of 65 percent now back the spd ; the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- enjoy support of around 9 percent . those political leanings are reflected in the german parliament , which currently has one turkish-german member each for the spd and the green party , but none from the cdu or the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor schröder , right with turkish prime minister erdogan dirk halm of the essen-based center for turkish studies traces the spd 's popularity among germany 's turks to the party 's working-class origins . " the first contact between the spd and many turks who came as guest workers to germany in the 1950s and 60s was through trade unions , and it was a strong political and cultural connection that lasted generations , " halm said . cdu 's turkey policy not popular however , the cdu does attract some turkish-germans , especially members of the business community , to its ranks .
according to some , the party 's traditional support of family values and business-friendly policies do have the potential to resonate with the turkish-german community . " most turks in germany are very conservative and the cdu would seem to be their natural choice .
but the cdu continues to turn them off with its anti-turkish politics and rhetoric , " özcan mutlu , a green party candidate from kreuzberg and a member of the berlin state parliament told spiegel online . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is strongly opposed to turkey 's eu bid this time seems to be no different .
the conservatives under the leadership of angela merkel have taken a vehement stance against turkey joining the european union , offering it a so-called " privileged partnership " instead . the position has predictably irked and further alienated many turks in germany , according to ozan ceyhun of the spd . " the thinking among turks is that ' if they -lrb- the cdu -rrb- do n't want my country of origin in the eu , then they do n't want me here in germany either . '
it 's definitely perceived as discriminatory , " ceyhun said . disillusioned by the spd too despite the obvious political preferences , experts warn that turkish-germans are far from having made up their minds about which box to check on the ballot on sept .
18 . many are said to be disillusioned with the spd on account of a new regulation in the naturalization law which has led to some 50,000 turkish-germans losing their german citizenship . hakki keskin , the first turkish-born german to be elected to the german parliament and who left the spd after 30 years and is now campaigning for the fledgling left party , said many were also " bitterly disappointed " by the spd 's " neo-liberal " social and economic reforms which have hit poorer turks . " the reforms are far removed from the social justice that the spd is supposed to stand for .
i 'm not the only one turning away from the party , " keskin said . jobs the crunch factor disenchantment with both the big mainstream political parties in germany may have made the turkish-germans politically unpredictable this election .

dw-world : spd presents election manifesto election 2005 -pipe- 01.09.2005 turkish-german vote anything but certain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social democrat müntefering gets chummy in kreuzberg german politicians are busy wooing turkish-germans .
but , disenchanted with both the conservatives ' anti-turkish rhetoric and the social democrats ' unpopular reforms , the group is proving politically unpredictable . in recent weeks , kreuzberg - berlin 's heavily turkish and alternative district , marked by a laid-back air , entrepreneurial spirit , and the smell of kebabs and lattes - has been witnessing a burst of activity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians in a turkish restaurant in kreuzberg as federal elections loom , politicians of all stripes have been dropping in on the colorful neighborhood 's numerous small shops and cafés , visiting kindergartens and schools where almost 90 percent of the children are of foreign origin . most kreuzbergers are unfazed by the spectacle . on a sunny morning this week , gülcan aydemir , a housewife and mother of three , who came to germany from turkey at the age of four , put her heavy shopping bags down in front of an election poster of ahmet iyidirli , the local social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- candidate . " never seen him before , " the 41-year-old said .
" it ’ s the same thing each time . the politicians only think of us turks when elections are around the corner . " turkish vote could prove decisive but politicians do have good reason to woo turkish-germans .
of the 2.6 million turks living in germany - the country 's biggest group of immigrants - an estimated 600,000 have been naturalized and are entitled to vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish grocers in cologne though that number may seem insignificant in a voting population of about 61.5 million , it is enough to tip the scales when the parties are neck-and-neck at the polls - as happened during the last elections in 2002 . " we had a really slim majority at the time and the few thousand turkish-german votes proved very valuable and helped us to win , " said ozan ceyhun , in charge of organizing a campaign to get the " foreign vote " for chancellor schröder 's spd . spd traditionally popular political preferences among germany 's turks have been clear-cut so far .
the large majority has traditionally voted for the spd .
according to one study , upwards of 65 percent now back the spd ; the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- enjoy support of around 9 percent . those political leanings are reflected in the german parliament , which currently has one turkish-german member each for the spd and the green party , but none from the cdu or the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor schröder , right with turkish prime minister erdogan dirk halm of the essen-based center for turkish studies traces the spd 's popularity among germany 's turks to the party 's working-class origins . " the first contact between the spd and many turks who came as guest workers to germany in the 1950s and 60s was through trade unions , and it was a strong political and cultural connection that lasted generations , " halm said . cdu 's turkey policy not popular however , the cdu does attract some turkish-germans , especially members of the business community , to its ranks .
according to some , the party 's traditional support of family values and business-friendly policies do have the potential to resonate with the turkish-german community . " most turks in germany are very conservative and the cdu would seem to be their natural choice .
but the cdu continues to turn them off with its anti-turkish politics and rhetoric , " özcan mutlu , a green party candidate from kreuzberg and a member of the berlin state parliament told spiegel online . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is strongly opposed to turkey 's eu bid this time seems to be no different .
the conservatives under the leadership of angela merkel have taken a vehement stance against turkey joining the european union , offering it a so-called " privileged partnership " instead . the position has predictably irked and further alienated many turks in germany , according to ozan ceyhun of the spd . " the thinking among turks is that ' if they -lrb- the cdu -rrb- do n't want my country of origin in the eu , then they do n't want me here in germany either . '
it 's definitely perceived as discriminatory , " ceyhun said . disillusioned by the spd too despite the obvious political preferences , experts warn that turkish-germans are far from having made up their minds about which box to check on the ballot on sept .
18 . many are said to be disillusioned with the spd on account of a new regulation in the naturalization law which has led to some 50,000 turkish-germans losing their german citizenship . hakki keskin , the first turkish-born german to be elected to the german parliament and who left the spd after 30 years and is now campaigning for the fledgling left party , said many were also " bitterly disappointed " by the spd 's " neo-liberal " social and economic reforms which have hit poorer turks . " the reforms are far removed from the social justice that the spd is supposed to stand for .
i 'm not the only one turning away from the party , " keskin said . jobs the crunch factor disenchantment with both the big mainstream political parties in germany may have made the turkish-germans politically unpredictable this election .
but in the end the crunch issues of jobs and economy will decide the vote , according to some . " so much has changed since the last general election .
work is the key concern now and the turkish community is particularly affected by unemployment , " said dirk halm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in kreuzberg , where the jobless rate is more than 20 percent and every third teenager drops out of school , that theory seems to hold especially true . mesut yatci , 22 , who works in a travel agency , said he could n't care less about politics . " whether turkey makes it into the eu or not isn ’ t important to me , " said yatci , who is of turkish origin and born in germany .
" i 'll vote for the party that really does something to fight unemployment and create more jobs , " he said . sonia phalnikar , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : opinion : merkel 's turkish delight chancellor candidate angela merkel has renewed her efforts to kibosh turkey 's bid to join the eu .

accused of plotting to assassinate fidel castro , he faces possible deportation to venezuela , where he is wanted over a 1976 plane bombing .
the former cia operative says he faces torture if he is sent to venezuela .
his lawyer says he will now seek to remain in the us on the basis of his us military service .
another court hearing is scheduled for 26 september .
mr posada carriles alleged the cuban leader tried to have him killed in 1990 because of his previous work for venezuela as a security official .
the former cia operative was arrested in miami in may , and applied for asylum .
but he has now withdrawn his asylum plea , because he feared continued testimony in court might force him to reveal state secrets .
he will now apply for us citizenship , under a law applying to non-citizens who served honourably in the us military .
mr posada carriles served for one year in the early 1960s .
torture threat the 77-year-old has been appearing before an immigration judge in el paso , texas , to face charges of entering the us illegally .
if the court finds against him , he risks being extradited to venezuela .
venezuela accuses mr posada carriles of planning the bombing of the cubana airlines plane on a flight from caracas to havana in 1976 , an attack which left 73 people dead .
a naturalised venezuelan , he was twice acquitted by courts there of plotting to bomb the plane .
he escaped from a venezuelan prison in 1985 while awaiting a trial on appeal .
he told the court he spent 15 of the years since his escape living on a military base in el salvador and making frequent trips to guatemala .
the exile said he had been issued passports and travel documents with different names by the governments of those countries .
" we had identification cards the government would give us .
we could not use our names or the communists would kill us , " he said .
earlier a venezuelan lawyer , testifying on behalf of mr posada carriles , said he would be tortured if he were extradited .
joaquin chaffardet said it was also very likely caracas would send him to cuba .
the cuban government says mr posada carriles was behind a series of bombings of hotels in havana in 1997 .
fidel castro has said that he should be tried in venezuela , or in front of an international court .

president susilo bambang yudhoyono said late on wednesday that fuel aid , which costs the nation a fifth of its annual budget , would be reduced after october .
investors had been hoping for quicker action to ease the pressure put on state funds by record crude oil prices .
concerns about indonesia 's ability to finance the aid have hammered markets .
the rupiah has lost more than 10 % against the us dollar this year and tumbled in august , as indonesia was forced to sell the currency to buy dollars and pay for crude oil imports .
the slide in the currency was only stopped by an interest rate rise , and hopes that president yudhoyono would take decisive steps regarding the fuel subsidies .
' cure the disease ' however , analysts said that the measures announced on wednesday were vague and voiced concerns about a compensation package for the poor , which they said was state aid under a different name .
higher fuel prices will hit the nation 's most vulnerable people " what the government is doing is like giving medicine to lower the temperature but not to cure the disease , " said doddy arifianto , an analyst at bank mandiri .
the rupiah weakened on thursday and was trading at 10,700 against the us dollar , compared to wednesday 's close of 10,350 .
it hit a four-year low of 11,750 on tuesday ahead of the president 's announcement .
jakarta 's main stock index shed 2 % in early trading on thursday , before rebounding slightly .
subsidies are a politically sensitive subject in indonesia and president yudhoyono was careful to point out that any changes would not hurt the nation 's poorest .
fuel protests contributed to the downfall of former president suharto in 1998 .
in an effort to reassure voters , he said that nothing would happen until a system to compensate the poor was put in place .

beijing times reporter zhang jin questions whether the rising asian giant can make it in the more exclusive world of luxury goods .
european fashion houses are marching into china 's market " do n't waste your time , young man .
i promise you wo n't find anything made in china here , " says the owner of the fashionable cesari clothing store .
this is london 's new bond street - home to stores and boutiques selling some of the world 's top luxury goods .
bernini , hugo boss , d & g , gucci and velentino are all international brands you 'll encounter on a shopping trip .
in the nearby bernini store , a sales assistant patiently shows me a selection of expensive suits , all proudly labelled " made in italy " .
the story is the same elsewhere , where the high prices are matched by exclusive ' country of origin ' labels .
but where are the goods made in china - that emerging economic giant known for its booming textile industry ?
bargain basement a short walk through the crowds brings you to the popular east side of oxford street , where luxury fades away and prices drop dramatically .
undoubtedly china is a promising market , with a fast-growing gdp and a younger generation that is fast developing a taste for luxury goods michele norsa , valentino chief executive with many items costing just a few pounds , the stores here target mass market consumers , and many of the cheapest clothes are made in china .
but does the absence of " made in china " labels at the high-end of the market suggest that people in china do not buy luxury goods ?
definitely not .
major foreign luxury brands such as louis vuitton , prada and giorgio armani have staked their presence in china , and more ambitious plans are reportedly in the works .
" the first thing our chinese customers ask us when they walk in is ' what 's the most expensive thing in the store ? " ' one retailer told me at a conference in china recently .
younger generation according to the latest statistics by the china brand strategy association , about 175 million chinese people - or 13 % of the entire population - can now afford high-end luxury goods .
china wants to play catch-up in the world of luxury goods by 2010 , that number is estimated to reach 250 million , based on a 20 % year-on-year growth rate expected for the coming five years .
" undoubtedly china is a promising market , with a fast-growing gdp and a younger generation that is fast developing a taste for luxury goods , " says michele norsa , chief executive of valentino .
however , none of these brands are made in china .
and its seems companies have no intention in the near term of producing such luxury goods locally in china .
" customers may perceive products made there are low-cost and low-quality .
clients still want something that says ' made in italy ' or ' made in france ' , " says mr norsa .
luxury needs i asked the owner of the cesari store in new bond street if he would ever consider stocking his shelves with luxury items from china .
" yes , " he said .
" the problem is , where are the goods ? "
chinese companies need to work really hard to change the status quo dennis zhang , beijing-based researcher .
the urgency of adding more value to china 's goods sold on the international market has become more evident recently .
" just look at the backlog of chinese textiles piling up in the ports of eu countries , " says an official from chinese chamber of commerce for the import and export of textiles .
" if the products had greater value added and could not be produced by any other country , they would not have been as reluctant as they are now . "
but many chinese enterprises , which are still adapting to the government 's drive for an increasingly market-oriented economy , are not yet fully aware of the critical importance of having their own international brand names , analysts say .
" building such brand names needs lots of resources , including time , expertise and money , " says dennis zhang , a beijing-based researcher .
" the real problems is , even if they have the resources , they may not have the patience to pursue the idea for as long as it takes . "
status quo weak protection of global intellectual property rights - despite efforts by the chinese government to toughen up related laws - remains a constraint on brand building .
before a new brand becomes famous , its pirated versions - typically similar in appearance but inferior in quality - can make bigger fortunes .
that frustrates the confidence of china 's entrepreneurs , both at home and abroad .
" chinese companies need to work really hard to change the status quo , " says mr zhang .
some observers have suggested that budding chinese luxury companies need to target international markets , rather than rely on china 's domestic markets to develop their products .
the chinese have a saying that home-grown flowers do n't smell as good as those grown elsewhere , and there is a deep-rooted mindset that local brands are inferior .
but if overcoming this sounds like an uphill battle , some locally-established brands could make some headway .
paris beckons the highly regarded and expensive liquor maotai , for example , could find itself among china 's first luxury brands in foreign markets .
shanghai tang , the up-market seller of chinese-inspired apparel is little known on the chinese mainland , but is rapidly gaining popularity in hong kong .
meanwhile , some international luxury goods makers are reportedly considering moving production of goods such as casual wear and certain leather goods to china .
analysts have predicted that luxury goods made in china could grace the stylish boutiques of paris in a few decades .
expect the same in london 's new bond street .

beijing times reporter zhang jin questions whether the rising asian giant can make it in the more exclusive world of luxury goods .
european fashion houses are marching into china 's market " do n't waste your time , young man .
i promise you wo n't find anything made in china here , " says the owner of the fashionable cesari clothing store .
this is london 's new bond street - home to stores and boutiques selling some of the world 's top luxury goods .
bernini , hugo boss , d & g , gucci and velentino are all international brands you 'll encounter on a shopping trip .
in the nearby bernini store , a sales assistant patiently shows me a selection of expensive suits , all proudly labelled " made in italy " .
the story is the same elsewhere , where the high prices are matched by exclusive ' country of origin ' labels .
but where are the goods made in china - that emerging economic giant known for its booming textile industry ?
bargain basement a short walk through the crowds brings you to the popular east side of oxford street , where luxury fades away and prices drop dramatically .
undoubtedly china is a promising market , with a fast-growing gdp and a younger generation that is fast developing a taste for luxury goods michele norsa , valentino chief executive with many items costing just a few pounds , the stores here target mass market consumers , and many of the cheapest clothes are made in china .
but does the absence of " made in china " labels at the high-end of the market suggest that people in china do not buy luxury goods ?
definitely not .
major foreign luxury brands such as louis vuitton , prada and giorgio armani have staked their presence in china , and more ambitious plans are reportedly in the works .
" the first thing our chinese customers ask us when they walk in is ' what 's the most expensive thing in the store ? " ' one retailer told me at a conference in china recently .
younger generation according to the latest statistics by the china brand strategy association , about 175 million chinese people - or 13 % of the entire population - can now afford high-end luxury goods .
china wants to play catch-up in the world of luxury goods by 2010 , that number is estimated to reach 250 million , based on a 20 % year-on-year growth rate expected for the coming five years .
" undoubtedly china is a promising market , with a fast-growing gdp and a younger generation that is fast developing a taste for luxury goods , " says michele norsa , chief executive of valentino .
however , none of these brands are made in china .
and its seems companies have no intention in the near term of producing such luxury goods locally in china .
" customers may perceive products made there are low-cost and low-quality .
clients still want something that says ' made in italy ' or ' made in france ' , " says mr norsa .
luxury needs i asked the owner of the cesari store in new bond street if he would ever consider stocking his shelves with luxury items from china .
" yes , " he said .
" the problem is , where are the goods ? "
chinese companies need to work really hard to change the status quo dennis zhang , beijing-based researcher .
the urgency of adding more value to china 's goods sold on the international market has become more evident recently .
" just look at the backlog of chinese textiles piling up in the ports of eu countries , " says an official from chinese chamber of commerce for the import and export of textiles .
" if the products had greater value added and could not be produced by any other country , they would not have been as reluctant as they are now . "
but many chinese enterprises , which are still adapting to the government 's drive for an increasingly market-oriented economy , are not yet fully aware of the critical importance of having their own international brand names , analysts say .
" building such brand names needs lots of resources , including time , expertise and money , " says dennis zhang , a beijing-based researcher .
" the real problems is , even if they have the resources , they may not have the patience to pursue the idea for as long as it takes . "
status quo weak protection of global intellectual property rights - despite efforts by the chinese government to toughen up related laws - remains a constraint on brand building .
before a new brand becomes famous , its pirated versions - typically similar in appearance but inferior in quality - can make bigger fortunes .
that frustrates the confidence of china 's entrepreneurs , both at home and abroad .
" chinese companies need to work really hard to change the status quo , " says mr zhang .
some observers have suggested that budding chinese luxury companies need to target international markets , rather than rely on china 's domestic markets to develop their products .
the chinese have a saying that home-grown flowers do n't smell as good as those grown elsewhere , and there is a deep-rooted mindset that local brands are inferior .
but if overcoming this sounds like an uphill battle , some locally-established brands could make some headway .
paris beckons the highly regarded and expensive liquor maotai , for example , could find itself among china 's first luxury brands in foreign markets .
shanghai tang , the up-market seller of chinese-inspired apparel is little known on the chinese mainland , but is rapidly gaining popularity in hong kong .
meanwhile , some international luxury goods makers are reportedly considering moving production of goods such as casual wear and certain leather goods to china .
analysts have predicted that luxury goods made in china could grace the stylish boutiques of paris in a few decades .
expect the same in london 's new bond street .

she found not being able to speak at the trial of his killer added to her trauma .
" during that time i felt like a trapped , tortured animal muted by the system because i could n't say anything .
i could n't protest , " she said .
under the new plans , bereaved families would be able to address the court before sentencing - either in person or through a victim 's advocate .
ministers from the department for constitutional affairs say it will help families like ms pakeraah and it could help to fight crime .
but the charity victim support has reservations .
the group said , as a general rule , victims should not have to think about the sentencing process .
" they should be able to express to the world how the crime has affected them .
the problem is linking that to the sentencing process , " a spokesman said .

if victims became more involved , there would be a danger they would feel guilty later if they felt the punishment had been too harsh , he warned .

by anna browning bbc news families of murder victims in england and wales could be allowed to tell courts of their grief , under government plans .
the proposals have already provoked strong emotions on both sides of the debate .
giselle pakeraah 's 14-year-old son stefan was murdered 18 months ago .
she found not being able to speak at the trial of his killer added to her trauma .
" during that time i felt like a trapped , tortured animal muted by the system because i could n't say anything .
i could n't protest , " she said .
under the new plans , bereaved families would be able to address the court before sentencing - either in person or through a victim 's advocate .
ministers from the department for constitutional affairs say it will help families like ms pakeraah and it could help to fight crime .
but the charity victim support has reservations .
the group said , as a general rule , victims should not have to think about the sentencing process .
" they should be able to express to the world how the crime has affected them .
the problem is linking that to the sentencing process , " a spokesman said . "
they should be able to express to the world how the crime has affected them - the problem is linking that to the sentencing process " victim support " we have got a legal system whereby the state says it is the state 's job to assume responsibility for punishment . "
if victims became more involved , there would be a danger they would feel guilty later if they felt the punishment had been too harsh , he warned .
" whatever is proposed , you have to be careful to ensure that victims have a really clear picture on how their views are going to be taken by the court . "
' can of worms ' julian young , solicitor advocate for the westminster law partnership , said the proposals were a waste of public money .
he said the currently-used victim impact statement - a written statement from relatives taken by police and presented to the judge before sentencing - was just as effective .
" victims getting involved in sentencing is opening a can of worms .
many victims will look for revenge - it 's quite natural , " he said .
a government spokesman said it was the beginning of a consultation period , and welcomed views from across the spectrum .
" we do not expect everyone to agree with the government - that would n't be right . "
he also said the proposals were not meant to place victims at the heart of the sentencing process .
" we are not in any way interfering with sentencing .
what sentences judges pass on the back of the -lsb- victim -rsb- statements is a matter for them - i 'm sure they consider a great many things before passing sentence . "
refuting the defence rose dixon , of the charity support after murder and manslaughter -lrb- samm -rrb- , described the plans as " excellent " , saying she had been asking for such a change for a long time . "
i do n't think it 's about getting harsher sentences " rose dixon support after murder and manslaughter " one of the reasons why it would be helpful to the family is that the defence team goes out of their way to try and suggest that the victim almost asked to be murdered , " she said .
" the family will be able to refute what has been said in court by the defence team .
a lot of our families would like the opportunity to stand up in court and say ' that 's not true ' . "
she added : " i do n't think it 's about getting harsher sentences - what families tell us is they want justice . "

on offer is something for everyone , from multimedia capabilities of the sony psp to the quirky gameplay of the nintendo ds .
click the links below for our guide to the current crop of handheld consoles .
gizmondo gameboy advance sp playstation portable n-gage qd gameboy micro nintendo ds gizmondo packed full of gadgetry , the gizmondo is an enigmatic machine .
attempting the difficult job of breaking into a market where nintendo and sony already have such huge brand recognition , the gizmondo provides gamers with an alternative console choice .
gizmondo stats features : camera , bluetooth , gps , gprs , mp3 and video playback , sms , mms , gyroscopic controls processor : 400mhz arm9 memory : 64mb graphics : nvidia goforce 4500 with 1.25mb ram screen : 2.8 " weight : 181 grams what sets it apart is its comprehensive set of features .
it includes a camera , text messaging capabilities and gprs support , as well as bluetooth and mp3 and video playback .
without doubt the most interesting innovation is the in-built satellite navigation -lrb- gps -rrb- system .
as well as being able to find your position and local information , the gps system is also being used in games .
titles such as colors , for example , allow gamers to team up locally and battle other nearby gizmondo owners .
released in march 2005 , a week after the launch of the eagerly awaited nintendo ds , the gizmondo has yet to become as well respected as its sony and nintendo rivals .
this may have something to do with the console 's weak launch line-up , which boasted only a few well-known titles and no real must-have game .
recently , doubts over the manufacturer 's finances and an aborted us launch have cast doubts over the console 's future .
there is still hope for the gizmondo , however .
tiger telematics , who make the machine , have promised to launch one game a week to provide its owners with a constant flow of titles .
in addition , big name studios like electronic arts and microsoft have agreed to develop games for the platform .
with the right games making use of the gizmondo 's extensive feature set , there is definite potential for the console to provide a genuine alternative to sony or nintendo .
return to top game boy advance sp the latest in nintendo 's game boy line , the game boy advance -lrb- gba -rrb- sp is a refined version of the original gba .
gba sp stats processor : 16.8mhz arm7 memory : 288kb screen : 2.9 " weight : 143 grams building on the popularity and fanbase of the original console , the gba sp can play any gba or gameboy game , giving it an impressive library of titles with which other handhelds find it hard to compete .
the machine , which was released in march 2003 , is now beginning to show its age .
although the number of games available keeps people playing , the impressive graphics of new games on platforms such as the nintendo ds and psp have tempted gamers away from the console in recent months .
the gba sp has seen some high quality titles during its lifetime , with old gameboy staples such as tetris featuring alongside more recent hits like advance wars and wario ware inc .
with the release of the gameboy micro , which is based on the same technology and will play the same games , the sp seems set to go into well-earned retirement .
return to top playstation portable this year 's most anticipated gaming release in the uk , the playstation portable -lrb- psp -rrb- has been on sale in japan since december 2004 and in the us since march this year .
psp stats features : wi-fi , mp3 and video playback , web browser , usb 2.0 processor : 333mhz mips r4200 memory : 32 mb graphics : 166mhz gpu with 2 mb ram screen : 4.3 " widescreen weight : 260 grams psp 's european debut sony says it delayed the european launch because they wanted to make sure they had enough to fill the shelves .
the figures back that up ; in the first two days of sales alone in the us , more than 500,000 consoles were sold .
building on the success of the playstation 2 console , the psp boasts some impressive specifications .
many launch titles make use of its power to deliver some of the most impressive graphics ever seen on a handheld console .
this , combined with the fact that titles like medievil : resurrection and wipeout pure , are based on already successful franchises , will help ensure the psp 's rapid take-up .
but sony is not focusing purely on gaming with the psp .
alongside its main processor is a dedicated multimedia chip to deal with playing high resolution video on the psp 's widescreen display .
sony has persuaded film studios to release dvd titles on universal media discs -lrb- umd -rrb- , which the psp uses to store games .
this turns the psp into a portable dvd player , provided you can find the film you want in umd format .
films and music can also be played from a sony memory stick , though a short battery life of about three hours can be an issue .
additionally , the console is equipped with wi-fi , and the software has been updated to include a web browser allowing access to the internet .
return to top n-gage qd there have been games on mobile phones since the late 1990s , but nokia 's n-gage is so far the only attempt to explicitly combine a game console and a mobile into one device .
n-gage qd stats features : voice calls , gprs , sms , mms , bluetooth processor : 104mhz arm4t memory : 3.4 mb screen : 2.1 " weight : 133 grams the n-gage qd is a redesign of the original n-gage , and was released in june 2004 .
the specifications of the machine have changed little , but the phone itself has been redesigned to make it more usable , and to address some of the problems which users complained of in the earlier model .
the result is a much nicer and more compact package , with more sensible positioning of microphone and speakers and less hassle required to change games .
though the original titles available for the system back in 2003 were disappointing , many which have launched since have been well received , such as fifa soccer 2005 , worms world party and the sims : busting out .
in other respects the qd is less impressive .
nokia has disabled mp3 playback on the new device , as well as removing the fm radio , at a time when more and more people are beginning to see their phones as valid multimedia devices .
the lack of modern features like a camera and push-to-talk put the n-gage qd at a distinct disadvantage compared to newer mobile phones .
return to top gameboy micro while the nintendo ds is designed to appeal to gamers who want new experiences from their consoles , the gameboy micro is aimed at an entirely different market : the ipod generation .
gameboy micro stats features : customisable looks processor : 16.8mhz arm7 memory : 288kb screen : 2 " weight : 85 grams aware that current consoles have a tendency to look clunky and gadgety to new users , the gameboy micro is nintendo 's attempt to emulate apple and nokia in making gadgets which are also fashion accessories .
the gameboy micro weighs about the same as a phone , is roughly the size of an ipod , and comes with customisable colour front covers .
despite this it is still a competent gaming machine , built on the model of the successful gameboy advance -lrb- gba -rrb- .
this brings with it not only recognisable features , but also a formidable host of games to accompany its launch .
like the gameboy advance sp , the gameboy micro can play any gba game , which includes nintendo favourites such as super mario world as well as third party hits such as the sims .
presumably to cut down the size of the console , nintendo has however decided to drop support for original game boy games .
whether nintendo will manage to introduce a new wave of unlikely gamers to portable consoles with the gameboy micro is uncertain .
equally , current gba owners may feel that buying yet another redesign of the same product is not a tempting prospect given the arrival of the nintendo ds and the psp .
the micro is due to go on sale in the us in september , with europe following in november .
return to top nintendo ds the nintendo ds ships without many of the gadgets which are taken for granted in modern consoles .
it can not play video or mp3s , browse websites or make phone calls .
rather than being an oversight , however , this is part of nintendo 's plan to create a pure and innovative gaming handheld .
nintendo ds stats features : touch screen in addition to normal screen , microphone , wi-fi , plays gameboy advance games processor : 67mhz arm9 and 33mhz arm7 memory : 4mb screen : 2 x 3 " weight : 275 grams central to this is the ds 's most striking feature ; its touch screen , which sits alongside a second , traditional display .
this allows game developers to devise new ways for players to interact with the system , with often highly successful results .
games for the ds have included sections where the user must draw fluffy clouds to stop baby mario from hitting the floor .
in the upcoming nintendogs , players use the touch screen to stroke their virtual pets .
far from being a gimmick , the addition of a touch screen and microphone to the standard handheld console template has meant that nintendo can encourage millions of gameboy owners to purchase another console .
they have been careful to distance the ds from the gameboy line , calling it a " third pillar " alongside the gameboy advance and gamecube .
nintendo have further innovations in store for the console , including a scheme to provide wi-fi hotspots .
this would increase the range of the console 's multiplayer capabilities , allowing gamers to play with other users at hotspots around the world .
whether the ds 's position as leader of the handheld pack remains intact when the psp launches in the uk is yet to be seen .
the success of the next generation handhelds will depend to a great extent on whether they can develop a library of decent games to entice new gamers along .

sony has persuaded film studios to release dvd titles on universal media discs -lrb- umd -rrb- , which the psp uses to store games .
this turns the psp into a portable dvd player , provided you can find the film you want in umd format .
films and music can also be played from a sony memory stick , though a short battery life of about three hours can be an issue .
additionally , the console is equipped with wi-fi , and the software has been updated to include a web browser allowing access to the internet .
return to top n-gage qd there have been games on mobile phones since the late 1990s , but nokia 's n-gage is so far the only attempt to explicitly combine a game console and a mobile into one device .
n-gage qd stats features : voice calls , gprs , sms , mms , bluetooth processor : 104mhz arm4t memory : 3.4 mb screen : 2.1 " weight : 133 grams the n-gage qd is a redesign of the original n-gage , and was released in june 2004 .
the specifications of the machine have changed little , but the phone itself has been redesigned to make it more usable , and to address some of the problems which users complained of in the earlier model .
the result is a much nicer and more compact package , with more sensible positioning of microphone and speakers and less hassle required to change games .
though the original titles available for the system back in 2003 were disappointing , many which have launched since have been well received , such as fifa soccer 2005 , worms world party and the sims : busting out .
in other respects the qd is less impressive .
nokia has disabled mp3 playback on the new device , as well as removing the fm radio , at a time when more and more people are beginning to see their phones as valid multimedia devices .
the lack of modern features like a camera and push-to-talk put the n-gage qd at a distinct disadvantage compared to newer mobile phones .
return to top gameboy micro while the nintendo ds is designed to appeal to gamers who want new experiences from their consoles , the gameboy micro is aimed at an entirely different market : the ipod generation .
gameboy micro stats features : customisable looks processor : 16.8mhz arm7 memory : 288kb screen : 2 " weight : 85 grams aware that current consoles have a tendency to look clunky and gadgety to new users , the gameboy micro is nintendo 's attempt to emulate apple and nokia in making gadgets which are also fashion accessories .
the gameboy micro weighs about the same as a phone , is roughly the size of an ipod , and comes with customisable colour front covers .
despite this it is still a competent gaming machine , built on the model of the successful gameboy advance -lrb- gba -rrb- .
this brings with it not only recognisable features , but also a formidable host of games to accompany its launch .
like the gameboy advance sp , the gameboy micro can play any gba game , which includes nintendo favourites such as super mario world as well as third party hits such as the sims .
presumably to cut down the size of the console , nintendo has however decided to drop support for original game boy games .
whether nintendo will manage to introduce a new wave of unlikely gamers to portable consoles with the gameboy micro is uncertain .
equally , current gba owners may feel that buying yet another redesign of the same product is not a tempting prospect given the arrival of the nintendo ds and the psp .
the micro is due to go on sale in the us in september , with europe following in november .
return to top nintendo ds the nintendo ds ships without many of the gadgets which are taken for granted in modern consoles .
it can not play video or mp3s , browse websites or make phone calls .
rather than being an oversight , however , this is part of nintendo 's plan to create a pure and innovative gaming handheld .
nintendo ds stats features : touch screen in addition to normal screen , microphone , wi-fi , plays gameboy advance games processor : 67mhz arm9 and 33mhz arm7 memory : 4mb screen : 2 x 3 " weight : 275 grams central to this is the ds 's most striking feature ; its touch screen , which sits alongside a second , traditional display .
this allows game developers to devise new ways for players to interact with the system , with often highly successful results .
games for the ds have included sections where the user must draw fluffy clouds to stop baby mario from hitting the floor .
in the upcoming nintendogs , players use the touch screen to stroke their virtual pets .
far from being a gimmick , the addition of a touch screen and microphone to the standard handheld console template has meant that nintendo can encourage millions of gameboy owners to purchase another console .
they have been careful to distance the ds from the gameboy line , calling it a " third pillar " alongside the gameboy advance and gamecube .
nintendo have further innovations in store for the console , including a scheme to provide wi-fi hotspots .
this would increase the range of the console 's multiplayer capabilities , allowing gamers to play with other users at hotspots around the world .
whether the ds 's position as leader of the handheld pack remains intact when the psp launches in the uk is yet to be seen .
the success of the next generation handhelds will depend to a great extent on whether they can develop a library of decent games to entice new gamers along .

on offer is something for everyone , from multimedia capabilities of the sony psp to the quirky gameplay of the nintendo ds .
click the links below for our guide to the current crop of handheld consoles .
gizmondo gameboy advance sp playstation portable n-gage qd gameboy micro nintendo ds gizmondo packed full of gadgetry , the gizmondo is an enigmatic machine .
attempting the difficult job of breaking into a market where nintendo and sony already have such huge brand recognition , the gizmondo provides gamers with an alternative console choice .
gizmondo stats features : camera , bluetooth , gps , gprs , mp3 and video playback , sms , mms , gyroscopic controls processor : 400mhz arm9 memory : 64mb graphics : nvidia goforce 4500 with 1.25mb ram screen : 2.8 " weight : 181 grams what sets it apart is its comprehensive set of features .
it includes a camera , text messaging capabilities and gprs support , as well as bluetooth and mp3 and video playback .
without doubt the most interesting innovation is the in-built satellite navigation -lrb- gps -rrb- system .
as well as being able to find your position and local information , the gps system is also being used in games .
titles such as colors , for example , allow gamers to team up locally and battle other nearby gizmondo owners .
released in march 2005 , a week after the launch of the eagerly awaited nintendo ds , the gizmondo has yet to become as well respected as its sony and nintendo rivals .
this may have something to do with the console 's weak launch line-up , which boasted only a few well-known titles and no real must-have game .
recently , doubts over the manufacturer 's finances and an aborted us launch have cast doubts over the console 's future .
there is still hope for the gizmondo , however .
tiger telematics , who make the machine , have promised to launch one game a week to provide its owners with a constant flow of titles .
in addition , big name studios like electronic arts and microsoft have agreed to develop games for the platform .
with the right games making use of the gizmondo 's extensive feature set , there is definite potential for the console to provide a genuine alternative to sony or nintendo .
return to top game boy advance sp the latest in nintendo 's game boy line , the game boy advance -lrb- gba -rrb- sp is a refined version of the original gba .
gba sp stats processor : 16.8mhz arm7 memory : 288kb screen : 2.9 " weight : 143 grams building on the popularity and fanbase of the original console , the gba sp can play any gba or gameboy game , giving it an impressive library of titles with which other handhelds find it hard to compete .
the machine , which was released in march 2003 , is now beginning to show its age .
although the number of games available keeps people playing , the impressive graphics of new games on platforms such as the nintendo ds and psp have tempted gamers away from the console in recent months .
the gba sp has seen some high quality titles during its lifetime , with old gameboy staples such as tetris featuring alongside more recent hits like advance wars and wario ware inc .
with the release of the gameboy micro , which is based on the same technology and will play the same games , the sp seems set to go into well-earned retirement .
return to top playstation portable this year 's most anticipated gaming release in the uk , the playstation portable -lrb- psp -rrb- has been on sale in japan since december 2004 and in the us since march this year .
psp stats features : wi-fi , mp3 and video playback , web browser , usb 2.0 processor : 333mhz mips r4200 memory : 32 mb graphics : 166mhz gpu with 2 mb ram screen : 4.3 " widescreen weight : 260 grams psp 's european debut sony says it delayed the european launch because they wanted to make sure they had enough to fill the shelves .
the figures back that up ; in the first two days of sales alone in the us , more than 500,000 consoles were sold .
building on the success of the playstation 2 console , the psp boasts some impressive specifications .
many launch titles make use of its power to deliver some of the most impressive graphics ever seen on a handheld console .
this , combined with the fact that titles like medievil : resurrection and wipeout pure , are based on already successful franchises , will help ensure the psp 's rapid take-up .

psp stats features : wi-fi , mp3 and video playback , web browser , usb 2.0 processor : 333mhz mips r4200 memory : 32 mb graphics : 166mhz gpu with 2 mb ram screen : 4.3 " widescreen weight : 260 grams psp 's european debut sony says it delayed the european launch because they wanted to make sure they had enough to fill the shelves .
the figures back that up ; in the first two days of sales alone in the us , more than 500,000 consoles were sold .
building on the success of the playstation 2 console , the psp boasts some impressive specifications .
many launch titles make use of its power to deliver some of the most impressive graphics ever seen on a handheld console .
this , combined with the fact that titles like medievil : resurrection and wipeout pure , are based on already successful franchises , will help ensure the psp 's rapid take-up .
but sony is not focusing purely on gaming with the psp .
alongside its main processor is a dedicated multimedia chip to deal with playing high resolution video on the psp 's widescreen display .
sony has persuaded film studios to release dvd titles on universal media discs -lrb- umd -rrb- , which the psp uses to store games .
this turns the psp into a portable dvd player , provided you can find the film you want in umd format .
films and music can also be played from a sony memory stick , though a short battery life of about three hours can be an issue .
additionally , the console is equipped with wi-fi , and the software has been updated to include a web browser allowing access to the internet .
return to top n-gage qd there have been games on mobile phones since the late 1990s , but nokia 's n-gage is so far the only attempt to explicitly combine a game console and a mobile into one device .
n-gage qd stats features : voice calls , gprs , sms , mms , bluetooth processor : 104mhz arm4t memory : 3.4 mb screen : 2.1 " weight : 133 grams the n-gage qd is a redesign of the original n-gage , and was released in june 2004 .
the specifications of the machine have changed little , but the phone itself has been redesigned to make it more usable , and to address some of the problems which users complained of in the earlier model .
the result is a much nicer and more compact package , with more sensible positioning of microphone and speakers and less hassle required to change games .
though the original titles available for the system back in 2003 were disappointing , many which have launched since have been well received , such as fifa soccer 2005 , worms world party and the sims : busting out .
in other respects the qd is less impressive .
nokia has disabled mp3 playback on the new device , as well as removing the fm radio , at a time when more and more people are beginning to see their phones as valid multimedia devices .
the lack of modern features like a camera and push-to-talk put the n-gage qd at a distinct disadvantage compared to newer mobile phones .
return to top gameboy micro while the nintendo ds is designed to appeal to gamers who want new experiences from their consoles , the gameboy micro is aimed at an entirely different market : the ipod generation .
gameboy micro stats features : customisable looks processor : 16.8mhz arm7 memory : 288kb screen : 2 " weight : 85 grams aware that current consoles have a tendency to look clunky and gadgety to new users , the gameboy micro is nintendo 's attempt to emulate apple and nokia in making gadgets which are also fashion accessories .
the gameboy micro weighs about the same as a phone , is roughly the size of an ipod , and comes with customisable colour front covers .
despite this it is still a competent gaming machine , built on the model of the successful gameboy advance -lrb- gba -rrb- .
this brings with it not only recognisable features , but also a formidable host of games to accompany its launch .
like the gameboy advance sp , the gameboy micro can play any gba game , which includes nintendo favourites such as super mario world as well as third party hits such as the sims .
presumably to cut down the size of the console , nintendo has however decided to drop support for original game boy games .
whether nintendo will manage to introduce a new wave of unlikely gamers to portable consoles with the gameboy micro is uncertain .
equally , current gba owners may feel that buying yet another redesign of the same product is not a tempting prospect given the arrival of the nintendo ds and the psp .
the micro is due to go on sale in the us in september , with europe following in november .
return to top nintendo ds the nintendo ds ships without many of the gadgets which are taken for granted in modern consoles .
it can not play video or mp3s , browse websites or make phone calls .
rather than being an oversight , however , this is part of nintendo 's plan to create a pure and innovative gaming handheld .
nintendo ds stats features : touch screen in addition to normal screen , microphone , wi-fi , plays gameboy advance games processor : 67mhz arm9 and 33mhz arm7 memory : 4mb screen : 2 x 3 " weight : 275 grams central to this is the ds 's most striking feature ; its touch screen , which sits alongside a second , traditional display .
this allows game developers to devise new ways for players to interact with the system , with often highly successful results .
games for the ds have included sections where the user must draw fluffy clouds to stop baby mario from hitting the floor .
in the upcoming nintendogs , players use the touch screen to stroke their virtual pets .
far from being a gimmick , the addition of a touch screen and microphone to the standard handheld console template has meant that nintendo can encourage millions of gameboy owners to purchase another console .
they have been careful to distance the ds from the gameboy line , calling it a " third pillar " alongside the gameboy advance and gamecube .
nintendo have further innovations in store for the console , including a scheme to provide wi-fi hotspots .
this would increase the range of the console 's multiplayer capabilities , allowing gamers to play with other users at hotspots around the world .
whether the ds 's position as leader of the handheld pack remains intact when the psp launches in the uk is yet to be seen .
the success of the next generation handhelds will depend to a great extent on whether they can develop a library of decent games to entice new gamers along .

gizmondo gameboy advance sp playstation portable n-gage qd gameboy micro nintendo ds gizmondo packed full of gadgetry , the gizmondo is an enigmatic machine .
attempting the difficult job of breaking into a market where nintendo and sony already have such huge brand recognition , the gizmondo provides gamers with an alternative console choice .

it includes a camera , text messaging capabilities and gprs support , as well as bluetooth and mp3 and video playback .
without doubt the most interesting innovation is the in-built satellite navigation -lrb- gps -rrb- system .
as well as being able to find your position and local information , the gps system is also being used in games .
titles such as colors , for example , allow gamers to team up locally and battle other nearby gizmondo owners .
released in march 2005 , a week after the launch of the eagerly awaited nintendo ds , the gizmondo has yet to become as well respected as its sony and nintendo rivals .
this may have something to do with the console 's weak launch line-up , which boasted only a few well-known titles and no real must-have game .
recently , doubts over the manufacturer 's finances and an aborted us launch have cast doubts over the console 's future .
there is still hope for the gizmondo , however .
tiger telematics , who make the machine , have promised to launch one game a week to provide its owners with a constant flow of titles .
in addition , big name studios like electronic arts and microsoft have agreed to develop games for the platform .

the machine , which was released in march 2003 , is now beginning to show its age .
although the number of games available keeps people playing , the impressive graphics of new games on platforms such as the nintendo ds and psp have tempted gamers away from the console in recent months .
the gba sp has seen some high quality titles during its lifetime , with old gameboy staples such as tetris featuring alongside more recent hits like advance wars and wario ware inc .

the machine , which was released in march 2003 , is now beginning to show its age .
although the number of games available keeps people playing , the impressive graphics of new games on platforms such as the nintendo ds and psp have tempted gamers away from the console in recent months .
the gba sp has seen some high quality titles during its lifetime , with old gameboy staples such as tetris featuring alongside more recent hits like advance wars and wario ware inc .
with the release of the gameboy micro , which is based on the same technology and will play the same games , the sp seems set to go into well-earned retirement .
return to top playstation portable this year 's most anticipated gaming release in the uk , the playstation portable -lrb- psp -rrb- has been on sale in japan since december 2004 and in the us since march this year .
psp stats features : wi-fi , mp3 and video playback , web browser , usb 2.0 processor : 333mhz mips r4200 memory : 32 mb graphics : 166mhz gpu with 2 mb ram screen : 4.3 " widescreen weight : 260 grams psp 's european debut sony says it delayed the european launch because they wanted to make sure they had enough to fill the shelves .
the figures back that up ; in the first two days of sales alone in the us , more than 500,000 consoles were sold .
building on the success of the playstation 2 console , the psp boasts some impressive specifications .
many launch titles make use of its power to deliver some of the most impressive graphics ever seen on a handheld console .
this , combined with the fact that titles like medievil : resurrection and wipeout pure , are based on already successful franchises , will help ensure the psp 's rapid take-up .
but sony is not focusing purely on gaming with the psp .
alongside its main processor is a dedicated multimedia chip to deal with playing high resolution video on the psp 's widescreen display .
sony has persuaded film studios to release dvd titles on universal media discs -lrb- umd -rrb- , which the psp uses to store games .
this turns the psp into a portable dvd player , provided you can find the film you want in umd format .
films and music can also be played from a sony memory stick , though a short battery life of about three hours can be an issue .
additionally , the console is equipped with wi-fi , and the software has been updated to include a web browser allowing access to the internet .
return to top n-gage qd there have been games on mobile phones since the late 1990s , but nokia 's n-gage is so far the only attempt to explicitly combine a game console and a mobile into one device .
n-gage qd stats features : voice calls , gprs , sms , mms , bluetooth processor : 104mhz arm4t memory : 3.4 mb screen : 2.1 " weight : 133 grams the n-gage qd is a redesign of the original n-gage , and was released in june 2004 .
the specifications of the machine have changed little , but the phone itself has been redesigned to make it more usable , and to address some of the problems which users complained of in the earlier model .
the result is a much nicer and more compact package , with more sensible positioning of microphone and speakers and less hassle required to change games .
though the original titles available for the system back in 2003 were disappointing , many which have launched since have been well received , such as fifa soccer 2005 , worms world party and the sims : busting out .
in other respects the qd is less impressive .
nokia has disabled mp3 playback on the new device , as well as removing the fm radio , at a time when more and more people are beginning to see their phones as valid multimedia devices .
the lack of modern features like a camera and push-to-talk put the n-gage qd at a distinct disadvantage compared to newer mobile phones .
return to top gameboy micro while the nintendo ds is designed to appeal to gamers who want new experiences from their consoles , the gameboy micro is aimed at an entirely different market : the ipod generation .
gameboy micro stats features : customisable looks processor : 16.8mhz arm7 memory : 288kb screen : 2 " weight : 85 grams aware that current consoles have a tendency to look clunky and gadgety to new users , the gameboy micro is nintendo 's attempt to emulate apple and nokia in making gadgets which are also fashion accessories .
the gameboy micro weighs about the same as a phone , is roughly the size of an ipod , and comes with customisable colour front covers .
despite this it is still a competent gaming machine , built on the model of the successful gameboy advance -lrb- gba -rrb- .
this brings with it not only recognisable features , but also a formidable host of games to accompany its launch .
like the gameboy advance sp , the gameboy micro can play any gba game , which includes nintendo favourites such as super mario world as well as third party hits such as the sims .
presumably to cut down the size of the console , nintendo has however decided to drop support for original game boy games .
whether nintendo will manage to introduce a new wave of unlikely gamers to portable consoles with the gameboy micro is uncertain .
equally , current gba owners may feel that buying yet another redesign of the same product is not a tempting prospect given the arrival of the nintendo ds and the psp .
the micro is due to go on sale in the us in september , with europe following in november .
return to top nintendo ds the nintendo ds ships without many of the gadgets which are taken for granted in modern consoles .
it can not play video or mp3s , browse websites or make phone calls .
rather than being an oversight , however , this is part of nintendo 's plan to create a pure and innovative gaming handheld .
nintendo ds stats features : touch screen in addition to normal screen , microphone , wi-fi , plays gameboy advance games processor : 67mhz arm9 and 33mhz arm7 memory : 4mb screen : 2 x 3 " weight : 275 grams central to this is the ds 's most striking feature ; its touch screen , which sits alongside a second , traditional display .
this allows game developers to devise new ways for players to interact with the system , with often highly successful results .
games for the ds have included sections where the user must draw fluffy clouds to stop baby mario from hitting the floor .
in the upcoming nintendogs , players use the touch screen to stroke their virtual pets .
far from being a gimmick , the addition of a touch screen and microphone to the standard handheld console template has meant that nintendo can encourage millions of gameboy owners to purchase another console .
they have been careful to distance the ds from the gameboy line , calling it a " third pillar " alongside the gameboy advance and gamecube .
nintendo have further innovations in store for the console , including a scheme to provide wi-fi hotspots .
this would increase the range of the console 's multiplayer capabilities , allowing gamers to play with other users at hotspots around the world .
whether the ds 's position as leader of the handheld pack remains intact when the psp launches in the uk is yet to be seen .
the success of the next generation handhelds will depend to a great extent on whether they can develop a library of decent games to entice new gamers along .

attempting the difficult job of breaking into a market where nintendo and sony already have such huge brand recognition , the gizmondo provides gamers with an alternative console choice .

without doubt the most interesting innovation is the in-built satellite navigation -lrb- gps -rrb- system .
as well as being able to find your position and local information , the gps system is also being used in games .
titles such as colors , for example , allow gamers to team up locally and battle other nearby gizmondo owners .
released in march 2005 , a week after the launch of the eagerly awaited nintendo ds , the gizmondo has yet to become as well respected as its sony and nintendo rivals .
this may have something to do with the console 's weak launch line-up , which boasted only a few well-known titles and no real must-have game .
recently , doubts over the manufacturer 's finances and an aborted us launch have cast doubts over the console 's future .
there is still hope for the gizmondo , however .
tiger telematics , who make the machine , have promised to launch one game a week to provide its owners with a constant flow of titles .
in addition , big name studios like electronic arts and microsoft have agreed to develop games for the platform .
with the right games making use of the gizmondo 's extensive feature set , there is definite potential for the console to provide a genuine alternative to sony or nintendo .

this may have something to do with the console 's weak launch line-up , which boasted only a few well-known titles and no real must-have game .
recently , doubts over the manufacturer 's finances and an aborted us launch have cast doubts over the console 's future .
there is still hope for the gizmondo , however .
tiger telematics , who make the machine , have promised to launch one game a week to provide its owners with a constant flow of titles .
in addition , big name studios like electronic arts and microsoft have agreed to develop games for the platform .
with the right games making use of the gizmondo 's extensive feature set , there is definite potential for the console to provide a genuine alternative to sony or nintendo .
game boy advance sp the latest in nintendo 's game boy line , the game boy advance -lrb- gba -rrb- sp is a refined version of the original gba .
gba sp stats processor : 16.8mhz arm7 memory : 288kb screen : 2.9 " weight : 143 grams building on the popularity and fanbase of the original console , the gba sp can play any gba or gameboy game , giving it an impressive library of titles with which other handhelds find it hard to compete .
the machine , which was released in march 2003 , is now beginning to show its age .
although the number of games available keeps people playing , the impressive graphics of new games on platforms such as the nintendo ds and psp have tempted gamers away from the console in recent months .
the gba sp has seen some high quality titles during its lifetime , with old gameboy staples such as tetris featuring alongside more recent hits like advance wars and wario ware inc .
with the release of the gameboy micro , which is based on the same technology and will play the same games , the sp seems set to go into well-earned retirement .
playstation portable this year 's most anticipated gaming release in the uk , the playstation portable -lrb- psp -rrb- has been on sale in japan since december 2004 and in the us since march this year .
psp stats features : wi-fi , mp3 and video playback , web browser , usb 2.0 processor : 333mhz mips r4200 memory : 32 mb graphics : 166mhz gpu with 2 mb ram screen : 4.3 " widescreen weight : 260 grams psp 's european debut sony says it delayed the european launch because they wanted to make sure they had enough to fill the shelves .
the figures back that up ; in the first two days of sales alone in the us , more than 500,000 consoles were sold .
building on the success of the playstation 2 console , the psp boasts some impressive specifications .
many launch titles make use of its power to deliver some of the most impressive graphics ever seen on a handheld console .
this , combined with the fact that titles like medievil : resurrection and wipeout pure , are based on already successful franchises , will help ensure the psp 's rapid take-up .
but sony is not focusing purely on gaming with the psp .
alongside its main processor is a dedicated multimedia chip to deal with playing high resolution video on the psp 's widescreen display .
sony has persuaded film studios to release dvd titles on universal media discs -lrb- umd -rrb- , which the psp uses to store games .
this turns the psp into a portable dvd player , provided you can find the film you want in umd format .
films and music can also be played from a sony memory stick , though a short battery life of about three hours can be an issue .
additionally , the console is equipped with wi-fi , and the software has been updated to include a web browser allowing access to the internet .
n-gage qd there have been games on mobile phones since the late 1990s , but nokia 's n-gage is so far the only attempt to explicitly combine a game console and a mobile into one device .
n-gage qd stats features : voice calls , gprs , sms , mms , bluetooth processor : 104mhz arm4t memory : 3.4 mb screen : 2.1 " weight : 133 grams the n-gage qd is a redesign of the original n-gage , and was released in june 2004 .
the specifications of the machine have changed little , but the phone itself has been redesigned to make it more usable , and to address some of the problems which users complained of in the earlier model .
the result is a much nicer and more compact package , with more sensible positioning of microphone and speakers and less hassle required to change games .
though the original titles available for the system back in 2003 were disappointing , many which have launched since have been well received , such as fifa soccer 2005 , worms world party and the sims : busting out .
in other respects the qd is less impressive .
nokia has disabled mp3 playback on the new device , as well as removing the fm radio , at a time when more and more people are beginning to see their phones as valid multimedia devices .
the lack of modern features like a camera and push-to-talk put the n-gage qd at a distinct disadvantage compared to newer mobile phones .
gameboy micro while the nintendo ds is designed to appeal to gamers who want new experiences from their consoles , the gameboy micro is aimed at an entirely different market : the ipod generation .
gameboy micro stats features : customisable looks processor : 16.8mhz arm7 memory : 288kb screen : 2 " weight : 85 grams aware that current consoles have a tendency to look clunky and gadgety to new users , the gameboy micro is nintendo 's attempt to emulate apple and nokia in making gadgets which are also fashion accessories .
the gameboy micro weighs about the same as a phone , is roughly the size of an ipod , and comes with customisable colour front covers .
despite this it is still a competent gaming machine , built on the model of the successful gameboy advance -lrb- gba -rrb- .
this brings with it not only recognisable features , but also a formidable host of games to accompany its launch .
like the gameboy advance sp , the gameboy micro can play any gba game , which includes nintendo favourites such as super mario world as well as third party hits such as the sims .
presumably to cut down the size of the console , nintendo has however decided to drop support for original game boy games .
whether nintendo will manage to introduce a new wave of unlikely gamers to portable consoles with the gameboy micro is uncertain .
equally , current gba owners may feel that buying yet another redesign of the same product is not a tempting prospect given the arrival of the nintendo ds and the psp .
the micro is due to go on sale in the us in september , with europe following in november .
nintendo ds the nintendo ds ships without many of the gadgets which are taken for granted in modern consoles .
it can not play video or mp3s , browse websites or make phone calls .
rather than being an oversight , however , this is part of nintendo 's plan to create a pure and innovative gaming handheld .
nintendo ds stats features : touch screen in addition to normal screen , microphone , wi-fi , plays gameboy advance games processor : 67mhz arm9 and 33mhz arm7 memory : 4mb screen : 2 x 3 " weight : 275 grams central to this is the ds 's most striking feature ; its touch screen , which sits alongside a second , traditional display .
this allows game developers to devise new ways for players to interact with the system , with often highly successful results .
games for the ds have included sections where the user must draw fluffy clouds to stop baby mario from hitting the floor .
in the upcoming nintendogs , players use the touch screen to stroke their virtual pets .
far from being a gimmick , the addition of a touch screen and microphone to the standard handheld console template has meant that nintendo can encourage millions of gameboy owners to purchase another console .
they have been careful to distance the ds from the gameboy line , calling it a " third pillar " alongside the gameboy advance and gamecube .
nintendo have further innovations in store for the console , including a scheme to provide wi-fi hotspots .
this would increase the range of the console 's multiplayer capabilities , allowing gamers to play with other users at hotspots around the world .
whether the ds 's position as leader of the handheld pack remains intact when the psp launches in the uk is yet to be seen .
the success of the next generation handhelds will depend to a great extent on whether they can develop a library of decent games to entice new gamers along .

cash was available from regional bodies and in the form of tax breaks , but few took advantage of these , said toby barnes of the pixel-lab think tank .
at the games developers conference europe in london , he said these funds could help get new ideas going .
the uk has a reputation as a games powerhouse but rising costs have meant many studios have closed .
funding for films the games industry has repeatedly called for more government support , along the lines of the support provided to british art house films .
many in the business are particularly worried about escalating costs of making games for the next generation of console games because of the number of people and level of skills needed .

" just because films got money in the past , it is no use arguing that games should get the money now , " he said .
instead he blamed game developers for not doing enough to take advantage of the support already available .
mr barnes argued that not enough game makers were drawing on tax credits for research and development .
under a scheme introduced in 2000 , companies can get £ 1.50 back for every £ 1 spent on research .
mr barnes cited an example where a company had claimed back 80 % of the costs of developing a blockbuster title .
the problem for smaller game makers was that they were too focused on getting a title finished and lack the knowledge to work the system .
" you need an accountant that understands these tax breaks , " he said .
" the reason people do n't take them up is because they do n't have the right advice . "

these regional bodies have received funding from the eu to help them rebuild the local economy .
mr barnes cited the example of a project he had worked on to attract video game makers to work with the east midlands regional screen agency called em media .
" the east midlands has a large pot for digital media production , " he said adding that millions over the next few years could be spent on creative businesses in the region .
" the investment funds are aimed at taking an idea that would not normally happen , that publishers would not fund , " he said .
" it is a way of funding the early stages of development and it takes risk away from publisher . "

cash was available from regional bodies and in the form of tax breaks , but few took advantage of these , said toby barnes of the pixel-lab think tank .
at the games developers conference europe in london , he said these funds could help get new ideas going .
the uk has a reputation as a games powerhouse but rising costs have meant many studios have closed .
funding for films the games industry has repeatedly called for more government support , along the lines of the support provided to british art house films .
many in the business are particularly worried about escalating costs of making games for the next generation of console games because of the number of people and level of skills needed .
the investment funds are aimed at taking an idea that would not normally happen , that publishers would not fund toby barnes , pixel-lab but mr barnes said that these calls were likely to fall on deaf ears .
" just because films got money in the past , it is no use arguing that games should get the money now , " he said .
instead he blamed game developers for not doing enough to take advantage of the support already available .
mr barnes argued that not enough game makers were drawing on tax credits for research and development .
under a scheme introduced in 2000 , companies can get £ 1.50 back for every £ 1 spent on research .
mr barnes cited an example where a company had claimed back 80 % of the costs of developing a blockbuster title .
the problem for smaller game makers was that they were too focused on getting a title finished and lack the knowledge to work the system .
" you need an accountant that understands these tax breaks , " he said .
" the reason people do n't take them up is because they do n't have the right advice . "
