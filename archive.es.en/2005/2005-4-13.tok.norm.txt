many who were babies or children during the war are still suffering from the trauma they experienced 60 years ago . in his speech commemorating the liberation of buchenwald concentration camp , chancellor gerhard schröder said remembering germany 's past - national socialism , war and genocide - was part of germany 's identity and , at the same time , " a permanent moral responsibility . "
yet there is a significant part of this past that has been neglected .
" it is surprising that the generation of children , who were born during the war and spent a large part of their childhood in the war , have until recently been remarkably silent about their biographies and appeared unaffected , " said dr. michael ermann , head of the war childhood project at munich 's ludwig-maximilians-university .
" their speechlessness found a counterpart in the little interest that the public showed for their fate , " ermann told german radio südwestrundfunk .
it is only in recent years that historians , psychoanalysts and german society are taking a closer look at these " kriegskinder " or children of war .
an international convention on the generation of war children is meeting in frankfurt this week to discuss the damage that the war and its effects had on people 's souls .
a robbed childhood dr. hartmut radebold , a former professor of clinical psychology at the university of kassel and the founder of germany 's geriatric psychotherapy , said these children were subject to suffering in three major areas .
" they faced violence , they had to deal with separation and loss of loved ones , and they had to come to terms with losing their homes , safety and security , " said radebold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many children had to flee their homes the psychiatrist helga spranger , one of the founding members of the war child association kriegskind.de and herself a war child , described the lives of children during the war in the international journal of evacuee and war child studies .
" children were separated from their parents , orphaned , evacuated by force , displaced , kidnapped , shot at , bombed , wounded , mutilated , raped , expropriated , blackmailed , adopted by force , drafted at an early age and forced into labor , " spranger wrote .
" in short , they suffered from stress for months or years and were basically robbed of their childhood . "
the horrors these children experienced continued to brew under the surface .
" it costs endless energy to keep it inside for decades , " said ermann .
haunted by memories in recent years , an increasing number of war children have suffered from agonizing health problems , as their trauma finally rises to the surface .
according to radebold , many are diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder .
" they are haunted by their memories and the terrors they experienced and are overwhelmed by them , " he said .
symptoms include jumpiness , restlessness , sleep disorders or withdrawal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sound of a plane can often trigger the trauma there are also many images that are burned into their minds , which trigger their trauma , said spranger .
" aside from the basic feelings of fear of death or abandonment , disgust and wishes of escaping , lasting horrifying impressions are hidden in the memories for a lifetime , " said spranger , such as the smell of burned houses , animals and humans after firebombs , hearing sirens or the shooting of weapons .
but despite their anguish , many war children have still been hesitant to talk .
sabine bode , author of the book " die vergessene generation " or " the lost generation , " looked at the stories of these war children to trace how their experiences shaped their lives .
she said her search for stories was tough .
" most of the people i spoke to fended off my questions with remarks like ' others were much worse off than i was ' or ' it did n't hurt us ' , " said bode .
" i rarely heard anyone complain about their fate .
i have the impression that despite the frequently observed trait that germans like to see themselves as victims , former war children of all people were in no way whiny about their past . "
history is a clogged toilet there are several reasons why these stories are only coming to the surface now .
many experiences were " re-awakened " through the images of other more recent wars , such as in kosovo or iraq .
that fact that these war children have reached retirement age also plays a role .
" in old age , you ca n't repress things as easily anymore , " said bode .
a profession also acts as a stabilizing factor for someone 's identity , said radebold .
" so when these war children retire , they have more time on their hands to think and with this time , come the memories , " he said .
in certain cases , trauma can be reactivated .
" this means that old memories are reawakened through a siren or an airplane that sounds similar to the ones during the war , " said radebold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " crabwalk " by günter grass was published in 2002 but bode said that war children also needed a form of " permission " to open their souls .
and this was given to them by nobel prize winner günter grass .
" he said , we also have to attend to germans ' problems after the war , " said bode .
" history or , to be more precise , the history we germans have repeatedly mucked up , is a clogged toilet .
we flush and flush , but the shit keeps rising , " grass wrote in his book " crabwalk , " published in 2002 .

german authorities want to extradite mamoun darkazanli to spain , where he is accused of being an al-qaeda associate . mamoun darkazanli 's extradition was requested by madrid under a controversial new system of eu arrest warrants introduced last year .
the aim of the system was to make it easier for terror suspects to be transferred between eu member states and to boost cooperation in the war on terrorism . but darkazanli 's lawyers are expected to argue before the court in karlsruhe that the eu arrest warrants are in breach of the german constitution , because their client can be handed over to face charges abroad that could not be brought against him in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : were the court to uphold darkazanli 's argument , it would seriously undermine one of the bloc 's main anti-terrorist security initiatives . wider implications german justice minister brigitte zypries said such a ruling would be detrimental to german cooperation in the eu 's joint fight against crime .
but she said she doubted the case would stand up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte zypries " i think the eu arrest warrant as a whole is not in violation , and in this concrete case there is even less evidence of that , " she told deutschlandfunk radio . michael rosenthal , darkazanli 's lawyer , said he would argue the measure is unconstitutional because it was introduced under a binding " framework decision " by eu ministers , and the parliament therefore had no choice but to approve it . " our constitutional appeal says : that is not democracy , " he told reuters . other legal experts believe an outcome in favor of darkazanli would have wider implications and introduce the possibility of challenges to other eu measures and even to the bloc 's new constitution , due to be ratified by parliament this year . logistical and financial support the 46-year-old darkazanli , a businessman who has dual syrian and german nationality , has been in custody in hamburg since last october and will not attend the hearings . he stands accused by the us of financing al qaeda and was one of 35 people charged by spanish judge baltasar garzon in september 2003 with belonging to the terrorist network . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marienstr .
54 was the base of the hamburg al qaeda cell he has also been investigated by german authorities for links to the hamburg cell which masterminded and executed the 9/11 attacks on new york and washington in 2001 . garzon 's charge sheet says he carried out " logistics support and financing activity , " including the purchase of a cargo vessel for its leader osama bin laden in december 1993 . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany agrees on al qaeda suspect 's extradition mamoun darkazanli , the syrian-german accused of being a member of al qaeda 's 9/11 hamburg cell , could soon face extradition proceedings after german authorities cleared his case to go before a court hearing . -lrb- oct .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.04.2005 germans question european arrest warrant großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german judges are set to decide on europe-wide extraditions the simplified extradition regulations for suspected criminals within the eu have been criticized ever since they came into effect .
the highest court in germany is now turning its attention to it . effective and swift cooperation - that 's what 's always been demanded on the legal level in europe .
towards that end , the european warrant arrest was introduced in the bloc early last year .
it aims to simplify extradition procedures for suspected criminals within the european union . but , not many eu members are really happy about it , with many preferring to retain elements of the old procedure .
that may seem odd given that the old regulation was rather cumbersome .
for instance , earlier the suspected crime had to be punishable and allowed to be pursued by the law both in the home country of the suspected criminal as well as in the nation that he was to be extradited to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money laundering and counterfeiting are included on the so-called " positive list of criminal areas . "
the new regulation has been significantly simplified in this regard : when the suspected crime is included on a so-called " positive list of criminal areas , " then the criminal can be extradited . the problem however is that the list is too vague .
" for example : what exactly does sabotage mean ? " said helmut satzger , professor for european criminal law at the university of munich .
" we do n't have a provision on the books to deal with sabotage in german law , " satzger said .
the same is true for racism and xenophobia . criticism is growing in germany about the european arrest warrant and its apparent contradictions and the german constitution court in karlsruhe is set to grapple with the topic in detail for the first time this week . different legal systems in many other cases , the crime must be punishable in both states much as was the case earlier .
despite that , there are huge differences in various eu states regarding the severity of the crime .
the differing legal systems in the eu member states have prompted concerns among german lawyers ' groups , law professors and lawyers .
how for instance , they ask , can a ruling of greek courts be accepted in germany when there are completely different laws here ? these worries are shared by other eu members states too and some have reacted .
" for example there are states like denmark who have n't translated the new regulations in binding law , " said satzger .
others such as france have reserved the right to examine the dual criminality principle contained in the european arrest warrant . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic militant metin kaplan was extradited to turkey by germany after a long-drawn out legal battle .
he was extradited on charges of treason for allegedly masterminding a failed plot to crash an airplane into the mausoleum of the founder of secular turkey .
but , it 's not just differing laws in eu states that have prompted worries .
even bans on extradition of criminals are problematic .
the eu so far recognizes only three hindrances to extradition : the already existing punishment of the criminal in his home country , if he 's not criminally liable due to underage , or an amnesty .
as against that member states can no longer refuse to surrender to another member state their own citizens on the ground that they are nationals . no appeal in the home country possible " for example , if lithuania issued such an arrest warrant against a german then germany must surrender its national to lithuania , " said satzger .
that means , that the german national could not protest that the crime is n't punishable in germany .
" if the suspected criminal does n't know lithuania , if he has no idea of the lithuanian legal system and if he also does n't exactly know for example how the mandatory defense counsel would work , then we 're dealing with certain problems here , " said satzger . long before the european warrant arrest actually too effect , a few german constitutional court judges had strongly criticized the procedure .
" the german constitutional court has undertaken a big task in the respect : the judges are using the arrest warrant to answer some very fundamental questions about the relationship between european law and national law , " said satzger . he added that most member states had accepted that european law would override national constitutional law .
but , germany 's not convinced . daphne antachopoulos -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the trouble with nailing terror suspects another terror trial without a hard conviction this week has illustrated once more the difficulties the german judiciary has in putting terror suspects behind bars .

experts believe that downward pressure on wages in germany will continue this year unless berlin takes decisive steps to curb the influx of cheap labor from eastern europe . chasing " black sheep " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the construction industry already has regulations in place to prevent wage dumping .
the task force in the german economics and finance ministry will in future conduct bilateral talks with the 10 new member states in order to push them to uphold eu labor and services law .
the new working group is also meant to create clear criteria for service providers , branches , companies as well as workers from the new member states . gerd andres , parliamentary under secretary in the german economics ministry , said the authorities should go after " black sheep " and prevent eastern european firms from bypassing eu laws to the detriment of the german labor market and economy . germany did insist on and achieve a seven-year freeze on people from the new member states from getting automatic access to the german labor market in the run up to the eu 's eastward expansion last year .
but immediately upon entry , companies in poland and the other new member states gained the right to sell business services in the rest of the eu .
just last month , chancellor gerhard schröder had to intervene in eu plans to liberalize services which would have thrown the doors further open for cheap labor from the east . under eu law , workers sent to a different country for a short-term contract must receive the minimum social benefits and wages of the state where they are carrying out the project . this doesn ’ t apply , however , to self-employed workers and foreign subcontractors .
in germany , the meat-packing industry has been particularly affected .
tens of thousands of workers lost their jobs in recent months , as their work is increasingly being done by companies from poland and hungary who essentially " lend " their foreign workers to companies here .
the wages the easterners receive are between just three and five euros an hour . expanding minimum wages in addition , the new task force is meant to examine whether the minimum wage rule that applies to the german building sector , one of the few industries that does have such a provision , can be expanded to other areas . unlike other eu countries , germany does not have a general minimum wage , because such a law was long considered to be an infringement of the right for industrial sectors to have their own pay scales .
but , now with low-wage workers from eastern europe squeezing germans out of jobs at a time of record unemployment and key regional elections coming up in the state of north rhine-westphalia next month , chancellor schröder is considering extending the law . " we 'll take a look at whether the anti-dumping law that applies to the building trade can be gradually extended to take in other sectors , " schröder said on wednesday .
" the aim is to make sure that dumping incidents do not ruin good companies that are unable to compete with such low wages . ” employers against minimum wages however , not everybody is happy with the idea of legally-set minimum wages .
german employers say it would be counterproductive as job opportunities for unskilled german workers would be lost .
in addition they claim companies would be burdened with the costs of greater bureaucracy . the institute for labor market and job research -lrb- iab -rrb- said that a minimum wage in individual sectors would help to reduce the pressure on wages in germany through eastward expansion , provided it was just a temporary measure . ulrich walwei , deputy head of the iab told the daily berliner zeitung that the government also had to be careful in its selection of sectors to introduce a temporary minimum wage in order to avoid damaging competition . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate flares up over minimum wages with the eu 's eastward expansion and subsequent downward pressure on wages in germany , opposition conservatives have stoked debate over the introduction of minimum wages , saying they 're ready to support such a move .

experts believe that downward pressure on wages in germany will continue this year unless berlin takes decisive steps to curb the influx of cheap labor from eastern europe . chasing " black sheep " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the construction industry already has regulations in place to prevent wage dumping .
the task force in the german economics and finance ministry will in future conduct bilateral talks with the 10 new member states in order to push them to uphold eu labor and services law .
the new working group is also meant to create clear criteria for service providers , branches , companies as well as workers from the new member states . gerd andres , parliamentary under secretary in the german economics ministry , said the authorities should go after " black sheep " and prevent eastern european firms from bypassing eu laws to the detriment of the german labor market and economy . germany did insist on and achieve a seven-year freeze on people from the new member states from getting automatic access to the german labor market in the run up to the eu 's eastward expansion last year .
but immediately upon entry , companies in poland and the other new member states gained the right to sell business services in the rest of the eu .
just last month , chancellor gerhard schröder had to intervene in eu plans to liberalize services which would have thrown the doors further open for cheap labor from the east . under eu law , workers sent to a different country for a short-term contract must receive the minimum social benefits and wages of the state where they are carrying out the project . this doesn ’ t apply , however , to self-employed workers and foreign subcontractors .
in germany , the meat-packing industry has been particularly affected .
tens of thousands of workers lost their jobs in recent months , as their work is increasingly being done by companies from poland and hungary who essentially " lend " their foreign workers to companies here .
the wages the easterners receive are between just three and five euros an hour . expanding minimum wages in addition , the new task force is meant to examine whether the minimum wage rule that applies to the german building sector , one of the few industries that does have such a provision , can be expanded to other areas . unlike other eu countries , germany does not have a general minimum wage , because such a law was long considered to be an infringement of the right for industrial sectors to have their own pay scales .
but , now with low-wage workers from eastern europe squeezing germans out of jobs at a time of record unemployment and key regional elections coming up in the state of north rhine-westphalia next month , chancellor schröder is considering extending the law . " we 'll take a look at whether the anti-dumping law that applies to the building trade can be gradually extended to take in other sectors , " schröder said on wednesday .
" the aim is to make sure that dumping incidents do not ruin good companies that are unable to compete with such low wages . ” employers against minimum wages however , not everybody is happy with the idea of legally-set minimum wages .
german employers say it would be counterproductive as job opportunities for unskilled german workers would be lost .
in addition they claim companies would be burdened with the costs of greater bureaucracy . the institute for labor market and job research -lrb- iab -rrb- said that a minimum wage in individual sectors would help to reduce the pressure on wages in germany through eastward expansion , provided it was just a temporary measure . ulrich walwei , deputy head of the iab told the daily berliner zeitung that the government also had to be careful in its selection of sectors to introduce a temporary minimum wage in order to avoid damaging competition . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate flares up over minimum wages with the eu 's eastward expansion and subsequent downward pressure on wages in germany , opposition conservatives have stoked debate over the introduction of minimum wages , saying they 're ready to support such a move .

to be elected , a candidate must win two-thirds of the vote , or 77 votes . at 78 , ratzinger is seen as a possible " transition " pope since he is one of the oldest candidates . hoping for short conclave bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal ratzinger -lrb- l -rrb- served at the pope 's funeral la repubblica reported the german has the support of several latin american cardinals , as well as two powerful italians , cardinals camillo ruini and angelo sodano - both seemingly intent of scuttling the chances of fellow italian dionigi tettamanzi . the corriere della sera newspaper reported that ratzinger was also benefitting from the fact that his opponents have for the time being failed to agree on another candidate . most church leaders hope for a short conclave , according to italian media .
cardinals are eager to project an image of unity by electing a pope as early as wednesday or thursday , the daily il messaggero wrote on wednesday . ratzinger is reportedly particularly eager to find the 264th successor of peter quickly , and la repubblica reported that he would withdraw his " candidacy " if he fails to garner the two-thirds majority needed on the first day . pope 's tomb draws faithful bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this picture released by the vatican newspaper l 'osservatore romano shows faithful coming to pray in front of the tomb of late pope john paul ii in the grottos of st. peter 's basilica at the vatican , wednesday april 13 , 2005 .
meanwhile , thousands of pilgrims , some weeping , bore prayers and messages of love to the simple marble-slab tomb of as the vatican opened the crypt of st peter 's basilica shortly after dawn . " it 's moving to see him shut up in a tomb , " said rosa sgarenella , from bari in southern italy , as she left the vaulted crypt .
" we remember him being so alive . " mourners paused to pray before the grave - inscribed with his name in latin , ioannes paulus ii , and the years of his life : 1920-2005 - and ushers quietly prodded the stream of pilgrims to move along . john paul ii was interred friday but vatican officials agreed to wait until wednesday to open the crypt .
italian authorities had requested the delay , fearing hundreds of thousands of followers in rome for his funeral would remain to visit the tomb . many determined pilgrims remained in the city anyway .
graziella valmori , a french woman of italian origin , was the first in the queue , arriving nearly three hours before the crypt opened at 7:00 am -lrb- 0500 gmt -rrb- . " he was so good , he deserved all this , " said valmori .
she drove from france last week to see the pope lying in state at the basilica and remained in rome to see his tomb . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de could a bavarian become pope ?

but her reign as germany 's high priestess of pop was to be a short one . chart fixing : happens all the time ? crucially , gracia qualified as a candidate only because of the single 's recent chart success . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david brandes when market researcher media control , which assembles germany 's weekly charts , noticed that exceptionally high numbers of " run & hide " were flying off the shelves , it discovered that in fact , producer david brandes -lrb- photo -rrb- had commissioned henchmen across germany to buy the records and help his protégées up the hit parade . karlheinz kögel from media control told der spiegel that brandes " spun a web across the entire country with considerable criminal energy . " as if that was n't bad enough , an anonymous source familiar with the workings of the music industry told german daily taz that brandes is n't the only one .
" it 's exactly what every product manager does if he wants to see his labors rewarded , " he explained .
he also pointed out that newcomer acts are , in fact , often given a bit of a " leg-up " when they first enter the charts . even gracia herself was n't bothering to act innocent .
" everyone in the business buys up their own records , " she said .
" if you do n't , you 're just plain stupid . " expelled from the charts , but not eurovision even so , the three acts given a leg-up by brandes have now been banished from the charts by the phonographic industry association and media control . gracia , however , will still be heading for kiev .
the phono association maintains the guilty party is the producers rather than the artists and has announced she can still represent germany at the eurovision . it has n't been a popular decision .
" cheating is cheating and gracia should n't go to kiev , " argued germany 's former hit parade host dieter-thomas heck . country singer gunter gabriel agreed .
" it 's shameful , " he told news agency ddp , adding that the case is symptomatic of the music industry 's staggering greed .

many who were babies or children during the war are still suffering from the trauma they experienced 60 years ago . in his speech commemorating the liberation of buchenwald concentration camp , chancellor gerhard schröder said remembering germany 's past - national socialism , war and genocide - was part of germany 's identity and , at the same time , " a permanent moral responsibility . "
yet there is a significant part of this past that has been neglected .
" it is surprising that the generation of children , who were born during the war and spent a large part of their childhood in the war , have until recently been remarkably silent about their biographies and appeared unaffected , " said dr. michael ermann , head of the war childhood project at munich 's ludwig-maximilians-university .
" their speechlessness found a counterpart in the little interest that the public showed for their fate , " ermann told german radio südwestrundfunk .
it is only in recent years that historians , psychoanalysts and german society are taking a closer look at these " kriegskinder " or children of war .
an international convention on the generation of war children is meeting in frankfurt this week to discuss the damage that the war and its effects had on people 's souls .
a robbed childhood dr. hartmut radebold , a former professor of clinical psychology at the university of kassel and the founder of germany 's geriatric psychotherapy , said these children were subject to suffering in three major areas .
" they faced violence , they had to deal with separation and loss of loved ones , and they had to come to terms with losing their homes , safety and security , " said radebold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many children had to flee their homes the psychiatrist helga spranger , one of the founding members of the war child association kriegskind.de and herself a war child , described the lives of children during the war in the international journal of evacuee and war child studies .
" children were separated from their parents , orphaned , evacuated by force , displaced , kidnapped , shot at , bombed , wounded , mutilated , raped , expropriated , blackmailed , adopted by force , drafted at an early age and forced into labor , " spranger wrote .
" in short , they suffered from stress for months or years and were basically robbed of their childhood . "
the horrors these children experienced continued to brew under the surface .
" it costs endless energy to keep it inside for decades , " said ermann .
haunted by memories in recent years , an increasing number of war children have suffered from agonizing health problems , as their trauma finally rises to the surface .
according to radebold , many are diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder .
" they are haunted by their memories and the terrors they experienced and are overwhelmed by them , " he said .
symptoms include jumpiness , restlessness , sleep disorders or withdrawal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sound of a plane can often trigger the trauma there are also many images that are burned into their minds , which trigger their trauma , said spranger .
" aside from the basic feelings of fear of death or abandonment , disgust and wishes of escaping , lasting horrifying impressions are hidden in the memories for a lifetime , " said spranger , such as the smell of burned houses , animals and humans after firebombs , hearing sirens or the shooting of weapons .
but despite their anguish , many war children have still been hesitant to talk .
sabine bode , author of the book " die vergessene generation " or " the lost generation , " looked at the stories of these war children to trace how their experiences shaped their lives .
she said her search for stories was tough .
" most of the people i spoke to fended off my questions with remarks like ' others were much worse off than i was ' or ' it did n't hurt us ' , " said bode .
" i rarely heard anyone complain about their fate .
i have the impression that despite the frequently observed trait that germans like to see themselves as victims , former war children of all people were in no way whiny about their past . "
history is a clogged toilet there are several reasons why these stories are only coming to the surface now .
many experiences were " re-awakened " through the images of other more recent wars , such as in kosovo or iraq .
that fact that these war children have reached retirement age also plays a role .
" in old age , you ca n't repress things as easily anymore , " said bode .
a profession also acts as a stabilizing factor for someone 's identity , said radebold .
" so when these war children retire , they have more time on their hands to think and with this time , come the memories , " he said .
in certain cases , trauma can be reactivated .
" this means that old memories are reawakened through a siren or an airplane that sounds similar to the ones during the war , " said radebold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " crabwalk " by günter grass was published in 2002 but bode said that war children also needed a form of " permission " to open their souls .
and this was given to them by nobel prize winner günter grass .
" he said , we also have to attend to germans ' problems after the war , " said bode .

many who were babies or children during the war are still suffering from the trauma they experienced 60 years ago . in his speech commemorating the liberation of buchenwald concentration camp , chancellor gerhard schröder said remembering germany 's past - national socialism , war and genocide - was part of germany 's identity and , at the same time , " a permanent moral responsibility . "
yet there is a significant part of this past that has been neglected .
" it is surprising that the generation of children , who were born during the war and spent a large part of their childhood in the war , have until recently been remarkably silent about their biographies and appeared unaffected , " said dr. michael ermann , head of the war childhood project at munich 's ludwig-maximilians-university .
" their speechlessness found a counterpart in the little interest that the public showed for their fate , " ermann told german radio südwestrundfunk .
it is only in recent years that historians , psychoanalysts and german society are taking a closer look at these " kriegskinder " or children of war .
an international convention on the generation of war children is meeting in frankfurt this week to discuss the damage that the war and its effects had on people 's souls .
a robbed childhood dr. hartmut radebold , a former professor of clinical psychology at the university of kassel and the founder of germany 's geriatric psychotherapy , said these children were subject to suffering in three major areas .
" they faced violence , they had to deal with separation and loss of loved ones , and they had to come to terms with losing their homes , safety and security , " said radebold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many children had to flee their homes the psychiatrist helga spranger , one of the founding members of the war child association kriegskind.de and herself a war child , described the lives of children during the war in the international journal of evacuee and war child studies .
" children were separated from their parents , orphaned , evacuated by force , displaced , kidnapped , shot at , bombed , wounded , mutilated , raped , expropriated , blackmailed , adopted by force , drafted at an early age and forced into labor , " spranger wrote .
" in short , they suffered from stress for months or years and were basically robbed of their childhood . "
the horrors these children experienced continued to brew under the surface .
" it costs endless energy to keep it inside for decades , " said ermann .
haunted by memories in recent years , an increasing number of war children have suffered from agonizing health problems , as their trauma finally rises to the surface .
according to radebold , many are diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder .
" they are haunted by their memories and the terrors they experienced and are overwhelmed by them , " he said .
symptoms include jumpiness , restlessness , sleep disorders or withdrawal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sound of a plane can often trigger the trauma there are also many images that are burned into their minds , which trigger their trauma , said spranger .
" aside from the basic feelings of fear of death or abandonment , disgust and wishes of escaping , lasting horrifying impressions are hidden in the memories for a lifetime , " said spranger , such as the smell of burned houses , animals and humans after firebombs , hearing sirens or the shooting of weapons .
but despite their anguish , many war children have still been hesitant to talk .
sabine bode , author of the book " die vergessene generation " or " the lost generation , " looked at the stories of these war children to trace how their experiences shaped their lives .
she said her search for stories was tough .
" most of the people i spoke to fended off my questions with remarks like ' others were much worse off than i was ' or ' it did n't hurt us ' , " said bode .
" i rarely heard anyone complain about their fate .
i have the impression that despite the frequently observed trait that germans like to see themselves as victims , former war children of all people were in no way whiny about their past . "
history is a clogged toilet there are several reasons why these stories are only coming to the surface now .
many experiences were " re-awakened " through the images of other more recent wars , such as in kosovo or iraq .
that fact that these war children have reached retirement age also plays a role .
" in old age , you ca n't repress things as easily anymore , " said bode .
a profession also acts as a stabilizing factor for someone 's identity , said radebold .
" so when these war children retire , they have more time on their hands to think and with this time , come the memories , " he said .
in certain cases , trauma can be reactivated .
" this means that old memories are reawakened through a siren or an airplane that sounds similar to the ones during the war , " said radebold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " crabwalk " by günter grass was published in 2002 but bode said that war children also needed a form of " permission " to open their souls .
and this was given to them by nobel prize winner günter grass .
" he said , we also have to attend to germans ' problems after the war , " said bode .
" history or , to be more precise , the history we germans have repeatedly mucked up , is a clogged toilet .
we flush and flush , but the shit keeps rising , " grass wrote in his book " crabwalk , " published in 2002 .

' this week saw germany 's pop industry shaken by the biggest shock revelation since milli vanilli famously admitted in 1990 that it was n't their own voices gracing their best-selling records . in the latest showbiz shenanigans , it seems maverick producer david brandes allegedly mass-bought records by artists signed to his label bros music , including gracia , vanilla ninja and virus incorpororated , to help secure their singles a place in the charts . eurovision euphoria as germany 's entry in the 2005 eurovision song contest , to be held in kiev on may 21 , gracia must be quaking in her six-inch heels .
but the 22-year-old has already proved her talent not only for singing but for making the most of a bad lot when she defied the jury on germany 's version of pop idol and carved herself a profitable career as a pop star despite being voted off the show in a spectacular tv debacle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a b-rate britney spears she may be , but she sealed her success when thousand of viewers called in to vote for her single " run & hide " at the recent eurovision national selection show . " i 'm overwhelmed , surprised and very , very happy , " gushed gracia .
but her reign as germany 's high priestess of pop was to be a short one . chart fixing : happens all the time ? crucially , gracia qualified as a candidate only because of the single 's recent chart success . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david brandes when market researcher media control , which assembles germany 's weekly charts , noticed that exceptionally high numbers of " run & hide " were flying off the shelves , it discovered that in fact , producer david brandes -lrb- photo -rrb- had commissioned henchmen across germany to buy the records and help his protégées up the hit parade . karlheinz kögel from media control told der spiegel that brandes " spun a web across the entire country with considerable criminal energy . " as if that was n't bad enough , an anonymous source familiar with the workings of the music industry told german daily taz that brandes is n't the only one .
" it 's exactly what every product manager does if he wants to see his labors rewarded , " he explained .
he also pointed out that newcomer acts are , in fact , often given a bit of a " leg-up " when they first enter the charts . even gracia herself was n't bothering to act innocent .
" everyone in the business buys up their own records , " she said .
" if you do n't , you 're just plain stupid . " expelled from the charts , but not eurovision even so , the three acts given a leg-up by brandes have now been banished from the charts by the phonographic industry association and media control . gracia , however , will still be heading for kiev .
the phono association maintains the guilty party is the producers rather than the artists and has announced she can still represent germany at the eurovision . it has n't been a popular decision .
" cheating is cheating and gracia should n't go to kiev , " argued germany 's former hit parade host dieter-thomas heck . country singer gunter gabriel agreed .
" it 's shameful , " he told news agency ddp , adding that the case is symptomatic of the music industry 's staggering greed .

the man had been sentenced to 13 years in jail partly based on evidence police collected by tracking his movements using a gps device secretly attached to his car .
the court ruled that keeping tabs on suspects ' movements did not normally invade their privacy . the judges did , however , add that lawmakers should prevent " all round surveillance , " keeping an eye on technical developments and ensuring that public prosecutors are informed in all cases to prevent suspects from being the subject of uncoordinated observation from different law enforcement agencies at the same time . german justice ministry otto schily welcomed the ruling .
" the constitution court confirmed a significant instrument for police investigations and safeguarded use of the most modern technical methods for fighting crime , " he said in berlin .
justice ministry state secretary hansjörg geiger praised the court for approving " weapon parity " between criminals and investigators . avoiding 1984 but many years have passed since gps was used in the case the karlsruhe judges examined and technology has made leaps and bounds , pointed out data protection specialist frank rosengart from berlin 's chaos computer club -lrb- ccc -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " gps is no longer necessary , except for when the suspect really does n't have a telephone with him or it 's always turned off .
otherwise , the person 's location can be much better determined through his mobile phone , " rosengart said , adding that gps is rarely used by police forces . berlin 's police already use so-called silent text messages to locate suspects , for which the ccc awarded the force its big brother award last year .
data protection experts should focus their attentions on tracking via mobile phones , rosengart said . " at the moment only the legal situation prevents things from being transposed as george orwell described in ' 1984 , ' his gloomy vision of a surveillance state , " rosengart said .

" the fathers were often at war and were the mothers even in a position to offer their children security ? " said radebold .
bode said her interview partners told her that after the war , life was about survival .
" they said they lived by the motto ' just forget everything and look ahead ' , " she said .
" there were enough deranged and sick adults to deal with that no one really paid attention to the children .
they thought , children are tough . "
but this was not the case .
" many told me , ' we learned to survive , but not how to live well ' , " said bode .
political support most of germany 's political leadership are war children .
chancellor schröder never even met his father , who fell in the war .
former president johannes rau had to clear away rubble in his home town of wuppertal after the war .
germany 's current president horst köhler spent years as a refugee and himself said that his biography is the biography of germany 's history .
" these leaders tell the public that their experiences during and after the war had a great impact on them and perhaps this makes it easier for other war children to talk about their past , " said radebold .
it is impossible to generalize the experiences of this " lost generation , " though .
each child went through his or her own personal trauma , which has a greater or lesser impact on them today .
" wars always involve a chain of traumatic experiences , " said bode .
" but there 's one very central denominator : hunger .
none of them can throw away bread .

it 's focusing on ways to effectively strengthen european defense efforts with a view to improving joint missions in crisis areas on the continent and elsewhere . the two-day conference in berlin has drawn high-ranking politicians , nato officials and eu defense experts and aims to highlight efforts to further harmonize defense cooperation within the north atlantic alliance and the eu 's own defense initiatives . it 's being held at a time when both the eu and nato are in the process of building up rapid reaction forces , or battle groups , as european strategists prefer to call them .
both organizations are potentially drawing upon the same pools of soldiers which indicates that rivalry can never be ruled out . but in a bid to further heal transatlantic relations after the controversy over the us-led war in iraq , assurances are being heard ever so often that the eu ’ s own security efforts are invariably intended to complement - not duplicate or rival - nato . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck " it would be totally wrong to view the development of european defense capabilities separately from advances within nato , " said germany 's social democrat defense minister , peter struck -lrb- photo -rrb- .

" nato must be open to reform " there can be no doubt whatsoever that in future nato has to be the place where dialogue on transatlantic security strategies must be intensified , struck added .
" the alliance has to be open for reform , " struck added . this is what german chancellor gerhard schröder demanded at a recent security conference in munich , and his words are being taken seriously by nato leaders . struck ’ s message to the conference was taken up by alessandro minuto rizzo , deputy secretary-general of nato .
he made it clear that it had been wrong to try and sweep different threat perception levels on both sides of the atlantic under the carpet and demanded that a fresh initiative be made to debate security strategies more openly within nato . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german nato troops in afghanistan " we need to understand that nato is not only a forum for action .

" a great proportion of the alliance ’ s forces will need to be deployable well away from their own territories and have the flexibility to switch rapidly between war fighting and peace keeping , " kujat said .

german authorities want to extradite mamoun darkazanli to spain , where he is accused of being an al-qaeda associate . mamoun darkazanli 's extradition was requested by madrid under a controversial new system of eu arrest warrants introduced last year .
the aim of the system was to make it easier for terror suspects to be transferred between eu member states and to boost cooperation in the war on terrorism . but darkazanli 's lawyers are expected to argue before the court in karlsruhe that the eu arrest warrants are in breach of the german constitution , because their client can be handed over to face charges abroad that could not be brought against him in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : were the court to uphold darkazanli 's argument , it would seriously undermine one of the bloc 's main anti-terrorist security initiatives . wider implications german justice minister brigitte zypries said such a ruling would be detrimental to german cooperation in the eu 's joint fight against crime .

and indeed it appears that the german foreign office readily employed former nazi officials who were looking for work immediately after the war . efforts are now underway to open up the ministry 's recent past to public scrutiny , according to klaus scharioth , undersecretary in the foreign ministry .
" we need to look into the history of the foreign office under the nazis in a systematic manner , " he said on monday .
" foreign minister joschka fischer is currently thinking of establishing an independent panel of historians who would carry out this task . " fischer has come under fire from senior members of his ministry for refusing to allow full obituaries of former nazi party members to be published in the ministry 's in-house newsletter .
he took the decision after it became known that posthumous tributes had been paid to franz nüsslein , a convicted war criminal . safe in franco 's spain the scandal was uncovered by marga henseler , a member of the ministry 's staff who has since retired .
" i could n't believe my eyes when i saw the obituary , " she said .
" i immediately wrote a letter to joschka fischer urging him not to tolerate this . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers in occupied prague , march 1939 franz nüsslein was a former nazi prosecutor in german-occupied czechoslovakia where he was involved in numerous death sentences handed down to the enemies of nazi germany .
after the war , a court in prague sentenced him to 20 years in prison for war crimes , but he was released after serving only seven years . henseler recalled that nüsslein joined the foreign service shortly thereafter .
" in the ministry rumors were quickly making the rounds that he did time in prague , " she said .
" so everybody knew about his past .
there were some protests internally , after which nüsslein was quickly moved to the mission in barcelona in spain , where dictator franco ruled at the time and where nothing could happen to him anymore . "
purging the remnants bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the foreign ministry in berlin earlier this year , joschka fischer also refused to pay full tribute to franz krapf , a former ss and nazi party member who later became germany 's ambassador to nato .
fischer 's actions provoked a revolt by some 70 diplomats who publicly accused the foreign minister of applying double standards in a reference to his own past as a leftist militant . although weakened by a different scandal over lax visa regulations , fischer appears determined to battle on in this dispute , which historians say should have reached the public domain long ago .
ministry sources say fischer is now planning an internal reshuffle of posts in what appears to be an effort to finally purge the foreign ministry of the last remnants of nazism . uwe hessler -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former diplomats turn against fischer several ex-diplomats in germany have struck out against their former boss joschka fischer for his role in the visa scandal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.04.2005 germans question european arrest warrant großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german judges are set to decide on europe-wide extraditions the simplified extradition regulations for suspected criminals within the eu have been criticized ever since they came into effect .
the highest court in germany is now turning its attention to it . effective and swift cooperation - that 's what 's always been demanded on the legal level in europe .
towards that end , the european warrant arrest was introduced in the bloc early last year .
it aims to simplify extradition procedures for suspected criminals within the european union . but , not many eu members are really happy about it , with many preferring to retain elements of the old procedure .
that may seem odd given that the old regulation was rather cumbersome .
for instance , earlier the suspected crime had to be punishable and allowed to be pursued by the law both in the home country of the suspected criminal as well as in the nation that he was to be extradited to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money laundering and counterfeiting are included on the so-called " positive list of criminal areas . "
the new regulation has been significantly simplified in this regard : when the suspected crime is included on a so-called " positive list of criminal areas , " then the criminal can be extradited . the problem however is that the list is too vague .
" for example : what exactly does sabotage mean ? " said helmut satzger , professor for european criminal law at the university of munich .
" we do n't have a provision on the books to deal with sabotage in german law , " satzger said .
the same is true for racism and xenophobia . criticism is growing in germany about the european arrest warrant and its apparent contradictions and the german constitution court in karlsruhe is set to grapple with the topic in detail for the first time this week . different legal systems in many other cases , the crime must be punishable in both states much as was the case earlier .
despite that , there are huge differences in various eu states regarding the severity of the crime .
the differing legal systems in the eu member states have prompted concerns among german lawyers ' groups , law professors and lawyers .
how for instance , they ask , can a ruling of greek courts be accepted in germany when there are completely different laws here ? these worries are shared by other eu members states too and some have reacted .
" for example there are states like denmark who have n't translated the new regulations in binding law , " said satzger .
others such as france have reserved the right to examine the dual criminality principle contained in the european arrest warrant . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic militant metin kaplan was extradited to turkey by germany after a long-drawn out legal battle .
he was extradited on charges of treason for allegedly masterminding a failed plot to crash an airplane into the mausoleum of the founder of secular turkey .
but , it 's not just differing laws in eu states that have prompted worries .
even bans on extradition of criminals are problematic .
the eu so far recognizes only three hindrances to extradition : the already existing punishment of the criminal in his home country , if he 's not criminally liable due to underage , or an amnesty .
as against that member states can no longer refuse to surrender to another member state their own citizens on the ground that they are nationals . no appeal in the home country possible " for example , if lithuania issued such an arrest warrant against a german then germany must surrender its national to lithuania , " said satzger .
that means , that the german national could not protest that the crime is n't punishable in germany .
" if the suspected criminal does n't know lithuania , if he has no idea of the lithuanian legal system and if he also does n't exactly know for example how the mandatory defense counsel would work , then we 're dealing with certain problems here , " said satzger . long before the european warrant arrest actually too effect , a few german constitutional court judges had strongly criticized the procedure .
" the german constitutional court has undertaken a big task in the respect : the judges are using the arrest warrant to answer some very fundamental questions about the relationship between european law and national law , " said satzger . he added that most member states had accepted that european law would override national constitutional law .
but , germany 's not convinced . daphne antachopoulos -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the trouble with nailing terror suspects another terror trial without a hard conviction this week has illustrated once more the difficulties the german judiciary has in putting terror suspects behind bars .

the highest court in germany is now turning its attention to it . effective and swift cooperation - that 's what 's always been demanded on the legal level in europe .
towards that end , the european warrant arrest was introduced in the bloc early last year .
it aims to simplify extradition procedures for suspected criminals within the european union . but , not many eu members are really happy about it , with many preferring to retain elements of the old procedure .
that may seem odd given that the old regulation was rather cumbersome .
for instance , earlier the suspected crime had to be punishable and allowed to be pursued by the law both in the home country of the suspected criminal as well as in the nation that he was to be extradited to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money laundering and counterfeiting are included on the so-called " positive list of criminal areas . "
the new regulation has been significantly simplified in this regard : when the suspected crime is included on a so-called " positive list of criminal areas , " then the criminal can be extradited . the problem however is that the list is too vague .
" for example : what exactly does sabotage mean ? " said helmut satzger , professor for european criminal law at the university of munich .
" we do n't have a provision on the books to deal with sabotage in german law , " satzger said .
the same is true for racism and xenophobia . criticism is growing in germany about the european arrest warrant and its apparent contradictions and the german constitution court in karlsruhe is set to grapple with the topic in detail for the first time this week . different legal systems in many other cases , the crime must be punishable in both states much as was the case earlier .
despite that , there are huge differences in various eu states regarding the severity of the crime .
the differing legal systems in the eu member states have prompted concerns among german lawyers ' groups , law professors and lawyers .
how for instance , they ask , can a ruling of greek courts be accepted in germany when there are completely different laws here ? these worries are shared by other eu members states too and some have reacted .
" for example there are states like denmark who have n't translated the new regulations in binding law , " said satzger .
others such as france have reserved the right to examine the dual criminality principle contained in the european arrest warrant . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic militant metin kaplan was extradited to turkey by germany after a long-drawn out legal battle .
he was extradited on charges of treason for allegedly masterminding a failed plot to crash an airplane into the mausoleum of the founder of secular turkey .
but , it 's not just differing laws in eu states that have prompted worries .
even bans on extradition of criminals are problematic .
the eu so far recognizes only three hindrances to extradition : the already existing punishment of the criminal in his home country , if he 's not criminally liable due to underage , or an amnesty .
as against that member states can no longer refuse to surrender to another member state their own citizens on the ground that they are nationals . no appeal in the home country possible " for example , if lithuania issued such an arrest warrant against a german then germany must surrender its national to lithuania , " said satzger .
that means , that the german national could not protest that the crime is n't punishable in germany .
" if the suspected criminal does n't know lithuania , if he has no idea of the lithuanian legal system and if he also does n't exactly know for example how the mandatory defense counsel would work , then we 're dealing with certain problems here , " said satzger . long before the european warrant arrest actually too effect , a few german constitutional court judges had strongly criticized the procedure .
" the german constitutional court has undertaken a big task in the respect : the judges are using the arrest warrant to answer some very fundamental questions about the relationship between european law and national law , " said satzger . he added that most member states had accepted that european law would override national constitutional law .

he was extradited on charges of treason for allegedly masterminding a failed plot to crash an airplane into the mausoleum of the founder of secular turkey .
but , it 's not just differing laws in eu states that have prompted worries .
even bans on extradition of criminals are problematic .
the eu so far recognizes only three hindrances to extradition : the already existing punishment of the criminal in his home country , if he 's not criminally liable due to underage , or an amnesty .
as against that member states can no longer refuse to surrender to another member state their own citizens on the ground that they are nationals . no appeal in the home country possible " for example , if lithuania issued such an arrest warrant against a german then germany must surrender its national to lithuania , " said satzger .
that means , that the german national could not protest that the crime is n't punishable in germany .
" if the suspected criminal does n't know lithuania , if he has no idea of the lithuanian legal system and if he also does n't exactly know for example how the mandatory defense counsel would work , then we 're dealing with certain problems here , " said satzger . long before the european warrant arrest actually too effect , a few german constitutional court judges had strongly criticized the procedure .
" the german constitutional court has undertaken a big task in the respect : the judges are using the arrest warrant to answer some very fundamental questions about the relationship between european law and national law , " said satzger . he added that most member states had accepted that european law would override national constitutional law .
but , germany 's not convinced . daphne antachopoulos -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the trouble with nailing terror suspects another terror trial without a hard conviction this week has illustrated once more the difficulties the german judiciary has in putting terror suspects behind bars .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.04.2005 historians to probe ministry 's nazi past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer is calling for historians to investigate the ministry sixty years after the collapse of the nazi regime , the german foreign ministry plans to look into its controversial postwar history , including allegations that it employed nazi war criminals . historians have long quipped that you could find more former nazi party members in the newly-established german diplomatic service after world war ii than you could in its predecessor during hitler 's third reich .
and indeed it appears that the german foreign office readily employed former nazi officials who were looking for work immediately after the war . efforts are now underway to open up the ministry 's recent past to public scrutiny , according to klaus scharioth , undersecretary in the foreign ministry .
" we need to look into the history of the foreign office under the nazis in a systematic manner , " he said on monday .
" foreign minister joschka fischer is currently thinking of establishing an independent panel of historians who would carry out this task . " fischer has come under fire from senior members of his ministry for refusing to allow full obituaries of former nazi party members to be published in the ministry 's in-house newsletter .
he took the decision after it became known that posthumous tributes had been paid to franz nüsslein , a convicted war criminal . safe in franco 's spain the scandal was uncovered by marga henseler , a member of the ministry 's staff who has since retired .
" i could n't believe my eyes when i saw the obituary , " she said .
" i immediately wrote a letter to joschka fischer urging him not to tolerate this . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers in occupied prague , march 1939 franz nüsslein was a former nazi prosecutor in german-occupied czechoslovakia where he was involved in numerous death sentences handed down to the enemies of nazi germany .
after the war , a court in prague sentenced him to 20 years in prison for war crimes , but he was released after serving only seven years . henseler recalled that nüsslein joined the foreign service shortly thereafter .
" in the ministry rumors were quickly making the rounds that he did time in prague , " she said .
" so everybody knew about his past .
there were some protests internally , after which nüsslein was quickly moved to the mission in barcelona in spain , where dictator franco ruled at the time and where nothing could happen to him anymore . "
purging the remnants bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the foreign ministry in berlin earlier this year , joschka fischer also refused to pay full tribute to franz krapf , a former ss and nazi party member who later became germany 's ambassador to nato .
fischer 's actions provoked a revolt by some 70 diplomats who publicly accused the foreign minister of applying double standards in a reference to his own past as a leftist militant . although weakened by a different scandal over lax visa regulations , fischer appears determined to battle on in this dispute , which historians say should have reached the public domain long ago .
ministry sources say fischer is now planning an internal reshuffle of posts in what appears to be an effort to finally purge the foreign ministry of the last remnants of nazism . uwe hessler -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former diplomats turn against fischer several ex-diplomats in germany have struck out against their former boss joschka fischer for his role in the visa scandal .

" the fathers were often at war and were the mothers even in a position to offer their children security ? " said radebold .
bode said her interview partners told her that after the war , life was about survival .
" they said they lived by the motto ' just forget everything and look ahead ' , " she said .
" there were enough deranged and sick adults to deal with that no one really paid attention to the children .
they thought , children are tough . "
but this was not the case .
" many told me , ' we learned to survive , but not how to live well ' , " said bode .
political support most of germany 's political leadership are war children .
chancellor schröder never even met his father , who fell in the war .
former president johannes rau had to clear away rubble in his home town of wuppertal after the war .
germany 's current president horst köhler spent years as a refugee and himself said that his biography is the biography of germany 's history .
" these leaders tell the public that their experiences during and after the war had a great impact on them and perhaps this makes it easier for other war children to talk about their past , " said radebold .
it is impossible to generalize the experiences of this " lost generation , " though .
each child went through his or her own personal trauma , which has a greater or lesser impact on them today .
" wars always involve a chain of traumatic experiences , " said bode .

she lunges across the bed to answer it , much to the chagrin of her videotaping boyfriend .
while paris does n't share much in common with everyday folk , it seems a surprisingly large minority do share her weakness for mobile phone calls over sex . is it a tale of modern , high-tech romance ?
an example of the modern tendency to always look around the corner for something better ?
or just a reflection of how technology is stripping mankind of its humanity ? perhaps the statistics recently unveiled in the magazine ad age pose a question for sociologists , philosophers , or at least sexologists to ponder .
why do 14 percent of the world 's mobile phone users report that they have interrupted sex to answer a beeping wireless device ? " people ca n't bear to miss a call , " said christine hannis , head of communications for bbdo europe , which conducted the study along with proximity worldwide .

and getting so many calls proves social success , " she said .
" it fulfills a fundamental insecurity . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany and spain , then , appear to have the highest levels of insecurity , with 22 percent in both countries reporting that grabbing that call was more important than finishing the task at hand -lrb- or at other parts of the anatomy -rrb- .
the lowest incidence of what might be called cellulus interruptus was reported in italy , where only 7 percent of mobile phone users picked up the phone during sex . perhaps the sex is just better there . it 's not that mobile phones and sex are enemies , or even strangers .
more than half of the respondents to the same survey , 52 percent , reported they used a mobile phone to flirt .

the 4-2 defeat in london a week earlier meant the victory was a hollow one .
bayern were eliminated . bayern munich 's dreams of european glory ended in dramatic style in the olympic stadium on tuesday night as english premiership side chelsea swept into the semi-finals of the champions league at the expense of the german bundesliga leaders despite losing 3-2 . although bayern were winners on the night , the 4-2 defeat at stamford bridge last week was enough to earn the premiership leaders a 6-5 aggregate victory and send felix magath 's side crashing out . it is the second successive season chelsea have reached the semi-finals of europe 's premier competition and they will hope to make amends for last season 's shock 5-3 aggregate defeat by monaco . chelsea led 4-2 from the first leg and england international frank lampard scored on the hour mark - his third goal against bayern in six days - to ensure bayern had to score three times .
" another deflected goal from chelsea , " said bayern coach magath .
" chelsea were not better than us they were just more fortunate and clinical in front of goal . " missed chances cost bayern dearly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : didier drogba is congratulated at the end of the match in munich by team mate eidur gudjonsson .
bayern scored three goals through claudio pizarro -lrb- 65 -rrb- and late goals from substitutes mehmet scholl and paolo guerrero both in stoppage time but it was their earlier profligacy that cost them dear .
bayern were eventually punished by ivory coast star didier drogba who scored the decisive goal for chelsea with 10 minutes to go . chelsea 's portuguese manager jose mourinho - still suspended by uefa - was amongst the capacity 59,000 fans watching from the stands and will be delighted as his charges scored twice to ensure bayern 's late goal fest was irrelevant . fitness coach rui faria was mourinho 's representative at the press conference and revealed the manager left the stadium because he felt his privacy was being invaded .
" jose will be delighted with the result but he left the stands because he could not watch the match in peace , " revealed faria .
" he went back to the hotel and watched us progress from there . " chelsea face the prospect of an all english semi-final clash with four-time european cup winners liverpool although italian giants juventus will fancy their chances of overturning a 2-1 deficit in turin on wednesday . bayern made four changes with dutch international roy makaay and peru star pizarro back to form their attacking partnership . first and fatal goal to chelsea manager magath claimed conceding the first goal would be ' fatal ' and it almost happened in the second minute with drogba - a lone target-man - rushing on to a through pass . bayern custodian oliver kahn came storming out to block his path and magath breathed a sigh of relief , although it was later to turn to despair . hosts munich then seized the initiative and german international michael ballack - at the centre of a diving storm in the first leg - saw his goal-bound shot blocked in the fifth minute and blazed his follow-up high over the crossbar .
pizarro then forced a brilliant point blank save from chelsea 's czech international goalkeeper petr cech in a thrilling first quarter hour . bastian schweinsteiger was causing havoc down the right flank and a goal looked inevitable but it was chelsea who scored it against the run of play .
in the 30th minute , joe cole fed england international team-mate lampard and the midfielder 's shot ricocheted off brazilian defender lucio sending kahn the wrong way . " the first goal was very fortunate , " said bayern defender sagnol .
" but to be honest the damage was done in the first leg . " munich hit again while chasing the game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england 's frank lampard opened the scoring in the olympic stadium .
it was more bad luck for lucio who deflected in cole 's first goal in the 4-2 first leg defeat at stamford bridge .
lampard 's deflected effort meant bayern needed to score three goals to go through and ballack should have got one of them in the 38th minute when he strangely chose to play the ball across the face of goal instead of shooting himself . bayern pulled off martin demichelis for the more inventive mehmet scholl early in the second half .
bayern were handed a lifeline in the 65th minute when cech could only parry a ballack header on to the post and the ball rolled kindly to pizarro who stroked the ball in to level the scores . with 25 minutes left to score twice bayern hit the crossbar through a deflected bixente lizarazu cross and then eidur gudjohnsen cleared off the line as chelsea began to wobble . but with 10 minutes left the excellent cole crossed for drogba to bullet a header past kahn and bayern knew the game was up .
guerrero and scholl both scored in stoppage time but bayern were left cursing having conceded six goals over the two legs . bayern 's star midfielder michael ballack said : " it 's annoying .

and indeed it appears that the german foreign office readily employed former nazi officials who were looking for work immediately after the war . efforts are now underway to open up the ministry 's recent past to public scrutiny , according to klaus scharioth , undersecretary in the foreign ministry .
" we need to look into the history of the foreign office under the nazis in a systematic manner , " he said on monday .
" foreign minister joschka fischer is currently thinking of establishing an independent panel of historians who would carry out this task . " fischer has come under fire from senior members of his ministry for refusing to allow full obituaries of former nazi party members to be published in the ministry 's in-house newsletter .
he took the decision after it became known that posthumous tributes had been paid to franz nüsslein , a convicted war criminal . safe in franco 's spain the scandal was uncovered by marga henseler , a member of the ministry 's staff who has since retired .
" i could n't believe my eyes when i saw the obituary , " she said .
" i immediately wrote a letter to joschka fischer urging him not to tolerate this . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers in occupied prague , march 1939 franz nüsslein was a former nazi prosecutor in german-occupied czechoslovakia where he was involved in numerous death sentences handed down to the enemies of nazi germany .
after the war , a court in prague sentenced him to 20 years in prison for war crimes , but he was released after serving only seven years . henseler recalled that nüsslein joined the foreign service shortly thereafter .
" in the ministry rumors were quickly making the rounds that he did time in prague , " she said .

fischer 's actions provoked a revolt by some 70 diplomats who publicly accused the foreign minister of applying double standards in a reference to his own past as a leftist militant . although weakened by a different scandal over lax visa regulations , fischer appears determined to battle on in this dispute , which historians say should have reached the public domain long ago .

it 's focusing on ways to effectively strengthen european defense efforts with a view to improving joint missions in crisis areas on the continent and elsewhere . the two-day conference in berlin has drawn high-ranking politicians , nato officials and eu defense experts and aims to highlight efforts to further harmonize defense cooperation within the north atlantic alliance and the eu 's own defense initiatives . it 's being held at a time when both the eu and nato are in the process of building up rapid reaction forces , or battle groups , as european strategists prefer to call them .
both organizations are potentially drawing upon the same pools of soldiers which indicates that rivalry can never be ruled out . but in a bid to further heal transatlantic relations after the controversy over the us-led war in iraq , assurances are being heard ever so often that the eu ’ s own security efforts are invariably intended to complement - not duplicate or rival - nato . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck " it would be totally wrong to view the development of european defense capabilities separately from advances within nato , " said germany 's social democrat defense minister , peter struck -lrb- photo -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.04.2005 war 's forgotten children break the silence 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children went back to school after the war but not to a normal life the traces of world war ii have faded but not disappeared for germans .
many who were babies or children during the war are still suffering from the trauma they experienced 60 years ago . in his speech commemorating the liberation of buchenwald concentration camp , chancellor gerhard schröder said remembering germany 's past - national socialism , war and genocide - was part of germany 's identity and , at the same time , " a permanent moral responsibility . "
yet there is a significant part of this past that has been neglected .
" it is surprising that the generation of children , who were born during the war and spent a large part of their childhood in the war , have until recently been remarkably silent about their biographies and appeared unaffected , " said dr. michael ermann , head of the war childhood project at munich 's ludwig-maximilians-university .
" their speechlessness found a counterpart in the little interest that the public showed for their fate , " ermann told german radio südwestrundfunk .
it is only in recent years that historians , psychoanalysts and german society are taking a closer look at these " kriegskinder " or children of war .
an international convention on the generation of war children is meeting in frankfurt this week to discuss the damage that the war and its effects had on people 's souls .
a robbed childhood dr. hartmut radebold , a former professor of clinical psychology at the university of kassel and the founder of germany 's geriatric psychotherapy , said these children were subject to suffering in three major areas .
" they faced violence , they had to deal with separation and loss of loved ones , and they had to come to terms with losing their homes , safety and security , " said radebold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many children had to flee their homes the psychiatrist helga spranger , one of the founding members of the war child association kriegskind.de and herself a war child , described the lives of children during the war in the international journal of evacuee and war child studies .
" children were separated from their parents , orphaned , evacuated by force , displaced , kidnapped , shot at , bombed , wounded , mutilated , raped , expropriated , blackmailed , adopted by force , drafted at an early age and forced into labor , " spranger wrote .
" in short , they suffered from stress for months or years and were basically robbed of their childhood . "
the horrors these children experienced continued to brew under the surface .
" it costs endless energy to keep it inside for decades , " said ermann .
haunted by memories in recent years , an increasing number of war children have suffered from agonizing health problems , as their trauma finally rises to the surface .
according to radebold , many are diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder .
" they are haunted by their memories and the terrors they experienced and are overwhelmed by them , " he said .
symptoms include jumpiness , restlessness , sleep disorders or withdrawal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sound of a plane can often trigger the trauma there are also many images that are burned into their minds , which trigger their trauma , said spranger .
" aside from the basic feelings of fear of death or abandonment , disgust and wishes of escaping , lasting horrifying impressions are hidden in the memories for a lifetime , " said spranger , such as the smell of burned houses , animals and humans after firebombs , hearing sirens or the shooting of weapons .
but despite their anguish , many war children have still been hesitant to talk .
sabine bode , author of the book " die vergessene generation " or " the lost generation , " looked at the stories of these war children to trace how their experiences shaped their lives .
she said her search for stories was tough .
" most of the people i spoke to fended off my questions with remarks like ' others were much worse off than i was ' or ' it did n't hurt us ' , " said bode .
" i rarely heard anyone complain about their fate .

many who were babies or children during the war are still suffering from the trauma they experienced 60 years ago . in his speech commemorating the liberation of buchenwald concentration camp , chancellor gerhard schröder said remembering germany 's past - national socialism , war and genocide - was part of germany 's identity and , at the same time , " a permanent moral responsibility . "
yet there is a significant part of this past that has been neglected .
" it is surprising that the generation of children , who were born during the war and spent a large part of their childhood in the war , have until recently been remarkably silent about their biographies and appeared unaffected , " said dr. michael ermann , head of the war childhood project at munich 's ludwig-maximilians-university .
" their speechlessness found a counterpart in the little interest that the public showed for their fate , " ermann told german radio südwestrundfunk .
it is only in recent years that historians , psychoanalysts and german society are taking a closer look at these " kriegskinder " or children of war .
an international convention on the generation of war children is meeting in frankfurt this week to discuss the damage that the war and its effects had on people 's souls .
a robbed childhood dr. hartmut radebold , a former professor of clinical psychology at the university of kassel and the founder of germany 's geriatric psychotherapy , said these children were subject to suffering in three major areas .
" they faced violence , they had to deal with separation and loss of loved ones , and they had to come to terms with losing their homes , safety and security , " said radebold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many children had to flee their homes the psychiatrist helga spranger , one of the founding members of the war child association kriegskind.de and herself a war child , described the lives of children during the war in the international journal of evacuee and war child studies .
" children were separated from their parents , orphaned , evacuated by force , displaced , kidnapped , shot at , bombed , wounded , mutilated , raped , expropriated , blackmailed , adopted by force , drafted at an early age and forced into labor , " spranger wrote .
" in short , they suffered from stress for months or years and were basically robbed of their childhood . "
the horrors these children experienced continued to brew under the surface .
" it costs endless energy to keep it inside for decades , " said ermann .
haunted by memories in recent years , an increasing number of war children have suffered from agonizing health problems , as their trauma finally rises to the surface .
according to radebold , many are diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder .
" they are haunted by their memories and the terrors they experienced and are overwhelmed by them , " he said .
symptoms include jumpiness , restlessness , sleep disorders or withdrawal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sound of a plane can often trigger the trauma there are also many images that are burned into their minds , which trigger their trauma , said spranger .
" aside from the basic feelings of fear of death or abandonment , disgust and wishes of escaping , lasting horrifying impressions are hidden in the memories for a lifetime , " said spranger , such as the smell of burned houses , animals and humans after firebombs , hearing sirens or the shooting of weapons .
but despite their anguish , many war children have still been hesitant to talk .
sabine bode , author of the book " die vergessene generation " or " the lost generation , " looked at the stories of these war children to trace how their experiences shaped their lives .
she said her search for stories was tough .
" most of the people i spoke to fended off my questions with remarks like ' others were much worse off than i was ' or ' it did n't hurt us ' , " said bode .
" i rarely heard anyone complain about their fate .
i have the impression that despite the frequently observed trait that germans like to see themselves as victims , former war children of all people were in no way whiny about their past . "
history is a clogged toilet there are several reasons why these stories are only coming to the surface now .
many experiences were " re-awakened " through the images of other more recent wars , such as in kosovo or iraq .
that fact that these war children have reached retirement age also plays a role .

many who were babies or children during the war are still suffering from the trauma they experienced 60 years ago . in his speech commemorating the liberation of buchenwald concentration camp , chancellor gerhard schröder said remembering germany 's past - national socialism , war and genocide - was part of germany 's identity and , at the same time , " a permanent moral responsibility . "
yet there is a significant part of this past that has been neglected .
" it is surprising that the generation of children , who were born during the war and spent a large part of their childhood in the war , have until recently been remarkably silent about their biographies and appeared unaffected , " said dr. michael ermann , head of the war childhood project at munich 's ludwig-maximilians-university .
" their speechlessness found a counterpart in the little interest that the public showed for their fate , " ermann told german radio südwestrundfunk .
it is only in recent years that historians , psychoanalysts and german society are taking a closer look at these " kriegskinder " or children of war .
an international convention on the generation of war children is meeting in frankfurt this week to discuss the damage that the war and its effects had on people 's souls .
a robbed childhood dr. hartmut radebold , a former professor of clinical psychology at the university of kassel and the founder of germany 's geriatric psychotherapy , said these children were subject to suffering in three major areas .
" they faced violence , they had to deal with separation and loss of loved ones , and they had to come to terms with losing their homes , safety and security , " said radebold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many children had to flee their homes the psychiatrist helga spranger , one of the founding members of the war child association kriegskind.de and herself a war child , described the lives of children during the war in the international journal of evacuee and war child studies .
" children were separated from their parents , orphaned , evacuated by force , displaced , kidnapped , shot at , bombed , wounded , mutilated , raped , expropriated , blackmailed , adopted by force , drafted at an early age and forced into labor , " spranger wrote .
" in short , they suffered from stress for months or years and were basically robbed of their childhood . "
the horrors these children experienced continued to brew under the surface .
" it costs endless energy to keep it inside for decades , " said ermann .
haunted by memories in recent years , an increasing number of war children have suffered from agonizing health problems , as their trauma finally rises to the surface .
according to radebold , many are diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder .
" they are haunted by their memories and the terrors they experienced and are overwhelmed by them , " he said .
symptoms include jumpiness , restlessness , sleep disorders or withdrawal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sound of a plane can often trigger the trauma there are also many images that are burned into their minds , which trigger their trauma , said spranger .
" aside from the basic feelings of fear of death or abandonment , disgust and wishes of escaping , lasting horrifying impressions are hidden in the memories for a lifetime , " said spranger , such as the smell of burned houses , animals and humans after firebombs , hearing sirens or the shooting of weapons .
but despite their anguish , many war children have still been hesitant to talk .
sabine bode , author of the book " die vergessene generation " or " the lost generation , " looked at the stories of these war children to trace how their experiences shaped their lives .
she said her search for stories was tough .
" most of the people i spoke to fended off my questions with remarks like ' others were much worse off than i was ' or ' it did n't hurt us ' , " said bode .
" i rarely heard anyone complain about their fate .
i have the impression that despite the frequently observed trait that germans like to see themselves as victims , former war children of all people were in no way whiny about their past . "
history is a clogged toilet there are several reasons why these stories are only coming to the surface now .
many experiences were " re-awakened " through the images of other more recent wars , such as in kosovo or iraq .
that fact that these war children have reached retirement age also plays a role .
" in old age , you ca n't repress things as easily anymore , " said bode .
a profession also acts as a stabilizing factor for someone 's identity , said radebold .
" so when these war children retire , they have more time on their hands to think and with this time , come the memories , " he said .
in certain cases , trauma can be reactivated .
" this means that old memories are reawakened through a siren or an airplane that sounds similar to the ones during the war , " said radebold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " crabwalk " by günter grass was published in 2002 but bode said that war children also needed a form of " permission " to open their souls .
and this was given to them by nobel prize winner günter grass .
" he said , we also have to attend to germans ' problems after the war , " said bode .
" history or , to be more precise , the history we germans have repeatedly mucked up , is a clogged toilet .
we flush and flush , but the shit keeps rising , " grass wrote in his book " crabwalk , " published in 2002 .

it 's focusing on ways to effectively strengthen european defense efforts with a view to improving joint missions in crisis areas on the continent and elsewhere . the two-day conference in berlin has drawn high-ranking politicians , nato officials and eu defense experts and aims to highlight efforts to further harmonize defense cooperation within the north atlantic alliance and the eu 's own defense initiatives . it 's being held at a time when both the eu and nato are in the process of building up rapid reaction forces , or battle groups , as european strategists prefer to call them .
both organizations are potentially drawing upon the same pools of soldiers which indicates that rivalry can never be ruled out . but in a bid to further heal transatlantic relations after the controversy over the us-led war in iraq , assurances are being heard ever so often that the eu ’ s own security efforts are invariably intended to complement - not duplicate or rival - nato . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck " it would be totally wrong to view the development of european defense capabilities separately from advances within nato , " said germany 's social democrat defense minister , peter struck -lrb- photo -rrb- .

" nato must be open to reform " there can be no doubt whatsoever that in future nato has to be the place where dialogue on transatlantic security strategies must be intensified , struck added .
" the alliance has to be open for reform , " struck added . this is what german chancellor gerhard schröder demanded at a recent security conference in munich , and his words are being taken seriously by nato leaders . struck ’ s message to the conference was taken up by alessandro minuto rizzo , deputy secretary-general of nato .

many who were babies or children during the war are still suffering from the trauma they experienced 60 years ago . in his speech commemorating the liberation of buchenwald concentration camp , chancellor gerhard schröder said remembering germany 's past - national socialism , war and genocide - was part of germany 's identity and , at the same time , " a permanent moral responsibility . "
yet there is a significant part of this past that has been neglected .
" it is surprising that the generation of children , who were born during the war and spent a large part of their childhood in the war , have until recently been remarkably silent about their biographies and appeared unaffected , " said dr. michael ermann , head of the war childhood project at munich 's ludwig-maximilians-university .
" their speechlessness found a counterpart in the little interest that the public showed for their fate , " ermann told german radio südwestrundfunk .
it is only in recent years that historians , psychoanalysts and german society are taking a closer look at these " kriegskinder " or children of war .
an international convention on the generation of war children is meeting in frankfurt this week to discuss the damage that the war and its effects had on people 's souls .
a robbed childhood dr. hartmut radebold , a former professor of clinical psychology at the university of kassel and the founder of germany 's geriatric psychotherapy , said these children were subject to suffering in three major areas .
" they faced violence , they had to deal with separation and loss of loved ones , and they had to come to terms with losing their homes , safety and security , " said radebold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many children had to flee their homes the psychiatrist helga spranger , one of the founding members of the war child association kriegskind.de and herself a war child , described the lives of children during the war in the international journal of evacuee and war child studies .
" children were separated from their parents , orphaned , evacuated by force , displaced , kidnapped , shot at , bombed , wounded , mutilated , raped , expropriated , blackmailed , adopted by force , drafted at an early age and forced into labor , " spranger wrote .
" in short , they suffered from stress for months or years and were basically robbed of their childhood . "
the horrors these children experienced continued to brew under the surface .
" it costs endless energy to keep it inside for decades , " said ermann .
haunted by memories in recent years , an increasing number of war children have suffered from agonizing health problems , as their trauma finally rises to the surface .
according to radebold , many are diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder .
" they are haunted by their memories and the terrors they experienced and are overwhelmed by them , " he said .
symptoms include jumpiness , restlessness , sleep disorders or withdrawal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sound of a plane can often trigger the trauma there are also many images that are burned into their minds , which trigger their trauma , said spranger .
" aside from the basic feelings of fear of death or abandonment , disgust and wishes of escaping , lasting horrifying impressions are hidden in the memories for a lifetime , " said spranger , such as the smell of burned houses , animals and humans after firebombs , hearing sirens or the shooting of weapons .
but despite their anguish , many war children have still been hesitant to talk .
sabine bode , author of the book " die vergessene generation " or " the lost generation , " looked at the stories of these war children to trace how their experiences shaped their lives .
she said her search for stories was tough .
" most of the people i spoke to fended off my questions with remarks like ' others were much worse off than i was ' or ' it did n't hurt us ' , " said bode .
" i rarely heard anyone complain about their fate .
i have the impression that despite the frequently observed trait that germans like to see themselves as victims , former war children of all people were in no way whiny about their past . "
history is a clogged toilet there are several reasons why these stories are only coming to the surface now .
many experiences were " re-awakened " through the images of other more recent wars , such as in kosovo or iraq .
that fact that these war children have reached retirement age also plays a role .
" in old age , you ca n't repress things as easily anymore , " said bode .
a profession also acts as a stabilizing factor for someone 's identity , said radebold .
" so when these war children retire , they have more time on their hands to think and with this time , come the memories , " he said .
in certain cases , trauma can be reactivated .
" this means that old memories are reawakened through a siren or an airplane that sounds similar to the ones during the war , " said radebold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " crabwalk " by günter grass was published in 2002 but bode said that war children also needed a form of " permission " to open their souls .
and this was given to them by nobel prize winner günter grass .
" he said , we also have to attend to germans ' problems after the war , " said bode .
" history or , to be more precise , the history we germans have repeatedly mucked up , is a clogged toilet .
we flush and flush , but the shit keeps rising , " grass wrote in his book " crabwalk , " published in 2002 .

experts believe that downward pressure on wages in germany will continue this year unless berlin takes decisive steps to curb the influx of cheap labor from eastern europe . chasing " black sheep " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the construction industry already has regulations in place to prevent wage dumping .
the task force in the german economics and finance ministry will in future conduct bilateral talks with the 10 new member states in order to push them to uphold eu labor and services law .
the new working group is also meant to create clear criteria for service providers , branches , companies as well as workers from the new member states . gerd andres , parliamentary under secretary in the german economics ministry , said the authorities should go after " black sheep " and prevent eastern european firms from bypassing eu laws to the detriment of the german labor market and economy . germany did insist on and achieve a seven-year freeze on people from the new member states from getting automatic access to the german labor market in the run up to the eu 's eastward expansion last year .
but immediately upon entry , companies in poland and the other new member states gained the right to sell business services in the rest of the eu .
just last month , chancellor gerhard schröder had to intervene in eu plans to liberalize services which would have thrown the doors further open for cheap labor from the east . under eu law , workers sent to a different country for a short-term contract must receive the minimum social benefits and wages of the state where they are carrying out the project . this doesn ’ t apply , however , to self-employed workers and foreign subcontractors .
in germany , the meat-packing industry has been particularly affected .
tens of thousands of workers lost their jobs in recent months , as their work is increasingly being done by companies from poland and hungary who essentially " lend " their foreign workers to companies here .
the wages the easterners receive are between just three and five euros an hour . expanding minimum wages in addition , the new task force is meant to examine whether the minimum wage rule that applies to the german building sector , one of the few industries that does have such a provision , can be expanded to other areas . unlike other eu countries , germany does not have a general minimum wage , because such a law was long considered to be an infringement of the right for industrial sectors to have their own pay scales .
but , now with low-wage workers from eastern europe squeezing germans out of jobs at a time of record unemployment and key regional elections coming up in the state of north rhine-westphalia next month , chancellor schröder is considering extending the law . " we 'll take a look at whether the anti-dumping law that applies to the building trade can be gradually extended to take in other sectors , " schröder said on wednesday .
" the aim is to make sure that dumping incidents do not ruin good companies that are unable to compete with such low wages . ” employers against minimum wages however , not everybody is happy with the idea of legally-set minimum wages .
german employers say it would be counterproductive as job opportunities for unskilled german workers would be lost .
in addition they claim companies would be burdened with the costs of greater bureaucracy . the institute for labor market and job research -lrb- iab -rrb- said that a minimum wage in individual sectors would help to reduce the pressure on wages in germany through eastward expansion , provided it was just a temporary measure . ulrich walwei , deputy head of the iab told the daily berliner zeitung that the government also had to be careful in its selection of sectors to introduce a temporary minimum wage in order to avoid damaging competition . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate flares up over minimum wages with the eu 's eastward expansion and subsequent downward pressure on wages in germany , opposition conservatives have stoked debate over the introduction of minimum wages , saying they 're ready to support such a move .

experts believe that downward pressure on wages in germany will continue this year unless berlin takes decisive steps to curb the influx of cheap labor from eastern europe . chasing " black sheep " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the construction industry already has regulations in place to prevent wage dumping .
the task force in the german economics and finance ministry will in future conduct bilateral talks with the 10 new member states in order to push them to uphold eu labor and services law .
the new working group is also meant to create clear criteria for service providers , branches , companies as well as workers from the new member states . gerd andres , parliamentary under secretary in the german economics ministry , said the authorities should go after " black sheep " and prevent eastern european firms from bypassing eu laws to the detriment of the german labor market and economy . germany did insist on and achieve a seven-year freeze on people from the new member states from getting automatic access to the german labor market in the run up to the eu 's eastward expansion last year .
but immediately upon entry , companies in poland and the other new member states gained the right to sell business services in the rest of the eu .
just last month , chancellor gerhard schröder had to intervene in eu plans to liberalize services which would have thrown the doors further open for cheap labor from the east . under eu law , workers sent to a different country for a short-term contract must receive the minimum social benefits and wages of the state where they are carrying out the project . this doesn ’ t apply , however , to self-employed workers and foreign subcontractors .
in germany , the meat-packing industry has been particularly affected .
tens of thousands of workers lost their jobs in recent months , as their work is increasingly being done by companies from poland and hungary who essentially " lend " their foreign workers to companies here .
the wages the easterners receive are between just three and five euros an hour . expanding minimum wages in addition , the new task force is meant to examine whether the minimum wage rule that applies to the german building sector , one of the few industries that does have such a provision , can be expanded to other areas . unlike other eu countries , germany does not have a general minimum wage , because such a law was long considered to be an infringement of the right for industrial sectors to have their own pay scales .
but , now with low-wage workers from eastern europe squeezing germans out of jobs at a time of record unemployment and key regional elections coming up in the state of north rhine-westphalia next month , chancellor schröder is considering extending the law . " we 'll take a look at whether the anti-dumping law that applies to the building trade can be gradually extended to take in other sectors , " schröder said on wednesday .
" the aim is to make sure that dumping incidents do not ruin good companies that are unable to compete with such low wages . ” employers against minimum wages however , not everybody is happy with the idea of legally-set minimum wages .
german employers say it would be counterproductive as job opportunities for unskilled german workers would be lost .
in addition they claim companies would be burdened with the costs of greater bureaucracy . the institute for labor market and job research -lrb- iab -rrb- said that a minimum wage in individual sectors would help to reduce the pressure on wages in germany through eastward expansion , provided it was just a temporary measure . ulrich walwei , deputy head of the iab told the daily berliner zeitung that the government also had to be careful in its selection of sectors to introduce a temporary minimum wage in order to avoid damaging competition . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate flares up over minimum wages with the eu 's eastward expansion and subsequent downward pressure on wages in germany , opposition conservatives have stoked debate over the introduction of minimum wages , saying they 're ready to support such a move .

because at a time when job seekers have it tough , his job auctions are won by those willing to work for the least pay .

experts believe that downward pressure on wages in germany will continue this year unless berlin takes decisive steps to curb the influx of cheap labor from eastern europe . chasing " black sheep " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the construction industry already has regulations in place to prevent wage dumping .
the task force in the german economics and finance ministry will in future conduct bilateral talks with the 10 new member states in order to push them to uphold eu labor and services law .
the new working group is also meant to create clear criteria for service providers , branches , companies as well as workers from the new member states . gerd andres , parliamentary under secretary in the german economics ministry , said the authorities should go after " black sheep " and prevent eastern european firms from bypassing eu laws to the detriment of the german labor market and economy . germany did insist on and achieve a seven-year freeze on people from the new member states from getting automatic access to the german labor market in the run up to the eu 's eastward expansion last year .
but immediately upon entry , companies in poland and the other new member states gained the right to sell business services in the rest of the eu .
just last month , chancellor gerhard schröder had to intervene in eu plans to liberalize services which would have thrown the doors further open for cheap labor from the east . under eu law , workers sent to a different country for a short-term contract must receive the minimum social benefits and wages of the state where they are carrying out the project . this doesn ’ t apply , however , to self-employed workers and foreign subcontractors .
in germany , the meat-packing industry has been particularly affected .
tens of thousands of workers lost their jobs in recent months , as their work is increasingly being done by companies from poland and hungary who essentially " lend " their foreign workers to companies here .
the wages the easterners receive are between just three and five euros an hour . expanding minimum wages in addition , the new task force is meant to examine whether the minimum wage rule that applies to the german building sector , one of the few industries that does have such a provision , can be expanded to other areas . unlike other eu countries , germany does not have a general minimum wage , because such a law was long considered to be an infringement of the right for industrial sectors to have their own pay scales .
but , now with low-wage workers from eastern europe squeezing germans out of jobs at a time of record unemployment and key regional elections coming up in the state of north rhine-westphalia next month , chancellor schröder is considering extending the law . " we 'll take a look at whether the anti-dumping law that applies to the building trade can be gradually extended to take in other sectors , " schröder said on wednesday .
" the aim is to make sure that dumping incidents do not ruin good companies that are unable to compete with such low wages . ” employers against minimum wages however , not everybody is happy with the idea of legally-set minimum wages .
german employers say it would be counterproductive as job opportunities for unskilled german workers would be lost .
in addition they claim companies would be burdened with the costs of greater bureaucracy . the institute for labor market and job research -lrb- iab -rrb- said that a minimum wage in individual sectors would help to reduce the pressure on wages in germany through eastward expansion , provided it was just a temporary measure . ulrich walwei , deputy head of the iab told the daily berliner zeitung that the government also had to be careful in its selection of sectors to introduce a temporary minimum wage in order to avoid damaging competition . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate flares up over minimum wages with the eu 's eastward expansion and subsequent downward pressure on wages in germany , opposition conservatives have stoked debate over the introduction of minimum wages , saying they 're ready to support such a move .

experts believe that downward pressure on wages in germany will continue this year unless berlin takes decisive steps to curb the influx of cheap labor from eastern europe . chasing " black sheep " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the construction industry already has regulations in place to prevent wage dumping .
the task force in the german economics and finance ministry will in future conduct bilateral talks with the 10 new member states in order to push them to uphold eu labor and services law .
the new working group is also meant to create clear criteria for service providers , branches , companies as well as workers from the new member states . gerd andres , parliamentary under secretary in the german economics ministry , said the authorities should go after " black sheep " and prevent eastern european firms from bypassing eu laws to the detriment of the german labor market and economy . germany did insist on and achieve a seven-year freeze on people from the new member states from getting automatic access to the german labor market in the run up to the eu 's eastward expansion last year .
but immediately upon entry , companies in poland and the other new member states gained the right to sell business services in the rest of the eu .
just last month , chancellor gerhard schröder had to intervene in eu plans to liberalize services which would have thrown the doors further open for cheap labor from the east . under eu law , workers sent to a different country for a short-term contract must receive the minimum social benefits and wages of the state where they are carrying out the project . this doesn ’ t apply , however , to self-employed workers and foreign subcontractors .
in germany , the meat-packing industry has been particularly affected .
tens of thousands of workers lost their jobs in recent months , as their work is increasingly being done by companies from poland and hungary who essentially " lend " their foreign workers to companies here .
the wages the easterners receive are between just three and five euros an hour . expanding minimum wages in addition , the new task force is meant to examine whether the minimum wage rule that applies to the german building sector , one of the few industries that does have such a provision , can be expanded to other areas . unlike other eu countries , germany does not have a general minimum wage , because such a law was long considered to be an infringement of the right for industrial sectors to have their own pay scales .
but , now with low-wage workers from eastern europe squeezing germans out of jobs at a time of record unemployment and key regional elections coming up in the state of north rhine-westphalia next month , chancellor schröder is considering extending the law . " we 'll take a look at whether the anti-dumping law that applies to the building trade can be gradually extended to take in other sectors , " schröder said on wednesday .
" the aim is to make sure that dumping incidents do not ruin good companies that are unable to compete with such low wages . ” employers against minimum wages however , not everybody is happy with the idea of legally-set minimum wages .
german employers say it would be counterproductive as job opportunities for unskilled german workers would be lost .
in addition they claim companies would be burdened with the costs of greater bureaucracy . the institute for labor market and job research -lrb- iab -rrb- said that a minimum wage in individual sectors would help to reduce the pressure on wages in germany through eastward expansion , provided it was just a temporary measure . ulrich walwei , deputy head of the iab told the daily berliner zeitung that the government also had to be careful in its selection of sectors to introduce a temporary minimum wage in order to avoid damaging competition . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate flares up over minimum wages with the eu 's eastward expansion and subsequent downward pressure on wages in germany , opposition conservatives have stoked debate over the introduction of minimum wages , saying they 're ready to support such a move .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.04.2005 germans question european arrest warrant großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german judges are set to decide on europe-wide extraditions the simplified extradition regulations for suspected criminals within the eu have been criticized ever since they came into effect .
the highest court in germany is now turning its attention to it . effective and swift cooperation - that 's what 's always been demanded on the legal level in europe .
towards that end , the european warrant arrest was introduced in the bloc early last year .
it aims to simplify extradition procedures for suspected criminals within the european union . but , not many eu members are really happy about it , with many preferring to retain elements of the old procedure .
that may seem odd given that the old regulation was rather cumbersome .
for instance , earlier the suspected crime had to be punishable and allowed to be pursued by the law both in the home country of the suspected criminal as well as in the nation that he was to be extradited to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money laundering and counterfeiting are included on the so-called " positive list of criminal areas . "
the new regulation has been significantly simplified in this regard : when the suspected crime is included on a so-called " positive list of criminal areas , " then the criminal can be extradited . the problem however is that the list is too vague .
" for example : what exactly does sabotage mean ? " said helmut satzger , professor for european criminal law at the university of munich .
" we do n't have a provision on the books to deal with sabotage in german law , " satzger said .
the same is true for racism and xenophobia . criticism is growing in germany about the european arrest warrant and its apparent contradictions and the german constitution court in karlsruhe is set to grapple with the topic in detail for the first time this week . different legal systems in many other cases , the crime must be punishable in both states much as was the case earlier .
despite that , there are huge differences in various eu states regarding the severity of the crime .
the differing legal systems in the eu member states have prompted concerns among german lawyers ' groups , law professors and lawyers .
how for instance , they ask , can a ruling of greek courts be accepted in germany when there are completely different laws here ? these worries are shared by other eu members states too and some have reacted .
" for example there are states like denmark who have n't translated the new regulations in binding law , " said satzger .
others such as france have reserved the right to examine the dual criminality principle contained in the european arrest warrant . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic militant metin kaplan was extradited to turkey by germany after a long-drawn out legal battle .
he was extradited on charges of treason for allegedly masterminding a failed plot to crash an airplane into the mausoleum of the founder of secular turkey .
but , it 's not just differing laws in eu states that have prompted worries .
even bans on extradition of criminals are problematic .
the eu so far recognizes only three hindrances to extradition : the already existing punishment of the criminal in his home country , if he 's not criminally liable due to underage , or an amnesty .
as against that member states can no longer refuse to surrender to another member state their own citizens on the ground that they are nationals . no appeal in the home country possible " for example , if lithuania issued such an arrest warrant against a german then germany must surrender its national to lithuania , " said satzger .
that means , that the german national could not protest that the crime is n't punishable in germany .
" if the suspected criminal does n't know lithuania , if he has no idea of the lithuanian legal system and if he also does n't exactly know for example how the mandatory defense counsel would work , then we 're dealing with certain problems here , " said satzger . long before the european warrant arrest actually too effect , a few german constitutional court judges had strongly criticized the procedure .
" the german constitutional court has undertaken a big task in the respect : the judges are using the arrest warrant to answer some very fundamental questions about the relationship between european law and national law , " said satzger . he added that most member states had accepted that european law would override national constitutional law .
but , germany 's not convinced . daphne antachopoulos -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the trouble with nailing terror suspects another terror trial without a hard conviction this week has illustrated once more the difficulties the german judiciary has in putting terror suspects behind bars .

the 4-2 defeat in london a week earlier meant the victory was a hollow one .
bayern were eliminated . bayern munich 's dreams of european glory ended in dramatic style in the olympic stadium on tuesday night as english premiership side chelsea swept into the semi-finals of the champions league at the expense of the german bundesliga leaders despite losing 3-2 . although bayern were winners on the night , the 4-2 defeat at stamford bridge last week was enough to earn the premiership leaders a 6-5 aggregate victory and send felix magath 's side crashing out . it is the second successive season chelsea have reached the semi-finals of europe 's premier competition and they will hope to make amends for last season 's shock 5-3 aggregate defeat by monaco . chelsea led 4-2 from the first leg and england international frank lampard scored on the hour mark - his third goal against bayern in six days - to ensure bayern had to score three times .
" another deflected goal from chelsea , " said bayern coach magath .
" chelsea were not better than us they were just more fortunate and clinical in front of goal . " missed chances cost bayern dearly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : didier drogba is congratulated at the end of the match in munich by team mate eidur gudjonsson .
bayern scored three goals through claudio pizarro -lrb- 65 -rrb- and late goals from substitutes mehmet scholl and paolo guerrero both in stoppage time but it was their earlier profligacy that cost them dear .
bayern were eventually punished by ivory coast star didier drogba who scored the decisive goal for chelsea with 10 minutes to go . chelsea 's portuguese manager jose mourinho - still suspended by uefa - was amongst the capacity 59,000 fans watching from the stands and will be delighted as his charges scored twice to ensure bayern 's late goal fest was irrelevant . fitness coach rui faria was mourinho 's representative at the press conference and revealed the manager left the stadium because he felt his privacy was being invaded .
" jose will be delighted with the result but he left the stands because he could not watch the match in peace , " revealed faria .
" he went back to the hotel and watched us progress from there . " chelsea face the prospect of an all english semi-final clash with four-time european cup winners liverpool although italian giants juventus will fancy their chances of overturning a 2-1 deficit in turin on wednesday . bayern made four changes with dutch international roy makaay and peru star pizarro back to form their attacking partnership . first and fatal goal to chelsea manager magath claimed conceding the first goal would be ' fatal ' and it almost happened in the second minute with drogba - a lone target-man - rushing on to a through pass . bayern custodian oliver kahn came storming out to block his path and magath breathed a sigh of relief , although it was later to turn to despair . hosts munich then seized the initiative and german international michael ballack - at the centre of a diving storm in the first leg - saw his goal-bound shot blocked in the fifth minute and blazed his follow-up high over the crossbar .
pizarro then forced a brilliant point blank save from chelsea 's czech international goalkeeper petr cech in a thrilling first quarter hour . bastian schweinsteiger was causing havoc down the right flank and a goal looked inevitable but it was chelsea who scored it against the run of play .
in the 30th minute , joe cole fed england international team-mate lampard and the midfielder 's shot ricocheted off brazilian defender lucio sending kahn the wrong way . " the first goal was very fortunate , " said bayern defender sagnol .
" but to be honest the damage was done in the first leg . " munich hit again while chasing the game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england 's frank lampard opened the scoring in the olympic stadium .
it was more bad luck for lucio who deflected in cole 's first goal in the 4-2 first leg defeat at stamford bridge .
lampard 's deflected effort meant bayern needed to score three goals to go through and ballack should have got one of them in the 38th minute when he strangely chose to play the ball across the face of goal instead of shooting himself . bayern pulled off martin demichelis for the more inventive mehmet scholl early in the second half .
bayern were handed a lifeline in the 65th minute when cech could only parry a ballack header on to the post and the ball rolled kindly to pizarro who stroked the ball in to level the scores . with 25 minutes left to score twice bayern hit the crossbar through a deflected bixente lizarazu cross and then eidur gudjohnsen cleared off the line as chelsea began to wobble . but with 10 minutes left the excellent cole crossed for drogba to bullet a header past kahn and bayern knew the game was up .
guerrero and scholl both scored in stoppage time but bayern were left cursing having conceded six goals over the two legs . bayern 's star midfielder michael ballack said : " it 's annoying .
we were the best team and we deserved to go through .

and indeed it appears that the german foreign office readily employed former nazi officials who were looking for work immediately after the war . efforts are now underway to open up the ministry 's recent past to public scrutiny , according to klaus scharioth , undersecretary in the foreign ministry .
" we need to look into the history of the foreign office under the nazis in a systematic manner , " he said on monday .
" foreign minister joschka fischer is currently thinking of establishing an independent panel of historians who would carry out this task . " fischer has come under fire from senior members of his ministry for refusing to allow full obituaries of former nazi party members to be published in the ministry 's in-house newsletter .
he took the decision after it became known that posthumous tributes had been paid to franz nüsslein , a convicted war criminal . safe in franco 's spain the scandal was uncovered by marga henseler , a member of the ministry 's staff who has since retired .
" i could n't believe my eyes when i saw the obituary , " she said .
" i immediately wrote a letter to joschka fischer urging him not to tolerate this . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers in occupied prague , march 1939 franz nüsslein was a former nazi prosecutor in german-occupied czechoslovakia where he was involved in numerous death sentences handed down to the enemies of nazi germany .
after the war , a court in prague sentenced him to 20 years in prison for war crimes , but he was released after serving only seven years . henseler recalled that nüsslein joined the foreign service shortly thereafter .
" in the ministry rumors were quickly making the rounds that he did time in prague , " she said .
" so everybody knew about his past .
there were some protests internally , after which nüsslein was quickly moved to the mission in barcelona in spain , where dictator franco ruled at the time and where nothing could happen to him anymore . "
purging the remnants bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the foreign ministry in berlin earlier this year , joschka fischer also refused to pay full tribute to franz krapf , a former ss and nazi party member who later became germany 's ambassador to nato .
fischer 's actions provoked a revolt by some 70 diplomats who publicly accused the foreign minister of applying double standards in a reference to his own past as a leftist militant . although weakened by a different scandal over lax visa regulations , fischer appears determined to battle on in this dispute , which historians say should have reached the public domain long ago .
ministry sources say fischer is now planning an internal reshuffle of posts in what appears to be an effort to finally purge the foreign ministry of the last remnants of nazism . uwe hessler -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former diplomats turn against fischer several ex-diplomats in germany have struck out against their former boss joschka fischer for his role in the visa scandal .

and indeed it appears that the german foreign office readily employed former nazi officials who were looking for work immediately after the war . efforts are now underway to open up the ministry 's recent past to public scrutiny , according to klaus scharioth , undersecretary in the foreign ministry .
" we need to look into the history of the foreign office under the nazis in a systematic manner , " he said on monday .
" foreign minister joschka fischer is currently thinking of establishing an independent panel of historians who would carry out this task . " fischer has come under fire from senior members of his ministry for refusing to allow full obituaries of former nazi party members to be published in the ministry 's in-house newsletter .
he took the decision after it became known that posthumous tributes had been paid to franz nüsslein , a convicted war criminal . safe in franco 's spain the scandal was uncovered by marga henseler , a member of the ministry 's staff who has since retired .
" i could n't believe my eyes when i saw the obituary , " she said .
" i immediately wrote a letter to joschka fischer urging him not to tolerate this . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers in occupied prague , march 1939 franz nüsslein was a former nazi prosecutor in german-occupied czechoslovakia where he was involved in numerous death sentences handed down to the enemies of nazi germany .
after the war , a court in prague sentenced him to 20 years in prison for war crimes , but he was released after serving only seven years . henseler recalled that nüsslein joined the foreign service shortly thereafter .
" in the ministry rumors were quickly making the rounds that he did time in prague , " she said .
" so everybody knew about his past .
there were some protests internally , after which nüsslein was quickly moved to the mission in barcelona in spain , where dictator franco ruled at the time and where nothing could happen to him anymore . "
purging the remnants bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the foreign ministry in berlin earlier this year , joschka fischer also refused to pay full tribute to franz krapf , a former ss and nazi party member who later became germany 's ambassador to nato .
fischer 's actions provoked a revolt by some 70 diplomats who publicly accused the foreign minister of applying double standards in a reference to his own past as a leftist militant . although weakened by a different scandal over lax visa regulations , fischer appears determined to battle on in this dispute , which historians say should have reached the public domain long ago .
ministry sources say fischer is now planning an internal reshuffle of posts in what appears to be an effort to finally purge the foreign ministry of the last remnants of nazism . uwe hessler -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former diplomats turn against fischer several ex-diplomats in germany have struck out against their former boss joschka fischer for his role in the visa scandal .

the 4-2 defeat in london a week earlier meant the victory was a hollow one .
bayern were eliminated . bayern munich 's dreams of european glory ended in dramatic style in the olympic stadium on tuesday night as english premiership side chelsea swept into the semi-finals of the champions league at the expense of the german bundesliga leaders despite losing 3-2 . although bayern were winners on the night , the 4-2 defeat at stamford bridge last week was enough to earn the premiership leaders a 6-5 aggregate victory and send felix magath 's side crashing out . it is the second successive season chelsea have reached the semi-finals of europe 's premier competition and they will hope to make amends for last season 's shock 5-3 aggregate defeat by monaco . chelsea led 4-2 from the first leg and england international frank lampard scored on the hour mark - his third goal against bayern in six days - to ensure bayern had to score three times .
" another deflected goal from chelsea , " said bayern coach magath .
" chelsea were not better than us they were just more fortunate and clinical in front of goal . " missed chances cost bayern dearly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : didier drogba is congratulated at the end of the match in munich by team mate eidur gudjonsson .
bayern scored three goals through claudio pizarro -lrb- 65 -rrb- and late goals from substitutes mehmet scholl and paolo guerrero both in stoppage time but it was their earlier profligacy that cost them dear .
bayern were eventually punished by ivory coast star didier drogba who scored the decisive goal for chelsea with 10 minutes to go . chelsea 's portuguese manager jose mourinho - still suspended by uefa - was amongst the capacity 59,000 fans watching from the stands and will be delighted as his charges scored twice to ensure bayern 's late goal fest was irrelevant . fitness coach rui faria was mourinho 's representative at the press conference and revealed the manager left the stadium because he felt his privacy was being invaded .
" jose will be delighted with the result but he left the stands because he could not watch the match in peace , " revealed faria .
" he went back to the hotel and watched us progress from there . " chelsea face the prospect of an all english semi-final clash with four-time european cup winners liverpool although italian giants juventus will fancy their chances of overturning a 2-1 deficit in turin on wednesday . bayern made four changes with dutch international roy makaay and peru star pizarro back to form their attacking partnership . first and fatal goal to chelsea manager magath claimed conceding the first goal would be ' fatal ' and it almost happened in the second minute with drogba - a lone target-man - rushing on to a through pass . bayern custodian oliver kahn came storming out to block his path and magath breathed a sigh of relief , although it was later to turn to despair . hosts munich then seized the initiative and german international michael ballack - at the centre of a diving storm in the first leg - saw his goal-bound shot blocked in the fifth minute and blazed his follow-up high over the crossbar .
pizarro then forced a brilliant point blank save from chelsea 's czech international goalkeeper petr cech in a thrilling first quarter hour . bastian schweinsteiger was causing havoc down the right flank and a goal looked inevitable but it was chelsea who scored it against the run of play .
in the 30th minute , joe cole fed england international team-mate lampard and the midfielder 's shot ricocheted off brazilian defender lucio sending kahn the wrong way . " the first goal was very fortunate , " said bayern defender sagnol .
" but to be honest the damage was done in the first leg . " munich hit again while chasing the game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england 's frank lampard opened the scoring in the olympic stadium .
it was more bad luck for lucio who deflected in cole 's first goal in the 4-2 first leg defeat at stamford bridge .
lampard 's deflected effort meant bayern needed to score three goals to go through and ballack should have got one of them in the 38th minute when he strangely chose to play the ball across the face of goal instead of shooting himself . bayern pulled off martin demichelis for the more inventive mehmet scholl early in the second half .
bayern were handed a lifeline in the 65th minute when cech could only parry a ballack header on to the post and the ball rolled kindly to pizarro who stroked the ball in to level the scores . with 25 minutes left to score twice bayern hit the crossbar through a deflected bixente lizarazu cross and then eidur gudjohnsen cleared off the line as chelsea began to wobble . but with 10 minutes left the excellent cole crossed for drogba to bullet a header past kahn and bayern knew the game was up .

and indeed it appears that the german foreign office readily employed former nazi officials who were looking for work immediately after the war . efforts are now underway to open up the ministry 's recent past to public scrutiny , according to klaus scharioth , undersecretary in the foreign ministry .
" we need to look into the history of the foreign office under the nazis in a systematic manner , " he said on monday .
" foreign minister joschka fischer is currently thinking of establishing an independent panel of historians who would carry out this task . " fischer has come under fire from senior members of his ministry for refusing to allow full obituaries of former nazi party members to be published in the ministry 's in-house newsletter .
he took the decision after it became known that posthumous tributes had been paid to franz nüsslein , a convicted war criminal . safe in franco 's spain the scandal was uncovered by marga henseler , a member of the ministry 's staff who has since retired .

the aim of the system was to make it easier for terror suspects to be transferred between eu member states and to boost cooperation in the war on terrorism . but darkazanli 's lawyers are expected to argue before the court in karlsruhe that the eu arrest warrants are in breach of the german constitution , because their client can be handed over to face charges abroad that could not be brought against him in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : were the court to uphold darkazanli 's argument , it would seriously undermine one of the bloc 's main anti-terrorist security initiatives . wider implications german justice minister brigitte zypries said such a ruling would be detrimental to german cooperation in the eu 's joint fight against crime .

german authorities want to extradite mamoun darkazanli to spain , where he is accused of being an al-qaeda associate . mamoun darkazanli 's extradition was requested by madrid under a controversial new system of eu arrest warrants introduced last year .
the aim of the system was to make it easier for terror suspects to be transferred between eu member states and to boost cooperation in the war on terrorism . but darkazanli 's lawyers are expected to argue before the court in karlsruhe that the eu arrest warrants are in breach of the german constitution , because their client can be handed over to face charges abroad that could not be brought against him in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : were the court to uphold darkazanli 's argument , it would seriously undermine one of the bloc 's main anti-terrorist security initiatives . wider implications german justice minister brigitte zypries said such a ruling would be detrimental to german cooperation in the eu 's joint fight against crime .
but she said she doubted the case would stand up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte zypries " i think the eu arrest warrant as a whole is not in violation , and in this concrete case there is even less evidence of that , " she told deutschlandfunk radio . michael rosenthal , darkazanli 's lawyer , said he would argue the measure is unconstitutional because it was introduced under a binding " framework decision " by eu ministers , and the parliament therefore had no choice but to approve it . " our constitutional appeal says : that is not democracy , " he told reuters . other legal experts believe an outcome in favor of darkazanli would have wider implications and introduce the possibility of challenges to other eu measures and even to the bloc 's new constitution , due to be ratified by parliament this year . logistical and financial support the 46-year-old darkazanli , a businessman who has dual syrian and german nationality , has been in custody in hamburg since last october and will not attend the hearings . he stands accused by the us of financing al qaeda and was one of 35 people charged by spanish judge baltasar garzon in september 2003 with belonging to the terrorist network . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marienstr .
54 was the base of the hamburg al qaeda cell he has also been investigated by german authorities for links to the hamburg cell which masterminded and executed the 9/11 attacks on new york and washington in 2001 . garzon 's charge sheet says he carried out " logistics support and financing activity , " including the purchase of a cargo vessel for its leader osama bin laden in december 1993 . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany agrees on al qaeda suspect 's extradition mamoun darkazanli , the syrian-german accused of being a member of al qaeda 's 9/11 hamburg cell , could soon face extradition proceedings after german authorities cleared his case to go before a court hearing . -lrb- oct .

an example of the modern tendency to always look around the corner for something better ?

why do 14 percent of the world 's mobile phone users report that they have interrupted sex to answer a beeping wireless device ? " people ca n't bear to miss a call , " said christine hannis , head of communications for bbdo europe , which conducted the study along with proximity worldwide .

and getting so many calls proves social success , " she said .
" it fulfills a fundamental insecurity . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany and spain , then , appear to have the highest levels of insecurity , with 22 percent in both countries reporting that grabbing that call was more important than finishing the task at hand -lrb- or at other parts of the anatomy -rrb- .
the lowest incidence of what might be called cellulus interruptus was reported in italy , where only 7 percent of mobile phone users picked up the phone during sex . perhaps the sex is just better there . it 's not that mobile phones and sex are enemies , or even strangers .
more than half of the respondents to the same survey , 52 percent , reported they used a mobile phone to flirt .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 13.04.2005 bayern 's dream dies in european thriller großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oli kahn ca n't believe it as chelsea 's first goal is deflected past him bayern munich stumbled at the quarter-final hurdle in the uefa champions league on tuesday despite beating chelsea 3-2 .
the 4-2 defeat in london a week earlier meant the victory was a hollow one .
bayern were eliminated . bayern munich 's dreams of european glory ended in dramatic style in the olympic stadium on tuesday night as english premiership side chelsea swept into the semi-finals of the champions league at the expense of the german bundesliga leaders despite losing 3-2 . although bayern were winners on the night , the 4-2 defeat at stamford bridge last week was enough to earn the premiership leaders a 6-5 aggregate victory and send felix magath 's side crashing out . it is the second successive season chelsea have reached the semi-finals of europe 's premier competition and they will hope to make amends for last season 's shock 5-3 aggregate defeat by monaco . chelsea led 4-2 from the first leg and england international frank lampard scored on the hour mark - his third goal against bayern in six days - to ensure bayern had to score three times .
" another deflected goal from chelsea , " said bayern coach magath .
" chelsea were not better than us they were just more fortunate and clinical in front of goal . " missed chances cost bayern dearly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : didier drogba is congratulated at the end of the match in munich by team mate eidur gudjonsson .
bayern scored three goals through claudio pizarro -lrb- 65 -rrb- and late goals from substitutes mehmet scholl and paolo guerrero both in stoppage time but it was their earlier profligacy that cost them dear .
bayern were eventually punished by ivory coast star didier drogba who scored the decisive goal for chelsea with 10 minutes to go . chelsea 's portuguese manager jose mourinho - still suspended by uefa - was amongst the capacity 59,000 fans watching from the stands and will be delighted as his charges scored twice to ensure bayern 's late goal fest was irrelevant . fitness coach rui faria was mourinho 's representative at the press conference and revealed the manager left the stadium because he felt his privacy was being invaded .
" jose will be delighted with the result but he left the stands because he could not watch the match in peace , " revealed faria .
" he went back to the hotel and watched us progress from there . " chelsea face the prospect of an all english semi-final clash with four-time european cup winners liverpool although italian giants juventus will fancy their chances of overturning a 2-1 deficit in turin on wednesday . bayern made four changes with dutch international roy makaay and peru star pizarro back to form their attacking partnership . first and fatal goal to chelsea manager magath claimed conceding the first goal would be ' fatal ' and it almost happened in the second minute with drogba - a lone target-man - rushing on to a through pass . bayern custodian oliver kahn came storming out to block his path and magath breathed a sigh of relief , although it was later to turn to despair . hosts munich then seized the initiative and german international michael ballack - at the centre of a diving storm in the first leg - saw his goal-bound shot blocked in the fifth minute and blazed his follow-up high over the crossbar .
pizarro then forced a brilliant point blank save from chelsea 's czech international goalkeeper petr cech in a thrilling first quarter hour . bastian schweinsteiger was causing havoc down the right flank and a goal looked inevitable but it was chelsea who scored it against the run of play .
in the 30th minute , joe cole fed england international team-mate lampard and the midfielder 's shot ricocheted off brazilian defender lucio sending kahn the wrong way . " the first goal was very fortunate , " said bayern defender sagnol .
" but to be honest the damage was done in the first leg . " munich hit again while chasing the game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england 's frank lampard opened the scoring in the olympic stadium .
it was more bad luck for lucio who deflected in cole 's first goal in the 4-2 first leg defeat at stamford bridge .
lampard 's deflected effort meant bayern needed to score three goals to go through and ballack should have got one of them in the 38th minute when he strangely chose to play the ball across the face of goal instead of shooting himself . bayern pulled off martin demichelis for the more inventive mehmet scholl early in the second half .
bayern were handed a lifeline in the 65th minute when cech could only parry a ballack header on to the post and the ball rolled kindly to pizarro who stroked the ball in to level the scores . with 25 minutes left to score twice bayern hit the crossbar through a deflected bixente lizarazu cross and then eidur gudjohnsen cleared off the line as chelsea began to wobble . but with 10 minutes left the excellent cole crossed for drogba to bullet a header past kahn and bayern knew the game was up .
guerrero and scholl both scored in stoppage time but bayern were left cursing having conceded six goals over the two legs . bayern 's star midfielder michael ballack said : " it 's annoying .
we were the best team and we deserved to go through .
we had numerous chances and should have got something out of tonight .

many who were babies or children during the war are still suffering from the trauma they experienced 60 years ago . in his speech commemorating the liberation of buchenwald concentration camp , chancellor gerhard schröder said remembering germany 's past - national socialism , war and genocide - was part of germany 's identity and , at the same time , " a permanent moral responsibility . "
yet there is a significant part of this past that has been neglected .
" it is surprising that the generation of children , who were born during the war and spent a large part of their childhood in the war , have until recently been remarkably silent about their biographies and appeared unaffected , " said dr. michael ermann , head of the war childhood project at munich 's ludwig-maximilians-university .
" their speechlessness found a counterpart in the little interest that the public showed for their fate , " ermann told german radio südwestrundfunk .
it is only in recent years that historians , psychoanalysts and german society are taking a closer look at these " kriegskinder " or children of war .
an international convention on the generation of war children is meeting in frankfurt this week to discuss the damage that the war and its effects had on people 's souls .
a robbed childhood dr. hartmut radebold , a former professor of clinical psychology at the university of kassel and the founder of germany 's geriatric psychotherapy , said these children were subject to suffering in three major areas .
" they faced violence , they had to deal with separation and loss of loved ones , and they had to come to terms with losing their homes , safety and security , " said radebold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many children had to flee their homes the psychiatrist helga spranger , one of the founding members of the war child association kriegskind.de and herself a war child , described the lives of children during the war in the international journal of evacuee and war child studies .
" children were separated from their parents , orphaned , evacuated by force , displaced , kidnapped , shot at , bombed , wounded , mutilated , raped , expropriated , blackmailed , adopted by force , drafted at an early age and forced into labor , " spranger wrote .
" in short , they suffered from stress for months or years and were basically robbed of their childhood . "
the horrors these children experienced continued to brew under the surface .
" it costs endless energy to keep it inside for decades , " said ermann .
haunted by memories in recent years , an increasing number of war children have suffered from agonizing health problems , as their trauma finally rises to the surface .
according to radebold , many are diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder .
" they are haunted by their memories and the terrors they experienced and are overwhelmed by them , " he said .
symptoms include jumpiness , restlessness , sleep disorders or withdrawal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sound of a plane can often trigger the trauma there are also many images that are burned into their minds , which trigger their trauma , said spranger .
" aside from the basic feelings of fear of death or abandonment , disgust and wishes of escaping , lasting horrifying impressions are hidden in the memories for a lifetime , " said spranger , such as the smell of burned houses , animals and humans after firebombs , hearing sirens or the shooting of weapons .
but despite their anguish , many war children have still been hesitant to talk .
sabine bode , author of the book " die vergessene generation " or " the lost generation , " looked at the stories of these war children to trace how their experiences shaped their lives .
she said her search for stories was tough .
" most of the people i spoke to fended off my questions with remarks like ' others were much worse off than i was ' or ' it did n't hurt us ' , " said bode .
" i rarely heard anyone complain about their fate .
i have the impression that despite the frequently observed trait that germans like to see themselves as victims , former war children of all people were in no way whiny about their past . "
history is a clogged toilet there are several reasons why these stories are only coming to the surface now .
many experiences were " re-awakened " through the images of other more recent wars , such as in kosovo or iraq .
that fact that these war children have reached retirement age also plays a role .
" in old age , you ca n't repress things as easily anymore , " said bode .
a profession also acts as a stabilizing factor for someone 's identity , said radebold .
" so when these war children retire , they have more time on their hands to think and with this time , come the memories , " he said .
in certain cases , trauma can be reactivated .
" this means that old memories are reawakened through a siren or an airplane that sounds similar to the ones during the war , " said radebold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " crabwalk " by günter grass was published in 2002 but bode said that war children also needed a form of " permission " to open their souls .
and this was given to them by nobel prize winner günter grass .
" he said , we also have to attend to germans ' problems after the war , " said bode .
" history or , to be more precise , the history we germans have repeatedly mucked up , is a clogged toilet .
we flush and flush , but the shit keeps rising , " grass wrote in his book " crabwalk , " published in 2002 .

haunted by memories in recent years , an increasing number of war children have suffered from agonizing health problems , as their trauma finally rises to the surface .
according to radebold , many are diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder .
" they are haunted by their memories and the terrors they experienced and are overwhelmed by them , " he said .
symptoms include jumpiness , restlessness , sleep disorders or withdrawal .

history is a clogged toilet there are several reasons why these stories are only coming to the surface now .
many experiences were " re-awakened " through the images of other more recent wars , such as in kosovo or iraq .

many who were babies or children during the war are still suffering from the trauma they experienced 60 years ago . in his speech commemorating the liberation of buchenwald concentration camp , chancellor gerhard schröder said remembering germany 's past - national socialism , war and genocide - was part of germany 's identity and , at the same time , " a permanent moral responsibility . "
yet there is a significant part of this past that has been neglected .
" it is surprising that the generation of children , who were born during the war and spent a large part of their childhood in the war , have until recently been remarkably silent about their biographies and appeared unaffected , " said dr. michael ermann , head of the war childhood project at munich 's ludwig-maximilians-university .
" their speechlessness found a counterpart in the little interest that the public showed for their fate , " ermann told german radio südwestrundfunk .
it is only in recent years that historians , psychoanalysts and german society are taking a closer look at these " kriegskinder " or children of war .
an international convention on the generation of war children is meeting in frankfurt this week to discuss the damage that the war and its effects had on people 's souls .
a robbed childhood dr. hartmut radebold , a former professor of clinical psychology at the university of kassel and the founder of germany 's geriatric psychotherapy , said these children were subject to suffering in three major areas .
" they faced violence , they had to deal with separation and loss of loved ones , and they had to come to terms with losing their homes , safety and security , " said radebold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many children had to flee their homes the psychiatrist helga spranger , one of the founding members of the war child association kriegskind.de and herself a war child , described the lives of children during the war in the international journal of evacuee and war child studies .
" children were separated from their parents , orphaned , evacuated by force , displaced , kidnapped , shot at , bombed , wounded , mutilated , raped , expropriated , blackmailed , adopted by force , drafted at an early age and forced into labor , " spranger wrote .
" in short , they suffered from stress for months or years and were basically robbed of their childhood . "
the horrors these children experienced continued to brew under the surface .

many who were babies or children during the war are still suffering from the trauma they experienced 60 years ago . in his speech commemorating the liberation of buchenwald concentration camp , chancellor gerhard schröder said remembering germany 's past - national socialism , war and genocide - was part of germany 's identity and , at the same time , " a permanent moral responsibility . "
yet there is a significant part of this past that has been neglected .
" it is surprising that the generation of children , who were born during the war and spent a large part of their childhood in the war , have until recently been remarkably silent about their biographies and appeared unaffected , " said dr. michael ermann , head of the war childhood project at munich 's ludwig-maximilians-university .
" their speechlessness found a counterpart in the little interest that the public showed for their fate , " ermann told german radio südwestrundfunk .
it is only in recent years that historians , psychoanalysts and german society are taking a closer look at these " kriegskinder " or children of war .
an international convention on the generation of war children is meeting in frankfurt this week to discuss the damage that the war and its effects had on people 's souls .
a robbed childhood dr. hartmut radebold , a former professor of clinical psychology at the university of kassel and the founder of germany 's geriatric psychotherapy , said these children were subject to suffering in three major areas .
" they faced violence , they had to deal with separation and loss of loved ones , and they had to come to terms with losing their homes , safety and security , " said radebold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many children had to flee their homes the psychiatrist helga spranger , one of the founding members of the war child association kriegskind.de and herself a war child , described the lives of children during the war in the international journal of evacuee and war child studies .
" children were separated from their parents , orphaned , evacuated by force , displaced , kidnapped , shot at , bombed , wounded , mutilated , raped , expropriated , blackmailed , adopted by force , drafted at an early age and forced into labor , " spranger wrote .
" in short , they suffered from stress for months or years and were basically robbed of their childhood . "
the horrors these children experienced continued to brew under the surface .
" it costs endless energy to keep it inside for decades , " said ermann .
haunted by memories in recent years , an increasing number of war children have suffered from agonizing health problems , as their trauma finally rises to the surface .
according to radebold , many are diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder .
" they are haunted by their memories and the terrors they experienced and are overwhelmed by them , " he said .
symptoms include jumpiness , restlessness , sleep disorders or withdrawal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sound of a plane can often trigger the trauma there are also many images that are burned into their minds , which trigger their trauma , said spranger .
" aside from the basic feelings of fear of death or abandonment , disgust and wishes of escaping , lasting horrifying impressions are hidden in the memories for a lifetime , " said spranger , such as the smell of burned houses , animals and humans after firebombs , hearing sirens or the shooting of weapons .
but despite their anguish , many war children have still been hesitant to talk .
sabine bode , author of the book " die vergessene generation " or " the lost generation , " looked at the stories of these war children to trace how their experiences shaped their lives .
she said her search for stories was tough .
" most of the people i spoke to fended off my questions with remarks like ' others were much worse off than i was ' or ' it did n't hurt us ' , " said bode .
" i rarely heard anyone complain about their fate .
i have the impression that despite the frequently observed trait that germans like to see themselves as victims , former war children of all people were in no way whiny about their past . "
history is a clogged toilet there are several reasons why these stories are only coming to the surface now .
many experiences were " re-awakened " through the images of other more recent wars , such as in kosovo or iraq .
that fact that these war children have reached retirement age also plays a role .
" in old age , you ca n't repress things as easily anymore , " said bode .
a profession also acts as a stabilizing factor for someone 's identity , said radebold .
" so when these war children retire , they have more time on their hands to think and with this time , come the memories , " he said .
in certain cases , trauma can be reactivated .
" this means that old memories are reawakened through a siren or an airplane that sounds similar to the ones during the war , " said radebold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " crabwalk " by günter grass was published in 2002 but bode said that war children also needed a form of " permission " to open their souls .
and this was given to them by nobel prize winner günter grass .
" he said , we also have to attend to germans ' problems after the war , " said bode .
" history or , to be more precise , the history we germans have repeatedly mucked up , is a clogged toilet .
we flush and flush , but the shit keeps rising , " grass wrote in his book " crabwalk , " published in 2002 .

a profession also acts as a stabilizing factor for someone 's identity , said radebold .
" so when these war children retire , they have more time on their hands to think and with this time , come the memories , " he said .
in certain cases , trauma can be reactivated .
" this means that old memories are reawakened through a siren or an airplane that sounds similar to the ones during the war , " said radebold .

many who were babies or children during the war are still suffering from the trauma they experienced 60 years ago . in his speech commemorating the liberation of buchenwald concentration camp , chancellor gerhard schröder said remembering germany 's past - national socialism , war and genocide - was part of germany 's identity and , at the same time , " a permanent moral responsibility . "
yet there is a significant part of this past that has been neglected .
" it is surprising that the generation of children , who were born during the war and spent a large part of their childhood in the war , have until recently been remarkably silent about their biographies and appeared unaffected , " said dr. michael ermann , head of the war childhood project at munich 's ludwig-maximilians-university .
" their speechlessness found a counterpart in the little interest that the public showed for their fate , " ermann told german radio südwestrundfunk .
it is only in recent years that historians , psychoanalysts and german society are taking a closer look at these " kriegskinder " or children of war .
an international convention on the generation of war children is meeting in frankfurt this week to discuss the damage that the war and its effects had on people 's souls .
a robbed childhood dr. hartmut radebold , a former professor of clinical psychology at the university of kassel and the founder of germany 's geriatric psychotherapy , said these children were subject to suffering in three major areas .
" they faced violence , they had to deal with separation and loss of loved ones , and they had to come to terms with losing their homes , safety and security , " said radebold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many children had to flee their homes the psychiatrist helga spranger , one of the founding members of the war child association kriegskind.de and herself a war child , described the lives of children during the war in the international journal of evacuee and war child studies .
" children were separated from their parents , orphaned , evacuated by force , displaced , kidnapped , shot at , bombed , wounded , mutilated , raped , expropriated , blackmailed , adopted by force , drafted at an early age and forced into labor , " spranger wrote .
" in short , they suffered from stress for months or years and were basically robbed of their childhood . "
the horrors these children experienced continued to brew under the surface .
" it costs endless energy to keep it inside for decades , " said ermann .
haunted by memories in recent years , an increasing number of war children have suffered from agonizing health problems , as their trauma finally rises to the surface .
according to radebold , many are diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder .
" they are haunted by their memories and the terrors they experienced and are overwhelmed by them , " he said .
symptoms include jumpiness , restlessness , sleep disorders or withdrawal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sound of a plane can often trigger the trauma there are also many images that are burned into their minds , which trigger their trauma , said spranger .
" aside from the basic feelings of fear of death or abandonment , disgust and wishes of escaping , lasting horrifying impressions are hidden in the memories for a lifetime , " said spranger , such as the smell of burned houses , animals and humans after firebombs , hearing sirens or the shooting of weapons .
but despite their anguish , many war children have still been hesitant to talk .
sabine bode , author of the book " die vergessene generation " or " the lost generation , " looked at the stories of these war children to trace how their experiences shaped their lives .
she said her search for stories was tough .
" most of the people i spoke to fended off my questions with remarks like ' others were much worse off than i was ' or ' it did n't hurt us ' , " said bode .
" i rarely heard anyone complain about their fate .
i have the impression that despite the frequently observed trait that germans like to see themselves as victims , former war children of all people were in no way whiny about their past . "
history is a clogged toilet there are several reasons why these stories are only coming to the surface now .
many experiences were " re-awakened " through the images of other more recent wars , such as in kosovo or iraq .
that fact that these war children have reached retirement age also plays a role .
" in old age , you ca n't repress things as easily anymore , " said bode .
a profession also acts as a stabilizing factor for someone 's identity , said radebold .
" so when these war children retire , they have more time on their hands to think and with this time , come the memories , " he said .
in certain cases , trauma can be reactivated .
" this means that old memories are reawakened through a siren or an airplane that sounds similar to the ones during the war , " said radebold .

and this was given to them by nobel prize winner günter grass .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.04.2005 war 's forgotten children break the silence 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children went back to school after the war but not to a normal life the traces of world war ii have faded but not disappeared for germans .
many who were babies or children during the war are still suffering from the trauma they experienced 60 years ago . in his speech commemorating the liberation of buchenwald concentration camp , chancellor gerhard schröder said remembering germany 's past - national socialism , war and genocide - was part of germany 's identity and , at the same time , " a permanent moral responsibility . "
yet there is a significant part of this past that has been neglected .
" it is surprising that the generation of children , who were born during the war and spent a large part of their childhood in the war , have until recently been remarkably silent about their biographies and appeared unaffected , " said dr. michael ermann , head of the war childhood project at munich 's ludwig-maximilians-university .
" their speechlessness found a counterpart in the little interest that the public showed for their fate , " ermann told german radio südwestrundfunk .
it is only in recent years that historians , psychoanalysts and german society are taking a closer look at these " kriegskinder " or children of war .
an international convention on the generation of war children is meeting in frankfurt this week to discuss the damage that the war and its effects had on people 's souls .
a robbed childhood dr. hartmut radebold , a former professor of clinical psychology at the university of kassel and the founder of germany 's geriatric psychotherapy , said these children were subject to suffering in three major areas .
" they faced violence , they had to deal with separation and loss of loved ones , and they had to come to terms with losing their homes , safety and security , " said radebold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many children had to flee their homes the psychiatrist helga spranger , one of the founding members of the war child association kriegskind.de and herself a war child , described the lives of children during the war in the international journal of evacuee and war child studies .
" children were separated from their parents , orphaned , evacuated by force , displaced , kidnapped , shot at , bombed , wounded , mutilated , raped , expropriated , blackmailed , adopted by force , drafted at an early age and forced into labor , " spranger wrote .
" in short , they suffered from stress for months or years and were basically robbed of their childhood . "
the horrors these children experienced continued to brew under the surface .
" it costs endless energy to keep it inside for decades , " said ermann .
haunted by memories in recent years , an increasing number of war children have suffered from agonizing health problems , as their trauma finally rises to the surface .
according to radebold , many are diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder .
" they are haunted by their memories and the terrors they experienced and are overwhelmed by them , " he said .
symptoms include jumpiness , restlessness , sleep disorders or withdrawal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sound of a plane can often trigger the trauma there are also many images that are burned into their minds , which trigger their trauma , said spranger .
" aside from the basic feelings of fear of death or abandonment , disgust and wishes of escaping , lasting horrifying impressions are hidden in the memories for a lifetime , " said spranger , such as the smell of burned houses , animals and humans after firebombs , hearing sirens or the shooting of weapons .
but despite their anguish , many war children have still been hesitant to talk .
sabine bode , author of the book " die vergessene generation " or " the lost generation , " looked at the stories of these war children to trace how their experiences shaped their lives .
she said her search for stories was tough .
" most of the people i spoke to fended off my questions with remarks like ' others were much worse off than i was ' or ' it did n't hurt us ' , " said bode .
" i rarely heard anyone complain about their fate .
i have the impression that despite the frequently observed trait that germans like to see themselves as victims , former war children of all people were in no way whiny about their past . "
history is a clogged toilet there are several reasons why these stories are only coming to the surface now .
many experiences were " re-awakened " through the images of other more recent wars , such as in kosovo or iraq .
that fact that these war children have reached retirement age also plays a role .
" in old age , you ca n't repress things as easily anymore , " said bode .
a profession also acts as a stabilizing factor for someone 's identity , said radebold .
" so when these war children retire , they have more time on their hands to think and with this time , come the memories , " he said .
in certain cases , trauma can be reactivated .
" this means that old memories are reawakened through a siren or an airplane that sounds similar to the ones during the war , " said radebold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " crabwalk " by günter grass was published in 2002 but bode said that war children also needed a form of " permission " to open their souls .
and this was given to them by nobel prize winner günter grass .
" he said , we also have to attend to germans ' problems after the war , " said bode .
" history or , to be more precise , the history we germans have repeatedly mucked up , is a clogged toilet .
we flush and flush , but the shit keeps rising , " grass wrote in his book " crabwalk , " published in 2002 .

many who were babies or children during the war are still suffering from the trauma they experienced 60 years ago . in his speech commemorating the liberation of buchenwald concentration camp , chancellor gerhard schröder said remembering germany 's past - national socialism , war and genocide - was part of germany 's identity and , at the same time , " a permanent moral responsibility . "
yet there is a significant part of this past that has been neglected .
" it is surprising that the generation of children , who were born during the war and spent a large part of their childhood in the war , have until recently been remarkably silent about their biographies and appeared unaffected , " said dr. michael ermann , head of the war childhood project at munich 's ludwig-maximilians-university .
" their speechlessness found a counterpart in the little interest that the public showed for their fate , " ermann told german radio südwestrundfunk .
it is only in recent years that historians , psychoanalysts and german society are taking a closer look at these " kriegskinder " or children of war .
an international convention on the generation of war children is meeting in frankfurt this week to discuss the damage that the war and its effects had on people 's souls .
a robbed childhood dr. hartmut radebold , a former professor of clinical psychology at the university of kassel and the founder of germany 's geriatric psychotherapy , said these children were subject to suffering in three major areas .

many who were babies or children during the war are still suffering from the trauma they experienced 60 years ago . in his speech commemorating the liberation of buchenwald concentration camp , chancellor gerhard schröder said remembering germany 's past - national socialism , war and genocide - was part of germany 's identity and , at the same time , " a permanent moral responsibility . "
yet there is a significant part of this past that has been neglected .
" it is surprising that the generation of children , who were born during the war and spent a large part of their childhood in the war , have until recently been remarkably silent about their biographies and appeared unaffected , " said dr. michael ermann , head of the war childhood project at munich 's ludwig-maximilians-university .
" their speechlessness found a counterpart in the little interest that the public showed for their fate , " ermann told german radio südwestrundfunk .
it is only in recent years that historians , psychoanalysts and german society are taking a closer look at these " kriegskinder " or children of war .
an international convention on the generation of war children is meeting in frankfurt this week to discuss the damage that the war and its effects had on people 's souls .
a robbed childhood dr. hartmut radebold , a former professor of clinical psychology at the university of kassel and the founder of germany 's geriatric psychotherapy , said these children were subject to suffering in three major areas .
" they faced violence , they had to deal with separation and loss of loved ones , and they had to come to terms with losing their homes , safety and security , " said radebold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many children had to flee their homes the psychiatrist helga spranger , one of the founding members of the war child association kriegskind.de and herself a war child , described the lives of children during the war in the international journal of evacuee and war child studies .
" children were separated from their parents , orphaned , evacuated by force , displaced , kidnapped , shot at , bombed , wounded , mutilated , raped , expropriated , blackmailed , adopted by force , drafted at an early age and forced into labor , " spranger wrote .
" in short , they suffered from stress for months or years and were basically robbed of their childhood . "
the horrors these children experienced continued to brew under the surface .
" it costs endless energy to keep it inside for decades , " said ermann .
haunted by memories in recent years , an increasing number of war children have suffered from agonizing health problems , as their trauma finally rises to the surface .
according to radebold , many are diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder .
" they are haunted by their memories and the terrors they experienced and are overwhelmed by them , " he said .
symptoms include jumpiness , restlessness , sleep disorders or withdrawal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sound of a plane can often trigger the trauma there are also many images that are burned into their minds , which trigger their trauma , said spranger .
" aside from the basic feelings of fear of death or abandonment , disgust and wishes of escaping , lasting horrifying impressions are hidden in the memories for a lifetime , " said spranger , such as the smell of burned houses , animals and humans after firebombs , hearing sirens or the shooting of weapons .
but despite their anguish , many war children have still been hesitant to talk .
sabine bode , author of the book " die vergessene generation " or " the lost generation , " looked at the stories of these war children to trace how their experiences shaped their lives .
she said her search for stories was tough .
" most of the people i spoke to fended off my questions with remarks like ' others were much worse off than i was ' or ' it did n't hurt us ' , " said bode .
" i rarely heard anyone complain about their fate .
i have the impression that despite the frequently observed trait that germans like to see themselves as victims , former war children of all people were in no way whiny about their past . "
history is a clogged toilet there are several reasons why these stories are only coming to the surface now .
many experiences were " re-awakened " through the images of other more recent wars , such as in kosovo or iraq .
that fact that these war children have reached retirement age also plays a role .
" in old age , you ca n't repress things as easily anymore , " said bode .
a profession also acts as a stabilizing factor for someone 's identity , said radebold .
" so when these war children retire , they have more time on their hands to think and with this time , come the memories , " he said .
in certain cases , trauma can be reactivated .
" this means that old memories are reawakened through a siren or an airplane that sounds similar to the ones during the war , " said radebold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " crabwalk " by günter grass was published in 2002 but bode said that war children also needed a form of " permission " to open their souls .
and this was given to them by nobel prize winner günter grass .
" he said , we also have to attend to germans ' problems after the war , " said bode .
" history or , to be more precise , the history we germans have repeatedly mucked up , is a clogged toilet .
we flush and flush , but the shit keeps rising , " grass wrote in his book " crabwalk , " published in 2002 .

' this week saw germany 's pop industry shaken by the biggest shock revelation since milli vanilli famously admitted in 1990 that it was n't their own voices gracing their best-selling records . in the latest showbiz shenanigans , it seems maverick producer david brandes allegedly mass-bought records by artists signed to his label bros music , including gracia , vanilla ninja and virus incorpororated , to help secure their singles a place in the charts . eurovision euphoria as germany 's entry in the 2005 eurovision song contest , to be held in kiev on may 21 , gracia must be quaking in her six-inch heels .
but the 22-year-old has already proved her talent not only for singing but for making the most of a bad lot when she defied the jury on germany 's version of pop idol and carved herself a profitable career as a pop star despite being voted off the show in a spectacular tv debacle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a b-rate britney spears she may be , but she sealed her success when thousand of viewers called in to vote for her single " run & hide " at the recent eurovision national selection show . " i 'm overwhelmed , surprised and very , very happy , " gushed gracia .
but her reign as germany 's high priestess of pop was to be a short one . chart fixing : happens all the time ? crucially , gracia qualified as a candidate only because of the single 's recent chart success . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david brandes when market researcher media control , which assembles germany 's weekly charts , noticed that exceptionally high numbers of " run & hide " were flying off the shelves , it discovered that in fact , producer david brandes -lrb- photo -rrb- had commissioned henchmen across germany to buy the records and help his protégées up the hit parade . karlheinz kögel from media control told der spiegel that brandes " spun a web across the entire country with considerable criminal energy . " as if that was n't bad enough , an anonymous source familiar with the workings of the music industry told german daily taz that brandes is n't the only one .
" it 's exactly what every product manager does if he wants to see his labors rewarded , " he explained .
he also pointed out that newcomer acts are , in fact , often given a bit of a " leg-up " when they first enter the charts . even gracia herself was n't bothering to act innocent .
" everyone in the business buys up their own records , " she said .
" if you do n't , you 're just plain stupid . " expelled from the charts , but not eurovision even so , the three acts given a leg-up by brandes have now been banished from the charts by the phonographic industry association and media control . gracia , however , will still be heading for kiev .
the phono association maintains the guilty party is the producers rather than the artists and has announced she can still represent germany at the eurovision . it has n't been a popular decision .
" cheating is cheating and gracia should n't go to kiev , " argued germany 's former hit parade host dieter-thomas heck . country singer gunter gabriel agreed .
" it 's shameful , " he told news agency ddp , adding that the case is symptomatic of the music industry 's staggering greed .
" it 's all about business , but music should be something for the soul , " he lamented . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the neue deutsche welle rises german pop and rock music is suddenly making a comeback - thanks to good bands and better media coverage .

it 's focusing on ways to effectively strengthen european defense efforts with a view to improving joint missions in crisis areas on the continent and elsewhere . the two-day conference in berlin has drawn high-ranking politicians , nato officials and eu defense experts and aims to highlight efforts to further harmonize defense cooperation within the north atlantic alliance and the eu 's own defense initiatives . it 's being held at a time when both the eu and nato are in the process of building up rapid reaction forces , or battle groups , as european strategists prefer to call them .
both organizations are potentially drawing upon the same pools of soldiers which indicates that rivalry can never be ruled out . but in a bid to further heal transatlantic relations after the controversy over the us-led war in iraq , assurances are being heard ever so often that the eu ’ s own security efforts are invariably intended to complement - not duplicate or rival - nato . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck " it would be totally wrong to view the development of european defense capabilities separately from advances within nato , " said germany 's social democrat defense minister , peter struck -lrb- photo -rrb- .
he added that both nato and the european union are currently making efforts to be better prepared for out-of-area missions in a bid to adapt to a fast changing security environment . " nato must be open to reform " there can be no doubt whatsoever that in future nato has to be the place where dialogue on transatlantic security strategies must be intensified , struck added .
" the alliance has to be open for reform , " struck added . this is what german chancellor gerhard schröder demanded at a recent security conference in munich , and his words are being taken seriously by nato leaders . struck ’ s message to the conference was taken up by alessandro minuto rizzo , deputy secretary-general of nato .
he made it clear that it had been wrong to try and sweep different threat perception levels on both sides of the atlantic under the carpet and demanded that a fresh initiative be made to debate security strategies more openly within nato . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german nato troops in afghanistan " we need to understand that nato is not only a forum for action .
we must also understand that it ’ s a forum for debate , " said minuto rizzo .
" during the iraq controversy , nato was manifestly under-utilized as a consultative forum , and we paid a high price for that , " he said .
" i ’ m confident that we ’ ve learned our lesson .
if we want to preserve nato as a central framework for effective multilateralism , we must engage in multilateral debate . " focus on rapid response forces defense minister struck said it would be in the interest of all to see the european union reinforce its own military capabilities alongside those of nato . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a congolese boy points as he speak to a french soldier , thursday , june 19 , 2003 during a foot patrol on the outskirts of bunia , congo .
he pointed to the eu ’ s successful peace-keeping operations in bosnia-herzegovina and parts of africa .
he announced that germany would be willing to contribute 50 military observers to the 250-strong eu contingent to become active in sudan soon . the chairman of nato ’ s military committee , general harald kujat , himself german , left mr struck ’ s remarks uncommented and focused on the capabilities of nato ’ s future rapid response forces instead . " a great proportion of the alliance ’ s forces will need to be deployable well away from their own territories and have the flexibility to switch rapidly between war fighting and peace keeping , " kujat said .
" future forces must be more capable of operating within a networked environment .
there will be a greater need for specialist skills in areas such as engineering , communications , special operations , civil-military cooperation , logistics , medical services and intelligence . " more money needed several speakers complained about eu defense programs being gravely underfinanced . they noted that the 16 european nato member countries together currently spend only $ 200 million on defense capabilities annually - which amounts to only half of the us defense budget . hardy graupner -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to head peacekeeping in bosnia the european union announced friday it plans to replace nato 's peacekeeping troops with its own in bosnia-herzegovina at the end of the year , as part of a new eu paramilitary force .

it 's focusing on ways to effectively strengthen european defense efforts with a view to improving joint missions in crisis areas on the continent and elsewhere . the two-day conference in berlin has drawn high-ranking politicians , nato officials and eu defense experts and aims to highlight efforts to further harmonize defense cooperation within the north atlantic alliance and the eu 's own defense initiatives . it 's being held at a time when both the eu and nato are in the process of building up rapid reaction forces , or battle groups , as european strategists prefer to call them .
both organizations are potentially drawing upon the same pools of soldiers which indicates that rivalry can never be ruled out . but in a bid to further heal transatlantic relations after the controversy over the us-led war in iraq , assurances are being heard ever so often that the eu ’ s own security efforts are invariably intended to complement - not duplicate or rival - nato . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck " it would be totally wrong to view the development of european defense capabilities separately from advances within nato , " said germany 's social democrat defense minister , peter struck -lrb- photo -rrb- .
he added that both nato and the european union are currently making efforts to be better prepared for out-of-area missions in a bid to adapt to a fast changing security environment . " nato must be open to reform " there can be no doubt whatsoever that in future nato has to be the place where dialogue on transatlantic security strategies must be intensified , struck added .
" the alliance has to be open for reform , " struck added . this is what german chancellor gerhard schröder demanded at a recent security conference in munich , and his words are being taken seriously by nato leaders . struck ’ s message to the conference was taken up by alessandro minuto rizzo , deputy secretary-general of nato .
he made it clear that it had been wrong to try and sweep different threat perception levels on both sides of the atlantic under the carpet and demanded that a fresh initiative be made to debate security strategies more openly within nato . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german nato troops in afghanistan " we need to understand that nato is not only a forum for action .
we must also understand that it ’ s a forum for debate , " said minuto rizzo .
" during the iraq controversy , nato was manifestly under-utilized as a consultative forum , and we paid a high price for that , " he said .
" i ’ m confident that we ’ ve learned our lesson .

he announced that germany would be willing to contribute 50 military observers to the 250-strong eu contingent to become active in sudan soon . the chairman of nato ’ s military committee , general harald kujat , himself german , left mr struck ’ s remarks uncommented and focused on the capabilities of nato ’ s future rapid response forces instead . " a great proportion of the alliance ’ s forces will need to be deployable well away from their own territories and have the flexibility to switch rapidly between war fighting and peace keeping , " kujat said .
" future forces must be more capable of operating within a networked environment .

she lunges across the bed to answer it , much to the chagrin of her videotaping boyfriend .
while paris does n't share much in common with everyday folk , it seems a surprisingly large minority do share her weakness for mobile phone calls over sex . is it a tale of modern , high-tech romance ?
an example of the modern tendency to always look around the corner for something better ?
or just a reflection of how technology is stripping mankind of its humanity ? perhaps the statistics recently unveiled in the magazine ad age pose a question for sociologists , philosophers , or at least sexologists to ponder .
why do 14 percent of the world 's mobile phone users report that they have interrupted sex to answer a beeping wireless device ? " people ca n't bear to miss a call , " said christine hannis , head of communications for bbdo europe , which conducted the study along with proximity worldwide .
" everybody thinks the next call can be something really exciting .
and getting so many calls proves social success , " she said .
" it fulfills a fundamental insecurity . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany and spain , then , appear to have the highest levels of insecurity , with 22 percent in both countries reporting that grabbing that call was more important than finishing the task at hand -lrb- or at other parts of the anatomy -rrb- .
the lowest incidence of what might be called cellulus interruptus was reported in italy , where only 7 percent of mobile phone users picked up the phone during sex . perhaps the sex is just better there . it 's not that mobile phones and sex are enemies , or even strangers .
more than half of the respondents to the same survey , 52 percent , reported they used a mobile phone to flirt .
a british company is selling software that transforms a cell phone into a sex toy .
it 's called " purring kitty " and according to the company launching it , vibelet.com , it can turn certain phones into a " discrete , vibrating massager .

the highest court in germany is now turning its attention to it . effective and swift cooperation - that 's what 's always been demanded on the legal level in europe .
towards that end , the european warrant arrest was introduced in the bloc early last year .
it aims to simplify extradition procedures for suspected criminals within the european union . but , not many eu members are really happy about it , with many preferring to retain elements of the old procedure .
that may seem odd given that the old regulation was rather cumbersome .
for instance , earlier the suspected crime had to be punishable and allowed to be pursued by the law both in the home country of the suspected criminal as well as in the nation that he was to be extradited to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money laundering and counterfeiting are included on the so-called " positive list of criminal areas . "
the new regulation has been significantly simplified in this regard : when the suspected crime is included on a so-called " positive list of criminal areas , " then the criminal can be extradited . the problem however is that the list is too vague .
" for example : what exactly does sabotage mean ? " said helmut satzger , professor for european criminal law at the university of munich .
" we do n't have a provision on the books to deal with sabotage in german law , " satzger said .
the same is true for racism and xenophobia . criticism is growing in germany about the european arrest warrant and its apparent contradictions and the german constitution court in karlsruhe is set to grapple with the topic in detail for the first time this week . different legal systems in many other cases , the crime must be punishable in both states much as was the case earlier .
despite that , there are huge differences in various eu states regarding the severity of the crime .
the differing legal systems in the eu member states have prompted concerns among german lawyers ' groups , law professors and lawyers .
how for instance , they ask , can a ruling of greek courts be accepted in germany when there are completely different laws here ? these worries are shared by other eu members states too and some have reacted .
" for example there are states like denmark who have n't translated the new regulations in binding law , " said satzger .
others such as france have reserved the right to examine the dual criminality principle contained in the european arrest warrant . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic militant metin kaplan was extradited to turkey by germany after a long-drawn out legal battle .
he was extradited on charges of treason for allegedly masterminding a failed plot to crash an airplane into the mausoleum of the founder of secular turkey .
but , it 's not just differing laws in eu states that have prompted worries .
even bans on extradition of criminals are problematic .
the eu so far recognizes only three hindrances to extradition : the already existing punishment of the criminal in his home country , if he 's not criminally liable due to underage , or an amnesty .
as against that member states can no longer refuse to surrender to another member state their own citizens on the ground that they are nationals . no appeal in the home country possible " for example , if lithuania issued such an arrest warrant against a german then germany must surrender its national to lithuania , " said satzger .
that means , that the german national could not protest that the crime is n't punishable in germany .
" if the suspected criminal does n't know lithuania , if he has no idea of the lithuanian legal system and if he also does n't exactly know for example how the mandatory defense counsel would work , then we 're dealing with certain problems here , " said satzger . long before the european warrant arrest actually too effect , a few german constitutional court judges had strongly criticized the procedure .
" the german constitutional court has undertaken a big task in the respect : the judges are using the arrest warrant to answer some very fundamental questions about the relationship between european law and national law , " said satzger . he added that most member states had accepted that european law would override national constitutional law .

the highest court in germany is now turning its attention to it . effective and swift cooperation - that 's what 's always been demanded on the legal level in europe .
towards that end , the european warrant arrest was introduced in the bloc early last year .
it aims to simplify extradition procedures for suspected criminals within the european union . but , not many eu members are really happy about it , with many preferring to retain elements of the old procedure .
that may seem odd given that the old regulation was rather cumbersome .
for instance , earlier the suspected crime had to be punishable and allowed to be pursued by the law both in the home country of the suspected criminal as well as in the nation that he was to be extradited to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money laundering and counterfeiting are included on the so-called " positive list of criminal areas . "
the new regulation has been significantly simplified in this regard : when the suspected crime is included on a so-called " positive list of criminal areas , " then the criminal can be extradited . the problem however is that the list is too vague .
" for example : what exactly does sabotage mean ? " said helmut satzger , professor for european criminal law at the university of munich .
" we do n't have a provision on the books to deal with sabotage in german law , " satzger said .
the same is true for racism and xenophobia . criticism is growing in germany about the european arrest warrant and its apparent contradictions and the german constitution court in karlsruhe is set to grapple with the topic in detail for the first time this week . different legal systems in many other cases , the crime must be punishable in both states much as was the case earlier .
despite that , there are huge differences in various eu states regarding the severity of the crime .
the differing legal systems in the eu member states have prompted concerns among german lawyers ' groups , law professors and lawyers .
how for instance , they ask , can a ruling of greek courts be accepted in germany when there are completely different laws here ? these worries are shared by other eu members states too and some have reacted .
" for example there are states like denmark who have n't translated the new regulations in binding law , " said satzger .
others such as france have reserved the right to examine the dual criminality principle contained in the european arrest warrant . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic militant metin kaplan was extradited to turkey by germany after a long-drawn out legal battle .
he was extradited on charges of treason for allegedly masterminding a failed plot to crash an airplane into the mausoleum of the founder of secular turkey .
but , it 's not just differing laws in eu states that have prompted worries .
even bans on extradition of criminals are problematic .
the eu so far recognizes only three hindrances to extradition : the already existing punishment of the criminal in his home country , if he 's not criminally liable due to underage , or an amnesty .
as against that member states can no longer refuse to surrender to another member state their own citizens on the ground that they are nationals . no appeal in the home country possible " for example , if lithuania issued such an arrest warrant against a german then germany must surrender its national to lithuania , " said satzger .
that means , that the german national could not protest that the crime is n't punishable in germany .
" if the suspected criminal does n't know lithuania , if he has no idea of the lithuanian legal system and if he also does n't exactly know for example how the mandatory defense counsel would work , then we 're dealing with certain problems here , " said satzger . long before the european warrant arrest actually too effect , a few german constitutional court judges had strongly criticized the procedure .
" the german constitutional court has undertaken a big task in the respect : the judges are using the arrest warrant to answer some very fundamental questions about the relationship between european law and national law , " said satzger . he added that most member states had accepted that european law would override national constitutional law .

but , it 's not just differing laws in eu states that have prompted worries .

that means , that the german national could not protest that the crime is n't punishable in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.04.2005 germans question european arrest warrant großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german judges are set to decide on europe-wide extraditions the simplified extradition regulations for suspected criminals within the eu have been criticized ever since they came into effect .
the highest court in germany is now turning its attention to it . effective and swift cooperation - that 's what 's always been demanded on the legal level in europe .
towards that end , the european warrant arrest was introduced in the bloc early last year .
it aims to simplify extradition procedures for suspected criminals within the european union . but , not many eu members are really happy about it , with many preferring to retain elements of the old procedure .
that may seem odd given that the old regulation was rather cumbersome .
for instance , earlier the suspected crime had to be punishable and allowed to be pursued by the law both in the home country of the suspected criminal as well as in the nation that he was to be extradited to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money laundering and counterfeiting are included on the so-called " positive list of criminal areas . "
the new regulation has been significantly simplified in this regard : when the suspected crime is included on a so-called " positive list of criminal areas , " then the criminal can be extradited . the problem however is that the list is too vague .
" for example : what exactly does sabotage mean ? " said helmut satzger , professor for european criminal law at the university of munich .
" we do n't have a provision on the books to deal with sabotage in german law , " satzger said .
the same is true for racism and xenophobia . criticism is growing in germany about the european arrest warrant and its apparent contradictions and the german constitution court in karlsruhe is set to grapple with the topic in detail for the first time this week . different legal systems in many other cases , the crime must be punishable in both states much as was the case earlier .
despite that , there are huge differences in various eu states regarding the severity of the crime .
the differing legal systems in the eu member states have prompted concerns among german lawyers ' groups , law professors and lawyers .
how for instance , they ask , can a ruling of greek courts be accepted in germany when there are completely different laws here ? these worries are shared by other eu members states too and some have reacted .

experts believe that downward pressure on wages in germany will continue this year unless berlin takes decisive steps to curb the influx of cheap labor from eastern europe . chasing " black sheep " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the construction industry already has regulations in place to prevent wage dumping .
the task force in the german economics and finance ministry will in future conduct bilateral talks with the 10 new member states in order to push them to uphold eu labor and services law .
the new working group is also meant to create clear criteria for service providers , branches , companies as well as workers from the new member states . gerd andres , parliamentary under secretary in the german economics ministry , said the authorities should go after " black sheep " and prevent eastern european firms from bypassing eu laws to the detriment of the german labor market and economy . germany did insist on and achieve a seven-year freeze on people from the new member states from getting automatic access to the german labor market in the run up to the eu 's eastward expansion last year .
but immediately upon entry , companies in poland and the other new member states gained the right to sell business services in the rest of the eu .
just last month , chancellor gerhard schröder had to intervene in eu plans to liberalize services which would have thrown the doors further open for cheap labor from the east . under eu law , workers sent to a different country for a short-term contract must receive the minimum social benefits and wages of the state where they are carrying out the project . this doesn ’ t apply , however , to self-employed workers and foreign subcontractors .
in germany , the meat-packing industry has been particularly affected .
tens of thousands of workers lost their jobs in recent months , as their work is increasingly being done by companies from poland and hungary who essentially " lend " their foreign workers to companies here .
the wages the easterners receive are between just three and five euros an hour . expanding minimum wages in addition , the new task force is meant to examine whether the minimum wage rule that applies to the german building sector , one of the few industries that does have such a provision , can be expanded to other areas . unlike other eu countries , germany does not have a general minimum wage , because such a law was long considered to be an infringement of the right for industrial sectors to have their own pay scales .
but , now with low-wage workers from eastern europe squeezing germans out of jobs at a time of record unemployment and key regional elections coming up in the state of north rhine-westphalia next month , chancellor schröder is considering extending the law . " we 'll take a look at whether the anti-dumping law that applies to the building trade can be gradually extended to take in other sectors , " schröder said on wednesday .
" the aim is to make sure that dumping incidents do not ruin good companies that are unable to compete with such low wages . ” employers against minimum wages however , not everybody is happy with the idea of legally-set minimum wages .
german employers say it would be counterproductive as job opportunities for unskilled german workers would be lost .
in addition they claim companies would be burdened with the costs of greater bureaucracy . the institute for labor market and job research -lrb- iab -rrb- said that a minimum wage in individual sectors would help to reduce the pressure on wages in germany through eastward expansion , provided it was just a temporary measure . ulrich walwei , deputy head of the iab told the daily berliner zeitung that the government also had to be careful in its selection of sectors to introduce a temporary minimum wage in order to avoid damaging competition . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate flares up over minimum wages with the eu 's eastward expansion and subsequent downward pressure on wages in germany , opposition conservatives have stoked debate over the introduction of minimum wages , saying they 're ready to support such a move .

german authorities want to extradite mamoun darkazanli to spain , where he is accused of being an al-qaeda associate . mamoun darkazanli 's extradition was requested by madrid under a controversial new system of eu arrest warrants introduced last year .
the aim of the system was to make it easier for terror suspects to be transferred between eu member states and to boost cooperation in the war on terrorism . but darkazanli 's lawyers are expected to argue before the court in karlsruhe that the eu arrest warrants are in breach of the german constitution , because their client can be handed over to face charges abroad that could not be brought against him in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : were the court to uphold darkazanli 's argument , it would seriously undermine one of the bloc 's main anti-terrorist security initiatives . wider implications german justice minister brigitte zypries said such a ruling would be detrimental to german cooperation in the eu 's joint fight against crime .
but she said she doubted the case would stand up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte zypries " i think the eu arrest warrant as a whole is not in violation , and in this concrete case there is even less evidence of that , " she told deutschlandfunk radio . michael rosenthal , darkazanli 's lawyer , said he would argue the measure is unconstitutional because it was introduced under a binding " framework decision " by eu ministers , and the parliament therefore had no choice but to approve it . " our constitutional appeal says : that is not democracy , " he told reuters . other legal experts believe an outcome in favor of darkazanli would have wider implications and introduce the possibility of challenges to other eu measures and even to the bloc 's new constitution , due to be ratified by parliament this year . logistical and financial support the 46-year-old darkazanli , a businessman who has dual syrian and german nationality , has been in custody in hamburg since last october and will not attend the hearings . he stands accused by the us of financing al qaeda and was one of 35 people charged by spanish judge baltasar garzon in september 2003 with belonging to the terrorist network . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marienstr .
54 was the base of the hamburg al qaeda cell he has also been investigated by german authorities for links to the hamburg cell which masterminded and executed the 9/11 attacks on new york and washington in 2001 . garzon 's charge sheet says he carried out " logistics support and financing activity , " including the purchase of a cargo vessel for its leader osama bin laden in december 1993 . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany agrees on al qaeda suspect 's extradition mamoun darkazanli , the syrian-german accused of being a member of al qaeda 's 9/11 hamburg cell , could soon face extradition proceedings after german authorities cleared his case to go before a court hearing . -lrb- oct .

the man had been sentenced to 13 years in jail partly based on evidence police collected by tracking his movements using a gps device secretly attached to his car .
the court ruled that keeping tabs on suspects ' movements did not normally invade their privacy . the judges did , however , add that lawmakers should prevent " all round surveillance , " keeping an eye on technical developments and ensuring that public prosecutors are informed in all cases to prevent suspects from being the subject of uncoordinated observation from different law enforcement agencies at the same time . german justice ministry otto schily welcomed the ruling .
" the constitution court confirmed a significant instrument for police investigations and safeguarded use of the most modern technical methods for fighting crime , " he said in berlin .
justice ministry state secretary hansjörg geiger praised the court for approving " weapon parity " between criminals and investigators . avoiding 1984 but many years have passed since gps was used in the case the karlsruhe judges examined and technology has made leaps and bounds , pointed out data protection specialist frank rosengart from berlin 's chaos computer club -lrb- ccc -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " gps is no longer necessary , except for when the suspect really does n't have a telephone with him or it 's always turned off .
otherwise , the person 's location can be much better determined through his mobile phone , " rosengart said , adding that gps is rarely used by police forces . berlin 's police already use so-called silent text messages to locate suspects , for which the ccc awarded the force its big brother award last year .
data protection experts should focus their attentions on tracking via mobile phones , rosengart said . " at the moment only the legal situation prevents things from being transposed as george orwell described in ' 1984 , ' his gloomy vision of a surveillance state , " rosengart said .
" the technical means are largely there .

italian authorities had requested the delay , fearing hundreds of thousands of followers in rome for his funeral would remain to visit the tomb . many determined pilgrims remained in the city anyway .

the 4-2 defeat in london a week earlier meant the victory was a hollow one .
bayern were eliminated . bayern munich 's dreams of european glory ended in dramatic style in the olympic stadium on tuesday night as english premiership side chelsea swept into the semi-finals of the champions league at the expense of the german bundesliga leaders despite losing 3-2 . although bayern were winners on the night , the 4-2 defeat at stamford bridge last week was enough to earn the premiership leaders a 6-5 aggregate victory and send felix magath 's side crashing out . it is the second successive season chelsea have reached the semi-finals of europe 's premier competition and they will hope to make amends for last season 's shock 5-3 aggregate defeat by monaco . chelsea led 4-2 from the first leg and england international frank lampard scored on the hour mark - his third goal against bayern in six days - to ensure bayern had to score three times .
" another deflected goal from chelsea , " said bayern coach magath .
" chelsea were not better than us they were just more fortunate and clinical in front of goal . " missed chances cost bayern dearly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : didier drogba is congratulated at the end of the match in munich by team mate eidur gudjonsson .
bayern scored three goals through claudio pizarro -lrb- 65 -rrb- and late goals from substitutes mehmet scholl and paolo guerrero both in stoppage time but it was their earlier profligacy that cost them dear .
bayern were eventually punished by ivory coast star didier drogba who scored the decisive goal for chelsea with 10 minutes to go . chelsea 's portuguese manager jose mourinho - still suspended by uefa - was amongst the capacity 59,000 fans watching from the stands and will be delighted as his charges scored twice to ensure bayern 's late goal fest was irrelevant . fitness coach rui faria was mourinho 's representative at the press conference and revealed the manager left the stadium because he felt his privacy was being invaded .
" jose will be delighted with the result but he left the stands because he could not watch the match in peace , " revealed faria .
" he went back to the hotel and watched us progress from there . " chelsea face the prospect of an all english semi-final clash with four-time european cup winners liverpool although italian giants juventus will fancy their chances of overturning a 2-1 deficit in turin on wednesday . bayern made four changes with dutch international roy makaay and peru star pizarro back to form their attacking partnership . first and fatal goal to chelsea manager magath claimed conceding the first goal would be ' fatal ' and it almost happened in the second minute with drogba - a lone target-man - rushing on to a through pass . bayern custodian oliver kahn came storming out to block his path and magath breathed a sigh of relief , although it was later to turn to despair . hosts munich then seized the initiative and german international michael ballack - at the centre of a diving storm in the first leg - saw his goal-bound shot blocked in the fifth minute and blazed his follow-up high over the crossbar .
pizarro then forced a brilliant point blank save from chelsea 's czech international goalkeeper petr cech in a thrilling first quarter hour . bastian schweinsteiger was causing havoc down the right flank and a goal looked inevitable but it was chelsea who scored it against the run of play .
in the 30th minute , joe cole fed england international team-mate lampard and the midfielder 's shot ricocheted off brazilian defender lucio sending kahn the wrong way . " the first goal was very fortunate , " said bayern defender sagnol .
" but to be honest the damage was done in the first leg . " munich hit again while chasing the game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england 's frank lampard opened the scoring in the olympic stadium .
it was more bad luck for lucio who deflected in cole 's first goal in the 4-2 first leg defeat at stamford bridge .
lampard 's deflected effort meant bayern needed to score three goals to go through and ballack should have got one of them in the 38th minute when he strangely chose to play the ball across the face of goal instead of shooting himself . bayern pulled off martin demichelis for the more inventive mehmet scholl early in the second half .
bayern were handed a lifeline in the 65th minute when cech could only parry a ballack header on to the post and the ball rolled kindly to pizarro who stroked the ball in to level the scores . with 25 minutes left to score twice bayern hit the crossbar through a deflected bixente lizarazu cross and then eidur gudjohnsen cleared off the line as chelsea began to wobble . but with 10 minutes left the excellent cole crossed for drogba to bullet a header past kahn and bayern knew the game was up .
guerrero and scholl both scored in stoppage time but bayern were left cursing having conceded six goals over the two legs . bayern 's star midfielder michael ballack said : " it 's annoying .

the aim of the system was to make it easier for terror suspects to be transferred between eu member states and to boost cooperation in the war on terrorism . but darkazanli 's lawyers are expected to argue before the court in karlsruhe that the eu arrest warrants are in breach of the german constitution , because their client can be handed over to face charges abroad that could not be brought against him in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : were the court to uphold darkazanli 's argument , it would seriously undermine one of the bloc 's main anti-terrorist security initiatives . wider implications german justice minister brigitte zypries said such a ruling would be detrimental to german cooperation in the eu 's joint fight against crime .

" our constitutional appeal says : that is not democracy , " he told reuters . other legal experts believe an outcome in favor of darkazanli would have wider implications and introduce the possibility of challenges to other eu measures and even to the bloc 's new constitution , due to be ratified by parliament this year . logistical and financial support the 46-year-old darkazanli , a businessman who has dual syrian and german nationality , has been in custody in hamburg since last october and will not attend the hearings . he stands accused by the us of financing al qaeda and was one of 35 people charged by spanish judge baltasar garzon in september 2003 with belonging to the terrorist network . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marienstr .

many who were babies or children during the war are still suffering from the trauma they experienced 60 years ago . in his speech commemorating the liberation of buchenwald concentration camp , chancellor gerhard schröder said remembering germany 's past - national socialism , war and genocide - was part of germany 's identity and , at the same time , " a permanent moral responsibility . "
yet there is a significant part of this past that has been neglected .
" it is surprising that the generation of children , who were born during the war and spent a large part of their childhood in the war , have until recently been remarkably silent about their biographies and appeared unaffected , " said dr. michael ermann , head of the war childhood project at munich 's ludwig-maximilians-university .
" their speechlessness found a counterpart in the little interest that the public showed for their fate , " ermann told german radio südwestrundfunk .
it is only in recent years that historians , psychoanalysts and german society are taking a closer look at these " kriegskinder " or children of war .
an international convention on the generation of war children is meeting in frankfurt this week to discuss the damage that the war and its effects had on people 's souls .
a robbed childhood dr. hartmut radebold , a former professor of clinical psychology at the university of kassel and the founder of germany 's geriatric psychotherapy , said these children were subject to suffering in three major areas .
" they faced violence , they had to deal with separation and loss of loved ones , and they had to come to terms with losing their homes , safety and security , " said radebold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many children had to flee their homes the psychiatrist helga spranger , one of the founding members of the war child association kriegskind.de and herself a war child , described the lives of children during the war in the international journal of evacuee and war child studies .
" children were separated from their parents , orphaned , evacuated by force , displaced , kidnapped , shot at , bombed , wounded , mutilated , raped , expropriated , blackmailed , adopted by force , drafted at an early age and forced into labor , " spranger wrote .
" in short , they suffered from stress for months or years and were basically robbed of their childhood . "
the horrors these children experienced continued to brew under the surface .
" it costs endless energy to keep it inside for decades , " said ermann .
haunted by memories in recent years , an increasing number of war children have suffered from agonizing health problems , as their trauma finally rises to the surface .
according to radebold , many are diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder .
" they are haunted by their memories and the terrors they experienced and are overwhelmed by them , " he said .
symptoms include jumpiness , restlessness , sleep disorders or withdrawal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sound of a plane can often trigger the trauma there are also many images that are burned into their minds , which trigger their trauma , said spranger .
" aside from the basic feelings of fear of death or abandonment , disgust and wishes of escaping , lasting horrifying impressions are hidden in the memories for a lifetime , " said spranger , such as the smell of burned houses , animals and humans after firebombs , hearing sirens or the shooting of weapons .
but despite their anguish , many war children have still been hesitant to talk .
sabine bode , author of the book " die vergessene generation " or " the lost generation , " looked at the stories of these war children to trace how their experiences shaped their lives .
she said her search for stories was tough .
" most of the people i spoke to fended off my questions with remarks like ' others were much worse off than i was ' or ' it did n't hurt us ' , " said bode .
" i rarely heard anyone complain about their fate .
i have the impression that despite the frequently observed trait that germans like to see themselves as victims , former war children of all people were in no way whiny about their past . "
history is a clogged toilet there are several reasons why these stories are only coming to the surface now .
many experiences were " re-awakened " through the images of other more recent wars , such as in kosovo or iraq .
that fact that these war children have reached retirement age also plays a role .
" in old age , you ca n't repress things as easily anymore , " said bode .
a profession also acts as a stabilizing factor for someone 's identity , said radebold .
" so when these war children retire , they have more time on their hands to think and with this time , come the memories , " he said .
in certain cases , trauma can be reactivated .
" this means that old memories are reawakened through a siren or an airplane that sounds similar to the ones during the war , " said radebold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " crabwalk " by günter grass was published in 2002 but bode said that war children also needed a form of " permission " to open their souls .
and this was given to them by nobel prize winner günter grass .
" he said , we also have to attend to germans ' problems after the war , " said bode .
" history or , to be more precise , the history we germans have repeatedly mucked up , is a clogged toilet .
we flush and flush , but the shit keeps rising , " grass wrote in his book " crabwalk , " published in 2002 .

many who were babies or children during the war are still suffering from the trauma they experienced 60 years ago . in his speech commemorating the liberation of buchenwald concentration camp , chancellor gerhard schröder said remembering germany 's past - national socialism , war and genocide - was part of germany 's identity and , at the same time , " a permanent moral responsibility . "
yet there is a significant part of this past that has been neglected .
" it is surprising that the generation of children , who were born during the war and spent a large part of their childhood in the war , have until recently been remarkably silent about their biographies and appeared unaffected , " said dr. michael ermann , head of the war childhood project at munich 's ludwig-maximilians-university .
" their speechlessness found a counterpart in the little interest that the public showed for their fate , " ermann told german radio südwestrundfunk .
it is only in recent years that historians , psychoanalysts and german society are taking a closer look at these " kriegskinder " or children of war .
an international convention on the generation of war children is meeting in frankfurt this week to discuss the damage that the war and its effects had on people 's souls .
a robbed childhood dr. hartmut radebold , a former professor of clinical psychology at the university of kassel and the founder of germany 's geriatric psychotherapy , said these children were subject to suffering in three major areas .
" they faced violence , they had to deal with separation and loss of loved ones , and they had to come to terms with losing their homes , safety and security , " said radebold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many children had to flee their homes the psychiatrist helga spranger , one of the founding members of the war child association kriegskind.de and herself a war child , described the lives of children during the war in the international journal of evacuee and war child studies .
" children were separated from their parents , orphaned , evacuated by force , displaced , kidnapped , shot at , bombed , wounded , mutilated , raped , expropriated , blackmailed , adopted by force , drafted at an early age and forced into labor , " spranger wrote .
" in short , they suffered from stress for months or years and were basically robbed of their childhood . "
the horrors these children experienced continued to brew under the surface .
" it costs endless energy to keep it inside for decades , " said ermann .
haunted by memories in recent years , an increasing number of war children have suffered from agonizing health problems , as their trauma finally rises to the surface .
according to radebold , many are diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder .
" they are haunted by their memories and the terrors they experienced and are overwhelmed by them , " he said .
symptoms include jumpiness , restlessness , sleep disorders or withdrawal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sound of a plane can often trigger the trauma there are also many images that are burned into their minds , which trigger their trauma , said spranger .
" aside from the basic feelings of fear of death or abandonment , disgust and wishes of escaping , lasting horrifying impressions are hidden in the memories for a lifetime , " said spranger , such as the smell of burned houses , animals and humans after firebombs , hearing sirens or the shooting of weapons .
but despite their anguish , many war children have still been hesitant to talk .
sabine bode , author of the book " die vergessene generation " or " the lost generation , " looked at the stories of these war children to trace how their experiences shaped their lives .
she said her search for stories was tough .
" most of the people i spoke to fended off my questions with remarks like ' others were much worse off than i was ' or ' it did n't hurt us ' , " said bode .
" i rarely heard anyone complain about their fate .
i have the impression that despite the frequently observed trait that germans like to see themselves as victims , former war children of all people were in no way whiny about their past . "
history is a clogged toilet there are several reasons why these stories are only coming to the surface now .
many experiences were " re-awakened " through the images of other more recent wars , such as in kosovo or iraq .
that fact that these war children have reached retirement age also plays a role .
" in old age , you ca n't repress things as easily anymore , " said bode .
a profession also acts as a stabilizing factor for someone 's identity , said radebold .
" so when these war children retire , they have more time on their hands to think and with this time , come the memories , " he said .
in certain cases , trauma can be reactivated .
" this means that old memories are reawakened through a siren or an airplane that sounds similar to the ones during the war , " said radebold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " crabwalk " by günter grass was published in 2002 but bode said that war children also needed a form of " permission " to open their souls .
and this was given to them by nobel prize winner günter grass .

many who were babies or children during the war are still suffering from the trauma they experienced 60 years ago . in his speech commemorating the liberation of buchenwald concentration camp , chancellor gerhard schröder said remembering germany 's past - national socialism , war and genocide - was part of germany 's identity and , at the same time , " a permanent moral responsibility . "
yet there is a significant part of this past that has been neglected .
" it is surprising that the generation of children , who were born during the war and spent a large part of their childhood in the war , have until recently been remarkably silent about their biographies and appeared unaffected , " said dr. michael ermann , head of the war childhood project at munich 's ludwig-maximilians-university .
" their speechlessness found a counterpart in the little interest that the public showed for their fate , " ermann told german radio südwestrundfunk .
it is only in recent years that historians , psychoanalysts and german society are taking a closer look at these " kriegskinder " or children of war .
an international convention on the generation of war children is meeting in frankfurt this week to discuss the damage that the war and its effects had on people 's souls .
a robbed childhood dr. hartmut radebold , a former professor of clinical psychology at the university of kassel and the founder of germany 's geriatric psychotherapy , said these children were subject to suffering in three major areas .
" they faced violence , they had to deal with separation and loss of loved ones , and they had to come to terms with losing their homes , safety and security , " said radebold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many children had to flee their homes the psychiatrist helga spranger , one of the founding members of the war child association kriegskind.de and herself a war child , described the lives of children during the war in the international journal of evacuee and war child studies .
" children were separated from their parents , orphaned , evacuated by force , displaced , kidnapped , shot at , bombed , wounded , mutilated , raped , expropriated , blackmailed , adopted by force , drafted at an early age and forced into labor , " spranger wrote .
" in short , they suffered from stress for months or years and were basically robbed of their childhood . "
the horrors these children experienced continued to brew under the surface .
" it costs endless energy to keep it inside for decades , " said ermann .
haunted by memories in recent years , an increasing number of war children have suffered from agonizing health problems , as their trauma finally rises to the surface .
according to radebold , many are diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder .
" they are haunted by their memories and the terrors they experienced and are overwhelmed by them , " he said .
symptoms include jumpiness , restlessness , sleep disorders or withdrawal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sound of a plane can often trigger the trauma there are also many images that are burned into their minds , which trigger their trauma , said spranger .
" aside from the basic feelings of fear of death or abandonment , disgust and wishes of escaping , lasting horrifying impressions are hidden in the memories for a lifetime , " said spranger , such as the smell of burned houses , animals and humans after firebombs , hearing sirens or the shooting of weapons .
but despite their anguish , many war children have still been hesitant to talk .
sabine bode , author of the book " die vergessene generation " or " the lost generation , " looked at the stories of these war children to trace how their experiences shaped their lives .
she said her search for stories was tough .
" most of the people i spoke to fended off my questions with remarks like ' others were much worse off than i was ' or ' it did n't hurt us ' , " said bode .
" i rarely heard anyone complain about their fate .
i have the impression that despite the frequently observed trait that germans like to see themselves as victims , former war children of all people were in no way whiny about their past . "
history is a clogged toilet there are several reasons why these stories are only coming to the surface now .
many experiences were " re-awakened " through the images of other more recent wars , such as in kosovo or iraq .
that fact that these war children have reached retirement age also plays a role .
" in old age , you ca n't repress things as easily anymore , " said bode .
a profession also acts as a stabilizing factor for someone 's identity , said radebold .
" so when these war children retire , they have more time on their hands to think and with this time , come the memories , " he said .
in certain cases , trauma can be reactivated .
" this means that old memories are reawakened through a siren or an airplane that sounds similar to the ones during the war , " said radebold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " crabwalk " by günter grass was published in 2002 but bode said that war children also needed a form of " permission " to open their souls .
and this was given to them by nobel prize winner günter grass .
" he said , we also have to attend to germans ' problems after the war , " said bode .
" history or , to be more precise , the history we germans have repeatedly mucked up , is a clogged toilet .

" they are haunted by their memories and the terrors they experienced and are overwhelmed by them , " he said .
symptoms include jumpiness , restlessness , sleep disorders or withdrawal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sound of a plane can often trigger the trauma there are also many images that are burned into their minds , which trigger their trauma , said spranger .
" aside from the basic feelings of fear of death or abandonment , disgust and wishes of escaping , lasting horrifying impressions are hidden in the memories for a lifetime , " said spranger , such as the smell of burned houses , animals and humans after firebombs , hearing sirens or the shooting of weapons .
but despite their anguish , many war children have still been hesitant to talk .
sabine bode , author of the book " die vergessene generation " or " the lost generation , " looked at the stories of these war children to trace how their experiences shaped their lives .
she said her search for stories was tough .
" most of the people i spoke to fended off my questions with remarks like ' others were much worse off than i was ' or ' it did n't hurt us ' , " said bode .
" i rarely heard anyone complain about their fate .
i have the impression that despite the frequently observed trait that germans like to see themselves as victims , former war children of all people were in no way whiny about their past . "
history is a clogged toilet there are several reasons why these stories are only coming to the surface now .
many experiences were " re-awakened " through the images of other more recent wars , such as in kosovo or iraq .
that fact that these war children have reached retirement age also plays a role .
" in old age , you ca n't repress things as easily anymore , " said bode .
a profession also acts as a stabilizing factor for someone 's identity , said radebold .
" so when these war children retire , they have more time on their hands to think and with this time , come the memories , " he said .
in certain cases , trauma can be reactivated .
" this means that old memories are reawakened through a siren or an airplane that sounds similar to the ones during the war , " said radebold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " crabwalk " by günter grass was published in 2002 but bode said that war children also needed a form of " permission " to open their souls .
and this was given to them by nobel prize winner günter grass .
" he said , we also have to attend to germans ' problems after the war , " said bode .
" history or , to be more precise , the history we germans have repeatedly mucked up , is a clogged toilet .
we flush and flush , but the shit keeps rising , " grass wrote in his book " crabwalk , " published in 2002 .

' this week saw germany 's pop industry shaken by the biggest shock revelation since milli vanilli famously admitted in 1990 that it was n't their own voices gracing their best-selling records . in the latest showbiz shenanigans , it seems maverick producer david brandes allegedly mass-bought records by artists signed to his label bros music , including gracia , vanilla ninja and virus incorpororated , to help secure their singles a place in the charts . eurovision euphoria as germany 's entry in the 2005 eurovision song contest , to be held in kiev on may 21 , gracia must be quaking in her six-inch heels .
but the 22-year-old has already proved her talent not only for singing but for making the most of a bad lot when she defied the jury on germany 's version of pop idol and carved herself a profitable career as a pop star despite being voted off the show in a spectacular tv debacle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a b-rate britney spears she may be , but she sealed her success when thousand of viewers called in to vote for her single " run & hide " at the recent eurovision national selection show . " i 'm overwhelmed , surprised and very , very happy , " gushed gracia .
but her reign as germany 's high priestess of pop was to be a short one . chart fixing : happens all the time ? crucially , gracia qualified as a candidate only because of the single 's recent chart success . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david brandes when market researcher media control , which assembles germany 's weekly charts , noticed that exceptionally high numbers of " run & hide " were flying off the shelves , it discovered that in fact , producer david brandes -lrb- photo -rrb- had commissioned henchmen across germany to buy the records and help his protégées up the hit parade . karlheinz kögel from media control told der spiegel that brandes " spun a web across the entire country with considerable criminal energy . " as if that was n't bad enough , an anonymous source familiar with the workings of the music industry told german daily taz that brandes is n't the only one .
" it 's exactly what every product manager does if he wants to see his labors rewarded , " he explained .
he also pointed out that newcomer acts are , in fact , often given a bit of a " leg-up " when they first enter the charts . even gracia herself was n't bothering to act innocent .
" everyone in the business buys up their own records , " she said .
" if you do n't , you 're just plain stupid . " expelled from the charts , but not eurovision even so , the three acts given a leg-up by brandes have now been banished from the charts by the phonographic industry association and media control . gracia , however , will still be heading for kiev .
the phono association maintains the guilty party is the producers rather than the artists and has announced she can still represent germany at the eurovision . it has n't been a popular decision .
" cheating is cheating and gracia should n't go to kiev , " argued germany 's former hit parade host dieter-thomas heck . country singer gunter gabriel agreed .
" it 's shameful , " he told news agency ddp , adding that the case is symptomatic of the music industry 's staggering greed .
" it 's all about business , but music should be something for the soul , " he lamented . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the neue deutsche welle rises german pop and rock music is suddenly making a comeback - thanks to good bands and better media coverage .

it 's focusing on ways to effectively strengthen european defense efforts with a view to improving joint missions in crisis areas on the continent and elsewhere . the two-day conference in berlin has drawn high-ranking politicians , nato officials and eu defense experts and aims to highlight efforts to further harmonize defense cooperation within the north atlantic alliance and the eu 's own defense initiatives . it 's being held at a time when both the eu and nato are in the process of building up rapid reaction forces , or battle groups , as european strategists prefer to call them .
both organizations are potentially drawing upon the same pools of soldiers which indicates that rivalry can never be ruled out . but in a bid to further heal transatlantic relations after the controversy over the us-led war in iraq , assurances are being heard ever so often that the eu ’ s own security efforts are invariably intended to complement - not duplicate or rival - nato . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck " it would be totally wrong to view the development of european defense capabilities separately from advances within nato , " said germany 's social democrat defense minister , peter struck -lrb- photo -rrb- .
he added that both nato and the european union are currently making efforts to be better prepared for out-of-area missions in a bid to adapt to a fast changing security environment . " nato must be open to reform " there can be no doubt whatsoever that in future nato has to be the place where dialogue on transatlantic security strategies must be intensified , struck added .
" the alliance has to be open for reform , " struck added . this is what german chancellor gerhard schröder demanded at a recent security conference in munich , and his words are being taken seriously by nato leaders . struck ’ s message to the conference was taken up by alessandro minuto rizzo , deputy secretary-general of nato .
he made it clear that it had been wrong to try and sweep different threat perception levels on both sides of the atlantic under the carpet and demanded that a fresh initiative be made to debate security strategies more openly within nato . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german nato troops in afghanistan " we need to understand that nato is not only a forum for action .
we must also understand that it ’ s a forum for debate , " said minuto rizzo .
" during the iraq controversy , nato was manifestly under-utilized as a consultative forum , and we paid a high price for that , " he said .
" i ’ m confident that we ’ ve learned our lesson .
if we want to preserve nato as a central framework for effective multilateralism , we must engage in multilateral debate . " focus on rapid response forces defense minister struck said it would be in the interest of all to see the european union reinforce its own military capabilities alongside those of nato . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a congolese boy points as he speak to a french soldier , thursday , june 19 , 2003 during a foot patrol on the outskirts of bunia , congo .
he pointed to the eu ’ s successful peace-keeping operations in bosnia-herzegovina and parts of africa .
he announced that germany would be willing to contribute 50 military observers to the 250-strong eu contingent to become active in sudan soon . the chairman of nato ’ s military committee , general harald kujat , himself german , left mr struck ’ s remarks uncommented and focused on the capabilities of nato ’ s future rapid response forces instead . " a great proportion of the alliance ’ s forces will need to be deployable well away from their own territories and have the flexibility to switch rapidly between war fighting and peace keeping , " kujat said .
" future forces must be more capable of operating within a networked environment .
there will be a greater need for specialist skills in areas such as engineering , communications , special operations , civil-military cooperation , logistics , medical services and intelligence . " more money needed several speakers complained about eu defense programs being gravely underfinanced . they noted that the 16 european nato member countries together currently spend only $ 200 million on defense capabilities annually - which amounts to only half of the us defense budget . hardy graupner -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to head peacekeeping in bosnia the european union announced friday it plans to replace nato 's peacekeeping troops with its own in bosnia-herzegovina at the end of the year , as part of a new eu paramilitary force .

it 's focusing on ways to effectively strengthen european defense efforts with a view to improving joint missions in crisis areas on the continent and elsewhere . the two-day conference in berlin has drawn high-ranking politicians , nato officials and eu defense experts and aims to highlight efforts to further harmonize defense cooperation within the north atlantic alliance and the eu 's own defense initiatives . it 's being held at a time when both the eu and nato are in the process of building up rapid reaction forces , or battle groups , as european strategists prefer to call them .
both organizations are potentially drawing upon the same pools of soldiers which indicates that rivalry can never be ruled out . but in a bid to further heal transatlantic relations after the controversy over the us-led war in iraq , assurances are being heard ever so often that the eu ’ s own security efforts are invariably intended to complement - not duplicate or rival - nato . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck " it would be totally wrong to view the development of european defense capabilities separately from advances within nato , " said germany 's social democrat defense minister , peter struck -lrb- photo -rrb- .
he added that both nato and the european union are currently making efforts to be better prepared for out-of-area missions in a bid to adapt to a fast changing security environment . " nato must be open to reform " there can be no doubt whatsoever that in future nato has to be the place where dialogue on transatlantic security strategies must be intensified , struck added .

the highest court in germany is now turning its attention to it . effective and swift cooperation - that 's what 's always been demanded on the legal level in europe .
towards that end , the european warrant arrest was introduced in the bloc early last year .
it aims to simplify extradition procedures for suspected criminals within the european union . but , not many eu members are really happy about it , with many preferring to retain elements of the old procedure .
that may seem odd given that the old regulation was rather cumbersome .
for instance , earlier the suspected crime had to be punishable and allowed to be pursued by the law both in the home country of the suspected criminal as well as in the nation that he was to be extradited to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money laundering and counterfeiting are included on the so-called " positive list of criminal areas . "
the new regulation has been significantly simplified in this regard : when the suspected crime is included on a so-called " positive list of criminal areas , " then the criminal can be extradited . the problem however is that the list is too vague .
" for example : what exactly does sabotage mean ? " said helmut satzger , professor for european criminal law at the university of munich .
" we do n't have a provision on the books to deal with sabotage in german law , " satzger said .
the same is true for racism and xenophobia . criticism is growing in germany about the european arrest warrant and its apparent contradictions and the german constitution court in karlsruhe is set to grapple with the topic in detail for the first time this week . different legal systems in many other cases , the crime must be punishable in both states much as was the case earlier .
despite that , there are huge differences in various eu states regarding the severity of the crime .
the differing legal systems in the eu member states have prompted concerns among german lawyers ' groups , law professors and lawyers .
how for instance , they ask , can a ruling of greek courts be accepted in germany when there are completely different laws here ? these worries are shared by other eu members states too and some have reacted .
" for example there are states like denmark who have n't translated the new regulations in binding law , " said satzger .
others such as france have reserved the right to examine the dual criminality principle contained in the european arrest warrant . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic militant metin kaplan was extradited to turkey by germany after a long-drawn out legal battle .
he was extradited on charges of treason for allegedly masterminding a failed plot to crash an airplane into the mausoleum of the founder of secular turkey .
but , it 's not just differing laws in eu states that have prompted worries .
even bans on extradition of criminals are problematic .
the eu so far recognizes only three hindrances to extradition : the already existing punishment of the criminal in his home country , if he 's not criminally liable due to underage , or an amnesty .
as against that member states can no longer refuse to surrender to another member state their own citizens on the ground that they are nationals . no appeal in the home country possible " for example , if lithuania issued such an arrest warrant against a german then germany must surrender its national to lithuania , " said satzger .
that means , that the german national could not protest that the crime is n't punishable in germany .
" if the suspected criminal does n't know lithuania , if he has no idea of the lithuanian legal system and if he also does n't exactly know for example how the mandatory defense counsel would work , then we 're dealing with certain problems here , " said satzger . long before the european warrant arrest actually too effect , a few german constitutional court judges had strongly criticized the procedure .
" the german constitutional court has undertaken a big task in the respect : the judges are using the arrest warrant to answer some very fundamental questions about the relationship between european law and national law , " said satzger . he added that most member states had accepted that european law would override national constitutional law .
but , germany 's not convinced . daphne antachopoulos -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the trouble with nailing terror suspects another terror trial without a hard conviction this week has illustrated once more the difficulties the german judiciary has in putting terror suspects behind bars .

the highest court in germany is now turning its attention to it . effective and swift cooperation - that 's what 's always been demanded on the legal level in europe .
towards that end , the european warrant arrest was introduced in the bloc early last year .
it aims to simplify extradition procedures for suspected criminals within the european union . but , not many eu members are really happy about it , with many preferring to retain elements of the old procedure .
that may seem odd given that the old regulation was rather cumbersome .
for instance , earlier the suspected crime had to be punishable and allowed to be pursued by the law both in the home country of the suspected criminal as well as in the nation that he was to be extradited to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money laundering and counterfeiting are included on the so-called " positive list of criminal areas . "
the new regulation has been significantly simplified in this regard : when the suspected crime is included on a so-called " positive list of criminal areas , " then the criminal can be extradited . the problem however is that the list is too vague .
" for example : what exactly does sabotage mean ? " said helmut satzger , professor for european criminal law at the university of munich .
" we do n't have a provision on the books to deal with sabotage in german law , " satzger said .
the same is true for racism and xenophobia . criticism is growing in germany about the european arrest warrant and its apparent contradictions and the german constitution court in karlsruhe is set to grapple with the topic in detail for the first time this week . different legal systems in many other cases , the crime must be punishable in both states much as was the case earlier .
despite that , there are huge differences in various eu states regarding the severity of the crime .
the differing legal systems in the eu member states have prompted concerns among german lawyers ' groups , law professors and lawyers .
how for instance , they ask , can a ruling of greek courts be accepted in germany when there are completely different laws here ? these worries are shared by other eu members states too and some have reacted .
" for example there are states like denmark who have n't translated the new regulations in binding law , " said satzger .
others such as france have reserved the right to examine the dual criminality principle contained in the european arrest warrant . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic militant metin kaplan was extradited to turkey by germany after a long-drawn out legal battle .
he was extradited on charges of treason for allegedly masterminding a failed plot to crash an airplane into the mausoleum of the founder of secular turkey .
but , it 's not just differing laws in eu states that have prompted worries .
even bans on extradition of criminals are problematic .
the eu so far recognizes only three hindrances to extradition : the already existing punishment of the criminal in his home country , if he 's not criminally liable due to underage , or an amnesty .
as against that member states can no longer refuse to surrender to another member state their own citizens on the ground that they are nationals . no appeal in the home country possible " for example , if lithuania issued such an arrest warrant against a german then germany must surrender its national to lithuania , " said satzger .
that means , that the german national could not protest that the crime is n't punishable in germany .
" if the suspected criminal does n't know lithuania , if he has no idea of the lithuanian legal system and if he also does n't exactly know for example how the mandatory defense counsel would work , then we 're dealing with certain problems here , " said satzger . long before the european warrant arrest actually too effect , a few german constitutional court judges had strongly criticized the procedure .
" the german constitutional court has undertaken a big task in the respect : the judges are using the arrest warrant to answer some very fundamental questions about the relationship between european law and national law , " said satzger . he added that most member states had accepted that european law would override national constitutional law .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 13.04.2005 bayern 's dream dies in european thriller großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oli kahn ca n't believe it as chelsea 's first goal is deflected past him bayern munich stumbled at the quarter-final hurdle in the uefa champions league on tuesday despite beating chelsea 3-2 .
the 4-2 defeat in london a week earlier meant the victory was a hollow one .
bayern were eliminated . bayern munich 's dreams of european glory ended in dramatic style in the olympic stadium on tuesday night as english premiership side chelsea swept into the semi-finals of the champions league at the expense of the german bundesliga leaders despite losing 3-2 . although bayern were winners on the night , the 4-2 defeat at stamford bridge last week was enough to earn the premiership leaders a 6-5 aggregate victory and send felix magath 's side crashing out . it is the second successive season chelsea have reached the semi-finals of europe 's premier competition and they will hope to make amends for last season 's shock 5-3 aggregate defeat by monaco . chelsea led 4-2 from the first leg and england international frank lampard scored on the hour mark - his third goal against bayern in six days - to ensure bayern had to score three times .
" another deflected goal from chelsea , " said bayern coach magath .
" chelsea were not better than us they were just more fortunate and clinical in front of goal . " missed chances cost bayern dearly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : didier drogba is congratulated at the end of the match in munich by team mate eidur gudjonsson .
bayern scored three goals through claudio pizarro -lrb- 65 -rrb- and late goals from substitutes mehmet scholl and paolo guerrero both in stoppage time but it was their earlier profligacy that cost them dear .
bayern were eventually punished by ivory coast star didier drogba who scored the decisive goal for chelsea with 10 minutes to go . chelsea 's portuguese manager jose mourinho - still suspended by uefa - was amongst the capacity 59,000 fans watching from the stands and will be delighted as his charges scored twice to ensure bayern 's late goal fest was irrelevant . fitness coach rui faria was mourinho 's representative at the press conference and revealed the manager left the stadium because he felt his privacy was being invaded .
" jose will be delighted with the result but he left the stands because he could not watch the match in peace , " revealed faria .
" he went back to the hotel and watched us progress from there . " chelsea face the prospect of an all english semi-final clash with four-time european cup winners liverpool although italian giants juventus will fancy their chances of overturning a 2-1 deficit in turin on wednesday . bayern made four changes with dutch international roy makaay and peru star pizarro back to form their attacking partnership . first and fatal goal to chelsea manager magath claimed conceding the first goal would be ' fatal ' and it almost happened in the second minute with drogba - a lone target-man - rushing on to a through pass . bayern custodian oliver kahn came storming out to block his path and magath breathed a sigh of relief , although it was later to turn to despair . hosts munich then seized the initiative and german international michael ballack - at the centre of a diving storm in the first leg - saw his goal-bound shot blocked in the fifth minute and blazed his follow-up high over the crossbar .
pizarro then forced a brilliant point blank save from chelsea 's czech international goalkeeper petr cech in a thrilling first quarter hour . bastian schweinsteiger was causing havoc down the right flank and a goal looked inevitable but it was chelsea who scored it against the run of play .
in the 30th minute , joe cole fed england international team-mate lampard and the midfielder 's shot ricocheted off brazilian defender lucio sending kahn the wrong way . " the first goal was very fortunate , " said bayern defender sagnol .
" but to be honest the damage was done in the first leg . " munich hit again while chasing the game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england 's frank lampard opened the scoring in the olympic stadium .
it was more bad luck for lucio who deflected in cole 's first goal in the 4-2 first leg defeat at stamford bridge .
lampard 's deflected effort meant bayern needed to score three goals to go through and ballack should have got one of them in the 38th minute when he strangely chose to play the ball across the face of goal instead of shooting himself . bayern pulled off martin demichelis for the more inventive mehmet scholl early in the second half .
bayern were handed a lifeline in the 65th minute when cech could only parry a ballack header on to the post and the ball rolled kindly to pizarro who stroked the ball in to level the scores . with 25 minutes left to score twice bayern hit the crossbar through a deflected bixente lizarazu cross and then eidur gudjohnsen cleared off the line as chelsea began to wobble . but with 10 minutes left the excellent cole crossed for drogba to bullet a header past kahn and bayern knew the game was up .
guerrero and scholl both scored in stoppage time but bayern were left cursing having conceded six goals over the two legs . bayern 's star midfielder michael ballack said : " it 's annoying .
we were the best team and we deserved to go through .
we had numerous chances and should have got something out of tonight .
but chelsea are a very capable team . " dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern meet their master in london bayern munich are eager to accept a challenge , but they may have found their master in english side , chelsea .

the 4-2 defeat in london a week earlier meant the victory was a hollow one .
bayern were eliminated . bayern munich 's dreams of european glory ended in dramatic style in the olympic stadium on tuesday night as english premiership side chelsea swept into the semi-finals of the champions league at the expense of the german bundesliga leaders despite losing 3-2 . although bayern were winners on the night , the 4-2 defeat at stamford bridge last week was enough to earn the premiership leaders a 6-5 aggregate victory and send felix magath 's side crashing out . it is the second successive season chelsea have reached the semi-finals of europe 's premier competition and they will hope to make amends for last season 's shock 5-3 aggregate defeat by monaco . chelsea led 4-2 from the first leg and england international frank lampard scored on the hour mark - his third goal against bayern in six days - to ensure bayern had to score three times .
" another deflected goal from chelsea , " said bayern coach magath .
" chelsea were not better than us they were just more fortunate and clinical in front of goal . " missed chances cost bayern dearly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : didier drogba is congratulated at the end of the match in munich by team mate eidur gudjonsson .
bayern scored three goals through claudio pizarro -lrb- 65 -rrb- and late goals from substitutes mehmet scholl and paolo guerrero both in stoppage time but it was their earlier profligacy that cost them dear .
bayern were eventually punished by ivory coast star didier drogba who scored the decisive goal for chelsea with 10 minutes to go . chelsea 's portuguese manager jose mourinho - still suspended by uefa - was amongst the capacity 59,000 fans watching from the stands and will be delighted as his charges scored twice to ensure bayern 's late goal fest was irrelevant . fitness coach rui faria was mourinho 's representative at the press conference and revealed the manager left the stadium because he felt his privacy was being invaded .
" jose will be delighted with the result but he left the stands because he could not watch the match in peace , " revealed faria .
" he went back to the hotel and watched us progress from there . " chelsea face the prospect of an all english semi-final clash with four-time european cup winners liverpool although italian giants juventus will fancy their chances of overturning a 2-1 deficit in turin on wednesday . bayern made four changes with dutch international roy makaay and peru star pizarro back to form their attacking partnership . first and fatal goal to chelsea manager magath claimed conceding the first goal would be ' fatal ' and it almost happened in the second minute with drogba - a lone target-man - rushing on to a through pass . bayern custodian oliver kahn came storming out to block his path and magath breathed a sigh of relief , although it was later to turn to despair . hosts munich then seized the initiative and german international michael ballack - at the centre of a diving storm in the first leg - saw his goal-bound shot blocked in the fifth minute and blazed his follow-up high over the crossbar .
pizarro then forced a brilliant point blank save from chelsea 's czech international goalkeeper petr cech in a thrilling first quarter hour . bastian schweinsteiger was causing havoc down the right flank and a goal looked inevitable but it was chelsea who scored it against the run of play .
in the 30th minute , joe cole fed england international team-mate lampard and the midfielder 's shot ricocheted off brazilian defender lucio sending kahn the wrong way . " the first goal was very fortunate , " said bayern defender sagnol .
" but to be honest the damage was done in the first leg . " munich hit again while chasing the game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england 's frank lampard opened the scoring in the olympic stadium .
it was more bad luck for lucio who deflected in cole 's first goal in the 4-2 first leg defeat at stamford bridge .
lampard 's deflected effort meant bayern needed to score three goals to go through and ballack should have got one of them in the 38th minute when he strangely chose to play the ball across the face of goal instead of shooting himself . bayern pulled off martin demichelis for the more inventive mehmet scholl early in the second half .
bayern were handed a lifeline in the 65th minute when cech could only parry a ballack header on to the post and the ball rolled kindly to pizarro who stroked the ball in to level the scores . with 25 minutes left to score twice bayern hit the crossbar through a deflected bixente lizarazu cross and then eidur gudjohnsen cleared off the line as chelsea began to wobble . but with 10 minutes left the excellent cole crossed for drogba to bullet a header past kahn and bayern knew the game was up .
guerrero and scholl both scored in stoppage time but bayern were left cursing having conceded six goals over the two legs . bayern 's star midfielder michael ballack said : " it 's annoying .
we were the best team and we deserved to go through .
we had numerous chances and should have got something out of tonight .
but chelsea are a very capable team . " dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern meet their master in london bayern munich are eager to accept a challenge , but they may have found their master in english side , chelsea .

" many told me , ' we learned to survive , but not how to live well ' , " said bode .
political support most of germany 's political leadership are war children .
chancellor schröder never even met his father , who fell in the war .
former president johannes rau had to clear away rubble in his home town of wuppertal after the war .
germany 's current president horst köhler spent years as a refugee and himself said that his biography is the biography of germany 's history .
" these leaders tell the public that their experiences during and after the war had a great impact on them and perhaps this makes it easier for other war children to talk about their past , " said radebold .
it is impossible to generalize the experiences of this " lost generation , " though .
each child went through his or her own personal trauma , which has a greater or lesser impact on them today .
" wars always involve a chain of traumatic experiences , " said bode .

none of them can throw away bread .

many who were babies or children during the war are still suffering from the trauma they experienced 60 years ago . in his speech commemorating the liberation of buchenwald concentration camp , chancellor gerhard schröder said remembering germany 's past - national socialism , war and genocide - was part of germany 's identity and , at the same time , " a permanent moral responsibility . "
yet there is a significant part of this past that has been neglected .
" it is surprising that the generation of children , who were born during the war and spent a large part of their childhood in the war , have until recently been remarkably silent about their biographies and appeared unaffected , " said dr. michael ermann , head of the war childhood project at munich 's ludwig-maximilians-university .
" their speechlessness found a counterpart in the little interest that the public showed for their fate , " ermann told german radio südwestrundfunk .
it is only in recent years that historians , psychoanalysts and german society are taking a closer look at these " kriegskinder " or children of war .
an international convention on the generation of war children is meeting in frankfurt this week to discuss the damage that the war and its effects had on people 's souls .
a robbed childhood dr. hartmut radebold , a former professor of clinical psychology at the university of kassel and the founder of germany 's geriatric psychotherapy , said these children were subject to suffering in three major areas .
" they faced violence , they had to deal with separation and loss of loved ones , and they had to come to terms with losing their homes , safety and security , " said radebold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many children had to flee their homes the psychiatrist helga spranger , one of the founding members of the war child association kriegskind.de and herself a war child , described the lives of children during the war in the international journal of evacuee and war child studies .
" children were separated from their parents , orphaned , evacuated by force , displaced , kidnapped , shot at , bombed , wounded , mutilated , raped , expropriated , blackmailed , adopted by force , drafted at an early age and forced into labor , " spranger wrote .
" in short , they suffered from stress for months or years and were basically robbed of their childhood . "
the horrors these children experienced continued to brew under the surface .
" it costs endless energy to keep it inside for decades , " said ermann .
haunted by memories in recent years , an increasing number of war children have suffered from agonizing health problems , as their trauma finally rises to the surface .
according to radebold , many are diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder .
" they are haunted by their memories and the terrors they experienced and are overwhelmed by them , " he said .
symptoms include jumpiness , restlessness , sleep disorders or withdrawal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sound of a plane can often trigger the trauma there are also many images that are burned into their minds , which trigger their trauma , said spranger .
" aside from the basic feelings of fear of death or abandonment , disgust and wishes of escaping , lasting horrifying impressions are hidden in the memories for a lifetime , " said spranger , such as the smell of burned houses , animals and humans after firebombs , hearing sirens or the shooting of weapons .
but despite their anguish , many war children have still been hesitant to talk .
sabine bode , author of the book " die vergessene generation " or " the lost generation , " looked at the stories of these war children to trace how their experiences shaped their lives .
she said her search for stories was tough .
" most of the people i spoke to fended off my questions with remarks like ' others were much worse off than i was ' or ' it did n't hurt us ' , " said bode .
" i rarely heard anyone complain about their fate .
i have the impression that despite the frequently observed trait that germans like to see themselves as victims , former war children of all people were in no way whiny about their past . "
history is a clogged toilet there are several reasons why these stories are only coming to the surface now .
many experiences were " re-awakened " through the images of other more recent wars , such as in kosovo or iraq .
that fact that these war children have reached retirement age also plays a role .
" in old age , you ca n't repress things as easily anymore , " said bode .
a profession also acts as a stabilizing factor for someone 's identity , said radebold .
" so when these war children retire , they have more time on their hands to think and with this time , come the memories , " he said .
in certain cases , trauma can be reactivated .
" this means that old memories are reawakened through a siren or an airplane that sounds similar to the ones during the war , " said radebold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " crabwalk " by günter grass was published in 2002 but bode said that war children also needed a form of " permission " to open their souls .
and this was given to them by nobel prize winner günter grass .
" he said , we also have to attend to germans ' problems after the war , " said bode .
" history or , to be more precise , the history we germans have repeatedly mucked up , is a clogged toilet .

many who were babies or children during the war are still suffering from the trauma they experienced 60 years ago . in his speech commemorating the liberation of buchenwald concentration camp , chancellor gerhard schröder said remembering germany 's past - national socialism , war and genocide - was part of germany 's identity and , at the same time , " a permanent moral responsibility . "
yet there is a significant part of this past that has been neglected .
" it is surprising that the generation of children , who were born during the war and spent a large part of their childhood in the war , have until recently been remarkably silent about their biographies and appeared unaffected , " said dr. michael ermann , head of the war childhood project at munich 's ludwig-maximilians-university .
" their speechlessness found a counterpart in the little interest that the public showed for their fate , " ermann told german radio südwestrundfunk .
it is only in recent years that historians , psychoanalysts and german society are taking a closer look at these " kriegskinder " or children of war .
an international convention on the generation of war children is meeting in frankfurt this week to discuss the damage that the war and its effects had on people 's souls .
a robbed childhood dr. hartmut radebold , a former professor of clinical psychology at the university of kassel and the founder of germany 's geriatric psychotherapy , said these children were subject to suffering in three major areas .
" they faced violence , they had to deal with separation and loss of loved ones , and they had to come to terms with losing their homes , safety and security , " said radebold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many children had to flee their homes the psychiatrist helga spranger , one of the founding members of the war child association kriegskind.de and herself a war child , described the lives of children during the war in the international journal of evacuee and war child studies .
" children were separated from their parents , orphaned , evacuated by force , displaced , kidnapped , shot at , bombed , wounded , mutilated , raped , expropriated , blackmailed , adopted by force , drafted at an early age and forced into labor , " spranger wrote .
" in short , they suffered from stress for months or years and were basically robbed of their childhood . "
the horrors these children experienced continued to brew under the surface .
" it costs endless energy to keep it inside for decades , " said ermann .
haunted by memories in recent years , an increasing number of war children have suffered from agonizing health problems , as their trauma finally rises to the surface .
according to radebold , many are diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder .
" they are haunted by their memories and the terrors they experienced and are overwhelmed by them , " he said .
symptoms include jumpiness , restlessness , sleep disorders or withdrawal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sound of a plane can often trigger the trauma there are also many images that are burned into their minds , which trigger their trauma , said spranger .
" aside from the basic feelings of fear of death or abandonment , disgust and wishes of escaping , lasting horrifying impressions are hidden in the memories for a lifetime , " said spranger , such as the smell of burned houses , animals and humans after firebombs , hearing sirens or the shooting of weapons .
but despite their anguish , many war children have still been hesitant to talk .
sabine bode , author of the book " die vergessene generation " or " the lost generation , " looked at the stories of these war children to trace how their experiences shaped their lives .
she said her search for stories was tough .
" most of the people i spoke to fended off my questions with remarks like ' others were much worse off than i was ' or ' it did n't hurt us ' , " said bode .
" i rarely heard anyone complain about their fate .
i have the impression that despite the frequently observed trait that germans like to see themselves as victims , former war children of all people were in no way whiny about their past . "
history is a clogged toilet there are several reasons why these stories are only coming to the surface now .
many experiences were " re-awakened " through the images of other more recent wars , such as in kosovo or iraq .
that fact that these war children have reached retirement age also plays a role .
" in old age , you ca n't repress things as easily anymore , " said bode .
a profession also acts as a stabilizing factor for someone 's identity , said radebold .
" so when these war children retire , they have more time on their hands to think and with this time , come the memories , " he said .
in certain cases , trauma can be reactivated .
" this means that old memories are reawakened through a siren or an airplane that sounds similar to the ones during the war , " said radebold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " crabwalk " by günter grass was published in 2002 but bode said that war children also needed a form of " permission " to open their souls .
and this was given to them by nobel prize winner günter grass .
" he said , we also have to attend to germans ' problems after the war , " said bode .
" history or , to be more precise , the history we germans have repeatedly mucked up , is a clogged toilet .
we flush and flush , but the shit keeps rising , " grass wrote in his book " crabwalk , " published in 2002 .

and indeed it appears that the german foreign office readily employed former nazi officials who were looking for work immediately after the war . efforts are now underway to open up the ministry 's recent past to public scrutiny , according to klaus scharioth , undersecretary in the foreign ministry .
" we need to look into the history of the foreign office under the nazis in a systematic manner , " he said on monday .
" foreign minister joschka fischer is currently thinking of establishing an independent panel of historians who would carry out this task . " fischer has come under fire from senior members of his ministry for refusing to allow full obituaries of former nazi party members to be published in the ministry 's in-house newsletter .
he took the decision after it became known that posthumous tributes had been paid to franz nüsslein , a convicted war criminal . safe in franco 's spain the scandal was uncovered by marga henseler , a member of the ministry 's staff who has since retired .

" in the ministry rumors were quickly making the rounds that he did time in prague , " she said .

there were some protests internally , after which nüsslein was quickly moved to the mission in barcelona in spain , where dictator franco ruled at the time and where nothing could happen to him anymore . "
purging the remnants bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the foreign ministry in berlin earlier this year , joschka fischer also refused to pay full tribute to franz krapf , a former ss and nazi party member who later became germany 's ambassador to nato .
fischer 's actions provoked a revolt by some 70 diplomats who publicly accused the foreign minister of applying double standards in a reference to his own past as a leftist militant . although weakened by a different scandal over lax visa regulations , fischer appears determined to battle on in this dispute , which historians say should have reached the public domain long ago .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.04.2005 historians to probe ministry 's nazi past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer is calling for historians to investigate the ministry sixty years after the collapse of the nazi regime , the german foreign ministry plans to look into its controversial postwar history , including allegations that it employed nazi war criminals . historians have long quipped that you could find more former nazi party members in the newly-established german diplomatic service after world war ii than you could in its predecessor during hitler 's third reich .
and indeed it appears that the german foreign office readily employed former nazi officials who were looking for work immediately after the war . efforts are now underway to open up the ministry 's recent past to public scrutiny , according to klaus scharioth , undersecretary in the foreign ministry .
" we need to look into the history of the foreign office under the nazis in a systematic manner , " he said on monday .
" foreign minister joschka fischer is currently thinking of establishing an independent panel of historians who would carry out this task . " fischer has come under fire from senior members of his ministry for refusing to allow full obituaries of former nazi party members to be published in the ministry 's in-house newsletter .
he took the decision after it became known that posthumous tributes had been paid to franz nüsslein , a convicted war criminal . safe in franco 's spain the scandal was uncovered by marga henseler , a member of the ministry 's staff who has since retired .
" i could n't believe my eyes when i saw the obituary , " she said .
" i immediately wrote a letter to joschka fischer urging him not to tolerate this . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers in occupied prague , march 1939 franz nüsslein was a former nazi prosecutor in german-occupied czechoslovakia where he was involved in numerous death sentences handed down to the enemies of nazi germany .
after the war , a court in prague sentenced him to 20 years in prison for war crimes , but he was released after serving only seven years . henseler recalled that nüsslein joined the foreign service shortly thereafter .
" in the ministry rumors were quickly making the rounds that he did time in prague , " she said .
" so everybody knew about his past .
there were some protests internally , after which nüsslein was quickly moved to the mission in barcelona in spain , where dictator franco ruled at the time and where nothing could happen to him anymore . "
purging the remnants bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the foreign ministry in berlin earlier this year , joschka fischer also refused to pay full tribute to franz krapf , a former ss and nazi party member who later became germany 's ambassador to nato .
fischer 's actions provoked a revolt by some 70 diplomats who publicly accused the foreign minister of applying double standards in a reference to his own past as a leftist militant . although weakened by a different scandal over lax visa regulations , fischer appears determined to battle on in this dispute , which historians say should have reached the public domain long ago .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 13.04.2005 berlin moves to counter wage dumping großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east european laborers often work for a fraction of what germans earn the german government has formed a new task force to battle wage dumping and examine ways to expand minimum wages to some sectors as the eu 's eastward expansion brings in an influx of cheap labor . on wednesday , the german cabinet set up a task force in an effort to close the loopholes that allow eastern europeans to work for a fraction of what their german colleagues earn , both legally and illegally . the measure , part of german chancellor gerhard schröder 's package to spur growth and create jobs , is meant to prevent a distortion of competition and protect people from having to work for too little . it 's in part a reaction to a 1.2 percent drop in wages in germany following the entry of poland , the czech republic and the baltic states into the european union last year .
experts believe that downward pressure on wages in germany will continue this year unless berlin takes decisive steps to curb the influx of cheap labor from eastern europe . chasing " black sheep " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the construction industry already has regulations in place to prevent wage dumping .
the task force in the german economics and finance ministry will in future conduct bilateral talks with the 10 new member states in order to push them to uphold eu labor and services law .
the new working group is also meant to create clear criteria for service providers , branches , companies as well as workers from the new member states . gerd andres , parliamentary under secretary in the german economics ministry , said the authorities should go after " black sheep " and prevent eastern european firms from bypassing eu laws to the detriment of the german labor market and economy . germany did insist on and achieve a seven-year freeze on people from the new member states from getting automatic access to the german labor market in the run up to the eu 's eastward expansion last year .
but immediately upon entry , companies in poland and the other new member states gained the right to sell business services in the rest of the eu .
just last month , chancellor gerhard schröder had to intervene in eu plans to liberalize services which would have thrown the doors further open for cheap labor from the east . under eu law , workers sent to a different country for a short-term contract must receive the minimum social benefits and wages of the state where they are carrying out the project . this doesn ’ t apply , however , to self-employed workers and foreign subcontractors .
in germany , the meat-packing industry has been particularly affected .
tens of thousands of workers lost their jobs in recent months , as their work is increasingly being done by companies from poland and hungary who essentially " lend " their foreign workers to companies here .
the wages the easterners receive are between just three and five euros an hour . expanding minimum wages in addition , the new task force is meant to examine whether the minimum wage rule that applies to the german building sector , one of the few industries that does have such a provision , can be expanded to other areas . unlike other eu countries , germany does not have a general minimum wage , because such a law was long considered to be an infringement of the right for industrial sectors to have their own pay scales .
but , now with low-wage workers from eastern europe squeezing germans out of jobs at a time of record unemployment and key regional elections coming up in the state of north rhine-westphalia next month , chancellor schröder is considering extending the law . " we 'll take a look at whether the anti-dumping law that applies to the building trade can be gradually extended to take in other sectors , " schröder said on wednesday .
" the aim is to make sure that dumping incidents do not ruin good companies that are unable to compete with such low wages . ” employers against minimum wages however , not everybody is happy with the idea of legally-set minimum wages .
german employers say it would be counterproductive as job opportunities for unskilled german workers would be lost .
in addition they claim companies would be burdened with the costs of greater bureaucracy . the institute for labor market and job research -lrb- iab -rrb- said that a minimum wage in individual sectors would help to reduce the pressure on wages in germany through eastward expansion , provided it was just a temporary measure . ulrich walwei , deputy head of the iab told the daily berliner zeitung that the government also had to be careful in its selection of sectors to introduce a temporary minimum wage in order to avoid damaging competition . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate flares up over minimum wages with the eu 's eastward expansion and subsequent downward pressure on wages in germany , opposition conservatives have stoked debate over the introduction of minimum wages , saying they 're ready to support such a move .

experts believe that downward pressure on wages in germany will continue this year unless berlin takes decisive steps to curb the influx of cheap labor from eastern europe . chasing " black sheep " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the construction industry already has regulations in place to prevent wage dumping .
the task force in the german economics and finance ministry will in future conduct bilateral talks with the 10 new member states in order to push them to uphold eu labor and services law .
the new working group is also meant to create clear criteria for service providers , branches , companies as well as workers from the new member states . gerd andres , parliamentary under secretary in the german economics ministry , said the authorities should go after " black sheep " and prevent eastern european firms from bypassing eu laws to the detriment of the german labor market and economy . germany did insist on and achieve a seven-year freeze on people from the new member states from getting automatic access to the german labor market in the run up to the eu 's eastward expansion last year .
but immediately upon entry , companies in poland and the other new member states gained the right to sell business services in the rest of the eu .
just last month , chancellor gerhard schröder had to intervene in eu plans to liberalize services which would have thrown the doors further open for cheap labor from the east . under eu law , workers sent to a different country for a short-term contract must receive the minimum social benefits and wages of the state where they are carrying out the project . this doesn ’ t apply , however , to self-employed workers and foreign subcontractors .
in germany , the meat-packing industry has been particularly affected .
tens of thousands of workers lost their jobs in recent months , as their work is increasingly being done by companies from poland and hungary who essentially " lend " their foreign workers to companies here .
the wages the easterners receive are between just three and five euros an hour . expanding minimum wages in addition , the new task force is meant to examine whether the minimum wage rule that applies to the german building sector , one of the few industries that does have such a provision , can be expanded to other areas . unlike other eu countries , germany does not have a general minimum wage , because such a law was long considered to be an infringement of the right for industrial sectors to have their own pay scales .
but , now with low-wage workers from eastern europe squeezing germans out of jobs at a time of record unemployment and key regional elections coming up in the state of north rhine-westphalia next month , chancellor schröder is considering extending the law . " we 'll take a look at whether the anti-dumping law that applies to the building trade can be gradually extended to take in other sectors , " schröder said on wednesday .
" the aim is to make sure that dumping incidents do not ruin good companies that are unable to compete with such low wages . ” employers against minimum wages however , not everybody is happy with the idea of legally-set minimum wages .
german employers say it would be counterproductive as job opportunities for unskilled german workers would be lost .
in addition they claim companies would be burdened with the costs of greater bureaucracy . the institute for labor market and job research -lrb- iab -rrb- said that a minimum wage in individual sectors would help to reduce the pressure on wages in germany through eastward expansion , provided it was just a temporary measure . ulrich walwei , deputy head of the iab told the daily berliner zeitung that the government also had to be careful in its selection of sectors to introduce a temporary minimum wage in order to avoid damaging competition . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate flares up over minimum wages with the eu 's eastward expansion and subsequent downward pressure on wages in germany , opposition conservatives have stoked debate over the introduction of minimum wages , saying they 're ready to support such a move .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.04.2005 meet focuses on nato-eu defense efforts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german and french nato peacekeepers in bosnia a conference on european security has opened in berlin .
it 's focusing on ways to effectively strengthen european defense efforts with a view to improving joint missions in crisis areas on the continent and elsewhere . the two-day conference in berlin has drawn high-ranking politicians , nato officials and eu defense experts and aims to highlight efforts to further harmonize defense cooperation within the north atlantic alliance and the eu 's own defense initiatives . it 's being held at a time when both the eu and nato are in the process of building up rapid reaction forces , or battle groups , as european strategists prefer to call them .
both organizations are potentially drawing upon the same pools of soldiers which indicates that rivalry can never be ruled out . but in a bid to further heal transatlantic relations after the controversy over the us-led war in iraq , assurances are being heard ever so often that the eu ’ s own security efforts are invariably intended to complement - not duplicate or rival - nato . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck " it would be totally wrong to view the development of european defense capabilities separately from advances within nato , " said germany 's social democrat defense minister , peter struck -lrb- photo -rrb- .
he added that both nato and the european union are currently making efforts to be better prepared for out-of-area missions in a bid to adapt to a fast changing security environment . " nato must be open to reform " there can be no doubt whatsoever that in future nato has to be the place where dialogue on transatlantic security strategies must be intensified , struck added .
" the alliance has to be open for reform , " struck added . this is what german chancellor gerhard schröder demanded at a recent security conference in munich , and his words are being taken seriously by nato leaders . struck ’ s message to the conference was taken up by alessandro minuto rizzo , deputy secretary-general of nato .
he made it clear that it had been wrong to try and sweep different threat perception levels on both sides of the atlantic under the carpet and demanded that a fresh initiative be made to debate security strategies more openly within nato . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german nato troops in afghanistan " we need to understand that nato is not only a forum for action .
we must also understand that it ’ s a forum for debate , " said minuto rizzo .
" during the iraq controversy , nato was manifestly under-utilized as a consultative forum , and we paid a high price for that , " he said .
" i ’ m confident that we ’ ve learned our lesson .
if we want to preserve nato as a central framework for effective multilateralism , we must engage in multilateral debate . " focus on rapid response forces defense minister struck said it would be in the interest of all to see the european union reinforce its own military capabilities alongside those of nato . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a congolese boy points as he speak to a french soldier , thursday , june 19 , 2003 during a foot patrol on the outskirts of bunia , congo .
he pointed to the eu ’ s successful peace-keeping operations in bosnia-herzegovina and parts of africa .
he announced that germany would be willing to contribute 50 military observers to the 250-strong eu contingent to become active in sudan soon . the chairman of nato ’ s military committee , general harald kujat , himself german , left mr struck ’ s remarks uncommented and focused on the capabilities of nato ’ s future rapid response forces instead . " a great proportion of the alliance ’ s forces will need to be deployable well away from their own territories and have the flexibility to switch rapidly between war fighting and peace keeping , " kujat said .
" future forces must be more capable of operating within a networked environment .
there will be a greater need for specialist skills in areas such as engineering , communications , special operations , civil-military cooperation , logistics , medical services and intelligence . " more money needed several speakers complained about eu defense programs being gravely underfinanced . they noted that the 16 european nato member countries together currently spend only $ 200 million on defense capabilities annually - which amounts to only half of the us defense budget . hardy graupner -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to head peacekeeping in bosnia the european union announced friday it plans to replace nato 's peacekeeping troops with its own in bosnia-herzegovina at the end of the year , as part of a new eu paramilitary force .

german authorities want to extradite mamoun darkazanli to spain , where he is accused of being an al-qaeda associate . mamoun darkazanli 's extradition was requested by madrid under a controversial new system of eu arrest warrants introduced last year .
the aim of the system was to make it easier for terror suspects to be transferred between eu member states and to boost cooperation in the war on terrorism . but darkazanli 's lawyers are expected to argue before the court in karlsruhe that the eu arrest warrants are in breach of the german constitution , because their client can be handed over to face charges abroad that could not be brought against him in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : were the court to uphold darkazanli 's argument , it would seriously undermine one of the bloc 's main anti-terrorist security initiatives . wider implications german justice minister brigitte zypries said such a ruling would be detrimental to german cooperation in the eu 's joint fight against crime .
but she said she doubted the case would stand up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte zypries " i think the eu arrest warrant as a whole is not in violation , and in this concrete case there is even less evidence of that , " she told deutschlandfunk radio . michael rosenthal , darkazanli 's lawyer , said he would argue the measure is unconstitutional because it was introduced under a binding " framework decision " by eu ministers , and the parliament therefore had no choice but to approve it . " our constitutional appeal says : that is not democracy , " he told reuters . other legal experts believe an outcome in favor of darkazanli would have wider implications and introduce the possibility of challenges to other eu measures and even to the bloc 's new constitution , due to be ratified by parliament this year . logistical and financial support the 46-year-old darkazanli , a businessman who has dual syrian and german nationality , has been in custody in hamburg since last october and will not attend the hearings . he stands accused by the us of financing al qaeda and was one of 35 people charged by spanish judge baltasar garzon in september 2003 with belonging to the terrorist network . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marienstr .
54 was the base of the hamburg al qaeda cell he has also been investigated by german authorities for links to the hamburg cell which masterminded and executed the 9/11 attacks on new york and washington in 2001 . garzon 's charge sheet says he carried out " logistics support and financing activity , " including the purchase of a cargo vessel for its leader osama bin laden in december 1993 . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany agrees on al qaeda suspect 's extradition mamoun darkazanli , the syrian-german accused of being a member of al qaeda 's 9/11 hamburg cell , could soon face extradition proceedings after german authorities cleared his case to go before a court hearing . -lrb- oct .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.04.2005 a key test for eu security cooperation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mamoun darkazanli 's case might prove decisive for the eu germany 's highest court began hearing a case wednesday that pits german law against european law .
german authorities want to extradite mamoun darkazanli to spain , where he is accused of being an al-qaeda associate . mamoun darkazanli 's extradition was requested by madrid under a controversial new system of eu arrest warrants introduced last year .
the aim of the system was to make it easier for terror suspects to be transferred between eu member states and to boost cooperation in the war on terrorism . but darkazanli 's lawyers are expected to argue before the court in karlsruhe that the eu arrest warrants are in breach of the german constitution , because their client can be handed over to face charges abroad that could not be brought against him in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : were the court to uphold darkazanli 's argument , it would seriously undermine one of the bloc 's main anti-terrorist security initiatives . wider implications german justice minister brigitte zypries said such a ruling would be detrimental to german cooperation in the eu 's joint fight against crime .

italian authorities had requested the delay , fearing hundreds of thousands of followers in rome for his funeral would remain to visit the tomb . many determined pilgrims remained in the city anyway .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.04.2005 war 's forgotten children break the silence 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children went back to school after the war but not to a normal life the traces of world war ii have faded but not disappeared for germans .
many who were babies or children during the war are still suffering from the trauma they experienced 60 years ago . in his speech commemorating the liberation of buchenwald concentration camp , chancellor gerhard schröder said remembering germany 's past - national socialism , war and genocide - was part of germany 's identity and , at the same time , " a permanent moral responsibility . "
yet there is a significant part of this past that has been neglected .
" it is surprising that the generation of children , who were born during the war and spent a large part of their childhood in the war , have until recently been remarkably silent about their biographies and appeared unaffected , " said dr. michael ermann , head of the war childhood project at munich 's ludwig-maximilians-university .
" their speechlessness found a counterpart in the little interest that the public showed for their fate , " ermann told german radio südwestrundfunk .
it is only in recent years that historians , psychoanalysts and german society are taking a closer look at these " kriegskinder " or children of war .
an international convention on the generation of war children is meeting in frankfurt this week to discuss the damage that the war and its effects had on people 's souls .
a robbed childhood dr. hartmut radebold , a former professor of clinical psychology at the university of kassel and the founder of germany 's geriatric psychotherapy , said these children were subject to suffering in three major areas .
" they faced violence , they had to deal with separation and loss of loved ones , and they had to come to terms with losing their homes , safety and security , " said radebold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many children had to flee their homes the psychiatrist helga spranger , one of the founding members of the war child association kriegskind.de and herself a war child , described the lives of children during the war in the international journal of evacuee and war child studies .
" children were separated from their parents , orphaned , evacuated by force , displaced , kidnapped , shot at , bombed , wounded , mutilated , raped , expropriated , blackmailed , adopted by force , drafted at an early age and forced into labor , " spranger wrote .
" in short , they suffered from stress for months or years and were basically robbed of their childhood . "
the horrors these children experienced continued to brew under the surface .
" it costs endless energy to keep it inside for decades , " said ermann .
haunted by memories in recent years , an increasing number of war children have suffered from agonizing health problems , as their trauma finally rises to the surface .
according to radebold , many are diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder .
" they are haunted by their memories and the terrors they experienced and are overwhelmed by them , " he said .
symptoms include jumpiness , restlessness , sleep disorders or withdrawal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sound of a plane can often trigger the trauma there are also many images that are burned into their minds , which trigger their trauma , said spranger .
" aside from the basic feelings of fear of death or abandonment , disgust and wishes of escaping , lasting horrifying impressions are hidden in the memories for a lifetime , " said spranger , such as the smell of burned houses , animals and humans after firebombs , hearing sirens or the shooting of weapons .
but despite their anguish , many war children have still been hesitant to talk .
sabine bode , author of the book " die vergessene generation " or " the lost generation , " looked at the stories of these war children to trace how their experiences shaped their lives .
she said her search for stories was tough .
" most of the people i spoke to fended off my questions with remarks like ' others were much worse off than i was ' or ' it did n't hurt us ' , " said bode .
" i rarely heard anyone complain about their fate .
i have the impression that despite the frequently observed trait that germans like to see themselves as victims , former war children of all people were in no way whiny about their past . "
history is a clogged toilet there are several reasons why these stories are only coming to the surface now .
many experiences were " re-awakened " through the images of other more recent wars , such as in kosovo or iraq .
that fact that these war children have reached retirement age also plays a role .
" in old age , you ca n't repress things as easily anymore , " said bode .
a profession also acts as a stabilizing factor for someone 's identity , said radebold .
" so when these war children retire , they have more time on their hands to think and with this time , come the memories , " he said .
in certain cases , trauma can be reactivated .
" this means that old memories are reawakened through a siren or an airplane that sounds similar to the ones during the war , " said radebold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " crabwalk " by günter grass was published in 2002 but bode said that war children also needed a form of " permission " to open their souls .
and this was given to them by nobel prize winner günter grass .
" he said , we also have to attend to germans ' problems after the war , " said bode .
" history or , to be more precise , the history we germans have repeatedly mucked up , is a clogged toilet .
we flush and flush , but the shit keeps rising , " grass wrote in his book " crabwalk , " published in 2002 .

many who were babies or children during the war are still suffering from the trauma they experienced 60 years ago . in his speech commemorating the liberation of buchenwald concentration camp , chancellor gerhard schröder said remembering germany 's past - national socialism , war and genocide - was part of germany 's identity and , at the same time , " a permanent moral responsibility . "
yet there is a significant part of this past that has been neglected .
" it is surprising that the generation of children , who were born during the war and spent a large part of their childhood in the war , have until recently been remarkably silent about their biographies and appeared unaffected , " said dr. michael ermann , head of the war childhood project at munich 's ludwig-maximilians-university .
" their speechlessness found a counterpart in the little interest that the public showed for their fate , " ermann told german radio südwestrundfunk .
it is only in recent years that historians , psychoanalysts and german society are taking a closer look at these " kriegskinder " or children of war .
an international convention on the generation of war children is meeting in frankfurt this week to discuss the damage that the war and its effects had on people 's souls .

many who were babies or children during the war are still suffering from the trauma they experienced 60 years ago . in his speech commemorating the liberation of buchenwald concentration camp , chancellor gerhard schröder said remembering germany 's past - national socialism , war and genocide - was part of germany 's identity and , at the same time , " a permanent moral responsibility . "
yet there is a significant part of this past that has been neglected .
" it is surprising that the generation of children , who were born during the war and spent a large part of their childhood in the war , have until recently been remarkably silent about their biographies and appeared unaffected , " said dr. michael ermann , head of the war childhood project at munich 's ludwig-maximilians-university .
" their speechlessness found a counterpart in the little interest that the public showed for their fate , " ermann told german radio südwestrundfunk .
it is only in recent years that historians , psychoanalysts and german society are taking a closer look at these " kriegskinder " or children of war .
an international convention on the generation of war children is meeting in frankfurt this week to discuss the damage that the war and its effects had on people 's souls .
a robbed childhood dr. hartmut radebold , a former professor of clinical psychology at the university of kassel and the founder of germany 's geriatric psychotherapy , said these children were subject to suffering in three major areas .
" they faced violence , they had to deal with separation and loss of loved ones , and they had to come to terms with losing their homes , safety and security , " said radebold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many children had to flee their homes the psychiatrist helga spranger , one of the founding members of the war child association kriegskind.de and herself a war child , described the lives of children during the war in the international journal of evacuee and war child studies .
" children were separated from their parents , orphaned , evacuated by force , displaced , kidnapped , shot at , bombed , wounded , mutilated , raped , expropriated , blackmailed , adopted by force , drafted at an early age and forced into labor , " spranger wrote .
" in short , they suffered from stress for months or years and were basically robbed of their childhood . "
the horrors these children experienced continued to brew under the surface .
" it costs endless energy to keep it inside for decades , " said ermann .
haunted by memories in recent years , an increasing number of war children have suffered from agonizing health problems , as their trauma finally rises to the surface .
according to radebold , many are diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder .
" they are haunted by their memories and the terrors they experienced and are overwhelmed by them , " he said .
symptoms include jumpiness , restlessness , sleep disorders or withdrawal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sound of a plane can often trigger the trauma there are also many images that are burned into their minds , which trigger their trauma , said spranger .
" aside from the basic feelings of fear of death or abandonment , disgust and wishes of escaping , lasting horrifying impressions are hidden in the memories for a lifetime , " said spranger , such as the smell of burned houses , animals and humans after firebombs , hearing sirens or the shooting of weapons .
but despite their anguish , many war children have still been hesitant to talk .
sabine bode , author of the book " die vergessene generation " or " the lost generation , " looked at the stories of these war children to trace how their experiences shaped their lives .
she said her search for stories was tough .
" most of the people i spoke to fended off my questions with remarks like ' others were much worse off than i was ' or ' it did n't hurt us ' , " said bode .
" i rarely heard anyone complain about their fate .
i have the impression that despite the frequently observed trait that germans like to see themselves as victims , former war children of all people were in no way whiny about their past . "
history is a clogged toilet there are several reasons why these stories are only coming to the surface now .
many experiences were " re-awakened " through the images of other more recent wars , such as in kosovo or iraq .
that fact that these war children have reached retirement age also plays a role .
" in old age , you ca n't repress things as easily anymore , " said bode .
a profession also acts as a stabilizing factor for someone 's identity , said radebold .
" so when these war children retire , they have more time on their hands to think and with this time , come the memories , " he said .
in certain cases , trauma can be reactivated .
" this means that old memories are reawakened through a siren or an airplane that sounds similar to the ones during the war , " said radebold .

history is a clogged toilet there are several reasons why these stories are only coming to the surface now .
many experiences were " re-awakened " through the images of other more recent wars , such as in kosovo or iraq .
that fact that these war children have reached retirement age also plays a role .

many who were babies or children during the war are still suffering from the trauma they experienced 60 years ago . in his speech commemorating the liberation of buchenwald concentration camp , chancellor gerhard schröder said remembering germany 's past - national socialism , war and genocide - was part of germany 's identity and , at the same time , " a permanent moral responsibility . "
yet there is a significant part of this past that has been neglected .
" it is surprising that the generation of children , who were born during the war and spent a large part of their childhood in the war , have until recently been remarkably silent about their biographies and appeared unaffected , " said dr. michael ermann , head of the war childhood project at munich 's ludwig-maximilians-university .
" their speechlessness found a counterpart in the little interest that the public showed for their fate , " ermann told german radio südwestrundfunk .
it is only in recent years that historians , psychoanalysts and german society are taking a closer look at these " kriegskinder " or children of war .
an international convention on the generation of war children is meeting in frankfurt this week to discuss the damage that the war and its effects had on people 's souls .
a robbed childhood dr. hartmut radebold , a former professor of clinical psychology at the university of kassel and the founder of germany 's geriatric psychotherapy , said these children were subject to suffering in three major areas .
" they faced violence , they had to deal with separation and loss of loved ones , and they had to come to terms with losing their homes , safety and security , " said radebold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many children had to flee their homes the psychiatrist helga spranger , one of the founding members of the war child association kriegskind.de and herself a war child , described the lives of children during the war in the international journal of evacuee and war child studies .
" children were separated from their parents , orphaned , evacuated by force , displaced , kidnapped , shot at , bombed , wounded , mutilated , raped , expropriated , blackmailed , adopted by force , drafted at an early age and forced into labor , " spranger wrote .
" in short , they suffered from stress for months or years and were basically robbed of their childhood . "
the horrors these children experienced continued to brew under the surface .
" it costs endless energy to keep it inside for decades , " said ermann .
haunted by memories in recent years , an increasing number of war children have suffered from agonizing health problems , as their trauma finally rises to the surface .
according to radebold , many are diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder .
" they are haunted by their memories and the terrors they experienced and are overwhelmed by them , " he said .
symptoms include jumpiness , restlessness , sleep disorders or withdrawal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sound of a plane can often trigger the trauma there are also many images that are burned into their minds , which trigger their trauma , said spranger .
" aside from the basic feelings of fear of death or abandonment , disgust and wishes of escaping , lasting horrifying impressions are hidden in the memories for a lifetime , " said spranger , such as the smell of burned houses , animals and humans after firebombs , hearing sirens or the shooting of weapons .
but despite their anguish , many war children have still been hesitant to talk .
sabine bode , author of the book " die vergessene generation " or " the lost generation , " looked at the stories of these war children to trace how their experiences shaped their lives .
she said her search for stories was tough .
" most of the people i spoke to fended off my questions with remarks like ' others were much worse off than i was ' or ' it did n't hurt us ' , " said bode .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.04.2005 historians to probe ministry 's nazi past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer is calling for historians to investigate the ministry sixty years after the collapse of the nazi regime , the german foreign ministry plans to look into its controversial postwar history , including allegations that it employed nazi war criminals . historians have long quipped that you could find more former nazi party members in the newly-established german diplomatic service after world war ii than you could in its predecessor during hitler 's third reich .
and indeed it appears that the german foreign office readily employed former nazi officials who were looking for work immediately after the war . efforts are now underway to open up the ministry 's recent past to public scrutiny , according to klaus scharioth , undersecretary in the foreign ministry .
" we need to look into the history of the foreign office under the nazis in a systematic manner , " he said on monday .
" foreign minister joschka fischer is currently thinking of establishing an independent panel of historians who would carry out this task . " fischer has come under fire from senior members of his ministry for refusing to allow full obituaries of former nazi party members to be published in the ministry 's in-house newsletter .
he took the decision after it became known that posthumous tributes had been paid to franz nüsslein , a convicted war criminal . safe in franco 's spain the scandal was uncovered by marga henseler , a member of the ministry 's staff who has since retired .
" i could n't believe my eyes when i saw the obituary , " she said .
" i immediately wrote a letter to joschka fischer urging him not to tolerate this . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers in occupied prague , march 1939 franz nüsslein was a former nazi prosecutor in german-occupied czechoslovakia where he was involved in numerous death sentences handed down to the enemies of nazi germany .
after the war , a court in prague sentenced him to 20 years in prison for war crimes , but he was released after serving only seven years . henseler recalled that nüsslein joined the foreign service shortly thereafter .
" in the ministry rumors were quickly making the rounds that he did time in prague , " she said .
" so everybody knew about his past .
there were some protests internally , after which nüsslein was quickly moved to the mission in barcelona in spain , where dictator franco ruled at the time and where nothing could happen to him anymore . "
purging the remnants bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the foreign ministry in berlin earlier this year , joschka fischer also refused to pay full tribute to franz krapf , a former ss and nazi party member who later became germany 's ambassador to nato .
fischer 's actions provoked a revolt by some 70 diplomats who publicly accused the foreign minister of applying double standards in a reference to his own past as a leftist militant . although weakened by a different scandal over lax visa regulations , fischer appears determined to battle on in this dispute , which historians say should have reached the public domain long ago .
ministry sources say fischer is now planning an internal reshuffle of posts in what appears to be an effort to finally purge the foreign ministry of the last remnants of nazism . uwe hessler -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former diplomats turn against fischer several ex-diplomats in germany have struck out against their former boss joschka fischer for his role in the visa scandal .

experts believe that downward pressure on wages in germany will continue this year unless berlin takes decisive steps to curb the influx of cheap labor from eastern europe . chasing " black sheep " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the construction industry already has regulations in place to prevent wage dumping .
the task force in the german economics and finance ministry will in future conduct bilateral talks with the 10 new member states in order to push them to uphold eu labor and services law .
the new working group is also meant to create clear criteria for service providers , branches , companies as well as workers from the new member states . gerd andres , parliamentary under secretary in the german economics ministry , said the authorities should go after " black sheep " and prevent eastern european firms from bypassing eu laws to the detriment of the german labor market and economy . germany did insist on and achieve a seven-year freeze on people from the new member states from getting automatic access to the german labor market in the run up to the eu 's eastward expansion last year .
but immediately upon entry , companies in poland and the other new member states gained the right to sell business services in the rest of the eu .
just last month , chancellor gerhard schröder had to intervene in eu plans to liberalize services which would have thrown the doors further open for cheap labor from the east . under eu law , workers sent to a different country for a short-term contract must receive the minimum social benefits and wages of the state where they are carrying out the project . this doesn ’ t apply , however , to self-employed workers and foreign subcontractors .
in germany , the meat-packing industry has been particularly affected .
tens of thousands of workers lost their jobs in recent months , as their work is increasingly being done by companies from poland and hungary who essentially " lend " their foreign workers to companies here .
the wages the easterners receive are between just three and five euros an hour . expanding minimum wages in addition , the new task force is meant to examine whether the minimum wage rule that applies to the german building sector , one of the few industries that does have such a provision , can be expanded to other areas . unlike other eu countries , germany does not have a general minimum wage , because such a law was long considered to be an infringement of the right for industrial sectors to have their own pay scales .
but , now with low-wage workers from eastern europe squeezing germans out of jobs at a time of record unemployment and key regional elections coming up in the state of north rhine-westphalia next month , chancellor schröder is considering extending the law . " we 'll take a look at whether the anti-dumping law that applies to the building trade can be gradually extended to take in other sectors , " schröder said on wednesday .
" the aim is to make sure that dumping incidents do not ruin good companies that are unable to compete with such low wages . ” employers against minimum wages however , not everybody is happy with the idea of legally-set minimum wages .
german employers say it would be counterproductive as job opportunities for unskilled german workers would be lost .
in addition they claim companies would be burdened with the costs of greater bureaucracy . the institute for labor market and job research -lrb- iab -rrb- said that a minimum wage in individual sectors would help to reduce the pressure on wages in germany through eastward expansion , provided it was just a temporary measure . ulrich walwei , deputy head of the iab told the daily berliner zeitung that the government also had to be careful in its selection of sectors to introduce a temporary minimum wage in order to avoid damaging competition . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate flares up over minimum wages with the eu 's eastward expansion and subsequent downward pressure on wages in germany , opposition conservatives have stoked debate over the introduction of minimum wages , saying they 're ready to support such a move .

experts believe that downward pressure on wages in germany will continue this year unless berlin takes decisive steps to curb the influx of cheap labor from eastern europe . chasing " black sheep " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the construction industry already has regulations in place to prevent wage dumping .
the task force in the german economics and finance ministry will in future conduct bilateral talks with the 10 new member states in order to push them to uphold eu labor and services law .
the new working group is also meant to create clear criteria for service providers , branches , companies as well as workers from the new member states . gerd andres , parliamentary under secretary in the german economics ministry , said the authorities should go after " black sheep " and prevent eastern european firms from bypassing eu laws to the detriment of the german labor market and economy . germany did insist on and achieve a seven-year freeze on people from the new member states from getting automatic access to the german labor market in the run up to the eu 's eastward expansion last year .
but immediately upon entry , companies in poland and the other new member states gained the right to sell business services in the rest of the eu .
just last month , chancellor gerhard schröder had to intervene in eu plans to liberalize services which would have thrown the doors further open for cheap labor from the east . under eu law , workers sent to a different country for a short-term contract must receive the minimum social benefits and wages of the state where they are carrying out the project . this doesn ’ t apply , however , to self-employed workers and foreign subcontractors .
in germany , the meat-packing industry has been particularly affected .
tens of thousands of workers lost their jobs in recent months , as their work is increasingly being done by companies from poland and hungary who essentially " lend " their foreign workers to companies here .
the wages the easterners receive are between just three and five euros an hour . expanding minimum wages in addition , the new task force is meant to examine whether the minimum wage rule that applies to the german building sector , one of the few industries that does have such a provision , can be expanded to other areas . unlike other eu countries , germany does not have a general minimum wage , because such a law was long considered to be an infringement of the right for industrial sectors to have their own pay scales .
but , now with low-wage workers from eastern europe squeezing germans out of jobs at a time of record unemployment and key regional elections coming up in the state of north rhine-westphalia next month , chancellor schröder is considering extending the law . " we 'll take a look at whether the anti-dumping law that applies to the building trade can be gradually extended to take in other sectors , " schröder said on wednesday .
" the aim is to make sure that dumping incidents do not ruin good companies that are unable to compete with such low wages . ” employers against minimum wages however , not everybody is happy with the idea of legally-set minimum wages .
german employers say it would be counterproductive as job opportunities for unskilled german workers would be lost .
in addition they claim companies would be burdened with the costs of greater bureaucracy . the institute for labor market and job research -lrb- iab -rrb- said that a minimum wage in individual sectors would help to reduce the pressure on wages in germany through eastward expansion , provided it was just a temporary measure . ulrich walwei , deputy head of the iab told the daily berliner zeitung that the government also had to be careful in its selection of sectors to introduce a temporary minimum wage in order to avoid damaging competition . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate flares up over minimum wages with the eu 's eastward expansion and subsequent downward pressure on wages in germany , opposition conservatives have stoked debate over the introduction of minimum wages , saying they 're ready to support such a move .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 13.04.2005 bayern 's dream dies in european thriller großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oli kahn ca n't believe it as chelsea 's first goal is deflected past him bayern munich stumbled at the quarter-final hurdle in the uefa champions league on tuesday despite beating chelsea 3-2 .
the 4-2 defeat in london a week earlier meant the victory was a hollow one .
bayern were eliminated . bayern munich 's dreams of european glory ended in dramatic style in the olympic stadium on tuesday night as english premiership side chelsea swept into the semi-finals of the champions league at the expense of the german bundesliga leaders despite losing 3-2 . although bayern were winners on the night , the 4-2 defeat at stamford bridge last week was enough to earn the premiership leaders a 6-5 aggregate victory and send felix magath 's side crashing out . it is the second successive season chelsea have reached the semi-finals of europe 's premier competition and they will hope to make amends for last season 's shock 5-3 aggregate defeat by monaco . chelsea led 4-2 from the first leg and england international frank lampard scored on the hour mark - his third goal against bayern in six days - to ensure bayern had to score three times .
" another deflected goal from chelsea , " said bayern coach magath .

the 4-2 defeat in london a week earlier meant the victory was a hollow one .
bayern were eliminated . bayern munich 's dreams of european glory ended in dramatic style in the olympic stadium on tuesday night as english premiership side chelsea swept into the semi-finals of the champions league at the expense of the german bundesliga leaders despite losing 3-2 . although bayern were winners on the night , the 4-2 defeat at stamford bridge last week was enough to earn the premiership leaders a 6-5 aggregate victory and send felix magath 's side crashing out . it is the second successive season chelsea have reached the semi-finals of europe 's premier competition and they will hope to make amends for last season 's shock 5-3 aggregate defeat by monaco . chelsea led 4-2 from the first leg and england international frank lampard scored on the hour mark - his third goal against bayern in six days - to ensure bayern had to score three times .
" another deflected goal from chelsea , " said bayern coach magath .
" chelsea were not better than us they were just more fortunate and clinical in front of goal . " missed chances cost bayern dearly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : didier drogba is congratulated at the end of the match in munich by team mate eidur gudjonsson .
bayern scored three goals through claudio pizarro -lrb- 65 -rrb- and late goals from substitutes mehmet scholl and paolo guerrero both in stoppage time but it was their earlier profligacy that cost them dear .
bayern were eventually punished by ivory coast star didier drogba who scored the decisive goal for chelsea with 10 minutes to go . chelsea 's portuguese manager jose mourinho - still suspended by uefa - was amongst the capacity 59,000 fans watching from the stands and will be delighted as his charges scored twice to ensure bayern 's late goal fest was irrelevant . fitness coach rui faria was mourinho 's representative at the press conference and revealed the manager left the stadium because he felt his privacy was being invaded .
" jose will be delighted with the result but he left the stands because he could not watch the match in peace , " revealed faria .
" he went back to the hotel and watched us progress from there . " chelsea face the prospect of an all english semi-final clash with four-time european cup winners liverpool although italian giants juventus will fancy their chances of overturning a 2-1 deficit in turin on wednesday . bayern made four changes with dutch international roy makaay and peru star pizarro back to form their attacking partnership . first and fatal goal to chelsea manager magath claimed conceding the first goal would be ' fatal ' and it almost happened in the second minute with drogba - a lone target-man - rushing on to a through pass . bayern custodian oliver kahn came storming out to block his path and magath breathed a sigh of relief , although it was later to turn to despair . hosts munich then seized the initiative and german international michael ballack - at the centre of a diving storm in the first leg - saw his goal-bound shot blocked in the fifth minute and blazed his follow-up high over the crossbar .
pizarro then forced a brilliant point blank save from chelsea 's czech international goalkeeper petr cech in a thrilling first quarter hour . bastian schweinsteiger was causing havoc down the right flank and a goal looked inevitable but it was chelsea who scored it against the run of play .
in the 30th minute , joe cole fed england international team-mate lampard and the midfielder 's shot ricocheted off brazilian defender lucio sending kahn the wrong way . " the first goal was very fortunate , " said bayern defender sagnol .
" but to be honest the damage was done in the first leg . " munich hit again while chasing the game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england 's frank lampard opened the scoring in the olympic stadium .
it was more bad luck for lucio who deflected in cole 's first goal in the 4-2 first leg defeat at stamford bridge .
lampard 's deflected effort meant bayern needed to score three goals to go through and ballack should have got one of them in the 38th minute when he strangely chose to play the ball across the face of goal instead of shooting himself . bayern pulled off martin demichelis for the more inventive mehmet scholl early in the second half .
bayern were handed a lifeline in the 65th minute when cech could only parry a ballack header on to the post and the ball rolled kindly to pizarro who stroked the ball in to level the scores . with 25 minutes left to score twice bayern hit the crossbar through a deflected bixente lizarazu cross and then eidur gudjohnsen cleared off the line as chelsea began to wobble . but with 10 minutes left the excellent cole crossed for drogba to bullet a header past kahn and bayern knew the game was up .
guerrero and scholl both scored in stoppage time but bayern were left cursing having conceded six goals over the two legs . bayern 's star midfielder michael ballack said : " it 's annoying .

" in a political case you have political actions , " said robert amsterdam , from khodorkovsky 's defense team . ulterior motives the case is widely seen as moscow 's ploy to crush one of its most powerful opponents - khodorkovsky , founder of oil company yukos .
once believed to be russia 's richest man , he is one of the russian oligarchs who amassed vast fortunes in the turbulent 1990s . human rights groups argue that russia has subverted the rule of law in its determination to defeat him . one particular target of his lawyers ' wrath was chancellor gerhard schröder , whose close friendship with russian president vladimir putin has prompted many to question the integrity of berlin 's policies towards russia - including its habit of turning a blind eye to breaches of human rights and press freedoms . serious accusations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert amsterdam " there are no words to describe my disappointment about chancellor schröder 's behaviour , " said robert amsterdam -lrb- photo -rrb- .
he could n't understand the german leader 's willingness to whitewash the russian government , he added , when the rest of the world considered the trial to be a farce . in a recent visit to moscow , schröder had insisted the trial was constitutional .
on another occasion , he described putin as a " flawless democrat , " while in hanover this week , he pushed through a series of major business deals with russia . amsterdam argued that the number of procedural errors made should have meant the case was dropped - even according to russian law .
prosecutors confiscated evidence from the defense that they then used in the case .
the lawyer accused the western world of ignoring these details , and singled out schröder as one of the kremlin 's staunchest allies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder and vladimir putin in hanover amsterdam announced he planned to visit berlin to speak with members of the bundestag and said he hoped there would be an investigation into the case .
" the chancellor is supporting an illegal trial , " he said , stressing that schröder 's motivation was economic . prosecutors in the case are asking for the maximum sentence of 10 years in jail for billionaire khodorkovsky .

the highest court in germany is now turning its attention to it . effective and swift cooperation - that 's what 's always been demanded on the legal level in europe .
towards that end , the european warrant arrest was introduced in the bloc early last year .
it aims to simplify extradition procedures for suspected criminals within the european union . but , not many eu members are really happy about it , with many preferring to retain elements of the old procedure .
that may seem odd given that the old regulation was rather cumbersome .
for instance , earlier the suspected crime had to be punishable and allowed to be pursued by the law both in the home country of the suspected criminal as well as in the nation that he was to be extradited to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money laundering and counterfeiting are included on the so-called " positive list of criminal areas . "
the new regulation has been significantly simplified in this regard : when the suspected crime is included on a so-called " positive list of criminal areas , " then the criminal can be extradited . the problem however is that the list is too vague .
" for example : what exactly does sabotage mean ? " said helmut satzger , professor for european criminal law at the university of munich .
" we do n't have a provision on the books to deal with sabotage in german law , " satzger said .
the same is true for racism and xenophobia . criticism is growing in germany about the european arrest warrant and its apparent contradictions and the german constitution court in karlsruhe is set to grapple with the topic in detail for the first time this week . different legal systems in many other cases , the crime must be punishable in both states much as was the case earlier .
despite that , there are huge differences in various eu states regarding the severity of the crime .
the differing legal systems in the eu member states have prompted concerns among german lawyers ' groups , law professors and lawyers .
how for instance , they ask , can a ruling of greek courts be accepted in germany when there are completely different laws here ? these worries are shared by other eu members states too and some have reacted .
" for example there are states like denmark who have n't translated the new regulations in binding law , " said satzger .
others such as france have reserved the right to examine the dual criminality principle contained in the european arrest warrant . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic militant metin kaplan was extradited to turkey by germany after a long-drawn out legal battle .
he was extradited on charges of treason for allegedly masterminding a failed plot to crash an airplane into the mausoleum of the founder of secular turkey .
but , it 's not just differing laws in eu states that have prompted worries .
even bans on extradition of criminals are problematic .
the eu so far recognizes only three hindrances to extradition : the already existing punishment of the criminal in his home country , if he 's not criminally liable due to underage , or an amnesty .
as against that member states can no longer refuse to surrender to another member state their own citizens on the ground that they are nationals . no appeal in the home country possible " for example , if lithuania issued such an arrest warrant against a german then germany must surrender its national to lithuania , " said satzger .
that means , that the german national could not protest that the crime is n't punishable in germany .
" if the suspected criminal does n't know lithuania , if he has no idea of the lithuanian legal system and if he also does n't exactly know for example how the mandatory defense counsel would work , then we 're dealing with certain problems here , " said satzger . long before the european warrant arrest actually too effect , a few german constitutional court judges had strongly criticized the procedure .
" the german constitutional court has undertaken a big task in the respect : the judges are using the arrest warrant to answer some very fundamental questions about the relationship between european law and national law , " said satzger . he added that most member states had accepted that european law would override national constitutional law .

" for example there are states like denmark who have n't translated the new regulations in binding law , " said satzger .
others such as france have reserved the right to examine the dual criminality principle contained in the european arrest warrant . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic militant metin kaplan was extradited to turkey by germany after a long-drawn out legal battle .
he was extradited on charges of treason for allegedly masterminding a failed plot to crash an airplane into the mausoleum of the founder of secular turkey .
but , it 's not just differing laws in eu states that have prompted worries .
even bans on extradition of criminals are problematic .
the eu so far recognizes only three hindrances to extradition : the already existing punishment of the criminal in his home country , if he 's not criminally liable due to underage , or an amnesty .
as against that member states can no longer refuse to surrender to another member state their own citizens on the ground that they are nationals . no appeal in the home country possible " for example , if lithuania issued such an arrest warrant against a german then germany must surrender its national to lithuania , " said satzger .
that means , that the german national could not protest that the crime is n't punishable in germany .
" if the suspected criminal does n't know lithuania , if he has no idea of the lithuanian legal system and if he also does n't exactly know for example how the mandatory defense counsel would work , then we 're dealing with certain problems here , " said satzger . long before the european warrant arrest actually too effect , a few german constitutional court judges had strongly criticized the procedure .
" the german constitutional court has undertaken a big task in the respect : the judges are using the arrest warrant to answer some very fundamental questions about the relationship between european law and national law , " said satzger . he added that most member states had accepted that european law would override national constitutional law .

the highest court in germany is now turning its attention to it . effective and swift cooperation - that 's what 's always been demanded on the legal level in europe .
towards that end , the european warrant arrest was introduced in the bloc early last year .
it aims to simplify extradition procedures for suspected criminals within the european union . but , not many eu members are really happy about it , with many preferring to retain elements of the old procedure .
that may seem odd given that the old regulation was rather cumbersome .
for instance , earlier the suspected crime had to be punishable and allowed to be pursued by the law both in the home country of the suspected criminal as well as in the nation that he was to be extradited to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money laundering and counterfeiting are included on the so-called " positive list of criminal areas . "
the new regulation has been significantly simplified in this regard : when the suspected crime is included on a so-called " positive list of criminal areas , " then the criminal can be extradited . the problem however is that the list is too vague .
" for example : what exactly does sabotage mean ? " said helmut satzger , professor for european criminal law at the university of munich .
" we do n't have a provision on the books to deal with sabotage in german law , " satzger said .
the same is true for racism and xenophobia . criticism is growing in germany about the european arrest warrant and its apparent contradictions and the german constitution court in karlsruhe is set to grapple with the topic in detail for the first time this week . different legal systems in many other cases , the crime must be punishable in both states much as was the case earlier .
despite that , there are huge differences in various eu states regarding the severity of the crime .

it 's focusing on ways to effectively strengthen european defense efforts with a view to improving joint missions in crisis areas on the continent and elsewhere . the two-day conference in berlin has drawn high-ranking politicians , nato officials and eu defense experts and aims to highlight efforts to further harmonize defense cooperation within the north atlantic alliance and the eu 's own defense initiatives . it 's being held at a time when both the eu and nato are in the process of building up rapid reaction forces , or battle groups , as european strategists prefer to call them .
both organizations are potentially drawing upon the same pools of soldiers which indicates that rivalry can never be ruled out . but in a bid to further heal transatlantic relations after the controversy over the us-led war in iraq , assurances are being heard ever so often that the eu ’ s own security efforts are invariably intended to complement - not duplicate or rival - nato . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck " it would be totally wrong to view the development of european defense capabilities separately from advances within nato , " said germany 's social democrat defense minister , peter struck -lrb- photo -rrb- .
he added that both nato and the european union are currently making efforts to be better prepared for out-of-area missions in a bid to adapt to a fast changing security environment . " nato must be open to reform " there can be no doubt whatsoever that in future nato has to be the place where dialogue on transatlantic security strategies must be intensified , struck added .
" the alliance has to be open for reform , " struck added . this is what german chancellor gerhard schröder demanded at a recent security conference in munich , and his words are being taken seriously by nato leaders . struck ’ s message to the conference was taken up by alessandro minuto rizzo , deputy secretary-general of nato .
he made it clear that it had been wrong to try and sweep different threat perception levels on both sides of the atlantic under the carpet and demanded that a fresh initiative be made to debate security strategies more openly within nato . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german nato troops in afghanistan " we need to understand that nato is not only a forum for action .
we must also understand that it ’ s a forum for debate , " said minuto rizzo .
" during the iraq controversy , nato was manifestly under-utilized as a consultative forum , and we paid a high price for that , " he said .
" i ’ m confident that we ’ ve learned our lesson .
if we want to preserve nato as a central framework for effective multilateralism , we must engage in multilateral debate . " focus on rapid response forces defense minister struck said it would be in the interest of all to see the european union reinforce its own military capabilities alongside those of nato . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a congolese boy points as he speak to a french soldier , thursday , june 19 , 2003 during a foot patrol on the outskirts of bunia , congo .
he pointed to the eu ’ s successful peace-keeping operations in bosnia-herzegovina and parts of africa .
he announced that germany would be willing to contribute 50 military observers to the 250-strong eu contingent to become active in sudan soon . the chairman of nato ’ s military committee , general harald kujat , himself german , left mr struck ’ s remarks uncommented and focused on the capabilities of nato ’ s future rapid response forces instead . " a great proportion of the alliance ’ s forces will need to be deployable well away from their own territories and have the flexibility to switch rapidly between war fighting and peace keeping , " kujat said .
" future forces must be more capable of operating within a networked environment .
there will be a greater need for specialist skills in areas such as engineering , communications , special operations , civil-military cooperation , logistics , medical services and intelligence . " more money needed several speakers complained about eu defense programs being gravely underfinanced . they noted that the 16 european nato member countries together currently spend only $ 200 million on defense capabilities annually - which amounts to only half of the us defense budget . hardy graupner -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to head peacekeeping in bosnia the european union announced friday it plans to replace nato 's peacekeeping troops with its own in bosnia-herzegovina at the end of the year , as part of a new eu paramilitary force .

both organizations are potentially drawing upon the same pools of soldiers which indicates that rivalry can never be ruled out . but in a bid to further heal transatlantic relations after the controversy over the us-led war in iraq , assurances are being heard ever so often that the eu ’ s own security efforts are invariably intended to complement - not duplicate or rival - nato . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck " it would be totally wrong to view the development of european defense capabilities separately from advances within nato , " said germany 's social democrat defense minister , peter struck -lrb- photo -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 13.04.2005 berlin moves to counter wage dumping großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east european laborers often work for a fraction of what germans earn the german government has formed a new task force to battle wage dumping and examine ways to expand minimum wages to some sectors as the eu 's eastward expansion brings in an influx of cheap labor . on wednesday , the german cabinet set up a task force in an effort to close the loopholes that allow eastern europeans to work for a fraction of what their german colleagues earn , both legally and illegally . the measure , part of german chancellor gerhard schröder 's package to spur growth and create jobs , is meant to prevent a distortion of competition and protect people from having to work for too little . it 's in part a reaction to a 1.2 percent drop in wages in germany following the entry of poland , the czech republic and the baltic states into the european union last year .
experts believe that downward pressure on wages in germany will continue this year unless berlin takes decisive steps to curb the influx of cheap labor from eastern europe . chasing " black sheep " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the construction industry already has regulations in place to prevent wage dumping .
the task force in the german economics and finance ministry will in future conduct bilateral talks with the 10 new member states in order to push them to uphold eu labor and services law .
the new working group is also meant to create clear criteria for service providers , branches , companies as well as workers from the new member states . gerd andres , parliamentary under secretary in the german economics ministry , said the authorities should go after " black sheep " and prevent eastern european firms from bypassing eu laws to the detriment of the german labor market and economy . germany did insist on and achieve a seven-year freeze on people from the new member states from getting automatic access to the german labor market in the run up to the eu 's eastward expansion last year .
but immediately upon entry , companies in poland and the other new member states gained the right to sell business services in the rest of the eu .
just last month , chancellor gerhard schröder had to intervene in eu plans to liberalize services which would have thrown the doors further open for cheap labor from the east . under eu law , workers sent to a different country for a short-term contract must receive the minimum social benefits and wages of the state where they are carrying out the project . this doesn ’ t apply , however , to self-employed workers and foreign subcontractors .
in germany , the meat-packing industry has been particularly affected .
tens of thousands of workers lost their jobs in recent months , as their work is increasingly being done by companies from poland and hungary who essentially " lend " their foreign workers to companies here .
the wages the easterners receive are between just three and five euros an hour . expanding minimum wages in addition , the new task force is meant to examine whether the minimum wage rule that applies to the german building sector , one of the few industries that does have such a provision , can be expanded to other areas . unlike other eu countries , germany does not have a general minimum wage , because such a law was long considered to be an infringement of the right for industrial sectors to have their own pay scales .
but , now with low-wage workers from eastern europe squeezing germans out of jobs at a time of record unemployment and key regional elections coming up in the state of north rhine-westphalia next month , chancellor schröder is considering extending the law . " we 'll take a look at whether the anti-dumping law that applies to the building trade can be gradually extended to take in other sectors , " schröder said on wednesday .
" the aim is to make sure that dumping incidents do not ruin good companies that are unable to compete with such low wages . ” employers against minimum wages however , not everybody is happy with the idea of legally-set minimum wages .
german employers say it would be counterproductive as job opportunities for unskilled german workers would be lost .
in addition they claim companies would be burdened with the costs of greater bureaucracy . the institute for labor market and job research -lrb- iab -rrb- said that a minimum wage in individual sectors would help to reduce the pressure on wages in germany through eastward expansion , provided it was just a temporary measure . ulrich walwei , deputy head of the iab told the daily berliner zeitung that the government also had to be careful in its selection of sectors to introduce a temporary minimum wage in order to avoid damaging competition . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate flares up over minimum wages with the eu 's eastward expansion and subsequent downward pressure on wages in germany , opposition conservatives have stoked debate over the introduction of minimum wages , saying they 're ready to support such a move .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 13.04.2005 berlin moves to counter wage dumping großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east european laborers often work for a fraction of what germans earn the german government has formed a new task force to battle wage dumping and examine ways to expand minimum wages to some sectors as the eu 's eastward expansion brings in an influx of cheap labor . on wednesday , the german cabinet set up a task force in an effort to close the loopholes that allow eastern europeans to work for a fraction of what their german colleagues earn , both legally and illegally . the measure , part of german chancellor gerhard schröder 's package to spur growth and create jobs , is meant to prevent a distortion of competition and protect people from having to work for too little . it 's in part a reaction to a 1.2 percent drop in wages in germany following the entry of poland , the czech republic and the baltic states into the european union last year .
experts believe that downward pressure on wages in germany will continue this year unless berlin takes decisive steps to curb the influx of cheap labor from eastern europe . chasing " black sheep " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the construction industry already has regulations in place to prevent wage dumping .
the task force in the german economics and finance ministry will in future conduct bilateral talks with the 10 new member states in order to push them to uphold eu labor and services law .
the new working group is also meant to create clear criteria for service providers , branches , companies as well as workers from the new member states . gerd andres , parliamentary under secretary in the german economics ministry , said the authorities should go after " black sheep " and prevent eastern european firms from bypassing eu laws to the detriment of the german labor market and economy . germany did insist on and achieve a seven-year freeze on people from the new member states from getting automatic access to the german labor market in the run up to the eu 's eastward expansion last year .
but immediately upon entry , companies in poland and the other new member states gained the right to sell business services in the rest of the eu .
just last month , chancellor gerhard schröder had to intervene in eu plans to liberalize services which would have thrown the doors further open for cheap labor from the east . under eu law , workers sent to a different country for a short-term contract must receive the minimum social benefits and wages of the state where they are carrying out the project . this doesn ’ t apply , however , to self-employed workers and foreign subcontractors .
in germany , the meat-packing industry has been particularly affected .
tens of thousands of workers lost their jobs in recent months , as their work is increasingly being done by companies from poland and hungary who essentially " lend " their foreign workers to companies here .
the wages the easterners receive are between just three and five euros an hour . expanding minimum wages in addition , the new task force is meant to examine whether the minimum wage rule that applies to the german building sector , one of the few industries that does have such a provision , can be expanded to other areas . unlike other eu countries , germany does not have a general minimum wage , because such a law was long considered to be an infringement of the right for industrial sectors to have their own pay scales .
but , now with low-wage workers from eastern europe squeezing germans out of jobs at a time of record unemployment and key regional elections coming up in the state of north rhine-westphalia next month , chancellor schröder is considering extending the law . " we 'll take a look at whether the anti-dumping law that applies to the building trade can be gradually extended to take in other sectors , " schröder said on wednesday .
" the aim is to make sure that dumping incidents do not ruin good companies that are unable to compete with such low wages . ” employers against minimum wages however , not everybody is happy with the idea of legally-set minimum wages .
german employers say it would be counterproductive as job opportunities for unskilled german workers would be lost .
in addition they claim companies would be burdened with the costs of greater bureaucracy . the institute for labor market and job research -lrb- iab -rrb- said that a minimum wage in individual sectors would help to reduce the pressure on wages in germany through eastward expansion , provided it was just a temporary measure . ulrich walwei , deputy head of the iab told the daily berliner zeitung that the government also had to be careful in its selection of sectors to introduce a temporary minimum wage in order to avoid damaging competition . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate flares up over minimum wages with the eu 's eastward expansion and subsequent downward pressure on wages in germany , opposition conservatives have stoked debate over the introduction of minimum wages , saying they 're ready to support such a move .

to be elected , a candidate must win two-thirds of the vote , or 77 votes . at 78 , ratzinger is seen as a possible " transition " pope since he is one of the oldest candidates . hoping for short conclave bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal ratzinger -lrb- l -rrb- served at the pope 's funeral la repubblica reported the german has the support of several latin american cardinals , as well as two powerful italians , cardinals camillo ruini and angelo sodano - both seemingly intent of scuttling the chances of fellow italian dionigi tettamanzi . the corriere della sera newspaper reported that ratzinger was also benefitting from the fact that his opponents have for the time being failed to agree on another candidate . most church leaders hope for a short conclave , according to italian media .
cardinals are eager to project an image of unity by electing a pope as early as wednesday or thursday , the daily il messaggero wrote on wednesday . ratzinger is reportedly particularly eager to find the 264th successor of peter quickly , and la repubblica reported that he would withdraw his " candidacy " if he fails to garner the two-thirds majority needed on the first day . pope 's tomb draws faithful bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this picture released by the vatican newspaper l 'osservatore romano shows faithful coming to pray in front of the tomb of late pope john paul ii in the grottos of st. peter 's basilica at the vatican , wednesday april 13 , 2005 .
meanwhile , thousands of pilgrims , some weeping , bore prayers and messages of love to the simple marble-slab tomb of as the vatican opened the crypt of st peter 's basilica shortly after dawn . " it 's moving to see him shut up in a tomb , " said rosa sgarenella , from bari in southern italy , as she left the vaulted crypt .
" we remember him being so alive . " mourners paused to pray before the grave - inscribed with his name in latin , ioannes paulus ii , and the years of his life : 1920-2005 - and ushers quietly prodded the stream of pilgrims to move along . john paul ii was interred friday but vatican officials agreed to wait until wednesday to open the crypt .
italian authorities had requested the delay , fearing hundreds of thousands of followers in rome for his funeral would remain to visit the tomb . many determined pilgrims remained in the city anyway .
graziella valmori , a french woman of italian origin , was the first in the queue , arriving nearly three hours before the crypt opened at 7:00 am -lrb- 0500 gmt -rrb- . " he was so good , he deserved all this , " said valmori .
she drove from france last week to see the pope lying in state at the basilica and remained in rome to see his tomb . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de could a bavarian become pope ?

many who were babies or children during the war are still suffering from the trauma they experienced 60 years ago . in his speech commemorating the liberation of buchenwald concentration camp , chancellor gerhard schröder said remembering germany 's past - national socialism , war and genocide - was part of germany 's identity and , at the same time , " a permanent moral responsibility . "
yet there is a significant part of this past that has been neglected .
" it is surprising that the generation of children , who were born during the war and spent a large part of their childhood in the war , have until recently been remarkably silent about their biographies and appeared unaffected , " said dr. michael ermann , head of the war childhood project at munich 's ludwig-maximilians-university .
" their speechlessness found a counterpart in the little interest that the public showed for their fate , " ermann told german radio südwestrundfunk .
it is only in recent years that historians , psychoanalysts and german society are taking a closer look at these " kriegskinder " or children of war .
an international convention on the generation of war children is meeting in frankfurt this week to discuss the damage that the war and its effects had on people 's souls .
a robbed childhood dr. hartmut radebold , a former professor of clinical psychology at the university of kassel and the founder of germany 's geriatric psychotherapy , said these children were subject to suffering in three major areas .
" they faced violence , they had to deal with separation and loss of loved ones , and they had to come to terms with losing their homes , safety and security , " said radebold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many children had to flee their homes the psychiatrist helga spranger , one of the founding members of the war child association kriegskind.de and herself a war child , described the lives of children during the war in the international journal of evacuee and war child studies .
" children were separated from their parents , orphaned , evacuated by force , displaced , kidnapped , shot at , bombed , wounded , mutilated , raped , expropriated , blackmailed , adopted by force , drafted at an early age and forced into labor , " spranger wrote .
" in short , they suffered from stress for months or years and were basically robbed of their childhood . "
the horrors these children experienced continued to brew under the surface .
" it costs endless energy to keep it inside for decades , " said ermann .
haunted by memories in recent years , an increasing number of war children have suffered from agonizing health problems , as their trauma finally rises to the surface .
according to radebold , many are diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder .
" they are haunted by their memories and the terrors they experienced and are overwhelmed by them , " he said .
symptoms include jumpiness , restlessness , sleep disorders or withdrawal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sound of a plane can often trigger the trauma there are also many images that are burned into their minds , which trigger their trauma , said spranger .
" aside from the basic feelings of fear of death or abandonment , disgust and wishes of escaping , lasting horrifying impressions are hidden in the memories for a lifetime , " said spranger , such as the smell of burned houses , animals and humans after firebombs , hearing sirens or the shooting of weapons .
but despite their anguish , many war children have still been hesitant to talk .
sabine bode , author of the book " die vergessene generation " or " the lost generation , " looked at the stories of these war children to trace how their experiences shaped their lives .
she said her search for stories was tough .
" most of the people i spoke to fended off my questions with remarks like ' others were much worse off than i was ' or ' it did n't hurt us ' , " said bode .
" i rarely heard anyone complain about their fate .
i have the impression that despite the frequently observed trait that germans like to see themselves as victims , former war children of all people were in no way whiny about their past . "
history is a clogged toilet there are several reasons why these stories are only coming to the surface now .
many experiences were " re-awakened " through the images of other more recent wars , such as in kosovo or iraq .
that fact that these war children have reached retirement age also plays a role .
" in old age , you ca n't repress things as easily anymore , " said bode .
a profession also acts as a stabilizing factor for someone 's identity , said radebold .
" so when these war children retire , they have more time on their hands to think and with this time , come the memories , " he said .
in certain cases , trauma can be reactivated .
" this means that old memories are reawakened through a siren or an airplane that sounds similar to the ones during the war , " said radebold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " crabwalk " by günter grass was published in 2002 but bode said that war children also needed a form of " permission " to open their souls .
and this was given to them by nobel prize winner günter grass .
" he said , we also have to attend to germans ' problems after the war , " said bode .
" history or , to be more precise , the history we germans have repeatedly mucked up , is a clogged toilet .
we flush and flush , but the shit keeps rising , " grass wrote in his book " crabwalk , " published in 2002 .

ahead of their spring meetings , they have issued a report saying many countries will fail to achieve the hoped-for levels of poverty reduction .
african nations in particular are failing to meet goals , the report says .
rich nations should do more and poor countries must create a climate for private business to thrive , it adds .
' more aid needed ' the world bank and imf argue that it is possible for most countries to reduce poverty , as well as providing the primary education and improved public health that the goals embody .
economic growth is central to the effort to achieve the goals and the imf and bank 's vision is one of expansion driven by private business .
paul wolfowitz has recently been named head of the world bank the developing countries ' governments also have a role in allowing that to happen , says the report .
" they have to ensure they have a stable macroeconomic environment .
that means low levels of inflation , a currency that does n't fluctuate in value , " said mark plant , an imf adviser .
" that provides the private sector a framework in which it can then begin to invest and realise the fruits of that investment in production . "
creating an environment for business is a recurrent theme in discussions between the bodies and the developing countries that seek financial assistance from them .
the role of the rich countries is likely to feature more prominently in the discussions over the rest of the week , as the two institutions prepare for meetings of finance and development ministers at the weekend .
the imf and the bank say in the report that the millennium development goals are not likely to be achieved unless there is a sharp increase in aid , more debt relief and better access to western markets for goods produced in the developing world .
european pledge however , there is some good news : the aim of halving the proportion of the world 's poor in extreme poverty compared to 1990 levels is likely to be achieved - east asia has already done it , says the report .
but it adds that sub-saharan africa lags far behind and some key health goals , such as halving the level of maternal and child deaths , are going to be missed in many countries on current trends .

the report says rich countries should reduce financial support for their own farmers , which undermines agriculture in the developing world , and give poorer countries better access to their markets .
on tuesday , the european commission adopted proposals on how the bloc could help countries meet the millennium development goals .
the eu intends to focus on improving governance , building infrastructure and improving education in africa .
" africa is a geo-political partner which is going to get more and more important .

the targets - agreed at a united nations summit in 2000 - are backed by more than 180 nations .
there are a total of 18 specific targets , most to be achieved by 2015 .

the genographic project will collect dna samples from over 100,000 people worldwide to help piece together a picture of how the earth was colonised .
samples gathered from indigenous people and the general public will be subjected to lab and computer analysis to extract the valuable genetic data .
team leader dr spencer wells calls the plan " the moon shot of anthropology " .
we see this as part of the commons of our species dr spencer wells , the genographic project the $ 40m -lrb- £ 21m -rrb- privately funded initiative is a collaboration between national geographic , ibm and the waitt family foundation charity .
participating in the five-year study are some of the world 's top population geneticists , as well as leading experts in the fields of ancient dna , linguistics and archaeology .
future resource " we see this as a resource for humanity going into the future .
it could potentially become the largest genetic database ever created , " dr wells told the bbc news website .
the dna double helix is held together by 2.9 billion chemical components called base-pairs enlarge image members of the public will be able to buy a kit that contains all the material needed to add their genetic information to the database .
already , evidence from genetics and archaeology places the origin of modern humans -lrb- homo sapiens -rrb- in africa roughly 200,000 years ago .
it is thought , the first moderns to leave the continent set off around 60,000 years ago .
by studying the y -lrb- or male -rrb- chromosome and mitochondrial dna -lrb- which is passed down exclusively on the maternal line -rrb- , scientists have pieced together a broad-brush picture of which populations moved where in the world - and when .
what is lacking , says wells , is the fine detail , which could be filled in by this large-scale project .
many native american communities are strongly advised by their elders not to give samples françois balloux , university of cambridge " we know which markers on the y chromosome to focus on ; we know our way around the mitochondrial genome fairly well .
we just have n't had the large sample sizes to apply these technologies properly , " dr wells explained .
" there are still many questions we have n't answered .
was there any interbreeding with neanderthals as modern humans moved into europe ?
did any of the migrations to the americas come across the pacific - or even the atlantic ? "
these and other unanswered questions form the research goals of the project .
they include : who are the oldest populations in africa - and therefore the world ?
did alexander the great 's armies leave a genetic trail ?
who were the first people to colonise india ?
is it possible to obtain intact dna from the remains of homo erectus and other extinct hominids ?
how has colonialism affected genetic patterns in africa ?
was there any admixture with homo erectus as modern humans spread throughout south-east asia ?
is there any relationship between australian aboriginal genetic patterns and their oral histories ?
what are the origins of differences between human groups ?
a total of 10 dna collection centres located around the world will focus on obtaining samples from indigenous peoples .
the genetic markers in the blood of these groups have remained relatively unchanged for generations .
" sub-saharan africa harbours the spectrum of variation that will allow us to trace the very origin of our species as well as more recent incursions , " said himla soodyall , principal project investigator for that region .
collection challenge but some researchers said experience on other projects suggested this one could run into trouble with indigenous groups - particularly those , such as native americans and aboriginal australians , with a history of exploitation .
" i do n't know how they 'll deal with getting samples from more sensitive places , " commented françois balloux , a population geneticist at the university of cambridge , uk .
spencer wells aims to build the world 's largest genetic database -lrb- image : mark read -rrb- " amongst australian aborigines and native americans , the cultural resistance to co-operating with scientists is very strong .
" for example , many native american communities are strongly advised by their elders not to give samples . "
ajay royyuru , ibm 's lead scientist on the genographic project was optimistic on the issue .
" we want to attract their participation by being extremely clear about what we do and do not do .
for example , we are very clear about not trying to exploit their genetic diversity for medical uses , " he told the bbc news website .
project directors said they had already sought advice from indigenous leaders about their participation .
the project will shed light on the origins of human diversity -lrb- image : jodi cobb / national geographic -rrb- ibm says it will use sophisticated analytical techniques to interpret the information in the biobank and find patterns in the genetic data .
the it giant will also provide the computing infrastructure for the project .
kits sold to the public contain cheek swabs used to scrape the inside of the mouth for a dna sample .
the swabs can then be mailed to a central laboratory for analysis .
after four to six weeks , the results of the analysis will appear on the website behind an anonymous password contained in the kit .
the exact budget available for the study will depend on how many test kits are sold to the public .
the net proceeds will go back into the research and into a " legacy project " to support indigenous peoples .
the genographic project 's directors emphasise that the information in the database will be made accessible to scientists studying human migrations .

the genographic project will collect dna samples from over 100,000 people worldwide to help piece together a picture of how the earth was colonised .
samples gathered from indigenous people and the general public will be subjected to lab and computer analysis to extract the valuable genetic data .

it is thought , the first moderns to leave the continent set off around 60,000 years ago .
by studying the y -lrb- or male -rrb- chromosome and mitochondrial dna -lrb- which is passed down exclusively on the maternal line -rrb- , scientists have pieced together a broad-brush picture of which populations moved where in the world - and when .

we just have n't had the large sample sizes to apply these technologies properly , " dr wells explained .
" there are still many questions we have n't answered .

did alexander the great 's armies leave a genetic trail ?
who were the first people to colonise india ?
is it possible to obtain intact dna from the remains of homo erectus and other extinct hominids ?
how has colonialism affected genetic patterns in africa ?
was there any admixture with homo erectus as modern humans spread throughout south-east asia ?
is there any relationship between australian aboriginal genetic patterns and their oral histories ?
what are the origins of differences between human groups ?
a total of 10 dna collection centres located around the world will focus on obtaining samples from indigenous peoples .
the genetic markers in the blood of these groups have remained relatively unchanged for generations .
" sub-saharan africa harbours the spectrum of variation that will allow us to trace the very origin of our species as well as more recent incursions , " said himla soodyall , principal project investigator for that region .
collection challenge but some researchers said experience on other projects suggested this one could run into trouble with indigenous groups - particularly those , such as native americans and aboriginal australians , with a history of exploitation .

ex-state department official carl ford was testifying before the senate foreign affairs committee examining mr bolton 's nomination .
mr bolton , a critic of the un , has denied trying to have people who disagreed with him sacked .
intelligence director nominee john negroponte has also faced a hearing .
' bruising process ' it is unusual for a nomination hearing to concentrate so intensely on an individual 's alleged personal failings , but democrats claim that mr bolton has shortcomings which genuinely interfere with his ability to do the un job , says the bbc 's justin webb in washington .
but it is a fight the democrats will probably lose and mr bolton is still likely to be confirmed as america 's un ambassador , he says .
john bolton yale law school graduate as assistant secretary of state under george bush senior , helped organise anti-saddam alliance made under-secretary of state for arms control and international security in may 2001 in july 2003 , condemned north korean leader kim jong-il for living like royalty while people lived in " hellish nightmare " profile : john bolton mr ford used to run the state department 's intelligence arm .
he said mr bolton was a serial abuser of junior staff , and that his treatment of an intelligence analyst who disagreed with him on the subject of cuba damaged the work of the department .
" the collateral damage and the personal hurt that he causes is not worth the price that had to be paid .
it simply is out of bounds for the federal bureaucracy to allow a bully to run wild over people , " he told the senate committee .
he described mr bolton as a " kiss up , kick down " bureaucrat .
this has been an extremely bruising process for mr bolton and he has been roughed up in the process in a manner which has surprised many observers , our correspondent says .
democrats oppose mr bolton 's nomination , but they need the support of at least one republican on the committee to block it .
rhode island senator lincoln chafee had been considering voting against mr bolton , but said he was impressed with his opening statement .
mr bolton 's dislike of the un as an institution has not been the central focus of the hearing .
he has said the un needed us leadership to get it back on track , and should focus more on human rights violations and international terrorism .
intelligence nominee in a separate hearing , mr bush 's choice for new director of national intelligence , john negroponte , has said his priority will be to make fundamental reforms to the us intelligence community .
have your say the un is due for a good shaking up .
if mr. bolton can do it - more power to him !
dwayne chastain , ohio send your comments he said he had built on the lessons learned about the shortcomings of the intelligence system both before and after the attacks on 11 september 2001 .
mr negroponte , 65 , a veteran diplomat , faced tough questioning by the senate intelligence committee about his time as ambassador to honduras , where human rights groups allege that he was aware of abuses by death squads .
he said he had done nothing improper and nothing which broke the laws applicable at the time .
the new post of national intelligence director was created on the recommendation of the commission that investigated the 11 september attacks .

by ray dunne bbc news online health staff a new virus could spread quickly it is only a matter of time before a major outbreak of potentially deadly flu , according to scientists .
could the world cope ?
there have been three flu pandemics during the past 100 years .
the 1918 spanish flu is estimated to have killed up to 50m people worldwide .
the asian flu of 1957 was caught much earlier but still claimed one million lives .
the hong kong flu of 1968 was responsible for a similar number of deaths .
it has been 37 years since the last major outbreak and scientists , health professionals and some governments are getting twitchy .
' inevitable outbreak ' most scientists agree that another flu pandemic is inevitable .
many say it is overdue .
" it really is inevitable , " says dr alan hay , director of the world influenza centre in london .
" we do n't know when it will arrive but we are anticipating it . "
some experts believe the next killer flu may already have arrived .
" avian flu might yet be the next pandemic virus , " says john oxford , professor of virology at st bartholomew 's and the royal london school of medicine .
bird flu is seen as a potential threat the latest outbreak of bird flu in asia has killed about 50 people .
millions of chickens have been slaughtered .
there has been no confirmed case yet of this particular strain of the virus being passed from human to human .
however , scientists are worried that the virus could mutate and could pass from one person to another , triggering a possible pandemic .
those fears are not groundless .
dutch scientists say three people who caught bird flu when a different strain hit the netherlands in 2003 may have caught it from people and not animals .
the world health organization has been urging the international community for years to prepare for the next flu pandemic .
it estimates a future outbreak could kill as many as 650,000 people in industrialised countries .
the figure would be significantly higher in the developing world .
recent outbreaks of bird flu and sars have spurred some countries into action .
however , others are lagging behind .
" the who has been desperately trying to get countries to take this seriously , " professor oxford says .
" it has 192 members but only 12 have done anything about it .
" people really need to think about what happens when this virus arrives - who is going to do what ; what vaccines are available ; who is going to distribute them and who is going to bury people when they die . "
emergency plans in early 2004 , canada , which was hit hard by sars , outlined its plans for dealing with a flu pandemic .
the 450-page document spells out what actions authorities will take in the event of an outbreak .
four years ago , ministers signed a deal with a local pharmaceutical company to provide a vaccine for 32m canadians in the event of a pandemic .
killer viruses 1918 spanish flu killed 50m 1957 asian flu killed around 1m 1968 hong kong flu killed 1m 2003 sars killed 774 2004-5 avian flu -lrb- h5n1 -rrb- has killed 50 to date other countries have taken similar steps .
in germany , the government has drawn up plans to dispense millions of doses of the antiviral drug tamiflu .
the uk government is taking similar action .
" we are taking active steps to increase our stocks of available antivirals , " says a spokesman for the department of health .
in a report in 2003 , the who said countries needed to do more .
" a few member states are formulating national plans for pandemic preparedness , but only one country has completed a formal , legally sanctioned plan .
" the absence of such national plans , including projected needs for vaccines , antiviral drugs , and other essential supplies , hinders efforts to coordinate preparedness planning at the global level . "
it added : " all countries need to be aware of the need to begin preparedness planning well in advance of a pandemic , as many essential activities take considerable time . "
the who will spearhead the international response to any flu pandemic .
some 110 national influenza reference centres in 83 countries are acting as its eyes and ears , feeding into four collaborating centres in atlanta , london , melbourne and tokyo .
" there is very intense surveillance to detect any novel viruses , " says dr alan hay .
vaccine search one of the biggest challenges facing scientists if and when a powerful strain of flu emerges will be to find a vaccine to protect people against it .
scientists around the world are already working on possible vaccines for sars and avian flu - two of the leading contenders for the title of next pandemic virus .
experts say a pandemic may be imminent " we have a sort of hierarchy of likelihood viruses that may spark a pandemic , " says dr hay .
" we have some vaccine prepared against some of these viruses .
we hope they will give us a head start . "
the vaccines are in very early stages of development and are based on strains of influenza that have emerged in recent years but have not sparked major outbreaks .
the hope is they can provide the basis of an effective vaccine in the event of a pandemic .
like all new drugs , any vaccine for flu - even one for a particularly lethal strain of the virus - will take time to develop and to be made available to the public .
" it is difficult to say how long it could take , " says dr hay .
some experts believe a vaccine could become available relatively quickly .
others maintain it will take a year or more after the virus hits .
however , experts are hopeful that some existing drugs could provide an important first line of defence against a future pandemic .
a study published in early 2004 by scientists in australia suggests relenza is effective against the strain of bird flu currently affecting asia .
the glaxosmithkline drug has been available since 1999 and stops the flu virus from spreading .
tamiflu , which is manufactured by hoffmann-la roche , works in a similar way .
professor oxford believes governments around the world should be stockpiling these drugs now .
" these drugs act against every known influenza virus .
there is no excuse for governments not to have them , " he says .
" there will be a mad rush for these drugs if this flu arrives on the scene .
it will be pretty chaotic .
" it will be a dereliction of duty not to have stockpiled these drugs . "

by ray dunne bbc news online health staff a new virus could spread quickly it is only a matter of time before a major outbreak of potentially deadly flu , according to scientists .
could the world cope ?
there have been three flu pandemics during the past 100 years .
the 1918 spanish flu is estimated to have killed up to 50m people worldwide .
the asian flu of 1957 was caught much earlier but still claimed one million lives .
the hong kong flu of 1968 was responsible for a similar number of deaths .
it has been 37 years since the last major outbreak and scientists , health professionals and some governments are getting twitchy .
' inevitable outbreak ' most scientists agree that another flu pandemic is inevitable .
many say it is overdue .
" it really is inevitable , " says dr alan hay , director of the world influenza centre in london .
" we do n't know when it will arrive but we are anticipating it . "
some experts believe the next killer flu may already have arrived .
" avian flu might yet be the next pandemic virus , " says john oxford , professor of virology at st bartholomew 's and the royal london school of medicine .
bird flu is seen as a potential threat the latest outbreak of bird flu in asia has killed about 50 people .
millions of chickens have been slaughtered .
there has been no confirmed case yet of this particular strain of the virus being passed from human to human .
however , scientists are worried that the virus could mutate and could pass from one person to another , triggering a possible pandemic .
those fears are not groundless .
dutch scientists say three people who caught bird flu when a different strain hit the netherlands in 2003 may have caught it from people and not animals .
the world health organization has been urging the international community for years to prepare for the next flu pandemic .
it estimates a future outbreak could kill as many as 650,000 people in industrialised countries .
the figure would be significantly higher in the developing world .
recent outbreaks of bird flu and sars have spurred some countries into action .
however , others are lagging behind .
" the who has been desperately trying to get countries to take this seriously , " professor oxford says .
" it has 192 members but only 12 have done anything about it .
" people really need to think about what happens when this virus arrives - who is going to do what ; what vaccines are available ; who is going to distribute them and who is going to bury people when they die . "
emergency plans in early 2004 , canada , which was hit hard by sars , outlined its plans for dealing with a flu pandemic .
the 450-page document spells out what actions authorities will take in the event of an outbreak .
four years ago , ministers signed a deal with a local pharmaceutical company to provide a vaccine for 32m canadians in the event of a pandemic .
killer viruses 1918 spanish flu killed 50m 1957 asian flu killed around 1m 1968 hong kong flu killed 1m 2003 sars killed 774 2004-5 avian flu -lrb- h5n1 -rrb- has killed 50 to date other countries have taken similar steps .
in germany , the government has drawn up plans to dispense millions of doses of the antiviral drug tamiflu .
the uk government is taking similar action .
" we are taking active steps to increase our stocks of available antivirals , " says a spokesman for the department of health .
in a report in 2003 , the who said countries needed to do more .
" a few member states are formulating national plans for pandemic preparedness , but only one country has completed a formal , legally sanctioned plan .
" the absence of such national plans , including projected needs for vaccines , antiviral drugs , and other essential supplies , hinders efforts to coordinate preparedness planning at the global level . "
it added : " all countries need to be aware of the need to begin preparedness planning well in advance of a pandemic , as many essential activities take considerable time . "
the who will spearhead the international response to any flu pandemic .
some 110 national influenza reference centres in 83 countries are acting as its eyes and ears , feeding into four collaborating centres in atlanta , london , melbourne and tokyo .
" there is very intense surveillance to detect any novel viruses , " says dr alan hay .
vaccine search one of the biggest challenges facing scientists if and when a powerful strain of flu emerges will be to find a vaccine to protect people against it .
scientists around the world are already working on possible vaccines for sars and avian flu - two of the leading contenders for the title of next pandemic virus .
experts say a pandemic may be imminent " we have a sort of hierarchy of likelihood viruses that may spark a pandemic , " says dr hay .
" we have some vaccine prepared against some of these viruses .
we hope they will give us a head start . "
the vaccines are in very early stages of development and are based on strains of influenza that have emerged in recent years but have not sparked major outbreaks .
the hope is they can provide the basis of an effective vaccine in the event of a pandemic .
like all new drugs , any vaccine for flu - even one for a particularly lethal strain of the virus - will take time to develop and to be made available to the public .
" it is difficult to say how long it could take , " says dr hay .
some experts believe a vaccine could become available relatively quickly .
others maintain it will take a year or more after the virus hits .
however , experts are hopeful that some existing drugs could provide an important first line of defence against a future pandemic .
a study published in early 2004 by scientists in australia suggests relenza is effective against the strain of bird flu currently affecting asia .
the glaxosmithkline drug has been available since 1999 and stops the flu virus from spreading .
tamiflu , which is manufactured by hoffmann-la roche , works in a similar way .
professor oxford believes governments around the world should be stockpiling these drugs now .
" these drugs act against every known influenza virus .
there is no excuse for governments not to have them , " he says .
" there will be a mad rush for these drugs if this flu arrives on the scene .
it will be pretty chaotic .
" it will be a dereliction of duty not to have stockpiled these drugs . "

dorset south candidate ed matts was pictured carrying a photo of an asylum seeker , next to ann widdecombe holding a placard saying " let them stay " .
in the " doctored " version , mr matts has a placard saying " controlled immigration " and ms widdecombe has one saying " not chaos and inhumanity " .
michael howard said mr matts would not be sacked , despite opponents ' calls .
the businessman , 42 , is standing in the key marginal seat of dorset south , and included the picture in his campaign literature .
to airbrush it out and make it almost the opposite is terrible father philip dyson priest and campaigner widdecombe ok with photo the undoctored original showed him protesting , holding a photo of verah kachepa , a malawian asylum seeker from weymouth who has been threatened with deportation .
in a statement , mr matts said : " i apologise for making a foolish mistake - i had no intention of causing any embarrassment .
" however , being involved in an individual asylum case is not inconsistent with the conservative view that britain 's asylum system is in urgent need of attention . "
but the priest who helped organise the campaign to stop mrs kachepa 's deportation told bbc news mr matts ' actions had been " shocking " .
father philip dyson , of st augustine 's catholic church , said : " to airbrush it out and make it almost the opposite is terrible .
to do that is deceitful .
it has done him no good . "
labour took the constituency at the last election with a majority of just 153 , making it one of the tories ' top targets in the upcoming election .
he should not have done what he did but he has apologised michael howard health secretary john reid released an open letter to tory leader michael howard asking how mr matts could not be sacked .
mr reid said the altering of the image was a " sick " political stunt and said if mr matts was not dismissed " the only conclusion i can come to is that this organised deceit has been sanctioned and organised by the conservative party " .
mr reid later delivered a letter to weymouth conservative club .
in response , tory co-chairman liam fox said mr matts had apologised and asked why labour ministers never apologised for their actions .
liberal democrat deputy leader menzies campbell said : " howard flight was sacked by the conservatives for telling the truth .
ed matts , the conservative candidate in dorset south , should be sacked for telling lies . "
speaking on a trip to torquay , mr howard said : " it should not have been done and the candidate concerned has apologised for it - and so he should . "
' silly mistake ' but mr howard said mr matts would not be stopped from standing in the same way as deputy chairman howard flight , who sparked a row over tory spending plans .
" no , no , not at all .
he has apologised .
he should not have done what he did but he has apologised . "
and ann widdecombe , who appeared in the images , said mr matts ' actions were " unfortunate , but i do n't believe they were malign " .
shadow chancellor oliver letwin , whose seat is the adjacent dorset west , told bbc news : " ed matts has already apologised .
he recognises that it was a silly mistake .
it was the wrong thing to do . "
but mr letwin said the images were " perfectly compatible " as the tories wanted a fairer and more humane immigration and asylum system .
mr matts campaigned against the deportation of mrs kachepa , who arrived in the uk in 2001 , was detained on 13 march and then threatened with deportation .
she and her children spent almost a fortnight in yarlswood detention centre until they were given a reprieve until july .
mrs kachepa 's husband was in the country on a work visa as a pharmacist .
she says he had a nervous breakdown , started drinking and vanished , eventually turning up back in malawi where he resumed a relationship with the powerful niece of former dictator hastings banda .
the mother-of-four is well-known locally and does voluntary work for the church and for charities .
also standing in dorset south are labour 's jim knight , lib dem graham oakes , the respect-unity coalition 's berny parkes , david marchesi of the socialist labour party , and the legalise cannabis alliance 's vic hamilton .

bbc one 's this week is using the song for its opening titles in the election .
presenter andrew neil has donned a purple suit and joined a bevy of dancing girls to mimic peter kay 's comic relief video .
the new titles feature in this week 's election specials , screened every monday and thursday evening .
the programme is usually at 2335 bst but this thursday will be shown at 2345 bst .
as well as publisher and former newspaper editor mr neil , the titles feature former conservative defence minister michael portillo and bbc chief political correspondent mark mardell .
look-alikes of tony blair , michael howard and charles kennedy , as well as comic pub landlord al murray , also dance and mime to christie 's tune .
christie has specially rewritten -lrb- is this the way to -rrb- amarillo for the programme , with the new chorus " election fever 's in the air " .
the first showing of the titles cut to mr neil marching into the studio in a feather boa , which he deftly threw into the lap of labour candidate and pundit diane abbott .
guests lined up for this week 's election programmes include impressionists rory bremner and alistair mcgowan , historian david starkey and comedian rich hall .
leading brain researcher susan greenfield , novelist fay weldon and ex-newspaper editor rose boycott are also due to appear in the show .

the decision will pave the way for the signing of an accession treaty later this month .
both countries are set to join the eu in 2007 .
but their memberships could be delayed by one year if they fail to make key reforms , such as curbing corruption and reorganising farming .
optimism at last the eu seems within reach for bulgaria and romania , which missed the first big wave of expansion into the former communist bloc last year .
many european deputies think that romania - a country of 23 million people - is still lagging behind .
but the european enlargement commissioner , olli rehn , called for cautious optimism .
the new romanian centre-right government , he said , was tackling judicial reform and state subsidies and stepping up the fight against corruption .
however , he warned he would not hesitate to recommend delaying both countries ' entry by one year if they proved unprepared .
later this month , eu foreign ministers and their romanian and bulgarian counterparts will sign an accession treaty , which has to be ratified by national parliaments across the european union .
for the next year and a half , both countries will be kept under close watch .
