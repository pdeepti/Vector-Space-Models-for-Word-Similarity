but it is his condemnation of abortion and same-sex marriage in the 227-page book " memory and identity " that has caused sharp criticism and controversy . the 84-year-old muses about the competing forces of good and evil in the world and history within the book , with special attention on the horrors committed by the nazis and by communist regimes . in one passage , after evoking the massacre of jews by the nazis in the holocaust , the pope writes that the democratically elected parliaments that replaced brutal authoritarian regimes in some countries continue to carry out murder on a huge scale by allowing abortion . " there is still , however , a legal extermination of human beings who have been conceived but not yet born , " the pope writes .
" and this time , we are talking about an extermination which has been allowed by nothing less than democratically elected parliaments . " germany 's jews criticize catholic view many critics have drawn a direct line between the pope 's reference to the holocaust and abortion , something jewish groups in germany immediately seized upon . " the catholic church does not understand or does not want to understand that there is an enormous difference between mass genocide and what women do to their own bodies , " paul spiegel , the president of the central council for jews in germany , said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cardinal joseph ratzinger of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith .
german cardinal joseph ratzinger , prefect of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith , the roman catholic church 's doctrinal watchdog , defended the pope and argued that misinterpretation had resulted in unwarranted criticism . german cardinal defends pontiff ratzinger , who has been touted as a possible successor to the ailing pontiff , told a new conference earlier this week that the pope " was not trying to put the holocaust and abortion on the same plane . "
it was the pope 's intention , he added , to show the pervasiveness of evil , " even in liberal political systems . " the book further echoes similar remarks made by the cardinal of cologne , joachim meisner , who declared in a sermon in january : " first there was herod , who ordered the children of bethlehem to be killed , then there was hitler and stalin among others , and today unborn children are being killed in their millions . "
meisner later expressed regret for his comparison . in other areas of the pontiff 's book , the pope discusses the fear within the vatican that rampant relativism and secularism are causing the decay of christian values in europe and beyond .
he uses the debate on same-sex marriages as an example . same-sex marriages part of " new evil " # bhe ponders whether the european parliament has been put under pressure to legalize same-sex marriage as " part of a new ideology of evil , perhaps more insidious and hidden , which attempts to pit human rights against the family and against man . " the book , based on conversations the pope had in polish with two friends , the philosopher krzysztof michalski and the late father jozef tischner , at the papal summer residence near rome in 1993 , also says terrorist networks represent " a constant threat to the life of millions of innocents , " and specifically mentions the sept .

but some lawmakers lamented the lack of a popular referendum . the german parliament has begun the legislative process leading towards ratification of the eu constitution - amid unusual harmony among politicians of all stripes .
for the most part , german lawmakers have praised the constitution , calling it a milestone on the way to a stronger and more integrated european union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baden-württemberg premier erwin teufel erwin teufel -lrb- photo -rrb- , the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- state premier of baden-württemberg and a member of the eu convention that worked out the document last year , recalled the old divisions and wars in europe which preceded the current climate of peace and unity on the continent .
eu is bigger - and more effective the constitution will give europe " a new shape and a future , " teufel said .
" europe won ’ t grow stronger when it deals with thousands of issues .
europe will only become stronger when it deals with the right issues .
and the constitution guarantees that it will do so . "
german foreign minister joschka fischer , one of the staunchest advocates of the constitution , argued that an enlarged european union is an effective political union , not a bureaucratic behemoth .
" the european union with 15 members hasn ’ t achieved in three summits what the enlarged eu of 25 members managed in only six months and two summits , " fischer said .
" this goes to show that accusations a larger europe is unmanageable are wrong .
the constitutional process has proved the european union is working . "
fischer also said he was convinced that the new constitution would overcome the widespread lack of interest about europe among its populations , and enhance their willingness to participate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. werner hoyer but werner hoyer -lrb- photo -rrb- , a parliamentarian from the liberal free democratic party , retorted that one reason germans are not interested in europe is that they are not given a say in adopting the constitution .
" germans are skeptical , uninterested and misinformed about the constitution because the political establishment doesn ’ t see the need to campaign for the document in a referendum , " he said .
" if we would be forced to wage a public information campaign , all of us would have to work really hard .
parliament ’ s refusal to hold a referendum on the constitution is hugely lamentable and will not serve our common cause . "
numerous eu state have decided to put the constitution to a popular vote .
spanish voters approved the document on sunday , in the first in a series of referendums .
points of controversy in spite of the general , cross-party political consensus in germany on the constitution , there is also controversy on the rights of control by national parliaments to be included in the annex to the draft .
germany ’ s conservative opposition wants parliament to be allowed to reprimand brussels and be given the right to sue before the european court , for example , in cases of violation of the subsidiarity principle .
the subsidiary principle obliges the european commission to restrict itself to legislation whose objectives can not be better achieved by the member states themselves .
they also want a strong national say on the possible entry of turkey into the eu , a move which the cdu flatly rejects at the moment .
so in the end , the ratification process in germany may take a while .
and joschka fischer 's much hoped-for signal to europe - a speedy ratification - is unlikely to materialize . uwe hessler -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a rough road to ratification three countries have already said " yes " to the eu constitution .

the highly populated country is one of the most attractive markets in asia behind china - a fact not lost on german airport operator fraport . in september 2003 , india 's government decided to sell 74 percent of india 's two major airports - delhi and mumbai .
now the government is looking for private companies to invest in the airports ' expansion .
as specialists estimate that the number of airline passengers is going to rise by 16 percent each year until 2010 , the investment in these airports promises a stake in a lucrative growth market . the frankfurt airport operating company fraport has been quick to realize this and has made its intentions towards india clear .
frank thiesen , assistant manager of the global investment and management division at fraport , has been busy preparing the division for the participation in one of the indian airports for the past one and a half years .
the process has been a long one for thiesen and his team .
firstly , partner companies with whom fraport sought to form a consortium with had to be selected .
at the same time the process of rapprochement to the indian government was underway .
fraport is planning to invest a total of € 30 to € 50 million -lrb- $ 40 to $ 66 million -rrb- for a stake of about 10 percent in one of the two airports .
" if we are going to be awarded the contract , we are going to first revise the airport 's internal company processes , " thiesen explained .
for this purpose , fraport personnel have to be sent to india , training programs have to be set up , and the infrastructure needs to be improved .
tough competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt international airport , operated by fraport .
about 10 more applicants are competing for the stake , among them consortia of the airports of paris , singapore , and hong kong .
the incentive is strong as the indian government 's liberalization strategy created new conditions for civil aviation policy .
since august 2003 , low-fare airlines have been given access to india 's domestic market .
more and more private airlines are coming to existence .
two of them , jet airways and air sahara , recently received permission to start service to international destinations .
with more than one billion people and an economic growth of more than eight percent , india is regarded as the most important asian market for the future next to china .
up to now , too much regulation of the aviation market , a thick jungle of bureaucracy and the protection of inefficient , run-down state airlines air india and indian airlines prevented private companies from raising the much invoked potential of the market .
private airlines contend that liberalizing of aviation policies is pointless if infrastructure is not massively extended at the same time .
metropolitan airports suffered from extreme overload , they say .
" if new airlines are to enter the market without infrastructure keeping up , the industry is headed for a disaster , " wolfgang prock-schauer , chief executive of the biggest private airline jet airways , warned .
the indian government has acknowledged this need and intends to invest a two-digit euro million amount into the extension of streets , railway , sea- and airports over the coming years .
a previous investment project failed a few years ago , fraport 's investment in the airport extension at the philippine capital manila was not successful .
europe 's second biggest airport company had to take the blow of losing € 300 million .
ever since , shareholders and analysts have kept a critical eye on fraport 's international activities .
" we learned from the experience , " fraport manager thiesen explains .
" nowadays we concentrate on smaller , specific management tasks and try to be on the safe side as far as possible . "
therefore , the frankfurt company prefers holding several small stakes over a few big ones .
this way , they keep the risk of a great loss smaller .

the murder of a turkish woman and the applauding of the crime by some students have left berlin shaken and officials pushing for ethics class .
but how deep does the concept of honor run among some immigrant communities ? on a cold afternoon this week , hatin sürücü gazed gravely from a large poster behind a bus stop lined with flowers , cards and candles . to the people who came to this bleak part of berlin 's tempelhof district for tuesday 's solemn vigil - called not by the city 's muslim community but a gay and lesbian organization - the image of the young woman in a headscarf , a baby in her arms , was familiar from newspapers and television .
a few notes at the memorial read , " hope you get a better deal in your next life , " and " live a life on your own terms . " " it 's a scandal , " said ali k , 33 .
" all muslims in berlin should take to the streets to protest . "
yasemin , 22 , said , " it 's horrific .
all hatin was doing was leading her life the way she wanted . " but it was a choice she paid for with her life .
on feb .
7 , 23-year-old hatin sürücü was gunned down at the aforementioned bus stop .
she died on the spot .
shortly afterwards , three of her brothers - who reportedly had long been threatening her - were arrested .
investigators suspect it was a so-called " honor killing , " given the fact that sürücü 's ultra-conservative turkish-kurdish family strongly disapproved of her modern and " un-islamic " life . sürücü grew up in berlin and was married off at 16 to a cousin in istanbul .
after a few years , she returned to the german capital with her young son , moved into a home for single mothers , completed school and began to train as an electrician .
she stopped wearing a headscarf and was said to be outgoing and vivacious . " she lived like a german " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish women in a mosque in berlin 's kreuzberg district though not the first of its kind , the brazen shooting has sent shockwaves through berlin , home to a large foreign community and which for years has fretted over steady ghetto-building in districts dominated by turkish and arab immigrants .

but some lawmakers lamented the lack of a popular referendum . the german parliament has begun the legislative process leading towards ratification of the eu constitution - amid unusual harmony among politicians of all stripes .
for the most part , german lawmakers have praised the constitution , calling it a milestone on the way to a stronger and more integrated european union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baden-württemberg premier erwin teufel erwin teufel -lrb- photo -rrb- , the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- state premier of baden-württemberg and a member of the eu convention that worked out the document last year , recalled the old divisions and wars in europe which preceded the current climate of peace and unity on the continent .
eu is bigger - and more effective the constitution will give europe " a new shape and a future , " teufel said .
" europe won ’ t grow stronger when it deals with thousands of issues .
europe will only become stronger when it deals with the right issues .
and the constitution guarantees that it will do so . "
german foreign minister joschka fischer , one of the staunchest advocates of the constitution , argued that an enlarged european union is an effective political union , not a bureaucratic behemoth .
" the european union with 15 members hasn ’ t achieved in three summits what the enlarged eu of 25 members managed in only six months and two summits , " fischer said .
" this goes to show that accusations a larger europe is unmanageable are wrong .
the constitutional process has proved the european union is working . "
fischer also said he was convinced that the new constitution would overcome the widespread lack of interest about europe among its populations , and enhance their willingness to participate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. werner hoyer but werner hoyer -lrb- photo -rrb- , a parliamentarian from the liberal free democratic party , retorted that one reason germans are not interested in europe is that they are not given a say in adopting the constitution .
" germans are skeptical , uninterested and misinformed about the constitution because the political establishment doesn ’ t see the need to campaign for the document in a referendum , " he said .
" if we would be forced to wage a public information campaign , all of us would have to work really hard .
parliament ’ s refusal to hold a referendum on the constitution is hugely lamentable and will not serve our common cause . "
numerous eu state have decided to put the constitution to a popular vote .
spanish voters approved the document on sunday , in the first in a series of referendums .
points of controversy in spite of the general , cross-party political consensus in germany on the constitution , there is also controversy on the rights of control by national parliaments to be included in the annex to the draft .
germany ’ s conservative opposition wants parliament to be allowed to reprimand brussels and be given the right to sue before the european court , for example , in cases of violation of the subsidiarity principle .
the subsidiary principle obliges the european commission to restrict itself to legislation whose objectives can not be better achieved by the member states themselves .
they also want a strong national say on the possible entry of turkey into the eu , a move which the cdu flatly rejects at the moment .
so in the end , the ratification process in germany may take a while .
and joschka fischer 's much hoped-for signal to europe - a speedy ratification - is unlikely to materialize . uwe hessler -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a rough road to ratification three countries have already said " yes " to the eu constitution .
on sunday , spain becomes the first country to put the matter directly to the people .

all hatin was doing was leading her life the way she wanted . " but it was a choice she paid for with her life .
on feb .
7 , 23-year-old hatin sürücü was gunned down at the aforementioned bus stop .
she died on the spot .
shortly afterwards , three of her brothers - who reportedly had long been threatening her - were arrested .
investigators suspect it was a so-called " honor killing , " given the fact that sürücü 's ultra-conservative turkish-kurdish family strongly disapproved of her modern and " un-islamic " life . sürücü grew up in berlin and was married off at 16 to a cousin in istanbul .
after a few years , she returned to the german capital with her young son , moved into a home for single mothers , completed school and began to train as an electrician .
she stopped wearing a headscarf and was said to be outgoing and vivacious . " she lived like a german " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish women in a mosque in berlin 's kreuzberg district though not the first of its kind , the brazen shooting has sent shockwaves through berlin , home to a large foreign community and which for years has fretted over steady ghetto-building in districts dominated by turkish and arab immigrants .
while the incident has reopened debate on the integration of immigrants and the compatibility of islamic values with western ones , it ’ s the reaction of a small group of turkish students to the murder that has rattled the german capital . days after hatin sürücü was killed , some male students of turkish origin at a high school near the scene of the crime reportedly downplayed the act .
during a class discussion on the murder , one said , " she -lrb- hatin sürücü -rrb- only had herself to blame , " while another remarked " she deserved what she got - the whore lived like a german . "
the school 's director promptly dashed off a letter to parents and students , castigating the students and warning that the school didn ’ t tolerate incitement against freedom . " her lifestyle did n't fit " the comments have sparked outrage and left many asking if it was just a one-off or whether such thinking is in fact not entirely uncommon among sections of the muslim community in the city . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to some , it is n't .
" there is n't a single school with a high foreign population where teachers have n't faced this kind of thing , where individual students sometimes regard murder as a just sentence , " said heinz wagner , head of school and education policy at the vbe teachers trade union and a school director himself .
referring to the controversial remarks on sürücü 's murder , he said , " the very fact that they decided to provoke with something like that tells you that they 're getting their ideas from somewhere . " at berlin 's turkish-dominated neighborhood near kottbusser tor in the kreuzberg district , 17-year-old erkan , a high school student of turkish origin , was divided about the issue .

the highly populated country is one of the most attractive markets in asia behind china - a fact not lost on german airport operator fraport . in september 2003 , india 's government decided to sell 74 percent of india 's two major airports - delhi and mumbai .
now the government is looking for private companies to invest in the airports ' expansion .
as specialists estimate that the number of airline passengers is going to rise by 16 percent each year until 2010 , the investment in these airports promises a stake in a lucrative growth market . the frankfurt airport operating company fraport has been quick to realize this and has made its intentions towards india clear .
frank thiesen , assistant manager of the global investment and management division at fraport , has been busy preparing the division for the participation in one of the indian airports for the past one and a half years .
the process has been a long one for thiesen and his team .
firstly , partner companies with whom fraport sought to form a consortium with had to be selected .
at the same time the process of rapprochement to the indian government was underway .
fraport is planning to invest a total of € 30 to € 50 million -lrb- $ 40 to $ 66 million -rrb- for a stake of about 10 percent in one of the two airports .
" if we are going to be awarded the contract , we are going to first revise the airport 's internal company processes , " thiesen explained .
for this purpose , fraport personnel have to be sent to india , training programs have to be set up , and the infrastructure needs to be improved .
tough competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt international airport , operated by fraport .
about 10 more applicants are competing for the stake , among them consortia of the airports of paris , singapore , and hong kong .
the incentive is strong as the indian government 's liberalization strategy created new conditions for civil aviation policy .
since august 2003 , low-fare airlines have been given access to india 's domestic market .
more and more private airlines are coming to existence .
two of them , jet airways and air sahara , recently received permission to start service to international destinations .
with more than one billion people and an economic growth of more than eight percent , india is regarded as the most important asian market for the future next to china .
up to now , too much regulation of the aviation market , a thick jungle of bureaucracy and the protection of inefficient , run-down state airlines air india and indian airlines prevented private companies from raising the much invoked potential of the market .
private airlines contend that liberalizing of aviation policies is pointless if infrastructure is not massively extended at the same time .
metropolitan airports suffered from extreme overload , they say .
" if new airlines are to enter the market without infrastructure keeping up , the industry is headed for a disaster , " wolfgang prock-schauer , chief executive of the biggest private airline jet airways , warned .
the indian government has acknowledged this need and intends to invest a two-digit euro million amount into the extension of streets , railway , sea- and airports over the coming years .
a previous investment project failed a few years ago , fraport 's investment in the airport extension at the philippine capital manila was not successful .
europe 's second biggest airport company had to take the blow of losing € 300 million .
ever since , shareholders and analysts have kept a critical eye on fraport 's international activities .
" we learned from the experience , " fraport manager thiesen explains .
" nowadays we concentrate on smaller , specific management tasks and try to be on the safe side as far as possible . "
therefore , the frankfurt company prefers holding several small stakes over a few big ones .
this way , they keep the risk of a great loss smaller .
if fraport will get the chance for participation in india is going be decided in the summer .
then , india 's government will pick which applicant is going to be awarded the contract . ana lehmann -lrb- bm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu favors aviation tax to fund african aid a proposal put forward by germany and france to tax commercial aviation fuel to raise funds for development in africa was endorsed by the european union executive on tuesday .

but it is his condemnation of abortion and same-sex marriage in the 227-page book " memory and identity " that has caused sharp criticism and controversy . the 84-year-old muses about the competing forces of good and evil in the world and history within the book , with special attention on the horrors committed by the nazis and by communist regimes . in one passage , after evoking the massacre of jews by the nazis in the holocaust , the pope writes that the democratically elected parliaments that replaced brutal authoritarian regimes in some countries continue to carry out murder on a huge scale by allowing abortion . " there is still , however , a legal extermination of human beings who have been conceived but not yet born , " the pope writes .
" and this time , we are talking about an extermination which has been allowed by nothing less than democratically elected parliaments . " germany 's jews criticize catholic view many critics have drawn a direct line between the pope 's reference to the holocaust and abortion , something jewish groups in germany immediately seized upon . " the catholic church does not understand or does not want to understand that there is an enormous difference between mass genocide and what women do to their own bodies , " paul spiegel , the president of the central council for jews in germany , said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cardinal joseph ratzinger of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith .
german cardinal joseph ratzinger , prefect of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith , the roman catholic church 's doctrinal watchdog , defended the pope and argued that misinterpretation had resulted in unwarranted criticism . german cardinal defends pontiff ratzinger , who has been touted as a possible successor to the ailing pontiff , told a new conference earlier this week that the pope " was not trying to put the holocaust and abortion on the same plane . "
it was the pope 's intention , he added , to show the pervasiveness of evil , " even in liberal political systems . " the book further echoes similar remarks made by the cardinal of cologne , joachim meisner , who declared in a sermon in january : " first there was herod , who ordered the children of bethlehem to be killed , then there was hitler and stalin among others , and today unborn children are being killed in their millions .

"
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. president george w. bush , left , listens to russian president vladimir putin during their meeting in the castle in bratislava , slovakia .
the two leaders said they had instructed their trade ministers to accelerate bilateral wto negotiations .
" we will work to identify areas for progress in our bilateral negotiations that will give momentum to russia 's accession to the wto , " they said .
they also agreed to enhance their joint efforts to counter the threat of nuclear terrorism by safeguarding atomic facilities and preparing emergency response capabilities .
the two sides said they agreed that security at nuclear facilities needs to be " constantly enhanced " to thwart terrorists .
the accord between washington and moscow came days after a us intelligence report said theft of radioactive materials from russian nuclear facilities " has occurred . "
missile accord bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovakian riot police equipment hangs on a security fence underneath the bratislava castle , in bratislava the tightly guarded meeting , at bratislava castle , in slovakia , opened with tensions over autocratic reforms in russia and moscow 's nuclear cooperation with iran topping the agenda .
but even before bush and putin crossed the threshold of the castle for their meeting , the two sides announced a deal on curbing the spread of shoulder-fired missiles that terrorists could use to shoot down airplanes .
the world leaders seemed to be trying to inject fresh warmth to their once excellent personal relationship , which has cooled since the iraq war and led to concerns that the former cold war foes may again be turning into rivals .
ahead of their talks , which were due to last at least 90 minutes , bush gave his strongest endorsement yet of european efforts to convince iran not to develop nuclear weapons and said he hoped for a peaceful end to the dispute .
" hopefully we 'll be able to reach a diplomatic solution to this effort .
we 're more likely to do so when we 're all on the same page , " said bush , who in the past has stressed that he can not rule out using force against tehran .
disagreements growing vocal bildunterschrift : view of the bratislava castle where thursday 's summit between u.s. president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin takes place .
bush 's talk with putin was their first in person since an asia-pacific summit in chile last november , when the us leader privately questioned his counterpart on moves that were widely seen as setting back democracy in russia .
their disagreements , muted over the past three years by the war on terrorism , have grown more vocal since bush placed a renewed emphasis in his second term on promoting democracy and confronting iran and syria .
bush began his day by meeting with slovakia 's president ivan gasparovic and prime minister mikulas dzurinda , before making an emotionally charged speech to thousands of cheering slovak citizens in a town square .
bush vowed to stand with slovakia 's young democracy and hailed what he called a " purple revolution " in iraq , where ink of that color was used to mark those who voted in january 30 elections .
pressure over iran expected he likened that vote to the velvet revolution that broke the hold of communism here nearly 16 years ago , saying : " to the iraqi people , this is their 1989 , and they will always remember who stood with them in their quest for freedom . "
bush also predicted thursday that former soviet republics moldova and belarus would embrace democracy , and saluted nato 's eastward expansion - all sources of concern in moscow .
bush was expected to press putin on iran , which washington accuses of trying to acquire nuclear weapons , and on syria , which washington insists must withdraw all of its troops and " secret services " from lebanon .
putin recently agreed to sell missile systems to syria , while declaring there is " no evidence " that iran is seeking an atomic bomb and has stepped up russian cooperation with tehran on nuclear technology . afp / dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush prepares to lock horns with putin president bush meets with his russian counterpart vladimir putin in bratislava on thursday armed with a warning that moscow must renew its commitment to democracy and advocating a hard line on iran .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a protestor carries a banner representing the u.s. flag with bombs in the place of stars , in mainz .
" mr. bush , you are a liar ! " said maria mies , who was protesting with the group attac , which has long been active in protesting us involvement in iraq .
she noted that the basis for the war , saddam hussein 's supposed weapons of mass destruction , were never found .
kept at a distance there were divergent reports about the number of protesters who turned out in the end .
the organizers of the rallies , an alliance of pacifist groups under the motto " not welcome , mr bush , " said they were expecting 10,000 people to attend , but estimates ranged between 4,000 and 12,000 .
what is certain is that the march , which remained peaceful , took place in freezing temperatures and the protesters were kept well away from the visiting us president .
the rally never got within a kilometer -lrb- half mile -rrb- of bush , who is on his first german visit since the 2003 iraq war .
the war was extremely unpopular in germany .
colorful slogans " i 'm disgusted by the war in iraq bush started that has cost thousands of civilian lives , " thomas odenweller , a 49-year-old computer technician told reuters .
" now he 's trying to normalize relations with europe .
it must be stopped . "
ignoring snow and freezing temperatures , the demonstrators held banners chastising bush in english with slogans such as : " you can bomb the world to pieces but not into peace . "
many had pre-printed posters reading : " bush , no. 1 terrorist " .
german police confiscated one poster that read : " we had our hitler , now you have yours . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rally against the visit of u.s. president bush up to and during bush 's visit , a force of 10,000 police officers staged one of the biggest postwar security operations in germany .
frogmen searched the rhine river for explosives , 1,300 manhole covers were welded shut and thousands of residents were displaced .
for bush 's eight-hour stay there was also a strict ban on air traffic within a 60-kilometer radius of mainz , barges on the river were halted and motorways in the region closed .
factories , businesses and schools were shut .
bush 's visit contrasted with that of his father to mainz in 1989 when large crowds cheered bush senior for his calls for the berlin wall to be torn down .
other us presidents have also been given a hero 's welcome in germany .
" when john f. kennedy came to germany he drove through cheering crowds , " mark reichelt , 20 , a student , told reuters .
" now bush is here and will drive through empty streets .

" there is still , however , a legal extermination of human beings who have been conceived but not yet born , " the pope writes .
" and this time , we are talking about an extermination which has been allowed by nothing less than democratically elected parliaments . " germany 's jews criticize catholic view many critics have drawn a direct line between the pope 's reference to the holocaust and abortion , something jewish groups in germany immediately seized upon .

"
meisner later expressed regret for his comparison . in other areas of the pontiff 's book , the pope discusses the fear within the vatican that rampant relativism and secularism are causing the decay of christian values in europe and beyond .
he uses the debate on same-sex marriages as an example . same-sex marriages part of " new evil " # bhe ponders whether the european parliament has been put under pressure to legalize same-sex marriage as " part of a new ideology of evil , perhaps more insidious and hidden , which attempts to pit human rights against the family and against man . " the book , based on conversations the pope had in polish with two friends , the philosopher krzysztof michalski and the late father jozef tischner , at the papal summer residence near rome in 1993 , also says terrorist networks represent " a constant threat to the life of millions of innocents , " and specifically mentions the sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.02.2005 approval of eu constitution may take time großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder , left , aided the spanish vote but does n't want one at home joschka fischer has called on lawmakers to quickly ratify the european union constitution , in order to set an example for other eu countries .
but some lawmakers lamented the lack of a popular referendum . the german parliament has begun the legislative process leading towards ratification of the eu constitution - amid unusual harmony among politicians of all stripes .
for the most part , german lawmakers have praised the constitution , calling it a milestone on the way to a stronger and more integrated european union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baden-württemberg premier erwin teufel erwin teufel -lrb- photo -rrb- , the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- state premier of baden-württemberg and a member of the eu convention that worked out the document last year , recalled the old divisions and wars in europe which preceded the current climate of peace and unity on the continent .
eu is bigger - and more effective the constitution will give europe " a new shape and a future , " teufel said .
" europe won ’ t grow stronger when it deals with thousands of issues .
europe will only become stronger when it deals with the right issues .
and the constitution guarantees that it will do so . "
german foreign minister joschka fischer , one of the staunchest advocates of the constitution , argued that an enlarged european union is an effective political union , not a bureaucratic behemoth .
" the european union with 15 members hasn ’ t achieved in three summits what the enlarged eu of 25 members managed in only six months and two summits , " fischer said .
" this goes to show that accusations a larger europe is unmanageable are wrong .
the constitutional process has proved the european union is working . "
fischer also said he was convinced that the new constitution would overcome the widespread lack of interest about europe among its populations , and enhance their willingness to participate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. werner hoyer but werner hoyer -lrb- photo -rrb- , a parliamentarian from the liberal free democratic party , retorted that one reason germans are not interested in europe is that they are not given a say in adopting the constitution .
" germans are skeptical , uninterested and misinformed about the constitution because the political establishment doesn ’ t see the need to campaign for the document in a referendum , " he said .
" if we would be forced to wage a public information campaign , all of us would have to work really hard .
parliament ’ s refusal to hold a referendum on the constitution is hugely lamentable and will not serve our common cause . "
numerous eu state have decided to put the constitution to a popular vote .
spanish voters approved the document on sunday , in the first in a series of referendums .
points of controversy in spite of the general , cross-party political consensus in germany on the constitution , there is also controversy on the rights of control by national parliaments to be included in the annex to the draft .
germany ’ s conservative opposition wants parliament to be allowed to reprimand brussels and be given the right to sue before the european court , for example , in cases of violation of the subsidiarity principle .
the subsidiary principle obliges the european commission to restrict itself to legislation whose objectives can not be better achieved by the member states themselves .
they also want a strong national say on the possible entry of turkey into the eu , a move which the cdu flatly rejects at the moment .
so in the end , the ratification process in germany may take a while .
and joschka fischer 's much hoped-for signal to europe - a speedy ratification - is unlikely to materialize . uwe hessler -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a rough road to ratification three countries have already said " yes " to the eu constitution .

but , statistics in berlin show that murders ostensibly meant to uphold the honor of the family are high among muslims . at the juvenile prison in the berlin suburb plötzensee , six of the current 529 inmates are serving time of six years and more for manslaughter in so-called " honor crimes . "
all come from the muslim world .
aged between 18 and 22 , one of them , an afghan national , was 16 when he helped relatives kill a widowed aunt who had refused to marry her brother-in-law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prison director marius fiedler said most of the murders are often carefully plotted in the family with the support of all , including women .
" usually the patriarch selects the youngest son to carry out the crime because he knows that judges in germany do n't usually give the maximum sentence of 10 years to a minor for manslaughter , " he said . fiedler admitted that getting the inmates , who undergo psychological therapy , to reform or change their attitudes is difficult .
" many come from rural areas in turkey or lebanon and just do n't know the concept of individualism , " he said .
" they do n't feel any regret for what they did though some even kill their favorite sister .
instead , they 're honored and feel like martyrs for having been chosen to carry out the crime . " ethics class the answer ? the realization that murder and archaic concepts of honor might actually find favor with some teenagers in the city , have caused alarm among berlin 's politicians and some muslim organizations . " it might be a minority , but even one person applauding the murder of hatin sürücü is absolutely unacceptable , " said kenan kolat , head of the turkish association in berlin and brandenburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : open day at a mosque in gelsenkirchen his organization has initiated a discussion with teachers , politicians , parents and imams and is planning to work with turkish newspapers and tv stations in berlin to kick-start a debate on democratic values among the turkish community . " we have to begin speaking about the role of women , about honor concepts , dignity , mutual respect and democratic values , " kolat said .
in addition to city politicians ' plans to introduce a mandatory ethics course in schools across berlin , kolat is pushing for an islamic studies course .
" the mainstream classroom has to be the place where one can get information about islam , not in ' islamic institutes ' who have the theological upper hand in the city , " he said . some , however , are skeptical of such flash-in-the-pan plans .
" every time there 's a controversial incident , politicians routinely come up with ' ethics class ' as a panacea , " said school director wagner .

the murder of a turkish woman and the applauding of the crime by some students have left berlin shaken and officials pushing for ethics class .
but how deep does the concept of honor run among some immigrant communities ? on a cold afternoon this week , hatin sürücü gazed gravely from a large poster behind a bus stop lined with flowers , cards and candles . to the people who came to this bleak part of berlin 's tempelhof district for tuesday 's solemn vigil - called not by the city 's muslim community but a gay and lesbian organization - the image of the young woman in a headscarf , a baby in her arms , was familiar from newspapers and television .
a few notes at the memorial read , " hope you get a better deal in your next life , " and " live a life on your own terms . " " it 's a scandal , " said ali k , 33 .
" all muslims in berlin should take to the streets to protest . "
yasemin , 22 , said , " it 's horrific .
all hatin was doing was leading her life the way she wanted . " but it was a choice she paid for with her life .
on feb .
7 , 23-year-old hatin sürücü was gunned down at the aforementioned bus stop .
she died on the spot .
shortly afterwards , three of her brothers - who reportedly had long been threatening her - were arrested .
investigators suspect it was a so-called " honor killing , " given the fact that sürücü 's ultra-conservative turkish-kurdish family strongly disapproved of her modern and " un-islamic " life . sürücü grew up in berlin and was married off at 16 to a cousin in istanbul .
after a few years , she returned to the german capital with her young son , moved into a home for single mothers , completed school and began to train as an electrician .
she stopped wearing a headscarf and was said to be outgoing and vivacious . " she lived like a german " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish women in a mosque in berlin 's kreuzberg district though not the first of its kind , the brazen shooting has sent shockwaves through berlin , home to a large foreign community and which for years has fretted over steady ghetto-building in districts dominated by turkish and arab immigrants .
while the incident has reopened debate on the integration of immigrants and the compatibility of islamic values with western ones , it ’ s the reaction of a small group of turkish students to the murder that has rattled the german capital . days after hatin sürücü was killed , some male students of turkish origin at a high school near the scene of the crime reportedly downplayed the act .
during a class discussion on the murder , one said , " she -lrb- hatin sürücü -rrb- only had herself to blame , " while another remarked " she deserved what she got - the whore lived like a german . "
the school 's director promptly dashed off a letter to parents and students , castigating the students and warning that the school didn ’ t tolerate incitement against freedom . " her lifestyle did n't fit " the comments have sparked outrage and left many asking if it was just a one-off or whether such thinking is in fact not entirely uncommon among sections of the muslim community in the city . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to some , it is n't .
" there is n't a single school with a high foreign population where teachers have n't faced this kind of thing , where individual students sometimes regard murder as a just sentence , " said heinz wagner , head of school and education policy at the vbe teachers trade union and a school director himself .
referring to the controversial remarks on sürücü 's murder , he said , " the very fact that they decided to provoke with something like that tells you that they 're getting their ideas from somewhere . " at berlin 's turkish-dominated neighborhood near kottbusser tor in the kreuzberg district , 17-year-old erkan , a high school student of turkish origin , was divided about the issue .

but , statistics in berlin show that murders ostensibly meant to uphold the honor of the family are high among muslims . at the juvenile prison in the berlin suburb plötzensee , six of the current 529 inmates are serving time of six years and more for manslaughter in so-called " honor crimes . "
all come from the muslim world .
aged between 18 and 22 , one of them , an afghan national , was 16 when he helped relatives kill a widowed aunt who had refused to marry her brother-in-law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prison director marius fiedler said most of the murders are often carefully plotted in the family with the support of all , including women .
" usually the patriarch selects the youngest son to carry out the crime because he knows that judges in germany do n't usually give the maximum sentence of 10 years to a minor for manslaughter , " he said . fiedler admitted that getting the inmates , who undergo psychological therapy , to reform or change their attitudes is difficult .
" many come from rural areas in turkey or lebanon and just do n't know the concept of individualism , " he said .
" they do n't feel any regret for what they did though some even kill their favorite sister .
instead , they 're honored and feel like martyrs for having been chosen to carry out the crime . " ethics class the answer ? the realization that murder and archaic concepts of honor might actually find favor with some teenagers in the city , have caused alarm among berlin 's politicians and some muslim organizations . " it might be a minority , but even one person applauding the murder of hatin sürücü is absolutely unacceptable , " said kenan kolat , head of the turkish association in berlin and brandenburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : open day at a mosque in gelsenkirchen his organization has initiated a discussion with teachers , politicians , parents and imams and is planning to work with turkish newspapers and tv stations in berlin to kick-start a debate on democratic values among the turkish community . " we have to begin speaking about the role of women , about honor concepts , dignity , mutual respect and democratic values , " kolat said .
in addition to city politicians ' plans to introduce a mandatory ethics course in schools across berlin , kolat is pushing for an islamic studies course .
" the mainstream classroom has to be the place where one can get information about islam , not in ' islamic institutes ' who have the theological upper hand in the city , " he said . some , however , are skeptical of such flash-in-the-pan plans .
" every time there 's a controversial incident , politicians routinely come up with ' ethics class ' as a panacea , " said school director wagner .
" but the school ca n't be the only place for learning democratic values .

for the most part , german lawmakers have praised the constitution , calling it a milestone on the way to a stronger and more integrated european union .

" europe won ’ t grow stronger when it deals with thousands of issues .
europe will only become stronger when it deals with the right issues .

german foreign minister joschka fischer , one of the staunchest advocates of the constitution , argued that an enlarged european union is an effective political union , not a bureaucratic behemoth .

germany ’ s conservative opposition wants parliament to be allowed to reprimand brussels and be given the right to sue before the european court , for example , in cases of violation of the subsidiarity principle .
the subsidiary principle obliges the european commission to restrict itself to legislation whose objectives can not be better achieved by the member states themselves .

but it is his condemnation of abortion and same-sex marriage in the 227-page book " memory and identity " that has caused sharp criticism and controversy . the 84-year-old muses about the competing forces of good and evil in the world and history within the book , with special attention on the horrors committed by the nazis and by communist regimes . in one passage , after evoking the massacre of jews by the nazis in the holocaust , the pope writes that the democratically elected parliaments that replaced brutal authoritarian regimes in some countries continue to carry out murder on a huge scale by allowing abortion . " there is still , however , a legal extermination of human beings who have been conceived but not yet born , " the pope writes .
" and this time , we are talking about an extermination which has been allowed by nothing less than democratically elected parliaments . " germany 's jews criticize catholic view many critics have drawn a direct line between the pope 's reference to the holocaust and abortion , something jewish groups in germany immediately seized upon . " the catholic church does not understand or does not want to understand that there is an enormous difference between mass genocide and what women do to their own bodies , " paul spiegel , the president of the central council for jews in germany , said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cardinal joseph ratzinger of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith .
german cardinal joseph ratzinger , prefect of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith , the roman catholic church 's doctrinal watchdog , defended the pope and argued that misinterpretation had resulted in unwarranted criticism . german cardinal defends pontiff ratzinger , who has been touted as a possible successor to the ailing pontiff , told a new conference earlier this week that the pope " was not trying to put the holocaust and abortion on the same plane . "
it was the pope 's intention , he added , to show the pervasiveness of evil , " even in liberal political systems . " the book further echoes similar remarks made by the cardinal of cologne , joachim meisner , who declared in a sermon in january : " first there was herod , who ordered the children of bethlehem to be killed , then there was hitler and stalin among others , and today unborn children are being killed in their millions . "
meisner later expressed regret for his comparison . in other areas of the pontiff 's book , the pope discusses the fear within the vatican that rampant relativism and secularism are causing the decay of christian values in europe and beyond .
he uses the debate on same-sex marriages as an example . same-sex marriages part of " new evil " # bhe ponders whether the european parliament has been put under pressure to legalize same-sex marriage as " part of a new ideology of evil , perhaps more insidious and hidden , which attempts to pit human rights against the family and against man . " the book , based on conversations the pope had in polish with two friends , the philosopher krzysztof michalski and the late father jozef tischner , at the papal summer residence near rome in 1993 , also says terrorist networks represent " a constant threat to the life of millions of innocents , " and specifically mentions the sept .

"
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. president george w. bush , left , listens to russian president vladimir putin during their meeting in the castle in bratislava , slovakia .
the two leaders said they had instructed their trade ministers to accelerate bilateral wto negotiations .
" we will work to identify areas for progress in our bilateral negotiations that will give momentum to russia 's accession to the wto , " they said .
they also agreed to enhance their joint efforts to counter the threat of nuclear terrorism by safeguarding atomic facilities and preparing emergency response capabilities .
the two sides said they agreed that security at nuclear facilities needs to be " constantly enhanced " to thwart terrorists .
the accord between washington and moscow came days after a us intelligence report said theft of radioactive materials from russian nuclear facilities " has occurred . "
missile accord bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovakian riot police equipment hangs on a security fence underneath the bratislava castle , in bratislava the tightly guarded meeting , at bratislava castle , in slovakia , opened with tensions over autocratic reforms in russia and moscow 's nuclear cooperation with iran topping the agenda .
but even before bush and putin crossed the threshold of the castle for their meeting , the two sides announced a deal on curbing the spread of shoulder-fired missiles that terrorists could use to shoot down airplanes .
the world leaders seemed to be trying to inject fresh warmth to their once excellent personal relationship , which has cooled since the iraq war and led to concerns that the former cold war foes may again be turning into rivals .
ahead of their talks , which were due to last at least 90 minutes , bush gave his strongest endorsement yet of european efforts to convince iran not to develop nuclear weapons and said he hoped for a peaceful end to the dispute .
" hopefully we 'll be able to reach a diplomatic solution to this effort .
we 're more likely to do so when we 're all on the same page , " said bush , who in the past has stressed that he can not rule out using force against tehran .
disagreements growing vocal bildunterschrift : view of the bratislava castle where thursday 's summit between u.s. president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin takes place .
bush 's talk with putin was their first in person since an asia-pacific summit in chile last november , when the us leader privately questioned his counterpart on moves that were widely seen as setting back democracy in russia .
their disagreements , muted over the past three years by the war on terrorism , have grown more vocal since bush placed a renewed emphasis in his second term on promoting democracy and confronting iran and syria .
bush began his day by meeting with slovakia 's president ivan gasparovic and prime minister mikulas dzurinda , before making an emotionally charged speech to thousands of cheering slovak citizens in a town square .
bush vowed to stand with slovakia 's young democracy and hailed what he called a " purple revolution " in iraq , where ink of that color was used to mark those who voted in january 30 elections .
pressure over iran expected he likened that vote to the velvet revolution that broke the hold of communism here nearly 16 years ago , saying : " to the iraqi people , this is their 1989 , and they will always remember who stood with them in their quest for freedom . "
bush also predicted thursday that former soviet republics moldova and belarus would embrace democracy , and saluted nato 's eastward expansion - all sources of concern in moscow .
bush was expected to press putin on iran , which washington accuses of trying to acquire nuclear weapons , and on syria , which washington insists must withdraw all of its troops and " secret services " from lebanon .
putin recently agreed to sell missile systems to syria , while declaring there is " no evidence " that iran is seeking an atomic bomb and has stepped up russian cooperation with tehran on nuclear technology . afp / dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush prepares to lock horns with putin president bush meets with his russian counterpart vladimir putin in bratislava on thursday armed with a warning that moscow must renew its commitment to democracy and advocating a hard line on iran .

but , statistics in berlin show that murders ostensibly meant to uphold the honor of the family are high among muslims . at the juvenile prison in the berlin suburb plötzensee , six of the current 529 inmates are serving time of six years and more for manslaughter in so-called " honor crimes . "
all come from the muslim world .
aged between 18 and 22 , one of them , an afghan national , was 16 when he helped relatives kill a widowed aunt who had refused to marry her brother-in-law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prison director marius fiedler said most of the murders are often carefully plotted in the family with the support of all , including women .
" usually the patriarch selects the youngest son to carry out the crime because he knows that judges in germany do n't usually give the maximum sentence of 10 years to a minor for manslaughter , " he said . fiedler admitted that getting the inmates , who undergo psychological therapy , to reform or change their attitudes is difficult .

instead , they 're honored and feel like martyrs for having been chosen to carry out the crime . " ethics class the answer ? the realization that murder and archaic concepts of honor might actually find favor with some teenagers in the city , have caused alarm among berlin 's politicians and some muslim organizations . " it might be a minority , but even one person applauding the murder of hatin sürücü is absolutely unacceptable , " said kenan kolat , head of the turkish association in berlin and brandenburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : open day at a mosque in gelsenkirchen his organization has initiated a discussion with teachers , politicians , parents and imams and is planning to work with turkish newspapers and tv stations in berlin to kick-start a debate on democratic values among the turkish community . " we have to begin speaking about the role of women , about honor concepts , dignity , mutual respect and democratic values , " kolat said .
in addition to city politicians ' plans to introduce a mandatory ethics course in schools across berlin , kolat is pushing for an islamic studies course .
" the mainstream classroom has to be the place where one can get information about islam , not in ' islamic institutes ' who have the theological upper hand in the city , " he said . some , however , are skeptical of such flash-in-the-pan plans .
" every time there 's a controversial incident , politicians routinely come up with ' ethics class ' as a panacea , " said school director wagner .

the highly populated country is one of the most attractive markets in asia behind china - a fact not lost on german airport operator fraport . in september 2003 , india 's government decided to sell 74 percent of india 's two major airports - delhi and mumbai .
now the government is looking for private companies to invest in the airports ' expansion .
as specialists estimate that the number of airline passengers is going to rise by 16 percent each year until 2010 , the investment in these airports promises a stake in a lucrative growth market . the frankfurt airport operating company fraport has been quick to realize this and has made its intentions towards india clear .
frank thiesen , assistant manager of the global investment and management division at fraport , has been busy preparing the division for the participation in one of the indian airports for the past one and a half years .
the process has been a long one for thiesen and his team .
firstly , partner companies with whom fraport sought to form a consortium with had to be selected .
at the same time the process of rapprochement to the indian government was underway .
fraport is planning to invest a total of € 30 to € 50 million -lrb- $ 40 to $ 66 million -rrb- for a stake of about 10 percent in one of the two airports .
" if we are going to be awarded the contract , we are going to first revise the airport 's internal company processes , " thiesen explained .
for this purpose , fraport personnel have to be sent to india , training programs have to be set up , and the infrastructure needs to be improved .
tough competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt international airport , operated by fraport .
about 10 more applicants are competing for the stake , among them consortia of the airports of paris , singapore , and hong kong .
the incentive is strong as the indian government 's liberalization strategy created new conditions for civil aviation policy .
since august 2003 , low-fare airlines have been given access to india 's domestic market .
more and more private airlines are coming to existence .
two of them , jet airways and air sahara , recently received permission to start service to international destinations .
with more than one billion people and an economic growth of more than eight percent , india is regarded as the most important asian market for the future next to china .
up to now , too much regulation of the aviation market , a thick jungle of bureaucracy and the protection of inefficient , run-down state airlines air india and indian airlines prevented private companies from raising the much invoked potential of the market .
private airlines contend that liberalizing of aviation policies is pointless if infrastructure is not massively extended at the same time .
metropolitan airports suffered from extreme overload , they say .
" if new airlines are to enter the market without infrastructure keeping up , the industry is headed for a disaster , " wolfgang prock-schauer , chief executive of the biggest private airline jet airways , warned .
the indian government has acknowledged this need and intends to invest a two-digit euro million amount into the extension of streets , railway , sea- and airports over the coming years .
a previous investment project failed a few years ago , fraport 's investment in the airport extension at the philippine capital manila was not successful .
europe 's second biggest airport company had to take the blow of losing € 300 million .
ever since , shareholders and analysts have kept a critical eye on fraport 's international activities .
" we learned from the experience , " fraport manager thiesen explains .
" nowadays we concentrate on smaller , specific management tasks and try to be on the safe side as far as possible . "
therefore , the frankfurt company prefers holding several small stakes over a few big ones .
this way , they keep the risk of a great loss smaller .
if fraport will get the chance for participation in india is going be decided in the summer .
then , india 's government will pick which applicant is going to be awarded the contract . ana lehmann -lrb- bm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu favors aviation tax to fund african aid a proposal put forward by germany and france to tax commercial aviation fuel to raise funds for development in africa was endorsed by the european union executive on tuesday .

but it is his condemnation of abortion and same-sex marriage in the 227-page book " memory and identity " that has caused sharp criticism and controversy . the 84-year-old muses about the competing forces of good and evil in the world and history within the book , with special attention on the horrors committed by the nazis and by communist regimes . in one passage , after evoking the massacre of jews by the nazis in the holocaust , the pope writes that the democratically elected parliaments that replaced brutal authoritarian regimes in some countries continue to carry out murder on a huge scale by allowing abortion . " there is still , however , a legal extermination of human beings who have been conceived but not yet born , " the pope writes .
" and this time , we are talking about an extermination which has been allowed by nothing less than democratically elected parliaments . " germany 's jews criticize catholic view many critics have drawn a direct line between the pope 's reference to the holocaust and abortion , something jewish groups in germany immediately seized upon . " the catholic church does not understand or does not want to understand that there is an enormous difference between mass genocide and what women do to their own bodies , " paul spiegel , the president of the central council for jews in germany , said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cardinal joseph ratzinger of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith .
german cardinal joseph ratzinger , prefect of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith , the roman catholic church 's doctrinal watchdog , defended the pope and argued that misinterpretation had resulted in unwarranted criticism . german cardinal defends pontiff ratzinger , who has been touted as a possible successor to the ailing pontiff , told a new conference earlier this week that the pope " was not trying to put the holocaust and abortion on the same plane . "
it was the pope 's intention , he added , to show the pervasiveness of evil , " even in liberal political systems . " the book further echoes similar remarks made by the cardinal of cologne , joachim meisner , who declared in a sermon in january : " first there was herod , who ordered the children of bethlehem to be killed , then there was hitler and stalin among others , and today unborn children are being killed in their millions . "
meisner later expressed regret for his comparison . in other areas of the pontiff 's book , the pope discusses the fear within the vatican that rampant relativism and secularism are causing the decay of christian values in europe and beyond .
he uses the debate on same-sex marriages as an example . same-sex marriages part of " new evil " # bhe ponders whether the european parliament has been put under pressure to legalize same-sex marriage as " part of a new ideology of evil , perhaps more insidious and hidden , which attempts to pit human rights against the family and against man . " the book , based on conversations the pope had in polish with two friends , the philosopher krzysztof michalski and the late father jozef tischner , at the papal summer residence near rome in 1993 , also says terrorist networks represent " a constant threat to the life of millions of innocents , " and specifically mentions the sept .

but , statistics in berlin show that murders ostensibly meant to uphold the honor of the family are high among muslims . at the juvenile prison in the berlin suburb plötzensee , six of the current 529 inmates are serving time of six years and more for manslaughter in so-called " honor crimes . "
all come from the muslim world .
aged between 18 and 22 , one of them , an afghan national , was 16 when he helped relatives kill a widowed aunt who had refused to marry her brother-in-law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prison director marius fiedler said most of the murders are often carefully plotted in the family with the support of all , including women .
" usually the patriarch selects the youngest son to carry out the crime because he knows that judges in germany do n't usually give the maximum sentence of 10 years to a minor for manslaughter , " he said . fiedler admitted that getting the inmates , who undergo psychological therapy , to reform or change their attitudes is difficult .
" many come from rural areas in turkey or lebanon and just do n't know the concept of individualism , " he said .
" they do n't feel any regret for what they did though some even kill their favorite sister .
instead , they 're honored and feel like martyrs for having been chosen to carry out the crime . " ethics class the answer ? the realization that murder and archaic concepts of honor might actually find favor with some teenagers in the city , have caused alarm among berlin 's politicians and some muslim organizations . " it might be a minority , but even one person applauding the murder of hatin sürücü is absolutely unacceptable , " said kenan kolat , head of the turkish association in berlin and brandenburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : open day at a mosque in gelsenkirchen his organization has initiated a discussion with teachers , politicians , parents and imams and is planning to work with turkish newspapers and tv stations in berlin to kick-start a debate on democratic values among the turkish community . " we have to begin speaking about the role of women , about honor concepts , dignity , mutual respect and democratic values , " kolat said .
in addition to city politicians ' plans to introduce a mandatory ethics course in schools across berlin , kolat is pushing for an islamic studies course .
" the mainstream classroom has to be the place where one can get information about islam , not in ' islamic institutes ' who have the theological upper hand in the city , " he said . some , however , are skeptical of such flash-in-the-pan plans .
" every time there 's a controversial incident , politicians routinely come up with ' ethics class ' as a panacea , " said school director wagner .
" but the school ca n't be the only place for learning democratic values .

they marched through the eerily empty downtown .
at the very least , their banners and posters - for example " bush go home , " " war monger , " and " no. 1 terrorist " - proclaimed their dislike and distrust of the u.s. president .
in general , the protesters ' complaints were about bush 's policies in iraq and his refusal to sign the kyoto treaty to curb global warming .
and despite official comments from bush and chancellor schröder about their disagreements being past , the demonstrators in mainz seemed doubtful about any possible rapprochement between the us and german governments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a protestor carries a banner representing the u.s. flag with bombs in the place of stars , in mainz .
" mr. bush , you are a liar ! " said maria mies , who was protesting with the group attac , which has long been active in protesting us involvement in iraq .
she noted that the basis for the war , saddam hussein 's supposed weapons of mass destruction , were never found .
kept at a distance there were divergent reports about the number of protesters who turned out in the end .
the organizers of the rallies , an alliance of pacifist groups under the motto " not welcome , mr bush , " said they were expecting 10,000 people to attend , but estimates ranged between 4,000 and 12,000 .
what is certain is that the march , which remained peaceful , took place in freezing temperatures and the protesters were kept well away from the visiting us president .
the rally never got within a kilometer -lrb- half mile -rrb- of bush , who is on his first german visit since the 2003 iraq war .
the war was extremely unpopular in germany .
colorful slogans " i 'm disgusted by the war in iraq bush started that has cost thousands of civilian lives , " thomas odenweller , a 49-year-old computer technician told reuters .
" now he 's trying to normalize relations with europe .
it must be stopped . "
ignoring snow and freezing temperatures , the demonstrators held banners chastising bush in english with slogans such as : " you can bomb the world to pieces but not into peace . "
many had pre-printed posters reading : " bush , no. 1 terrorist " .
german police confiscated one poster that read : " we had our hitler , now you have yours . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rally against the visit of u.s. president bush up to and during bush 's visit , a force of 10,000 police officers staged one of the biggest postwar security operations in germany .
frogmen searched the rhine river for explosives , 1,300 manhole covers were welded shut and thousands of residents were displaced .
for bush 's eight-hour stay there was also a strict ban on air traffic within a 60-kilometer radius of mainz , barges on the river were halted and motorways in the region closed .
factories , businesses and schools were shut .
bush 's visit contrasted with that of his father to mainz in 1989 when large crowds cheered bush senior for his calls for the berlin wall to be torn down .
other us presidents have also been given a hero 's welcome in germany .

the highly populated country is one of the most attractive markets in asia behind china - a fact not lost on german airport operator fraport . in september 2003 , india 's government decided to sell 74 percent of india 's two major airports - delhi and mumbai .
now the government is looking for private companies to invest in the airports ' expansion .
as specialists estimate that the number of airline passengers is going to rise by 16 percent each year until 2010 , the investment in these airports promises a stake in a lucrative growth market . the frankfurt airport operating company fraport has been quick to realize this and has made its intentions towards india clear .
frank thiesen , assistant manager of the global investment and management division at fraport , has been busy preparing the division for the participation in one of the indian airports for the past one and a half years .
the process has been a long one for thiesen and his team .
firstly , partner companies with whom fraport sought to form a consortium with had to be selected .
at the same time the process of rapprochement to the indian government was underway .
fraport is planning to invest a total of € 30 to € 50 million -lrb- $ 40 to $ 66 million -rrb- for a stake of about 10 percent in one of the two airports .
" if we are going to be awarded the contract , we are going to first revise the airport 's internal company processes , " thiesen explained .
for this purpose , fraport personnel have to be sent to india , training programs have to be set up , and the infrastructure needs to be improved .
tough competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt international airport , operated by fraport .
about 10 more applicants are competing for the stake , among them consortia of the airports of paris , singapore , and hong kong .
the incentive is strong as the indian government 's liberalization strategy created new conditions for civil aviation policy .
since august 2003 , low-fare airlines have been given access to india 's domestic market .
more and more private airlines are coming to existence .
two of them , jet airways and air sahara , recently received permission to start service to international destinations .
with more than one billion people and an economic growth of more than eight percent , india is regarded as the most important asian market for the future next to china .
up to now , too much regulation of the aviation market , a thick jungle of bureaucracy and the protection of inefficient , run-down state airlines air india and indian airlines prevented private companies from raising the much invoked potential of the market .
private airlines contend that liberalizing of aviation policies is pointless if infrastructure is not massively extended at the same time .
metropolitan airports suffered from extreme overload , they say .
" if new airlines are to enter the market without infrastructure keeping up , the industry is headed for a disaster , " wolfgang prock-schauer , chief executive of the biggest private airline jet airways , warned .
the indian government has acknowledged this need and intends to invest a two-digit euro million amount into the extension of streets , railway , sea- and airports over the coming years .
a previous investment project failed a few years ago , fraport 's investment in the airport extension at the philippine capital manila was not successful .
europe 's second biggest airport company had to take the blow of losing € 300 million .
ever since , shareholders and analysts have kept a critical eye on fraport 's international activities .
" we learned from the experience , " fraport manager thiesen explains .
" nowadays we concentrate on smaller , specific management tasks and try to be on the safe side as far as possible . "
therefore , the frankfurt company prefers holding several small stakes over a few big ones .
this way , they keep the risk of a great loss smaller .
if fraport will get the chance for participation in india is going be decided in the summer .
then , india 's government will pick which applicant is going to be awarded the contract . ana lehmann -lrb- bm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu favors aviation tax to fund african aid a proposal put forward by germany and france to tax commercial aviation fuel to raise funds for development in africa was endorsed by the european union executive on tuesday .

but it is his condemnation of abortion and same-sex marriage in the 227-page book " memory and identity " that has caused sharp criticism and controversy . the 84-year-old muses about the competing forces of good and evil in the world and history within the book , with special attention on the horrors committed by the nazis and by communist regimes . in one passage , after evoking the massacre of jews by the nazis in the holocaust , the pope writes that the democratically elected parliaments that replaced brutal authoritarian regimes in some countries continue to carry out murder on a huge scale by allowing abortion . " there is still , however , a legal extermination of human beings who have been conceived but not yet born , " the pope writes .
" and this time , we are talking about an extermination which has been allowed by nothing less than democratically elected parliaments . " germany 's jews criticize catholic view many critics have drawn a direct line between the pope 's reference to the holocaust and abortion , something jewish groups in germany immediately seized upon . " the catholic church does not understand or does not want to understand that there is an enormous difference between mass genocide and what women do to their own bodies , " paul spiegel , the president of the central council for jews in germany , said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cardinal joseph ratzinger of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith .
german cardinal joseph ratzinger , prefect of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith , the roman catholic church 's doctrinal watchdog , defended the pope and argued that misinterpretation had resulted in unwarranted criticism . german cardinal defends pontiff ratzinger , who has been touted as a possible successor to the ailing pontiff , told a new conference earlier this week that the pope " was not trying to put the holocaust and abortion on the same plane . "
it was the pope 's intention , he added , to show the pervasiveness of evil , " even in liberal political systems . " the book further echoes similar remarks made by the cardinal of cologne , joachim meisner , who declared in a sermon in january : " first there was herod , who ordered the children of bethlehem to be killed , then there was hitler and stalin among others , and today unborn children are being killed in their millions . "
meisner later expressed regret for his comparison . in other areas of the pontiff 's book , the pope discusses the fear within the vatican that rampant relativism and secularism are causing the decay of christian values in europe and beyond .
he uses the debate on same-sex marriages as an example . same-sex marriages part of " new evil " # bhe ponders whether the european parliament has been put under pressure to legalize same-sex marriage as " part of a new ideology of evil , perhaps more insidious and hidden , which attempts to pit human rights against the family and against man . " the book , based on conversations the pope had in polish with two friends , the philosopher krzysztof michalski and the late father jozef tischner , at the papal summer residence near rome in 1993 , also says terrorist networks represent " a constant threat to the life of millions of innocents , " and specifically mentions the sept .

but it is his condemnation of abortion and same-sex marriage in the 227-page book " memory and identity " that has caused sharp criticism and controversy . the 84-year-old muses about the competing forces of good and evil in the world and history within the book , with special attention on the horrors committed by the nazis and by communist regimes . in one passage , after evoking the massacre of jews by the nazis in the holocaust , the pope writes that the democratically elected parliaments that replaced brutal authoritarian regimes in some countries continue to carry out murder on a huge scale by allowing abortion . " there is still , however , a legal extermination of human beings who have been conceived but not yet born , " the pope writes .
" and this time , we are talking about an extermination which has been allowed by nothing less than democratically elected parliaments . " germany 's jews criticize catholic view many critics have drawn a direct line between the pope 's reference to the holocaust and abortion , something jewish groups in germany immediately seized upon . " the catholic church does not understand or does not want to understand that there is an enormous difference between mass genocide and what women do to their own bodies , " paul spiegel , the president of the central council for jews in germany , said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cardinal joseph ratzinger of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith .
german cardinal joseph ratzinger , prefect of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith , the roman catholic church 's doctrinal watchdog , defended the pope and argued that misinterpretation had resulted in unwarranted criticism . german cardinal defends pontiff ratzinger , who has been touted as a possible successor to the ailing pontiff , told a new conference earlier this week that the pope " was not trying to put the holocaust and abortion on the same plane . "
it was the pope 's intention , he added , to show the pervasiveness of evil , " even in liberal political systems . " the book further echoes similar remarks made by the cardinal of cologne , joachim meisner , who declared in a sermon in january : " first there was herod , who ordered the children of bethlehem to be killed , then there was hitler and stalin among others , and today unborn children are being killed in their millions . "
meisner later expressed regret for his comparison . in other areas of the pontiff 's book , the pope discusses the fear within the vatican that rampant relativism and secularism are causing the decay of christian values in europe and beyond .
he uses the debate on same-sex marriages as an example . same-sex marriages part of " new evil " # bhe ponders whether the european parliament has been put under pressure to legalize same-sex marriage as " part of a new ideology of evil , perhaps more insidious and hidden , which attempts to pit human rights against the family and against man . " the book , based on conversations the pope had in polish with two friends , the philosopher krzysztof michalski and the late father jozef tischner , at the papal summer residence near rome in 1993 , also says terrorist networks represent " a constant threat to the life of millions of innocents , " and specifically mentions the sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 24.02.2005 fraport wants stake in indian airport großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fraport staff could be packing their bags for india the aviation industry is regarded as an engine for growth in india .
the highly populated country is one of the most attractive markets in asia behind china - a fact not lost on german airport operator fraport . in september 2003 , india 's government decided to sell 74 percent of india 's two major airports - delhi and mumbai .
now the government is looking for private companies to invest in the airports ' expansion .
as specialists estimate that the number of airline passengers is going to rise by 16 percent each year until 2010 , the investment in these airports promises a stake in a lucrative growth market . the frankfurt airport operating company fraport has been quick to realize this and has made its intentions towards india clear .
frank thiesen , assistant manager of the global investment and management division at fraport , has been busy preparing the division for the participation in one of the indian airports for the past one and a half years .
the process has been a long one for thiesen and his team .
firstly , partner companies with whom fraport sought to form a consortium with had to be selected .
at the same time the process of rapprochement to the indian government was underway .
fraport is planning to invest a total of € 30 to € 50 million -lrb- $ 40 to $ 66 million -rrb- for a stake of about 10 percent in one of the two airports .
" if we are going to be awarded the contract , we are going to first revise the airport 's internal company processes , " thiesen explained .
for this purpose , fraport personnel have to be sent to india , training programs have to be set up , and the infrastructure needs to be improved .
tough competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt international airport , operated by fraport .
about 10 more applicants are competing for the stake , among them consortia of the airports of paris , singapore , and hong kong .
the incentive is strong as the indian government 's liberalization strategy created new conditions for civil aviation policy .
since august 2003 , low-fare airlines have been given access to india 's domestic market .
more and more private airlines are coming to existence .
two of them , jet airways and air sahara , recently received permission to start service to international destinations .
with more than one billion people and an economic growth of more than eight percent , india is regarded as the most important asian market for the future next to china .
up to now , too much regulation of the aviation market , a thick jungle of bureaucracy and the protection of inefficient , run-down state airlines air india and indian airlines prevented private companies from raising the much invoked potential of the market .
private airlines contend that liberalizing of aviation policies is pointless if infrastructure is not massively extended at the same time .
metropolitan airports suffered from extreme overload , they say .
" if new airlines are to enter the market without infrastructure keeping up , the industry is headed for a disaster , " wolfgang prock-schauer , chief executive of the biggest private airline jet airways , warned .
the indian government has acknowledged this need and intends to invest a two-digit euro million amount into the extension of streets , railway , sea- and airports over the coming years .
a previous investment project failed a few years ago , fraport 's investment in the airport extension at the philippine capital manila was not successful .
europe 's second biggest airport company had to take the blow of losing € 300 million .
ever since , shareholders and analysts have kept a critical eye on fraport 's international activities .
" we learned from the experience , " fraport manager thiesen explains .
" nowadays we concentrate on smaller , specific management tasks and try to be on the safe side as far as possible . "
therefore , the frankfurt company prefers holding several small stakes over a few big ones .
this way , they keep the risk of a great loss smaller .
if fraport will get the chance for participation in india is going be decided in the summer .
then , india 's government will pick which applicant is going to be awarded the contract . ana lehmann -lrb- bm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu favors aviation tax to fund african aid a proposal put forward by germany and france to tax commercial aviation fuel to raise funds for development in africa was endorsed by the european union executive on tuesday .

the highly populated country is one of the most attractive markets in asia behind china - a fact not lost on german airport operator fraport . in september 2003 , india 's government decided to sell 74 percent of india 's two major airports - delhi and mumbai .
now the government is looking for private companies to invest in the airports ' expansion .
as specialists estimate that the number of airline passengers is going to rise by 16 percent each year until 2010 , the investment in these airports promises a stake in a lucrative growth market . the frankfurt airport operating company fraport has been quick to realize this and has made its intentions towards india clear .
frank thiesen , assistant manager of the global investment and management division at fraport , has been busy preparing the division for the participation in one of the indian airports for the past one and a half years .
the process has been a long one for thiesen and his team .
firstly , partner companies with whom fraport sought to form a consortium with had to be selected .
at the same time the process of rapprochement to the indian government was underway .
fraport is planning to invest a total of € 30 to € 50 million -lrb- $ 40 to $ 66 million -rrb- for a stake of about 10 percent in one of the two airports .
" if we are going to be awarded the contract , we are going to first revise the airport 's internal company processes , " thiesen explained .
for this purpose , fraport personnel have to be sent to india , training programs have to be set up , and the infrastructure needs to be improved .
tough competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt international airport , operated by fraport .
about 10 more applicants are competing for the stake , among them consortia of the airports of paris , singapore , and hong kong .
the incentive is strong as the indian government 's liberalization strategy created new conditions for civil aviation policy .
since august 2003 , low-fare airlines have been given access to india 's domestic market .
more and more private airlines are coming to existence .
two of them , jet airways and air sahara , recently received permission to start service to international destinations .
with more than one billion people and an economic growth of more than eight percent , india is regarded as the most important asian market for the future next to china .
up to now , too much regulation of the aviation market , a thick jungle of bureaucracy and the protection of inefficient , run-down state airlines air india and indian airlines prevented private companies from raising the much invoked potential of the market .
private airlines contend that liberalizing of aviation policies is pointless if infrastructure is not massively extended at the same time .
metropolitan airports suffered from extreme overload , they say .
" if new airlines are to enter the market without infrastructure keeping up , the industry is headed for a disaster , " wolfgang prock-schauer , chief executive of the biggest private airline jet airways , warned .
the indian government has acknowledged this need and intends to invest a two-digit euro million amount into the extension of streets , railway , sea- and airports over the coming years .
a previous investment project failed a few years ago , fraport 's investment in the airport extension at the philippine capital manila was not successful .
europe 's second biggest airport company had to take the blow of losing € 300 million .
ever since , shareholders and analysts have kept a critical eye on fraport 's international activities .
" we learned from the experience , " fraport manager thiesen explains .
" nowadays we concentrate on smaller , specific management tasks and try to be on the safe side as far as possible . "
therefore , the frankfurt company prefers holding several small stakes over a few big ones .
this way , they keep the risk of a great loss smaller .
if fraport will get the chance for participation in india is going be decided in the summer .

but it is his condemnation of abortion and same-sex marriage in the 227-page book " memory and identity " that has caused sharp criticism and controversy . the 84-year-old muses about the competing forces of good and evil in the world and history within the book , with special attention on the horrors committed by the nazis and by communist regimes . in one passage , after evoking the massacre of jews by the nazis in the holocaust , the pope writes that the democratically elected parliaments that replaced brutal authoritarian regimes in some countries continue to carry out murder on a huge scale by allowing abortion .

it was the pope 's intention , he added , to show the pervasiveness of evil , " even in liberal political systems .

"
meisner later expressed regret for his comparison . in other areas of the pontiff 's book , the pope discusses the fear within the vatican that rampant relativism and secularism are causing the decay of christian values in europe and beyond .
he uses the debate on same-sex marriages as an example . same-sex marriages part of " new evil " # bhe ponders whether the european parliament has been put under pressure to legalize same-sex marriage as " part of a new ideology of evil , perhaps more insidious and hidden , which attempts to pit human rights against the family and against man .

he uses the debate on same-sex marriages as an example . same-sex marriages part of " new evil " # bhe ponders whether the european parliament has been put under pressure to legalize same-sex marriage as " part of a new ideology of evil , perhaps more insidious and hidden , which attempts to pit human rights against the family and against man .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 24.02.2005 fraport wants stake in indian airport großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fraport staff could be packing their bags for india the aviation industry is regarded as an engine for growth in india .
the highly populated country is one of the most attractive markets in asia behind china - a fact not lost on german airport operator fraport . in september 2003 , india 's government decided to sell 74 percent of india 's two major airports - delhi and mumbai .
now the government is looking for private companies to invest in the airports ' expansion .
as specialists estimate that the number of airline passengers is going to rise by 16 percent each year until 2010 , the investment in these airports promises a stake in a lucrative growth market . the frankfurt airport operating company fraport has been quick to realize this and has made its intentions towards india clear .
frank thiesen , assistant manager of the global investment and management division at fraport , has been busy preparing the division for the participation in one of the indian airports for the past one and a half years .
the process has been a long one for thiesen and his team .
firstly , partner companies with whom fraport sought to form a consortium with had to be selected .
at the same time the process of rapprochement to the indian government was underway .
fraport is planning to invest a total of € 30 to € 50 million -lrb- $ 40 to $ 66 million -rrb- for a stake of about 10 percent in one of the two airports .
" if we are going to be awarded the contract , we are going to first revise the airport 's internal company processes , " thiesen explained .
for this purpose , fraport personnel have to be sent to india , training programs have to be set up , and the infrastructure needs to be improved .
tough competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt international airport , operated by fraport .
about 10 more applicants are competing for the stake , among them consortia of the airports of paris , singapore , and hong kong .
the incentive is strong as the indian government 's liberalization strategy created new conditions for civil aviation policy .
since august 2003 , low-fare airlines have been given access to india 's domestic market .
more and more private airlines are coming to existence .
two of them , jet airways and air sahara , recently received permission to start service to international destinations .
with more than one billion people and an economic growth of more than eight percent , india is regarded as the most important asian market for the future next to china .
up to now , too much regulation of the aviation market , a thick jungle of bureaucracy and the protection of inefficient , run-down state airlines air india and indian airlines prevented private companies from raising the much invoked potential of the market .
private airlines contend that liberalizing of aviation policies is pointless if infrastructure is not massively extended at the same time .
metropolitan airports suffered from extreme overload , they say .
" if new airlines are to enter the market without infrastructure keeping up , the industry is headed for a disaster , " wolfgang prock-schauer , chief executive of the biggest private airline jet airways , warned .
the indian government has acknowledged this need and intends to invest a two-digit euro million amount into the extension of streets , railway , sea- and airports over the coming years .
a previous investment project failed a few years ago , fraport 's investment in the airport extension at the philippine capital manila was not successful .
europe 's second biggest airport company had to take the blow of losing € 300 million .
ever since , shareholders and analysts have kept a critical eye on fraport 's international activities .
" we learned from the experience , " fraport manager thiesen explains .
" nowadays we concentrate on smaller , specific management tasks and try to be on the safe side as far as possible . "
therefore , the frankfurt company prefers holding several small stakes over a few big ones .
this way , they keep the risk of a great loss smaller .
if fraport will get the chance for participation in india is going be decided in the summer .
then , india 's government will pick which applicant is going to be awarded the contract . ana lehmann -lrb- bm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu favors aviation tax to fund african aid a proposal put forward by germany and france to tax commercial aviation fuel to raise funds for development in africa was endorsed by the european union executive on tuesday .

the murder of a turkish woman and the applauding of the crime by some students have left berlin shaken and officials pushing for ethics class .
but how deep does the concept of honor run among some immigrant communities ? on a cold afternoon this week , hatin sürücü gazed gravely from a large poster behind a bus stop lined with flowers , cards and candles . to the people who came to this bleak part of berlin 's tempelhof district for tuesday 's solemn vigil - called not by the city 's muslim community but a gay and lesbian organization - the image of the young woman in a headscarf , a baby in her arms , was familiar from newspapers and television .
a few notes at the memorial read , " hope you get a better deal in your next life , " and " live a life on your own terms . " " it 's a scandal , " said ali k , 33 .
" all muslims in berlin should take to the streets to protest . "
yasemin , 22 , said , " it 's horrific .
all hatin was doing was leading her life the way she wanted . " but it was a choice she paid for with her life .
on feb .
7 , 23-year-old hatin sürücü was gunned down at the aforementioned bus stop .
she died on the spot .
shortly afterwards , three of her brothers - who reportedly had long been threatening her - were arrested .
investigators suspect it was a so-called " honor killing , " given the fact that sürücü 's ultra-conservative turkish-kurdish family strongly disapproved of her modern and " un-islamic " life . sürücü grew up in berlin and was married off at 16 to a cousin in istanbul .
after a few years , she returned to the german capital with her young son , moved into a home for single mothers , completed school and began to train as an electrician .
she stopped wearing a headscarf and was said to be outgoing and vivacious . " she lived like a german " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish women in a mosque in berlin 's kreuzberg district though not the first of its kind , the brazen shooting has sent shockwaves through berlin , home to a large foreign community and which for years has fretted over steady ghetto-building in districts dominated by turkish and arab immigrants .
while the incident has reopened debate on the integration of immigrants and the compatibility of islamic values with western ones , it ’ s the reaction of a small group of turkish students to the murder that has rattled the german capital . days after hatin sürücü was killed , some male students of turkish origin at a high school near the scene of the crime reportedly downplayed the act .
during a class discussion on the murder , one said , " she -lrb- hatin sürücü -rrb- only had herself to blame , " while another remarked " she deserved what she got - the whore lived like a german . "
the school 's director promptly dashed off a letter to parents and students , castigating the students and warning that the school didn ’ t tolerate incitement against freedom . " her lifestyle did n't fit " the comments have sparked outrage and left many asking if it was just a one-off or whether such thinking is in fact not entirely uncommon among sections of the muslim community in the city . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to some , it is n't .
" there is n't a single school with a high foreign population where teachers have n't faced this kind of thing , where individual students sometimes regard murder as a just sentence , " said heinz wagner , head of school and education policy at the vbe teachers trade union and a school director himself .
referring to the controversial remarks on sürücü 's murder , he said , " the very fact that they decided to provoke with something like that tells you that they 're getting their ideas from somewhere . " at berlin 's turkish-dominated neighborhood near kottbusser tor in the kreuzberg district , 17-year-old erkan , a high school student of turkish origin , was divided about the issue .
" i 'm not saying you should murder , but hatin 's lifestyle just did n't fit the way traditional muslims live , " he said . please click on the second page to continue reading the story 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a wife bound by shame in europe 's closed-off immigrant communities , hundreds of women are forced to marry against their will .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 24.02.2005 fraport wants stake in indian airport großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fraport staff could be packing their bags for india the aviation industry is regarded as an engine for growth in india .
the highly populated country is one of the most attractive markets in asia behind china - a fact not lost on german airport operator fraport . in september 2003 , india 's government decided to sell 74 percent of india 's two major airports - delhi and mumbai .
now the government is looking for private companies to invest in the airports ' expansion .
as specialists estimate that the number of airline passengers is going to rise by 16 percent each year until 2010 , the investment in these airports promises a stake in a lucrative growth market . the frankfurt airport operating company fraport has been quick to realize this and has made its intentions towards india clear .
frank thiesen , assistant manager of the global investment and management division at fraport , has been busy preparing the division for the participation in one of the indian airports for the past one and a half years .
the process has been a long one for thiesen and his team .
firstly , partner companies with whom fraport sought to form a consortium with had to be selected .
at the same time the process of rapprochement to the indian government was underway .
fraport is planning to invest a total of € 30 to € 50 million -lrb- $ 40 to $ 66 million -rrb- for a stake of about 10 percent in one of the two airports .
" if we are going to be awarded the contract , we are going to first revise the airport 's internal company processes , " thiesen explained .
for this purpose , fraport personnel have to be sent to india , training programs have to be set up , and the infrastructure needs to be improved .
tough competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt international airport , operated by fraport .
about 10 more applicants are competing for the stake , among them consortia of the airports of paris , singapore , and hong kong .
the incentive is strong as the indian government 's liberalization strategy created new conditions for civil aviation policy .
since august 2003 , low-fare airlines have been given access to india 's domestic market .
more and more private airlines are coming to existence .
two of them , jet airways and air sahara , recently received permission to start service to international destinations .
with more than one billion people and an economic growth of more than eight percent , india is regarded as the most important asian market for the future next to china .
up to now , too much regulation of the aviation market , a thick jungle of bureaucracy and the protection of inefficient , run-down state airlines air india and indian airlines prevented private companies from raising the much invoked potential of the market .
private airlines contend that liberalizing of aviation policies is pointless if infrastructure is not massively extended at the same time .
metropolitan airports suffered from extreme overload , they say .
" if new airlines are to enter the market without infrastructure keeping up , the industry is headed for a disaster , " wolfgang prock-schauer , chief executive of the biggest private airline jet airways , warned .
the indian government has acknowledged this need and intends to invest a two-digit euro million amount into the extension of streets , railway , sea- and airports over the coming years .
a previous investment project failed a few years ago , fraport 's investment in the airport extension at the philippine capital manila was not successful .
europe 's second biggest airport company had to take the blow of losing € 300 million .
ever since , shareholders and analysts have kept a critical eye on fraport 's international activities .
" we learned from the experience , " fraport manager thiesen explains .
" nowadays we concentrate on smaller , specific management tasks and try to be on the safe side as far as possible . "
therefore , the frankfurt company prefers holding several small stakes over a few big ones .
this way , they keep the risk of a great loss smaller .
if fraport will get the chance for participation in india is going be decided in the summer .
then , india 's government will pick which applicant is going to be awarded the contract . ana lehmann -lrb- bm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu favors aviation tax to fund african aid a proposal put forward by germany and france to tax commercial aviation fuel to raise funds for development in africa was endorsed by the european union executive on tuesday .

they marched through the eerily empty downtown .
at the very least , their banners and posters - for example " bush go home , " " war monger , " and " no. 1 terrorist " - proclaimed their dislike and distrust of the u.s. president .
in general , the protesters ' complaints were about bush 's policies in iraq and his refusal to sign the kyoto treaty to curb global warming .
and despite official comments from bush and chancellor schröder about their disagreements being past , the demonstrators in mainz seemed doubtful about any possible rapprochement between the us and german governments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a protestor carries a banner representing the u.s. flag with bombs in the place of stars , in mainz .
" mr. bush , you are a liar ! " said maria mies , who was protesting with the group attac , which has long been active in protesting us involvement in iraq .
she noted that the basis for the war , saddam hussein 's supposed weapons of mass destruction , were never found .
kept at a distance there were divergent reports about the number of protesters who turned out in the end .
the organizers of the rallies , an alliance of pacifist groups under the motto " not welcome , mr bush , " said they were expecting 10,000 people to attend , but estimates ranged between 4,000 and 12,000 .
what is certain is that the march , which remained peaceful , took place in freezing temperatures and the protesters were kept well away from the visiting us president .
the rally never got within a kilometer -lrb- half mile -rrb- of bush , who is on his first german visit since the 2003 iraq war .
the war was extremely unpopular in germany .
colorful slogans " i 'm disgusted by the war in iraq bush started that has cost thousands of civilian lives , " thomas odenweller , a 49-year-old computer technician told reuters .
" now he 's trying to normalize relations with europe .
it must be stopped . "
ignoring snow and freezing temperatures , the demonstrators held banners chastising bush in english with slogans such as : " you can bomb the world to pieces but not into peace . "
many had pre-printed posters reading : " bush , no. 1 terrorist " .
german police confiscated one poster that read : " we had our hitler , now you have yours . "

the federal administrative court in this eastern city upheld a complaint by the klosterbrauerei neuzelle demanding that the state of brandenburg recognize its product as beer after a 10-year campaign .
the " schwarzer abt " -lrb- black abbot -rrb- black beer has a hint of invert sugar syrup , using a recipe handed down by monks .
thus , it does not meet the purity standards for german beer established in 1516 , which limits the ingredients to malt , water , yeast and hops .
" it looks like beer , tastes like beer and has alcohol in it , " the brewer 's managing director helmut fritsche insisted , arguing for the right to have the beer designation .
the state agricultural ministry had withheld the label , a decision fritsche described as discrimination because foreign brewers that do not meet the purity standards may still call their products " beer . "
the court 's judges agreed but stipulated that neuzelle must inform consumers about the syrup additive on its labels . dw-world.de ' anti-aging ' beer is not beer beer lovers in germany wo n't be able to say cheers to ' anti-aging ' beer : officials in the eastern german state of brandenburg ruled that " anti-aging beer " does not pass the beer purity law and can not be marketed as beer .

but some lawmakers lamented the lack of a popular referendum . the german parliament has begun the legislative process leading towards ratification of the eu constitution - amid unusual harmony among politicians of all stripes .
for the most part , german lawmakers have praised the constitution , calling it a milestone on the way to a stronger and more integrated european union .

eu is bigger - and more effective the constitution will give europe " a new shape and a future , " teufel said .
" europe won ’ t grow stronger when it deals with thousands of issues .
europe will only become stronger when it deals with the right issues .
and the constitution guarantees that it will do so . "
german foreign minister joschka fischer , one of the staunchest advocates of the constitution , argued that an enlarged european union is an effective political union , not a bureaucratic behemoth .
" the european union with 15 members hasn ’ t achieved in three summits what the enlarged eu of 25 members managed in only six months and two summits , " fischer said .
" this goes to show that accusations a larger europe is unmanageable are wrong .
the constitutional process has proved the european union is working . "
fischer also said he was convinced that the new constitution would overcome the widespread lack of interest about europe among its populations , and enhance their willingness to participate .

" if we would be forced to wage a public information campaign , all of us would have to work really hard .
parliament ’ s refusal to hold a referendum on the constitution is hugely lamentable and will not serve our common cause . "

germany ’ s conservative opposition wants parliament to be allowed to reprimand brussels and be given the right to sue before the european court , for example , in cases of violation of the subsidiarity principle .
the subsidiary principle obliges the european commission to restrict itself to legislation whose objectives can not be better achieved by the member states themselves .
they also want a strong national say on the possible entry of turkey into the eu , a move which the cdu flatly rejects at the moment .

but some lawmakers lamented the lack of a popular referendum . the german parliament has begun the legislative process leading towards ratification of the eu constitution - amid unusual harmony among politicians of all stripes .
for the most part , german lawmakers have praised the constitution , calling it a milestone on the way to a stronger and more integrated european union .

eu is bigger - and more effective the constitution will give europe " a new shape and a future , " teufel said .
" europe won ’ t grow stronger when it deals with thousands of issues .
europe will only become stronger when it deals with the right issues .
and the constitution guarantees that it will do so . "
german foreign minister joschka fischer , one of the staunchest advocates of the constitution , argued that an enlarged european union is an effective political union , not a bureaucratic behemoth .
" the european union with 15 members hasn ’ t achieved in three summits what the enlarged eu of 25 members managed in only six months and two summits , " fischer said .
" this goes to show that accusations a larger europe is unmanageable are wrong .
the constitutional process has proved the european union is working . "
fischer also said he was convinced that the new constitution would overcome the widespread lack of interest about europe among its populations , and enhance their willingness to participate .

" germans are skeptical , uninterested and misinformed about the constitution because the political establishment doesn ’ t see the need to campaign for the document in a referendum , " he said .
" if we would be forced to wage a public information campaign , all of us would have to work really hard .
parliament ’ s refusal to hold a referendum on the constitution is hugely lamentable and will not serve our common cause . "
numerous eu state have decided to put the constitution to a popular vote .

germany ’ s conservative opposition wants parliament to be allowed to reprimand brussels and be given the right to sue before the european court , for example , in cases of violation of the subsidiarity principle .
the subsidiary principle obliges the european commission to restrict itself to legislation whose objectives can not be better achieved by the member states themselves .
they also want a strong national say on the possible entry of turkey into the eu , a move which the cdu flatly rejects at the moment .

"
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. president george w. bush , left , listens to russian president vladimir putin during their meeting in the castle in bratislava , slovakia .
the two leaders said they had instructed their trade ministers to accelerate bilateral wto negotiations .
" we will work to identify areas for progress in our bilateral negotiations that will give momentum to russia 's accession to the wto , " they said .
they also agreed to enhance their joint efforts to counter the threat of nuclear terrorism by safeguarding atomic facilities and preparing emergency response capabilities .
the two sides said they agreed that security at nuclear facilities needs to be " constantly enhanced " to thwart terrorists .
the accord between washington and moscow came days after a us intelligence report said theft of radioactive materials from russian nuclear facilities " has occurred . "
missile accord bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovakian riot police equipment hangs on a security fence underneath the bratislava castle , in bratislava the tightly guarded meeting , at bratislava castle , in slovakia , opened with tensions over autocratic reforms in russia and moscow 's nuclear cooperation with iran topping the agenda .
but even before bush and putin crossed the threshold of the castle for their meeting , the two sides announced a deal on curbing the spread of shoulder-fired missiles that terrorists could use to shoot down airplanes .
the world leaders seemed to be trying to inject fresh warmth to their once excellent personal relationship , which has cooled since the iraq war and led to concerns that the former cold war foes may again be turning into rivals .
ahead of their talks , which were due to last at least 90 minutes , bush gave his strongest endorsement yet of european efforts to convince iran not to develop nuclear weapons and said he hoped for a peaceful end to the dispute .
" hopefully we 'll be able to reach a diplomatic solution to this effort .
we 're more likely to do so when we 're all on the same page , " said bush , who in the past has stressed that he can not rule out using force against tehran .
disagreements growing vocal bildunterschrift : view of the bratislava castle where thursday 's summit between u.s. president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin takes place .
bush 's talk with putin was their first in person since an asia-pacific summit in chile last november , when the us leader privately questioned his counterpart on moves that were widely seen as setting back democracy in russia .
their disagreements , muted over the past three years by the war on terrorism , have grown more vocal since bush placed a renewed emphasis in his second term on promoting democracy and confronting iran and syria .
bush began his day by meeting with slovakia 's president ivan gasparovic and prime minister mikulas dzurinda , before making an emotionally charged speech to thousands of cheering slovak citizens in a town square .
bush vowed to stand with slovakia 's young democracy and hailed what he called a " purple revolution " in iraq , where ink of that color was used to mark those who voted in january 30 elections .
pressure over iran expected he likened that vote to the velvet revolution that broke the hold of communism here nearly 16 years ago , saying : " to the iraqi people , this is their 1989 , and they will always remember who stood with them in their quest for freedom . "
bush also predicted thursday that former soviet republics moldova and belarus would embrace democracy , and saluted nato 's eastward expansion - all sources of concern in moscow .
bush was expected to press putin on iran , which washington accuses of trying to acquire nuclear weapons , and on syria , which washington insists must withdraw all of its troops and " secret services " from lebanon .
putin recently agreed to sell missile systems to syria , while declaring there is " no evidence " that iran is seeking an atomic bomb and has stepped up russian cooperation with tehran on nuclear technology . afp / dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush prepares to lock horns with putin president bush meets with his russian counterpart vladimir putin in bratislava on thursday armed with a warning that moscow must renew its commitment to democracy and advocating a hard line on iran .

they also agreed to enhance their joint efforts to counter the threat of nuclear terrorism by safeguarding atomic facilities and preparing emergency response capabilities .

the federal administrative court in this eastern city upheld a complaint by the klosterbrauerei neuzelle demanding that the state of brandenburg recognize its product as beer after a 10-year campaign .
the " schwarzer abt " -lrb- black abbot -rrb- black beer has a hint of invert sugar syrup , using a recipe handed down by monks .
thus , it does not meet the purity standards for german beer established in 1516 , which limits the ingredients to malt , water , yeast and hops .
" it looks like beer , tastes like beer and has alcohol in it , " the brewer 's managing director helmut fritsche insisted , arguing for the right to have the beer designation .
the state agricultural ministry had withheld the label , a decision fritsche described as discrimination because foreign brewers that do not meet the purity standards may still call their products " beer . "
the court 's judges agreed but stipulated that neuzelle must inform consumers about the syrup additive on its labels . dw-world.de ' anti-aging ' beer is not beer beer lovers in germany wo n't be able to say cheers to ' anti-aging ' beer : officials in the eastern german state of brandenburg ruled that " anti-aging beer " does not pass the beer purity law and can not be marketed as beer .

the world leaders seemed to be trying to inject fresh warmth to their once excellent personal relationship , which has cooled since the iraq war and led to concerns that the former cold war foes may again be turning into rivals .
ahead of their talks , which were due to last at least 90 minutes , bush gave his strongest endorsement yet of european efforts to convince iran not to develop nuclear weapons and said he hoped for a peaceful end to the dispute .
" hopefully we 'll be able to reach a diplomatic solution to this effort .
we 're more likely to do so when we 're all on the same page , " said bush , who in the past has stressed that he can not rule out using force against tehran .
disagreements growing vocal bildunterschrift : view of the bratislava castle where thursday 's summit between u.s. president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin takes place .
bush 's talk with putin was their first in person since an asia-pacific summit in chile last november , when the us leader privately questioned his counterpart on moves that were widely seen as setting back democracy in russia .
their disagreements , muted over the past three years by the war on terrorism , have grown more vocal since bush placed a renewed emphasis in his second term on promoting democracy and confronting iran and syria .
bush began his day by meeting with slovakia 's president ivan gasparovic and prime minister mikulas dzurinda , before making an emotionally charged speech to thousands of cheering slovak citizens in a town square .
bush vowed to stand with slovakia 's young democracy and hailed what he called a " purple revolution " in iraq , where ink of that color was used to mark those who voted in january 30 elections .
pressure over iran expected he likened that vote to the velvet revolution that broke the hold of communism here nearly 16 years ago , saying : " to the iraqi people , this is their 1989 , and they will always remember who stood with them in their quest for freedom . "
bush also predicted thursday that former soviet republics moldova and belarus would embrace democracy , and saluted nato 's eastward expansion - all sources of concern in moscow .
bush was expected to press putin on iran , which washington accuses of trying to acquire nuclear weapons , and on syria , which washington insists must withdraw all of its troops and " secret services " from lebanon .
putin recently agreed to sell missile systems to syria , while declaring there is " no evidence " that iran is seeking an atomic bomb and has stepped up russian cooperation with tehran on nuclear technology . afp / dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush prepares to lock horns with putin president bush meets with his russian counterpart vladimir putin in bratislava on thursday armed with a warning that moscow must renew its commitment to democracy and advocating a hard line on iran .

"
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. president george w. bush , left , listens to russian president vladimir putin during their meeting in the castle in bratislava , slovakia .
the two leaders said they had instructed their trade ministers to accelerate bilateral wto negotiations .
" we will work to identify areas for progress in our bilateral negotiations that will give momentum to russia 's accession to the wto , " they said .
they also agreed to enhance their joint efforts to counter the threat of nuclear terrorism by safeguarding atomic facilities and preparing emergency response capabilities .
the two sides said they agreed that security at nuclear facilities needs to be " constantly enhanced " to thwart terrorists .
the accord between washington and moscow came days after a us intelligence report said theft of radioactive materials from russian nuclear facilities " has occurred . "
missile accord bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovakian riot police equipment hangs on a security fence underneath the bratislava castle , in bratislava the tightly guarded meeting , at bratislava castle , in slovakia , opened with tensions over autocratic reforms in russia and moscow 's nuclear cooperation with iran topping the agenda .
but even before bush and putin crossed the threshold of the castle for their meeting , the two sides announced a deal on curbing the spread of shoulder-fired missiles that terrorists could use to shoot down airplanes .
the world leaders seemed to be trying to inject fresh warmth to their once excellent personal relationship , which has cooled since the iraq war and led to concerns that the former cold war foes may again be turning into rivals .
ahead of their talks , which were due to last at least 90 minutes , bush gave his strongest endorsement yet of european efforts to convince iran not to develop nuclear weapons and said he hoped for a peaceful end to the dispute .
" hopefully we 'll be able to reach a diplomatic solution to this effort .
we 're more likely to do so when we 're all on the same page , " said bush , who in the past has stressed that he can not rule out using force against tehran .
disagreements growing vocal bildunterschrift : view of the bratislava castle where thursday 's summit between u.s. president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin takes place .
bush 's talk with putin was their first in person since an asia-pacific summit in chile last november , when the us leader privately questioned his counterpart on moves that were widely seen as setting back democracy in russia .
their disagreements , muted over the past three years by the war on terrorism , have grown more vocal since bush placed a renewed emphasis in his second term on promoting democracy and confronting iran and syria .
bush began his day by meeting with slovakia 's president ivan gasparovic and prime minister mikulas dzurinda , before making an emotionally charged speech to thousands of cheering slovak citizens in a town square .
bush vowed to stand with slovakia 's young democracy and hailed what he called a " purple revolution " in iraq , where ink of that color was used to mark those who voted in january 30 elections .
pressure over iran expected he likened that vote to the velvet revolution that broke the hold of communism here nearly 16 years ago , saying : " to the iraqi people , this is their 1989 , and they will always remember who stood with them in their quest for freedom . "
bush also predicted thursday that former soviet republics moldova and belarus would embrace democracy , and saluted nato 's eastward expansion - all sources of concern in moscow .
bush was expected to press putin on iran , which washington accuses of trying to acquire nuclear weapons , and on syria , which washington insists must withdraw all of its troops and " secret services " from lebanon .
putin recently agreed to sell missile systems to syria , while declaring there is " no evidence " that iran is seeking an atomic bomb and has stepped up russian cooperation with tehran on nuclear technology . afp / dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush prepares to lock horns with putin president bush meets with his russian counterpart vladimir putin in bratislava on thursday armed with a warning that moscow must renew its commitment to democracy and advocating a hard line on iran .

but some lawmakers lamented the lack of a popular referendum . the german parliament has begun the legislative process leading towards ratification of the eu constitution - amid unusual harmony among politicians of all stripes .
for the most part , german lawmakers have praised the constitution , calling it a milestone on the way to a stronger and more integrated european union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baden-württemberg premier erwin teufel erwin teufel -lrb- photo -rrb- , the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- state premier of baden-württemberg and a member of the eu convention that worked out the document last year , recalled the old divisions and wars in europe which preceded the current climate of peace and unity on the continent .
eu is bigger - and more effective the constitution will give europe " a new shape and a future , " teufel said .
" europe won ’ t grow stronger when it deals with thousands of issues .
europe will only become stronger when it deals with the right issues .
and the constitution guarantees that it will do so . "
german foreign minister joschka fischer , one of the staunchest advocates of the constitution , argued that an enlarged european union is an effective political union , not a bureaucratic behemoth .
" the european union with 15 members hasn ’ t achieved in three summits what the enlarged eu of 25 members managed in only six months and two summits , " fischer said .
" this goes to show that accusations a larger europe is unmanageable are wrong .
the constitutional process has proved the european union is working . "
fischer also said he was convinced that the new constitution would overcome the widespread lack of interest about europe among its populations , and enhance their willingness to participate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. werner hoyer but werner hoyer -lrb- photo -rrb- , a parliamentarian from the liberal free democratic party , retorted that one reason germans are not interested in europe is that they are not given a say in adopting the constitution .
" germans are skeptical , uninterested and misinformed about the constitution because the political establishment doesn ’ t see the need to campaign for the document in a referendum , " he said .
" if we would be forced to wage a public information campaign , all of us would have to work really hard .
parliament ’ s refusal to hold a referendum on the constitution is hugely lamentable and will not serve our common cause . "
numerous eu state have decided to put the constitution to a popular vote .
spanish voters approved the document on sunday , in the first in a series of referendums .
points of controversy in spite of the general , cross-party political consensus in germany on the constitution , there is also controversy on the rights of control by national parliaments to be included in the annex to the draft .
germany ’ s conservative opposition wants parliament to be allowed to reprimand brussels and be given the right to sue before the european court , for example , in cases of violation of the subsidiarity principle .
the subsidiary principle obliges the european commission to restrict itself to legislation whose objectives can not be better achieved by the member states themselves .
they also want a strong national say on the possible entry of turkey into the eu , a move which the cdu flatly rejects at the moment .
so in the end , the ratification process in germany may take a while .

the federal administrative court in this eastern city upheld a complaint by the klosterbrauerei neuzelle demanding that the state of brandenburg recognize its product as beer after a 10-year campaign .
the " schwarzer abt " -lrb- black abbot -rrb- black beer has a hint of invert sugar syrup , using a recipe handed down by monks .
thus , it does not meet the purity standards for german beer established in 1516 , which limits the ingredients to malt , water , yeast and hops .
" it looks like beer , tastes like beer and has alcohol in it , " the brewer 's managing director helmut fritsche insisted , arguing for the right to have the beer designation .
the state agricultural ministry had withheld the label , a decision fritsche described as discrimination because foreign brewers that do not meet the purity standards may still call their products " beer . "
the court 's judges agreed but stipulated that neuzelle must inform consumers about the syrup additive on its labels . dw-world.de ' anti-aging ' beer is not beer beer lovers in germany wo n't be able to say cheers to ' anti-aging ' beer : officials in the eastern german state of brandenburg ruled that " anti-aging beer " does not pass the beer purity law and can not be marketed as beer .

they marched through the eerily empty downtown .
at the very least , their banners and posters - for example " bush go home , " " war monger , " and " no. 1 terrorist " - proclaimed their dislike and distrust of the u.s. president .
in general , the protesters ' complaints were about bush 's policies in iraq and his refusal to sign the kyoto treaty to curb global warming .
and despite official comments from bush and chancellor schröder about their disagreements being past , the demonstrators in mainz seemed doubtful about any possible rapprochement between the us and german governments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a protestor carries a banner representing the u.s. flag with bombs in the place of stars , in mainz .
" mr. bush , you are a liar ! " said maria mies , who was protesting with the group attac , which has long been active in protesting us involvement in iraq .
she noted that the basis for the war , saddam hussein 's supposed weapons of mass destruction , were never found .
kept at a distance there were divergent reports about the number of protesters who turned out in the end .
the organizers of the rallies , an alliance of pacifist groups under the motto " not welcome , mr bush , " said they were expecting 10,000 people to attend , but estimates ranged between 4,000 and 12,000 .
what is certain is that the march , which remained peaceful , took place in freezing temperatures and the protesters were kept well away from the visiting us president .

but it is his condemnation of abortion and same-sex marriage in the 227-page book " memory and identity " that has caused sharp criticism and controversy . the 84-year-old muses about the competing forces of good and evil in the world and history within the book , with special attention on the horrors committed by the nazis and by communist regimes . in one passage , after evoking the massacre of jews by the nazis in the holocaust , the pope writes that the democratically elected parliaments that replaced brutal authoritarian regimes in some countries continue to carry out murder on a huge scale by allowing abortion . " there is still , however , a legal extermination of human beings who have been conceived but not yet born , " the pope writes .
" and this time , we are talking about an extermination which has been allowed by nothing less than democratically elected parliaments . " germany 's jews criticize catholic view many critics have drawn a direct line between the pope 's reference to the holocaust and abortion , something jewish groups in germany immediately seized upon .

"
it was the pope 's intention , he added , to show the pervasiveness of evil , " even in liberal political systems . " the book further echoes similar remarks made by the cardinal of cologne , joachim meisner , who declared in a sermon in january : " first there was herod , who ordered the children of bethlehem to be killed , then there was hitler and stalin among others , and today unborn children are being killed in their millions . "
meisner later expressed regret for his comparison . in other areas of the pontiff 's book , the pope discusses the fear within the vatican that rampant relativism and secularism are causing the decay of christian values in europe and beyond .
he uses the debate on same-sex marriages as an example . same-sex marriages part of " new evil " # bhe ponders whether the european parliament has been put under pressure to legalize same-sex marriage as " part of a new ideology of evil , perhaps more insidious and hidden , which attempts to pit human rights against the family and against man . " the book , based on conversations the pope had in polish with two friends , the philosopher krzysztof michalski and the late father jozef tischner , at the papal summer residence near rome in 1993 , also says terrorist networks represent " a constant threat to the life of millions of innocents , " and specifically mentions the sept .

" all muslims in berlin should take to the streets to protest . "
yasemin , 22 , said , " it 's horrific .
all hatin was doing was leading her life the way she wanted . " but it was a choice she paid for with her life .
on feb .
7 , 23-year-old hatin sürücü was gunned down at the aforementioned bus stop .
she died on the spot .
shortly afterwards , three of her brothers - who reportedly had long been threatening her - were arrested .
investigators suspect it was a so-called " honor killing , " given the fact that sürücü 's ultra-conservative turkish-kurdish family strongly disapproved of her modern and " un-islamic " life . sürücü grew up in berlin and was married off at 16 to a cousin in istanbul .
after a few years , she returned to the german capital with her young son , moved into a home for single mothers , completed school and began to train as an electrician .
she stopped wearing a headscarf and was said to be outgoing and vivacious . " she lived like a german " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish women in a mosque in berlin 's kreuzberg district though not the first of its kind , the brazen shooting has sent shockwaves through berlin , home to a large foreign community and which for years has fretted over steady ghetto-building in districts dominated by turkish and arab immigrants .
while the incident has reopened debate on the integration of immigrants and the compatibility of islamic values with western ones , it ’ s the reaction of a small group of turkish students to the murder that has rattled the german capital . days after hatin sürücü was killed , some male students of turkish origin at a high school near the scene of the crime reportedly downplayed the act .
during a class discussion on the murder , one said , " she -lrb- hatin sürücü -rrb- only had herself to blame , " while another remarked " she deserved what she got - the whore lived like a german . "
the school 's director promptly dashed off a letter to parents and students , castigating the students and warning that the school didn ’ t tolerate incitement against freedom . " her lifestyle did n't fit " the comments have sparked outrage and left many asking if it was just a one-off or whether such thinking is in fact not entirely uncommon among sections of the muslim community in the city . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to some , it is n't .
" there is n't a single school with a high foreign population where teachers have n't faced this kind of thing , where individual students sometimes regard murder as a just sentence , " said heinz wagner , head of school and education policy at the vbe teachers trade union and a school director himself .
referring to the controversial remarks on sürücü 's murder , he said , " the very fact that they decided to provoke with something like that tells you that they 're getting their ideas from somewhere . " at berlin 's turkish-dominated neighborhood near kottbusser tor in the kreuzberg district , 17-year-old erkan , a high school student of turkish origin , was divided about the issue .

but it is his condemnation of abortion and same-sex marriage in the 227-page book " memory and identity " that has caused sharp criticism and controversy . the 84-year-old muses about the competing forces of good and evil in the world and history within the book , with special attention on the horrors committed by the nazis and by communist regimes . in one passage , after evoking the massacre of jews by the nazis in the holocaust , the pope writes that the democratically elected parliaments that replaced brutal authoritarian regimes in some countries continue to carry out murder on a huge scale by allowing abortion . " there is still , however , a legal extermination of human beings who have been conceived but not yet born , " the pope writes .
" and this time , we are talking about an extermination which has been allowed by nothing less than democratically elected parliaments . " germany 's jews criticize catholic view many critics have drawn a direct line between the pope 's reference to the holocaust and abortion , something jewish groups in germany immediately seized upon . " the catholic church does not understand or does not want to understand that there is an enormous difference between mass genocide and what women do to their own bodies , " paul spiegel , the president of the central council for jews in germany , said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cardinal joseph ratzinger of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith .
german cardinal joseph ratzinger , prefect of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith , the roman catholic church 's doctrinal watchdog , defended the pope and argued that misinterpretation had resulted in unwarranted criticism . german cardinal defends pontiff ratzinger , who has been touted as a possible successor to the ailing pontiff , told a new conference earlier this week that the pope " was not trying to put the holocaust and abortion on the same plane . "
it was the pope 's intention , he added , to show the pervasiveness of evil , " even in liberal political systems . " the book further echoes similar remarks made by the cardinal of cologne , joachim meisner , who declared in a sermon in january : " first there was herod , who ordered the children of bethlehem to be killed , then there was hitler and stalin among others , and today unborn children are being killed in their millions . "
meisner later expressed regret for his comparison . in other areas of the pontiff 's book , the pope discusses the fear within the vatican that rampant relativism and secularism are causing the decay of christian values in europe and beyond .
he uses the debate on same-sex marriages as an example . same-sex marriages part of " new evil " # bhe ponders whether the european parliament has been put under pressure to legalize same-sex marriage as " part of a new ideology of evil , perhaps more insidious and hidden , which attempts to pit human rights against the family and against man . " the book , based on conversations the pope had in polish with two friends , the philosopher krzysztof michalski and the late father jozef tischner , at the papal summer residence near rome in 1993 , also says terrorist networks represent " a constant threat to the life of millions of innocents , " and specifically mentions the sept .

but it is his condemnation of abortion and same-sex marriage in the 227-page book " memory and identity " that has caused sharp criticism and controversy . the 84-year-old muses about the competing forces of good and evil in the world and history within the book , with special attention on the horrors committed by the nazis and by communist regimes . in one passage , after evoking the massacre of jews by the nazis in the holocaust , the pope writes that the democratically elected parliaments that replaced brutal authoritarian regimes in some countries continue to carry out murder on a huge scale by allowing abortion . " there is still , however , a legal extermination of human beings who have been conceived but not yet born , " the pope writes .
" and this time , we are talking about an extermination which has been allowed by nothing less than democratically elected parliaments . " germany 's jews criticize catholic view many critics have drawn a direct line between the pope 's reference to the holocaust and abortion , something jewish groups in germany immediately seized upon . " the catholic church does not understand or does not want to understand that there is an enormous difference between mass genocide and what women do to their own bodies , " paul spiegel , the president of the central council for jews in germany , said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cardinal joseph ratzinger of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith .
german cardinal joseph ratzinger , prefect of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith , the roman catholic church 's doctrinal watchdog , defended the pope and argued that misinterpretation had resulted in unwarranted criticism . german cardinal defends pontiff ratzinger , who has been touted as a possible successor to the ailing pontiff , told a new conference earlier this week that the pope " was not trying to put the holocaust and abortion on the same plane . "
it was the pope 's intention , he added , to show the pervasiveness of evil , " even in liberal political systems . " the book further echoes similar remarks made by the cardinal of cologne , joachim meisner , who declared in a sermon in january : " first there was herod , who ordered the children of bethlehem to be killed , then there was hitler and stalin among others , and today unborn children are being killed in their millions . "
meisner later expressed regret for his comparison . in other areas of the pontiff 's book , the pope discusses the fear within the vatican that rampant relativism and secularism are causing the decay of christian values in europe and beyond .
he uses the debate on same-sex marriages as an example . same-sex marriages part of " new evil " # bhe ponders whether the european parliament has been put under pressure to legalize same-sex marriage as " part of a new ideology of evil , perhaps more insidious and hidden , which attempts to pit human rights against the family and against man . " the book , based on conversations the pope had in polish with two friends , the philosopher krzysztof michalski and the late father jozef tischner , at the papal summer residence near rome in 1993 , also says terrorist networks represent " a constant threat to the life of millions of innocents , " and specifically mentions the sept .

" there is still , however , a legal extermination of human beings who have been conceived but not yet born , " the pope writes .
" and this time , we are talking about an extermination which has been allowed by nothing less than democratically elected parliaments . " germany 's jews criticize catholic view many critics have drawn a direct line between the pope 's reference to the holocaust and abortion , something jewish groups in germany immediately seized upon .

"
meisner later expressed regret for his comparison . in other areas of the pontiff 's book , the pope discusses the fear within the vatican that rampant relativism and secularism are causing the decay of christian values in europe and beyond .
he uses the debate on same-sex marriages as an example . same-sex marriages part of " new evil " # bhe ponders whether the european parliament has been put under pressure to legalize same-sex marriage as " part of a new ideology of evil , perhaps more insidious and hidden , which attempts to pit human rights against the family and against man .

they marched through the eerily empty downtown .
at the very least , their banners and posters - for example " bush go home , " " war monger , " and " no. 1 terrorist " - proclaimed their dislike and distrust of the u.s. president .
in general , the protesters ' complaints were about bush 's policies in iraq and his refusal to sign the kyoto treaty to curb global warming .
and despite official comments from bush and chancellor schröder about their disagreements being past , the demonstrators in mainz seemed doubtful about any possible rapprochement between the us and german governments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a protestor carries a banner representing the u.s. flag with bombs in the place of stars , in mainz .
" mr. bush , you are a liar ! " said maria mies , who was protesting with the group attac , which has long been active in protesting us involvement in iraq .
she noted that the basis for the war , saddam hussein 's supposed weapons of mass destruction , were never found .
kept at a distance there were divergent reports about the number of protesters who turned out in the end .
the organizers of the rallies , an alliance of pacifist groups under the motto " not welcome , mr bush , " said they were expecting 10,000 people to attend , but estimates ranged between 4,000 and 12,000 .
what is certain is that the march , which remained peaceful , took place in freezing temperatures and the protesters were kept well away from the visiting us president .
the rally never got within a kilometer -lrb- half mile -rrb- of bush , who is on his first german visit since the 2003 iraq war .
the war was extremely unpopular in germany .
colorful slogans " i 'm disgusted by the war in iraq bush started that has cost thousands of civilian lives , " thomas odenweller , a 49-year-old computer technician told reuters .
" now he 's trying to normalize relations with europe .
it must be stopped . "
ignoring snow and freezing temperatures , the demonstrators held banners chastising bush in english with slogans such as : " you can bomb the world to pieces but not into peace . "
many had pre-printed posters reading : " bush , no. 1 terrorist " .
german police confiscated one poster that read : " we had our hitler , now you have yours . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rally against the visit of u.s. president bush up to and during bush 's visit , a force of 10,000 police officers staged one of the biggest postwar security operations in germany .
frogmen searched the rhine river for explosives , 1,300 manhole covers were welded shut and thousands of residents were displaced .
for bush 's eight-hour stay there was also a strict ban on air traffic within a 60-kilometer radius of mainz , barges on the river were halted and motorways in the region closed .
factories , businesses and schools were shut .
bush 's visit contrasted with that of his father to mainz in 1989 when large crowds cheered bush senior for his calls for the berlin wall to be torn down .
other us presidents have also been given a hero 's welcome in germany .
" when john f. kennedy came to germany he drove through cheering crowds , " mark reichelt , 20 , a student , told reuters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 24.02.2005 fraport wants stake in indian airport großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fraport staff could be packing their bags for india the aviation industry is regarded as an engine for growth in india .
the highly populated country is one of the most attractive markets in asia behind china - a fact not lost on german airport operator fraport . in september 2003 , india 's government decided to sell 74 percent of india 's two major airports - delhi and mumbai .
now the government is looking for private companies to invest in the airports ' expansion .
as specialists estimate that the number of airline passengers is going to rise by 16 percent each year until 2010 , the investment in these airports promises a stake in a lucrative growth market . the frankfurt airport operating company fraport has been quick to realize this and has made its intentions towards india clear .
frank thiesen , assistant manager of the global investment and management division at fraport , has been busy preparing the division for the participation in one of the indian airports for the past one and a half years .
the process has been a long one for thiesen and his team .
firstly , partner companies with whom fraport sought to form a consortium with had to be selected .
at the same time the process of rapprochement to the indian government was underway .
fraport is planning to invest a total of € 30 to € 50 million -lrb- $ 40 to $ 66 million -rrb- for a stake of about 10 percent in one of the two airports .
" if we are going to be awarded the contract , we are going to first revise the airport 's internal company processes , " thiesen explained .
for this purpose , fraport personnel have to be sent to india , training programs have to be set up , and the infrastructure needs to be improved .
tough competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt international airport , operated by fraport .
about 10 more applicants are competing for the stake , among them consortia of the airports of paris , singapore , and hong kong .
the incentive is strong as the indian government 's liberalization strategy created new conditions for civil aviation policy .
since august 2003 , low-fare airlines have been given access to india 's domestic market .
more and more private airlines are coming to existence .
two of them , jet airways and air sahara , recently received permission to start service to international destinations .
with more than one billion people and an economic growth of more than eight percent , india is regarded as the most important asian market for the future next to china .
up to now , too much regulation of the aviation market , a thick jungle of bureaucracy and the protection of inefficient , run-down state airlines air india and indian airlines prevented private companies from raising the much invoked potential of the market .
private airlines contend that liberalizing of aviation policies is pointless if infrastructure is not massively extended at the same time .
metropolitan airports suffered from extreme overload , they say .
" if new airlines are to enter the market without infrastructure keeping up , the industry is headed for a disaster , " wolfgang prock-schauer , chief executive of the biggest private airline jet airways , warned .
the indian government has acknowledged this need and intends to invest a two-digit euro million amount into the extension of streets , railway , sea- and airports over the coming years .
a previous investment project failed a few years ago , fraport 's investment in the airport extension at the philippine capital manila was not successful .
europe 's second biggest airport company had to take the blow of losing € 300 million .
ever since , shareholders and analysts have kept a critical eye on fraport 's international activities .
" we learned from the experience , " fraport manager thiesen explains .
" nowadays we concentrate on smaller , specific management tasks and try to be on the safe side as far as possible . "
therefore , the frankfurt company prefers holding several small stakes over a few big ones .
this way , they keep the risk of a great loss smaller .
if fraport will get the chance for participation in india is going be decided in the summer .
then , india 's government will pick which applicant is going to be awarded the contract . ana lehmann -lrb- bm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu favors aviation tax to fund african aid a proposal put forward by germany and france to tax commercial aviation fuel to raise funds for development in africa was endorsed by the european union executive on tuesday .

private airlines contend that liberalizing of aviation policies is pointless if infrastructure is not massively extended at the same time .
metropolitan airports suffered from extreme overload , they say .
" if new airlines are to enter the market without infrastructure keeping up , the industry is headed for a disaster , " wolfgang prock-schauer , chief executive of the biggest private airline jet airways , warned .
the indian government has acknowledged this need and intends to invest a two-digit euro million amount into the extension of streets , railway , sea- and airports over the coming years .
a previous investment project failed a few years ago , fraport 's investment in the airport extension at the philippine capital manila was not successful .
europe 's second biggest airport company had to take the blow of losing € 300 million .
ever since , shareholders and analysts have kept a critical eye on fraport 's international activities .
" we learned from the experience , " fraport manager thiesen explains .
" nowadays we concentrate on smaller , specific management tasks and try to be on the safe side as far as possible . "
therefore , the frankfurt company prefers holding several small stakes over a few big ones .
this way , they keep the risk of a great loss smaller .
if fraport will get the chance for participation in india is going be decided in the summer .
then , india 's government will pick which applicant is going to be awarded the contract . ana lehmann -lrb- bm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu favors aviation tax to fund african aid a proposal put forward by germany and france to tax commercial aviation fuel to raise funds for development in africa was endorsed by the european union executive on tuesday .

the murder of a turkish woman and the applauding of the crime by some students have left berlin shaken and officials pushing for ethics class .
but how deep does the concept of honor run among some immigrant communities ? on a cold afternoon this week , hatin sürücü gazed gravely from a large poster behind a bus stop lined with flowers , cards and candles . to the people who came to this bleak part of berlin 's tempelhof district for tuesday 's solemn vigil - called not by the city 's muslim community but a gay and lesbian organization - the image of the young woman in a headscarf , a baby in her arms , was familiar from newspapers and television .
a few notes at the memorial read , " hope you get a better deal in your next life , " and " live a life on your own terms . " " it 's a scandal , " said ali k , 33 .
" all muslims in berlin should take to the streets to protest . "
yasemin , 22 , said , " it 's horrific .
all hatin was doing was leading her life the way she wanted . " but it was a choice she paid for with her life .
on feb .
7 , 23-year-old hatin sürücü was gunned down at the aforementioned bus stop .
she died on the spot .
shortly afterwards , three of her brothers - who reportedly had long been threatening her - were arrested .
investigators suspect it was a so-called " honor killing , " given the fact that sürücü 's ultra-conservative turkish-kurdish family strongly disapproved of her modern and " un-islamic " life . sürücü grew up in berlin and was married off at 16 to a cousin in istanbul .
after a few years , she returned to the german capital with her young son , moved into a home for single mothers , completed school and began to train as an electrician .
she stopped wearing a headscarf and was said to be outgoing and vivacious . " she lived like a german " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish women in a mosque in berlin 's kreuzberg district though not the first of its kind , the brazen shooting has sent shockwaves through berlin , home to a large foreign community and which for years has fretted over steady ghetto-building in districts dominated by turkish and arab immigrants .
while the incident has reopened debate on the integration of immigrants and the compatibility of islamic values with western ones , it ’ s the reaction of a small group of turkish students to the murder that has rattled the german capital . days after hatin sürücü was killed , some male students of turkish origin at a high school near the scene of the crime reportedly downplayed the act .
during a class discussion on the murder , one said , " she -lrb- hatin sürücü -rrb- only had herself to blame , " while another remarked " she deserved what she got - the whore lived like a german . "
the school 's director promptly dashed off a letter to parents and students , castigating the students and warning that the school didn ’ t tolerate incitement against freedom .

they marched through the eerily empty downtown .
at the very least , their banners and posters - for example " bush go home , " " war monger , " and " no. 1 terrorist " - proclaimed their dislike and distrust of the u.s. president .
in general , the protesters ' complaints were about bush 's policies in iraq and his refusal to sign the kyoto treaty to curb global warming .
and despite official comments from bush and chancellor schröder about their disagreements being past , the demonstrators in mainz seemed doubtful about any possible rapprochement between the us and german governments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a protestor carries a banner representing the u.s. flag with bombs in the place of stars , in mainz .

kept at a distance there were divergent reports about the number of protesters who turned out in the end .
the organizers of the rallies , an alliance of pacifist groups under the motto " not welcome , mr bush , " said they were expecting 10,000 people to attend , but estimates ranged between 4,000 and 12,000 .
what is certain is that the march , which remained peaceful , took place in freezing temperatures and the protesters were kept well away from the visiting us president .
the rally never got within a kilometer -lrb- half mile -rrb- of bush , who is on his first german visit since the 2003 iraq war .
the war was extremely unpopular in germany .
colorful slogans " i 'm disgusted by the war in iraq bush started that has cost thousands of civilian lives , " thomas odenweller , a 49-year-old computer technician told reuters .
" now he 's trying to normalize relations with europe .
it must be stopped . "
ignoring snow and freezing temperatures , the demonstrators held banners chastising bush in english with slogans such as : " you can bomb the world to pieces but not into peace . "
many had pre-printed posters reading : " bush , no. 1 terrorist " .
german police confiscated one poster that read : " we had our hitler , now you have yours . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rally against the visit of u.s. president bush up to and during bush 's visit , a force of 10,000 police officers staged one of the biggest postwar security operations in germany .
frogmen searched the rhine river for explosives , 1,300 manhole covers were welded shut and thousands of residents were displaced .
for bush 's eight-hour stay there was also a strict ban on air traffic within a 60-kilometer radius of mainz , barges on the river were halted and motorways in the region closed .
factories , businesses and schools were shut .
bush 's visit contrasted with that of his father to mainz in 1989 when large crowds cheered bush senior for his calls for the berlin wall to be torn down .
other us presidents have also been given a hero 's welcome in germany .

" there is still , however , a legal extermination of human beings who have been conceived but not yet born , " the pope writes .
" and this time , we are talking about an extermination which has been allowed by nothing less than democratically elected parliaments .

"
meisner later expressed regret for his comparison . in other areas of the pontiff 's book , the pope discusses the fear within the vatican that rampant relativism and secularism are causing the decay of christian values in europe and beyond .
he uses the debate on same-sex marriages as an example . same-sex marriages part of " new evil " # bhe ponders whether the european parliament has been put under pressure to legalize same-sex marriage as " part of a new ideology of evil , perhaps more insidious and hidden , which attempts to pit human rights against the family and against man . " the book , based on conversations the pope had in polish with two friends , the philosopher krzysztof michalski and the late father jozef tischner , at the papal summer residence near rome in 1993 , also says terrorist networks represent " a constant threat to the life of millions of innocents , " and specifically mentions the sept .

but it is his condemnation of abortion and same-sex marriage in the 227-page book " memory and identity " that has caused sharp criticism and controversy . the 84-year-old muses about the competing forces of good and evil in the world and history within the book , with special attention on the horrors committed by the nazis and by communist regimes . in one passage , after evoking the massacre of jews by the nazis in the holocaust , the pope writes that the democratically elected parliaments that replaced brutal authoritarian regimes in some countries continue to carry out murder on a huge scale by allowing abortion . " there is still , however , a legal extermination of human beings who have been conceived but not yet born , " the pope writes .
" and this time , we are talking about an extermination which has been allowed by nothing less than democratically elected parliaments . " germany 's jews criticize catholic view many critics have drawn a direct line between the pope 's reference to the holocaust and abortion , something jewish groups in germany immediately seized upon . " the catholic church does not understand or does not want to understand that there is an enormous difference between mass genocide and what women do to their own bodies , " paul spiegel , the president of the central council for jews in germany , said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cardinal joseph ratzinger of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith .
german cardinal joseph ratzinger , prefect of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith , the roman catholic church 's doctrinal watchdog , defended the pope and argued that misinterpretation had resulted in unwarranted criticism . german cardinal defends pontiff ratzinger , who has been touted as a possible successor to the ailing pontiff , told a new conference earlier this week that the pope " was not trying to put the holocaust and abortion on the same plane . "
it was the pope 's intention , he added , to show the pervasiveness of evil , " even in liberal political systems . " the book further echoes similar remarks made by the cardinal of cologne , joachim meisner , who declared in a sermon in january : " first there was herod , who ordered the children of bethlehem to be killed , then there was hitler and stalin among others , and today unborn children are being killed in their millions . "
meisner later expressed regret for his comparison . in other areas of the pontiff 's book , the pope discusses the fear within the vatican that rampant relativism and secularism are causing the decay of christian values in europe and beyond .
he uses the debate on same-sex marriages as an example . same-sex marriages part of " new evil " # bhe ponders whether the european parliament has been put under pressure to legalize same-sex marriage as " part of a new ideology of evil , perhaps more insidious and hidden , which attempts to pit human rights against the family and against man . " the book , based on conversations the pope had in polish with two friends , the philosopher krzysztof michalski and the late father jozef tischner , at the papal summer residence near rome in 1993 , also says terrorist networks represent " a constant threat to the life of millions of innocents , " and specifically mentions the sept .

but some lawmakers lamented the lack of a popular referendum . the german parliament has begun the legislative process leading towards ratification of the eu constitution - amid unusual harmony among politicians of all stripes .
for the most part , german lawmakers have praised the constitution , calling it a milestone on the way to a stronger and more integrated european union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baden-württemberg premier erwin teufel erwin teufel -lrb- photo -rrb- , the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- state premier of baden-württemberg and a member of the eu convention that worked out the document last year , recalled the old divisions and wars in europe which preceded the current climate of peace and unity on the continent .
eu is bigger - and more effective the constitution will give europe " a new shape and a future , " teufel said .
" europe won ’ t grow stronger when it deals with thousands of issues .
europe will only become stronger when it deals with the right issues .
and the constitution guarantees that it will do so . "
german foreign minister joschka fischer , one of the staunchest advocates of the constitution , argued that an enlarged european union is an effective political union , not a bureaucratic behemoth .
" the european union with 15 members hasn ’ t achieved in three summits what the enlarged eu of 25 members managed in only six months and two summits , " fischer said .
" this goes to show that accusations a larger europe is unmanageable are wrong .
the constitutional process has proved the european union is working . "

" germans are skeptical , uninterested and misinformed about the constitution because the political establishment doesn ’ t see the need to campaign for the document in a referendum , " he said .
" if we would be forced to wage a public information campaign , all of us would have to work really hard .
parliament ’ s refusal to hold a referendum on the constitution is hugely lamentable and will not serve our common cause . "
numerous eu state have decided to put the constitution to a popular vote .

points of controversy in spite of the general , cross-party political consensus in germany on the constitution , there is also controversy on the rights of control by national parliaments to be included in the annex to the draft .
germany ’ s conservative opposition wants parliament to be allowed to reprimand brussels and be given the right to sue before the european court , for example , in cases of violation of the subsidiarity principle .
the subsidiary principle obliges the european commission to restrict itself to legislation whose objectives can not be better achieved by the member states themselves .
they also want a strong national say on the possible entry of turkey into the eu , a move which the cdu flatly rejects at the moment .

"
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. president george w. bush , left , listens to russian president vladimir putin during their meeting in the castle in bratislava , slovakia .
the two leaders said they had instructed their trade ministers to accelerate bilateral wto negotiations .
" we will work to identify areas for progress in our bilateral negotiations that will give momentum to russia 's accession to the wto , " they said .
they also agreed to enhance their joint efforts to counter the threat of nuclear terrorism by safeguarding atomic facilities and preparing emergency response capabilities .
the two sides said they agreed that security at nuclear facilities needs to be " constantly enhanced " to thwart terrorists .
the accord between washington and moscow came days after a us intelligence report said theft of radioactive materials from russian nuclear facilities " has occurred . "
missile accord bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovakian riot police equipment hangs on a security fence underneath the bratislava castle , in bratislava the tightly guarded meeting , at bratislava castle , in slovakia , opened with tensions over autocratic reforms in russia and moscow 's nuclear cooperation with iran topping the agenda .
but even before bush and putin crossed the threshold of the castle for their meeting , the two sides announced a deal on curbing the spread of shoulder-fired missiles that terrorists could use to shoot down airplanes .
the world leaders seemed to be trying to inject fresh warmth to their once excellent personal relationship , which has cooled since the iraq war and led to concerns that the former cold war foes may again be turning into rivals .
ahead of their talks , which were due to last at least 90 minutes , bush gave his strongest endorsement yet of european efforts to convince iran not to develop nuclear weapons and said he hoped for a peaceful end to the dispute .
" hopefully we 'll be able to reach a diplomatic solution to this effort .
we 're more likely to do so when we 're all on the same page , " said bush , who in the past has stressed that he can not rule out using force against tehran .
disagreements growing vocal bildunterschrift : view of the bratislava castle where thursday 's summit between u.s. president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin takes place .
bush 's talk with putin was their first in person since an asia-pacific summit in chile last november , when the us leader privately questioned his counterpart on moves that were widely seen as setting back democracy in russia .
their disagreements , muted over the past three years by the war on terrorism , have grown more vocal since bush placed a renewed emphasis in his second term on promoting democracy and confronting iran and syria .
bush began his day by meeting with slovakia 's president ivan gasparovic and prime minister mikulas dzurinda , before making an emotionally charged speech to thousands of cheering slovak citizens in a town square .
bush vowed to stand with slovakia 's young democracy and hailed what he called a " purple revolution " in iraq , where ink of that color was used to mark those who voted in january 30 elections .
pressure over iran expected he likened that vote to the velvet revolution that broke the hold of communism here nearly 16 years ago , saying : " to the iraqi people , this is their 1989 , and they will always remember who stood with them in their quest for freedom . "
bush also predicted thursday that former soviet republics moldova and belarus would embrace democracy , and saluted nato 's eastward expansion - all sources of concern in moscow .
bush was expected to press putin on iran , which washington accuses of trying to acquire nuclear weapons , and on syria , which washington insists must withdraw all of its troops and " secret services " from lebanon .
putin recently agreed to sell missile systems to syria , while declaring there is " no evidence " that iran is seeking an atomic bomb and has stepped up russian cooperation with tehran on nuclear technology . afp / dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush prepares to lock horns with putin president bush meets with his russian counterpart vladimir putin in bratislava on thursday armed with a warning that moscow must renew its commitment to democracy and advocating a hard line on iran .

"
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. president george w. bush , left , listens to russian president vladimir putin during their meeting in the castle in bratislava , slovakia .
the two leaders said they had instructed their trade ministers to accelerate bilateral wto negotiations .
" we will work to identify areas for progress in our bilateral negotiations that will give momentum to russia 's accession to the wto , " they said .
they also agreed to enhance their joint efforts to counter the threat of nuclear terrorism by safeguarding atomic facilities and preparing emergency response capabilities .
the two sides said they agreed that security at nuclear facilities needs to be " constantly enhanced " to thwart terrorists .
the accord between washington and moscow came days after a us intelligence report said theft of radioactive materials from russian nuclear facilities " has occurred . "
missile accord bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovakian riot police equipment hangs on a security fence underneath the bratislava castle , in bratislava the tightly guarded meeting , at bratislava castle , in slovakia , opened with tensions over autocratic reforms in russia and moscow 's nuclear cooperation with iran topping the agenda .
but even before bush and putin crossed the threshold of the castle for their meeting , the two sides announced a deal on curbing the spread of shoulder-fired missiles that terrorists could use to shoot down airplanes .
the world leaders seemed to be trying to inject fresh warmth to their once excellent personal relationship , which has cooled since the iraq war and led to concerns that the former cold war foes may again be turning into rivals .
ahead of their talks , which were due to last at least 90 minutes , bush gave his strongest endorsement yet of european efforts to convince iran not to develop nuclear weapons and said he hoped for a peaceful end to the dispute .
" hopefully we 'll be able to reach a diplomatic solution to this effort .
we 're more likely to do so when we 're all on the same page , " said bush , who in the past has stressed that he can not rule out using force against tehran .
disagreements growing vocal bildunterschrift : view of the bratislava castle where thursday 's summit between u.s. president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin takes place .
bush 's talk with putin was their first in person since an asia-pacific summit in chile last november , when the us leader privately questioned his counterpart on moves that were widely seen as setting back democracy in russia .
their disagreements , muted over the past three years by the war on terrorism , have grown more vocal since bush placed a renewed emphasis in his second term on promoting democracy and confronting iran and syria .
bush began his day by meeting with slovakia 's president ivan gasparovic and prime minister mikulas dzurinda , before making an emotionally charged speech to thousands of cheering slovak citizens in a town square .
bush vowed to stand with slovakia 's young democracy and hailed what he called a " purple revolution " in iraq , where ink of that color was used to mark those who voted in january 30 elections .
pressure over iran expected he likened that vote to the velvet revolution that broke the hold of communism here nearly 16 years ago , saying : " to the iraqi people , this is their 1989 , and they will always remember who stood with them in their quest for freedom . "
bush also predicted thursday that former soviet republics moldova and belarus would embrace democracy , and saluted nato 's eastward expansion - all sources of concern in moscow .
bush was expected to press putin on iran , which washington accuses of trying to acquire nuclear weapons , and on syria , which washington insists must withdraw all of its troops and " secret services " from lebanon .
putin recently agreed to sell missile systems to syria , while declaring there is " no evidence " that iran is seeking an atomic bomb and has stepped up russian cooperation with tehran on nuclear technology . afp / dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush prepares to lock horns with putin president bush meets with his russian counterpart vladimir putin in bratislava on thursday armed with a warning that moscow must renew its commitment to democracy and advocating a hard line on iran .

the highly populated country is one of the most attractive markets in asia behind china - a fact not lost on german airport operator fraport . in september 2003 , india 's government decided to sell 74 percent of india 's two major airports - delhi and mumbai .
now the government is looking for private companies to invest in the airports ' expansion .
as specialists estimate that the number of airline passengers is going to rise by 16 percent each year until 2010 , the investment in these airports promises a stake in a lucrative growth market . the frankfurt airport operating company fraport has been quick to realize this and has made its intentions towards india clear .
frank thiesen , assistant manager of the global investment and management division at fraport , has been busy preparing the division for the participation in one of the indian airports for the past one and a half years .
the process has been a long one for thiesen and his team .
firstly , partner companies with whom fraport sought to form a consortium with had to be selected .
at the same time the process of rapprochement to the indian government was underway .
fraport is planning to invest a total of € 30 to € 50 million -lrb- $ 40 to $ 66 million -rrb- for a stake of about 10 percent in one of the two airports .
" if we are going to be awarded the contract , we are going to first revise the airport 's internal company processes , " thiesen explained .
for this purpose , fraport personnel have to be sent to india , training programs have to be set up , and the infrastructure needs to be improved .
tough competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt international airport , operated by fraport .
about 10 more applicants are competing for the stake , among them consortia of the airports of paris , singapore , and hong kong .
the incentive is strong as the indian government 's liberalization strategy created new conditions for civil aviation policy .
since august 2003 , low-fare airlines have been given access to india 's domestic market .
more and more private airlines are coming to existence .
two of them , jet airways and air sahara , recently received permission to start service to international destinations .
with more than one billion people and an economic growth of more than eight percent , india is regarded as the most important asian market for the future next to china .
up to now , too much regulation of the aviation market , a thick jungle of bureaucracy and the protection of inefficient , run-down state airlines air india and indian airlines prevented private companies from raising the much invoked potential of the market .
private airlines contend that liberalizing of aviation policies is pointless if infrastructure is not massively extended at the same time .
metropolitan airports suffered from extreme overload , they say .
" if new airlines are to enter the market without infrastructure keeping up , the industry is headed for a disaster , " wolfgang prock-schauer , chief executive of the biggest private airline jet airways , warned .
the indian government has acknowledged this need and intends to invest a two-digit euro million amount into the extension of streets , railway , sea- and airports over the coming years .
a previous investment project failed a few years ago , fraport 's investment in the airport extension at the philippine capital manila was not successful .
europe 's second biggest airport company had to take the blow of losing € 300 million .
ever since , shareholders and analysts have kept a critical eye on fraport 's international activities .
" we learned from the experience , " fraport manager thiesen explains .
" nowadays we concentrate on smaller , specific management tasks and try to be on the safe side as far as possible . "
therefore , the frankfurt company prefers holding several small stakes over a few big ones .
this way , they keep the risk of a great loss smaller .
if fraport will get the chance for participation in india is going be decided in the summer .
then , india 's government will pick which applicant is going to be awarded the contract . ana lehmann -lrb- bm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu favors aviation tax to fund african aid a proposal put forward by germany and france to tax commercial aviation fuel to raise funds for development in africa was endorsed by the european union executive on tuesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 24.02.2005 fraport wants stake in indian airport großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fraport staff could be packing their bags for india the aviation industry is regarded as an engine for growth in india .
the highly populated country is one of the most attractive markets in asia behind china - a fact not lost on german airport operator fraport . in september 2003 , india 's government decided to sell 74 percent of india 's two major airports - delhi and mumbai .
now the government is looking for private companies to invest in the airports ' expansion .
as specialists estimate that the number of airline passengers is going to rise by 16 percent each year until 2010 , the investment in these airports promises a stake in a lucrative growth market . the frankfurt airport operating company fraport has been quick to realize this and has made its intentions towards india clear .
frank thiesen , assistant manager of the global investment and management division at fraport , has been busy preparing the division for the participation in one of the indian airports for the past one and a half years .
the process has been a long one for thiesen and his team .
firstly , partner companies with whom fraport sought to form a consortium with had to be selected .
at the same time the process of rapprochement to the indian government was underway .
fraport is planning to invest a total of € 30 to € 50 million -lrb- $ 40 to $ 66 million -rrb- for a stake of about 10 percent in one of the two airports .

but it is his condemnation of abortion and same-sex marriage in the 227-page book " memory and identity " that has caused sharp criticism and controversy . the 84-year-old muses about the competing forces of good and evil in the world and history within the book , with special attention on the horrors committed by the nazis and by communist regimes . in one passage , after evoking the massacre of jews by the nazis in the holocaust , the pope writes that the democratically elected parliaments that replaced brutal authoritarian regimes in some countries continue to carry out murder on a huge scale by allowing abortion . " there is still , however , a legal extermination of human beings who have been conceived but not yet born , " the pope writes .
" and this time , we are talking about an extermination which has been allowed by nothing less than democratically elected parliaments . " germany 's jews criticize catholic view many critics have drawn a direct line between the pope 's reference to the holocaust and abortion , something jewish groups in germany immediately seized upon . " the catholic church does not understand or does not want to understand that there is an enormous difference between mass genocide and what women do to their own bodies , " paul spiegel , the president of the central council for jews in germany , said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cardinal joseph ratzinger of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith .
german cardinal joseph ratzinger , prefect of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith , the roman catholic church 's doctrinal watchdog , defended the pope and argued that misinterpretation had resulted in unwarranted criticism . german cardinal defends pontiff ratzinger , who has been touted as a possible successor to the ailing pontiff , told a new conference earlier this week that the pope " was not trying to put the holocaust and abortion on the same plane . "
it was the pope 's intention , he added , to show the pervasiveness of evil , " even in liberal political systems . " the book further echoes similar remarks made by the cardinal of cologne , joachim meisner , who declared in a sermon in january : " first there was herod , who ordered the children of bethlehem to be killed , then there was hitler and stalin among others , and today unborn children are being killed in their millions . "
meisner later expressed regret for his comparison . in other areas of the pontiff 's book , the pope discusses the fear within the vatican that rampant relativism and secularism are causing the decay of christian values in europe and beyond .
he uses the debate on same-sex marriages as an example . same-sex marriages part of " new evil " # bhe ponders whether the european parliament has been put under pressure to legalize same-sex marriage as " part of a new ideology of evil , perhaps more insidious and hidden , which attempts to pit human rights against the family and against man . " the book , based on conversations the pope had in polish with two friends , the philosopher krzysztof michalski and the late father jozef tischner , at the papal summer residence near rome in 1993 , also says terrorist networks represent " a constant threat to the life of millions of innocents , " and specifically mentions the sept .

they marched through the eerily empty downtown .
at the very least , their banners and posters - for example " bush go home , " " war monger , " and " no. 1 terrorist " - proclaimed their dislike and distrust of the u.s. president .
in general , the protesters ' complaints were about bush 's policies in iraq and his refusal to sign the kyoto treaty to curb global warming .
and despite official comments from bush and chancellor schröder about their disagreements being past , the demonstrators in mainz seemed doubtful about any possible rapprochement between the us and german governments .

ignoring snow and freezing temperatures , the demonstrators held banners chastising bush in english with slogans such as : " you can bomb the world to pieces but not into peace . "

during a class discussion on the murder , one said , " she -lrb- hatin sürücü -rrb- only had herself to blame , " while another remarked " she deserved what she got - the whore lived like a german . "
the school 's director promptly dashed off a letter to parents and students , castigating the students and warning that the school didn ’ t tolerate incitement against freedom . " her lifestyle did n't fit " the comments have sparked outrage and left many asking if it was just a one-off or whether such thinking is in fact not entirely uncommon among sections of the muslim community in the city . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to some , it is n't .
" there is n't a single school with a high foreign population where teachers have n't faced this kind of thing , where individual students sometimes regard murder as a just sentence , " said heinz wagner , head of school and education policy at the vbe teachers trade union and a school director himself .
referring to the controversial remarks on sürücü 's murder , he said , " the very fact that they decided to provoke with something like that tells you that they 're getting their ideas from somewhere . " at berlin 's turkish-dominated neighborhood near kottbusser tor in the kreuzberg district , 17-year-old erkan , a high school student of turkish origin , was divided about the issue .
" i 'm not saying you should murder , but hatin 's lifestyle just did n't fit the way traditional muslims live , " he said . please click on the second page to continue reading the story 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a wife bound by shame in europe 's closed-off immigrant communities , hundreds of women are forced to marry against their will .

but some lawmakers lamented the lack of a popular referendum . the german parliament has begun the legislative process leading towards ratification of the eu constitution - amid unusual harmony among politicians of all stripes .
for the most part , german lawmakers have praised the constitution , calling it a milestone on the way to a stronger and more integrated european union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baden-württemberg premier erwin teufel erwin teufel -lrb- photo -rrb- , the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- state premier of baden-württemberg and a member of the eu convention that worked out the document last year , recalled the old divisions and wars in europe which preceded the current climate of peace and unity on the continent .
eu is bigger - and more effective the constitution will give europe " a new shape and a future , " teufel said .
" europe won ’ t grow stronger when it deals with thousands of issues .
europe will only become stronger when it deals with the right issues .
and the constitution guarantees that it will do so . "
german foreign minister joschka fischer , one of the staunchest advocates of the constitution , argued that an enlarged european union is an effective political union , not a bureaucratic behemoth .
" the european union with 15 members hasn ’ t achieved in three summits what the enlarged eu of 25 members managed in only six months and two summits , " fischer said .
" this goes to show that accusations a larger europe is unmanageable are wrong .
the constitutional process has proved the european union is working . "
fischer also said he was convinced that the new constitution would overcome the widespread lack of interest about europe among its populations , and enhance their willingness to participate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. werner hoyer but werner hoyer -lrb- photo -rrb- , a parliamentarian from the liberal free democratic party , retorted that one reason germans are not interested in europe is that they are not given a say in adopting the constitution .
" germans are skeptical , uninterested and misinformed about the constitution because the political establishment doesn ’ t see the need to campaign for the document in a referendum , " he said .
" if we would be forced to wage a public information campaign , all of us would have to work really hard .
parliament ’ s refusal to hold a referendum on the constitution is hugely lamentable and will not serve our common cause . "
numerous eu state have decided to put the constitution to a popular vote .
spanish voters approved the document on sunday , in the first in a series of referendums .
points of controversy in spite of the general , cross-party political consensus in germany on the constitution , there is also controversy on the rights of control by national parliaments to be included in the annex to the draft .
germany ’ s conservative opposition wants parliament to be allowed to reprimand brussels and be given the right to sue before the european court , for example , in cases of violation of the subsidiarity principle .
the subsidiary principle obliges the european commission to restrict itself to legislation whose objectives can not be better achieved by the member states themselves .
they also want a strong national say on the possible entry of turkey into the eu , a move which the cdu flatly rejects at the moment .
so in the end , the ratification process in germany may take a while .
and joschka fischer 's much hoped-for signal to europe - a speedy ratification - is unlikely to materialize . uwe hessler -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a rough road to ratification three countries have already said " yes " to the eu constitution .

" this goes to show that accusations a larger europe is unmanageable are wrong .
the constitutional process has proved the european union is working . "

" if we would be forced to wage a public information campaign , all of us would have to work really hard .

germany ’ s conservative opposition wants parliament to be allowed to reprimand brussels and be given the right to sue before the european court , for example , in cases of violation of the subsidiarity principle .
the subsidiary principle obliges the european commission to restrict itself to legislation whose objectives can not be better achieved by the member states themselves .
they also want a strong national say on the possible entry of turkey into the eu , a move which the cdu flatly rejects at the moment .

"
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. president george w. bush , left , listens to russian president vladimir putin during their meeting in the castle in bratislava , slovakia .
the two leaders said they had instructed their trade ministers to accelerate bilateral wto negotiations .
" we will work to identify areas for progress in our bilateral negotiations that will give momentum to russia 's accession to the wto , " they said .
they also agreed to enhance their joint efforts to counter the threat of nuclear terrorism by safeguarding atomic facilities and preparing emergency response capabilities .
the two sides said they agreed that security at nuclear facilities needs to be " constantly enhanced " to thwart terrorists .
the accord between washington and moscow came days after a us intelligence report said theft of radioactive materials from russian nuclear facilities " has occurred . "
missile accord bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovakian riot police equipment hangs on a security fence underneath the bratislava castle , in bratislava the tightly guarded meeting , at bratislava castle , in slovakia , opened with tensions over autocratic reforms in russia and moscow 's nuclear cooperation with iran topping the agenda .
but even before bush and putin crossed the threshold of the castle for their meeting , the two sides announced a deal on curbing the spread of shoulder-fired missiles that terrorists could use to shoot down airplanes .
the world leaders seemed to be trying to inject fresh warmth to their once excellent personal relationship , which has cooled since the iraq war and led to concerns that the former cold war foes may again be turning into rivals .
ahead of their talks , which were due to last at least 90 minutes , bush gave his strongest endorsement yet of european efforts to convince iran not to develop nuclear weapons and said he hoped for a peaceful end to the dispute .
" hopefully we 'll be able to reach a diplomatic solution to this effort .
we 're more likely to do so when we 're all on the same page , " said bush , who in the past has stressed that he can not rule out using force against tehran .
disagreements growing vocal bildunterschrift : view of the bratislava castle where thursday 's summit between u.s. president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin takes place .
bush 's talk with putin was their first in person since an asia-pacific summit in chile last november , when the us leader privately questioned his counterpart on moves that were widely seen as setting back democracy in russia .
their disagreements , muted over the past three years by the war on terrorism , have grown more vocal since bush placed a renewed emphasis in his second term on promoting democracy and confronting iran and syria .
bush began his day by meeting with slovakia 's president ivan gasparovic and prime minister mikulas dzurinda , before making an emotionally charged speech to thousands of cheering slovak citizens in a town square .
bush vowed to stand with slovakia 's young democracy and hailed what he called a " purple revolution " in iraq , where ink of that color was used to mark those who voted in january 30 elections .
pressure over iran expected he likened that vote to the velvet revolution that broke the hold of communism here nearly 16 years ago , saying : " to the iraqi people , this is their 1989 , and they will always remember who stood with them in their quest for freedom . "
bush also predicted thursday that former soviet republics moldova and belarus would embrace democracy , and saluted nato 's eastward expansion - all sources of concern in moscow .
bush was expected to press putin on iran , which washington accuses of trying to acquire nuclear weapons , and on syria , which washington insists must withdraw all of its troops and " secret services " from lebanon .
putin recently agreed to sell missile systems to syria , while declaring there is " no evidence " that iran is seeking an atomic bomb and has stepped up russian cooperation with tehran on nuclear technology . afp / dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush prepares to lock horns with putin president bush meets with his russian counterpart vladimir putin in bratislava on thursday armed with a warning that moscow must renew its commitment to democracy and advocating a hard line on iran .

" hopefully we 'll be able to reach a diplomatic solution to this effort .
we 're more likely to do so when we 're all on the same page , " said bush , who in the past has stressed that he can not rule out using force against tehran .
disagreements growing vocal bildunterschrift : view of the bratislava castle where thursday 's summit between u.s. president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin takes place .
bush 's talk with putin was their first in person since an asia-pacific summit in chile last november , when the us leader privately questioned his counterpart on moves that were widely seen as setting back democracy in russia .
their disagreements , muted over the past three years by the war on terrorism , have grown more vocal since bush placed a renewed emphasis in his second term on promoting democracy and confronting iran and syria .
bush began his day by meeting with slovakia 's president ivan gasparovic and prime minister mikulas dzurinda , before making an emotionally charged speech to thousands of cheering slovak citizens in a town square .
bush vowed to stand with slovakia 's young democracy and hailed what he called a " purple revolution " in iraq , where ink of that color was used to mark those who voted in january 30 elections .
pressure over iran expected he likened that vote to the velvet revolution that broke the hold of communism here nearly 16 years ago , saying : " to the iraqi people , this is their 1989 , and they will always remember who stood with them in their quest for freedom . "
bush also predicted thursday that former soviet republics moldova and belarus would embrace democracy , and saluted nato 's eastward expansion - all sources of concern in moscow .
bush was expected to press putin on iran , which washington accuses of trying to acquire nuclear weapons , and on syria , which washington insists must withdraw all of its troops and " secret services " from lebanon .
putin recently agreed to sell missile systems to syria , while declaring there is " no evidence " that iran is seeking an atomic bomb and has stepped up russian cooperation with tehran on nuclear technology . afp / dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush prepares to lock horns with putin president bush meets with his russian counterpart vladimir putin in bratislava on thursday armed with a warning that moscow must renew its commitment to democracy and advocating a hard line on iran .

"
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. president george w. bush , left , listens to russian president vladimir putin during their meeting in the castle in bratislava , slovakia .
the two leaders said they had instructed their trade ministers to accelerate bilateral wto negotiations .
" we will work to identify areas for progress in our bilateral negotiations that will give momentum to russia 's accession to the wto , " they said .
they also agreed to enhance their joint efforts to counter the threat of nuclear terrorism by safeguarding atomic facilities and preparing emergency response capabilities .
the two sides said they agreed that security at nuclear facilities needs to be " constantly enhanced " to thwart terrorists .
the accord between washington and moscow came days after a us intelligence report said theft of radioactive materials from russian nuclear facilities " has occurred . "
missile accord bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovakian riot police equipment hangs on a security fence underneath the bratislava castle , in bratislava the tightly guarded meeting , at bratislava castle , in slovakia , opened with tensions over autocratic reforms in russia and moscow 's nuclear cooperation with iran topping the agenda .
but even before bush and putin crossed the threshold of the castle for their meeting , the two sides announced a deal on curbing the spread of shoulder-fired missiles that terrorists could use to shoot down airplanes .
the world leaders seemed to be trying to inject fresh warmth to their once excellent personal relationship , which has cooled since the iraq war and led to concerns that the former cold war foes may again be turning into rivals .

but some lawmakers lamented the lack of a popular referendum . the german parliament has begun the legislative process leading towards ratification of the eu constitution - amid unusual harmony among politicians of all stripes .
for the most part , german lawmakers have praised the constitution , calling it a milestone on the way to a stronger and more integrated european union .

" europe won ’ t grow stronger when it deals with thousands of issues .
europe will only become stronger when it deals with the right issues .

german foreign minister joschka fischer , one of the staunchest advocates of the constitution , argued that an enlarged european union is an effective political union , not a bureaucratic behemoth .
" the european union with 15 members hasn ’ t achieved in three summits what the enlarged eu of 25 members managed in only six months and two summits , " fischer said .
" this goes to show that accusations a larger europe is unmanageable are wrong .
the constitutional process has proved the european union is working . "
fischer also said he was convinced that the new constitution would overcome the widespread lack of interest about europe among its populations , and enhance their willingness to participate .

germany ’ s conservative opposition wants parliament to be allowed to reprimand brussels and be given the right to sue before the european court , for example , in cases of violation of the subsidiarity principle .
the subsidiary principle obliges the european commission to restrict itself to legislation whose objectives can not be better achieved by the member states themselves .
they also want a strong national say on the possible entry of turkey into the eu , a move which the cdu flatly rejects at the moment .

but some lawmakers lamented the lack of a popular referendum . the german parliament has begun the legislative process leading towards ratification of the eu constitution - amid unusual harmony among politicians of all stripes .
for the most part , german lawmakers have praised the constitution , calling it a milestone on the way to a stronger and more integrated european union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baden-württemberg premier erwin teufel erwin teufel -lrb- photo -rrb- , the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- state premier of baden-württemberg and a member of the eu convention that worked out the document last year , recalled the old divisions and wars in europe which preceded the current climate of peace and unity on the continent .
eu is bigger - and more effective the constitution will give europe " a new shape and a future , " teufel said .
" europe won ’ t grow stronger when it deals with thousands of issues .
europe will only become stronger when it deals with the right issues .
and the constitution guarantees that it will do so . "
german foreign minister joschka fischer , one of the staunchest advocates of the constitution , argued that an enlarged european union is an effective political union , not a bureaucratic behemoth .
" the european union with 15 members hasn ’ t achieved in three summits what the enlarged eu of 25 members managed in only six months and two summits , " fischer said .
" this goes to show that accusations a larger europe is unmanageable are wrong .
the constitutional process has proved the european union is working . "
fischer also said he was convinced that the new constitution would overcome the widespread lack of interest about europe among its populations , and enhance their willingness to participate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. werner hoyer but werner hoyer -lrb- photo -rrb- , a parliamentarian from the liberal free democratic party , retorted that one reason germans are not interested in europe is that they are not given a say in adopting the constitution .
" germans are skeptical , uninterested and misinformed about the constitution because the political establishment doesn ’ t see the need to campaign for the document in a referendum , " he said .
" if we would be forced to wage a public information campaign , all of us would have to work really hard .
parliament ’ s refusal to hold a referendum on the constitution is hugely lamentable and will not serve our common cause . "
numerous eu state have decided to put the constitution to a popular vote .
spanish voters approved the document on sunday , in the first in a series of referendums .
points of controversy in spite of the general , cross-party political consensus in germany on the constitution , there is also controversy on the rights of control by national parliaments to be included in the annex to the draft .
germany ’ s conservative opposition wants parliament to be allowed to reprimand brussels and be given the right to sue before the european court , for example , in cases of violation of the subsidiarity principle .
the subsidiary principle obliges the european commission to restrict itself to legislation whose objectives can not be better achieved by the member states themselves .
they also want a strong national say on the possible entry of turkey into the eu , a move which the cdu flatly rejects at the moment .
so in the end , the ratification process in germany may take a while .
and joschka fischer 's much hoped-for signal to europe - a speedy ratification - is unlikely to materialize . uwe hessler -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a rough road to ratification three countries have already said " yes " to the eu constitution .
on sunday , spain becomes the first country to put the matter directly to the people .

"
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. president george w. bush , left , listens to russian president vladimir putin during their meeting in the castle in bratislava , slovakia .
the two leaders said they had instructed their trade ministers to accelerate bilateral wto negotiations .
" we will work to identify areas for progress in our bilateral negotiations that will give momentum to russia 's accession to the wto , " they said .
they also agreed to enhance their joint efforts to counter the threat of nuclear terrorism by safeguarding atomic facilities and preparing emergency response capabilities .
the two sides said they agreed that security at nuclear facilities needs to be " constantly enhanced " to thwart terrorists .
the accord between washington and moscow came days after a us intelligence report said theft of radioactive materials from russian nuclear facilities " has occurred . "

but even before bush and putin crossed the threshold of the castle for their meeting , the two sides announced a deal on curbing the spread of shoulder-fired missiles that terrorists could use to shoot down airplanes .
the world leaders seemed to be trying to inject fresh warmth to their once excellent personal relationship , which has cooled since the iraq war and led to concerns that the former cold war foes may again be turning into rivals .
ahead of their talks , which were due to last at least 90 minutes , bush gave his strongest endorsement yet of european efforts to convince iran not to develop nuclear weapons and said he hoped for a peaceful end to the dispute .
" hopefully we 'll be able to reach a diplomatic solution to this effort .

bush 's talk with putin was their first in person since an asia-pacific summit in chile last november , when the us leader privately questioned his counterpart on moves that were widely seen as setting back democracy in russia .
their disagreements , muted over the past three years by the war on terrorism , have grown more vocal since bush placed a renewed emphasis in his second term on promoting democracy and confronting iran and syria .
bush began his day by meeting with slovakia 's president ivan gasparovic and prime minister mikulas dzurinda , before making an emotionally charged speech to thousands of cheering slovak citizens in a town square .
bush vowed to stand with slovakia 's young democracy and hailed what he called a " purple revolution " in iraq , where ink of that color was used to mark those who voted in january 30 elections .
pressure over iran expected he likened that vote to the velvet revolution that broke the hold of communism here nearly 16 years ago , saying : " to the iraqi people , this is their 1989 , and they will always remember who stood with them in their quest for freedom . "
bush also predicted thursday that former soviet republics moldova and belarus would embrace democracy , and saluted nato 's eastward expansion - all sources of concern in moscow .
bush was expected to press putin on iran , which washington accuses of trying to acquire nuclear weapons , and on syria , which washington insists must withdraw all of its troops and " secret services " from lebanon .
putin recently agreed to sell missile systems to syria , while declaring there is " no evidence " that iran is seeking an atomic bomb and has stepped up russian cooperation with tehran on nuclear technology . afp / dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush prepares to lock horns with putin president bush meets with his russian counterpart vladimir putin in bratislava on thursday armed with a warning that moscow must renew its commitment to democracy and advocating a hard line on iran .

" hopefully we 'll be able to reach a diplomatic solution to this effort .
we 're more likely to do so when we 're all on the same page , " said bush , who in the past has stressed that he can not rule out using force against tehran .
disagreements growing vocal bildunterschrift : view of the bratislava castle where thursday 's summit between u.s. president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin takes place .
bush 's talk with putin was their first in person since an asia-pacific summit in chile last november , when the us leader privately questioned his counterpart on moves that were widely seen as setting back democracy in russia .
their disagreements , muted over the past three years by the war on terrorism , have grown more vocal since bush placed a renewed emphasis in his second term on promoting democracy and confronting iran and syria .
bush began his day by meeting with slovakia 's president ivan gasparovic and prime minister mikulas dzurinda , before making an emotionally charged speech to thousands of cheering slovak citizens in a town square .
bush vowed to stand with slovakia 's young democracy and hailed what he called a " purple revolution " in iraq , where ink of that color was used to mark those who voted in january 30 elections .
pressure over iran expected he likened that vote to the velvet revolution that broke the hold of communism here nearly 16 years ago , saying : " to the iraqi people , this is their 1989 , and they will always remember who stood with them in their quest for freedom . "
bush also predicted thursday that former soviet republics moldova and belarus would embrace democracy , and saluted nato 's eastward expansion - all sources of concern in moscow .
bush was expected to press putin on iran , which washington accuses of trying to acquire nuclear weapons , and on syria , which washington insists must withdraw all of its troops and " secret services " from lebanon .
putin recently agreed to sell missile systems to syria , while declaring there is " no evidence " that iran is seeking an atomic bomb and has stepped up russian cooperation with tehran on nuclear technology . afp / dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush prepares to lock horns with putin president bush meets with his russian counterpart vladimir putin in bratislava on thursday armed with a warning that moscow must renew its commitment to democracy and advocating a hard line on iran .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.02.2005 approval of eu constitution may take time großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder , left , aided the spanish vote but does n't want one at home joschka fischer has called on lawmakers to quickly ratify the european union constitution , in order to set an example for other eu countries .
but some lawmakers lamented the lack of a popular referendum . the german parliament has begun the legislative process leading towards ratification of the eu constitution - amid unusual harmony among politicians of all stripes .
for the most part , german lawmakers have praised the constitution , calling it a milestone on the way to a stronger and more integrated european union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baden-württemberg premier erwin teufel erwin teufel -lrb- photo -rrb- , the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- state premier of baden-württemberg and a member of the eu convention that worked out the document last year , recalled the old divisions and wars in europe which preceded the current climate of peace and unity on the continent .
eu is bigger - and more effective the constitution will give europe " a new shape and a future , " teufel said .
" europe won ’ t grow stronger when it deals with thousands of issues .
europe will only become stronger when it deals with the right issues .
and the constitution guarantees that it will do so . "
german foreign minister joschka fischer , one of the staunchest advocates of the constitution , argued that an enlarged european union is an effective political union , not a bureaucratic behemoth .
" the european union with 15 members hasn ’ t achieved in three summits what the enlarged eu of 25 members managed in only six months and two summits , " fischer said .
" this goes to show that accusations a larger europe is unmanageable are wrong .
the constitutional process has proved the european union is working . "
fischer also said he was convinced that the new constitution would overcome the widespread lack of interest about europe among its populations , and enhance their willingness to participate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. werner hoyer but werner hoyer -lrb- photo -rrb- , a parliamentarian from the liberal free democratic party , retorted that one reason germans are not interested in europe is that they are not given a say in adopting the constitution .
" germans are skeptical , uninterested and misinformed about the constitution because the political establishment doesn ’ t see the need to campaign for the document in a referendum , " he said .
" if we would be forced to wage a public information campaign , all of us would have to work really hard .
parliament ’ s refusal to hold a referendum on the constitution is hugely lamentable and will not serve our common cause . "
numerous eu state have decided to put the constitution to a popular vote .
spanish voters approved the document on sunday , in the first in a series of referendums .
points of controversy in spite of the general , cross-party political consensus in germany on the constitution , there is also controversy on the rights of control by national parliaments to be included in the annex to the draft .
germany ’ s conservative opposition wants parliament to be allowed to reprimand brussels and be given the right to sue before the european court , for example , in cases of violation of the subsidiarity principle .
the subsidiary principle obliges the european commission to restrict itself to legislation whose objectives can not be better achieved by the member states themselves .
they also want a strong national say on the possible entry of turkey into the eu , a move which the cdu flatly rejects at the moment .
so in the end , the ratification process in germany may take a while .
and joschka fischer 's much hoped-for signal to europe - a speedy ratification - is unlikely to materialize . uwe hessler -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a rough road to ratification three countries have already said " yes " to the eu constitution .
on sunday , spain becomes the first country to put the matter directly to the people .

shortly afterwards , three of her brothers - who reportedly had long been threatening her - were arrested .
investigators suspect it was a so-called " honor killing , " given the fact that sürücü 's ultra-conservative turkish-kurdish family strongly disapproved of her modern and " un-islamic " life . sürücü grew up in berlin and was married off at 16 to a cousin in istanbul .

the murder of a turkish woman and the applauding of the crime by some students have left berlin shaken and officials pushing for ethics class .
but how deep does the concept of honor run among some immigrant communities ? on a cold afternoon this week , hatin sürücü gazed gravely from a large poster behind a bus stop lined with flowers , cards and candles . to the people who came to this bleak part of berlin 's tempelhof district for tuesday 's solemn vigil - called not by the city 's muslim community but a gay and lesbian organization - the image of the young woman in a headscarf , a baby in her arms , was familiar from newspapers and television .
a few notes at the memorial read , " hope you get a better deal in your next life , " and " live a life on your own terms . " " it 's a scandal , " said ali k , 33 .
" all muslims in berlin should take to the streets to protest . "
yasemin , 22 , said , " it 's horrific .
all hatin was doing was leading her life the way she wanted . " but it was a choice she paid for with her life .
on feb .
7 , 23-year-old hatin sürücü was gunned down at the aforementioned bus stop .
she died on the spot .
shortly afterwards , three of her brothers - who reportedly had long been threatening her - were arrested .
investigators suspect it was a so-called " honor killing , " given the fact that sürücü 's ultra-conservative turkish-kurdish family strongly disapproved of her modern and " un-islamic " life . sürücü grew up in berlin and was married off at 16 to a cousin in istanbul .
after a few years , she returned to the german capital with her young son , moved into a home for single mothers , completed school and began to train as an electrician .
she stopped wearing a headscarf and was said to be outgoing and vivacious . " she lived like a german " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish women in a mosque in berlin 's kreuzberg district though not the first of its kind , the brazen shooting has sent shockwaves through berlin , home to a large foreign community and which for years has fretted over steady ghetto-building in districts dominated by turkish and arab immigrants .
while the incident has reopened debate on the integration of immigrants and the compatibility of islamic values with western ones , it ’ s the reaction of a small group of turkish students to the murder that has rattled the german capital . days after hatin sürücü was killed , some male students of turkish origin at a high school near the scene of the crime reportedly downplayed the act .
during a class discussion on the murder , one said , " she -lrb- hatin sürücü -rrb- only had herself to blame , " while another remarked " she deserved what she got - the whore lived like a german . "
the school 's director promptly dashed off a letter to parents and students , castigating the students and warning that the school didn ’ t tolerate incitement against freedom . " her lifestyle did n't fit " the comments have sparked outrage and left many asking if it was just a one-off or whether such thinking is in fact not entirely uncommon among sections of the muslim community in the city . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to some , it is n't .
" there is n't a single school with a high foreign population where teachers have n't faced this kind of thing , where individual students sometimes regard murder as a just sentence , " said heinz wagner , head of school and education policy at the vbe teachers trade union and a school director himself .
referring to the controversial remarks on sürücü 's murder , he said , " the very fact that they decided to provoke with something like that tells you that they 're getting their ideas from somewhere . " at berlin 's turkish-dominated neighborhood near kottbusser tor in the kreuzberg district , 17-year-old erkan , a high school student of turkish origin , was divided about the issue .

but it is his condemnation of abortion and same-sex marriage in the 227-page book " memory and identity " that has caused sharp criticism and controversy . the 84-year-old muses about the competing forces of good and evil in the world and history within the book , with special attention on the horrors committed by the nazis and by communist regimes . in one passage , after evoking the massacre of jews by the nazis in the holocaust , the pope writes that the democratically elected parliaments that replaced brutal authoritarian regimes in some countries continue to carry out murder on a huge scale by allowing abortion . " there is still , however , a legal extermination of human beings who have been conceived but not yet born , " the pope writes .
" and this time , we are talking about an extermination which has been allowed by nothing less than democratically elected parliaments . " germany 's jews criticize catholic view many critics have drawn a direct line between the pope 's reference to the holocaust and abortion , something jewish groups in germany immediately seized upon . " the catholic church does not understand or does not want to understand that there is an enormous difference between mass genocide and what women do to their own bodies , " paul spiegel , the president of the central council for jews in germany , said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cardinal joseph ratzinger of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith .
german cardinal joseph ratzinger , prefect of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith , the roman catholic church 's doctrinal watchdog , defended the pope and argued that misinterpretation had resulted in unwarranted criticism . german cardinal defends pontiff ratzinger , who has been touted as a possible successor to the ailing pontiff , told a new conference earlier this week that the pope " was not trying to put the holocaust and abortion on the same plane . "
it was the pope 's intention , he added , to show the pervasiveness of evil , " even in liberal political systems . " the book further echoes similar remarks made by the cardinal of cologne , joachim meisner , who declared in a sermon in january : " first there was herod , who ordered the children of bethlehem to be killed , then there was hitler and stalin among others , and today unborn children are being killed in their millions . "
meisner later expressed regret for his comparison . in other areas of the pontiff 's book , the pope discusses the fear within the vatican that rampant relativism and secularism are causing the decay of christian values in europe and beyond .
he uses the debate on same-sex marriages as an example . same-sex marriages part of " new evil " # bhe ponders whether the european parliament has been put under pressure to legalize same-sex marriage as " part of a new ideology of evil , perhaps more insidious and hidden , which attempts to pit human rights against the family and against man . " the book , based on conversations the pope had in polish with two friends , the philosopher krzysztof michalski and the late father jozef tischner , at the papal summer residence near rome in 1993 , also says terrorist networks represent " a constant threat to the life of millions of innocents , " and specifically mentions the sept .

the murder of a turkish woman and the applauding of the crime by some students have left berlin shaken and officials pushing for ethics class .
but how deep does the concept of honor run among some immigrant communities ? on a cold afternoon this week , hatin sürücü gazed gravely from a large poster behind a bus stop lined with flowers , cards and candles . to the people who came to this bleak part of berlin 's tempelhof district for tuesday 's solemn vigil - called not by the city 's muslim community but a gay and lesbian organization - the image of the young woman in a headscarf , a baby in her arms , was familiar from newspapers and television .
a few notes at the memorial read , " hope you get a better deal in your next life , " and " live a life on your own terms . " " it 's a scandal , " said ali k , 33 .

"
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. president george w. bush , left , listens to russian president vladimir putin during their meeting in the castle in bratislava , slovakia .
the two leaders said they had instructed their trade ministers to accelerate bilateral wto negotiations .
" we will work to identify areas for progress in our bilateral negotiations that will give momentum to russia 's accession to the wto , " they said .
they also agreed to enhance their joint efforts to counter the threat of nuclear terrorism by safeguarding atomic facilities and preparing emergency response capabilities .
the two sides said they agreed that security at nuclear facilities needs to be " constantly enhanced " to thwart terrorists .
the accord between washington and moscow came days after a us intelligence report said theft of radioactive materials from russian nuclear facilities " has occurred . "
missile accord bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovakian riot police equipment hangs on a security fence underneath the bratislava castle , in bratislava the tightly guarded meeting , at bratislava castle , in slovakia , opened with tensions over autocratic reforms in russia and moscow 's nuclear cooperation with iran topping the agenda .
but even before bush and putin crossed the threshold of the castle for their meeting , the two sides announced a deal on curbing the spread of shoulder-fired missiles that terrorists could use to shoot down airplanes .
the world leaders seemed to be trying to inject fresh warmth to their once excellent personal relationship , which has cooled since the iraq war and led to concerns that the former cold war foes may again be turning into rivals .
ahead of their talks , which were due to last at least 90 minutes , bush gave his strongest endorsement yet of european efforts to convince iran not to develop nuclear weapons and said he hoped for a peaceful end to the dispute .
" hopefully we 'll be able to reach a diplomatic solution to this effort .
we 're more likely to do so when we 're all on the same page , " said bush , who in the past has stressed that he can not rule out using force against tehran .
disagreements growing vocal bildunterschrift : view of the bratislava castle where thursday 's summit between u.s. president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin takes place .
bush 's talk with putin was their first in person since an asia-pacific summit in chile last november , when the us leader privately questioned his counterpart on moves that were widely seen as setting back democracy in russia .
their disagreements , muted over the past three years by the war on terrorism , have grown more vocal since bush placed a renewed emphasis in his second term on promoting democracy and confronting iran and syria .
bush began his day by meeting with slovakia 's president ivan gasparovic and prime minister mikulas dzurinda , before making an emotionally charged speech to thousands of cheering slovak citizens in a town square .
bush vowed to stand with slovakia 's young democracy and hailed what he called a " purple revolution " in iraq , where ink of that color was used to mark those who voted in january 30 elections .
pressure over iran expected he likened that vote to the velvet revolution that broke the hold of communism here nearly 16 years ago , saying : " to the iraqi people , this is their 1989 , and they will always remember who stood with them in their quest for freedom . "
bush also predicted thursday that former soviet republics moldova and belarus would embrace democracy , and saluted nato 's eastward expansion - all sources of concern in moscow .
bush was expected to press putin on iran , which washington accuses of trying to acquire nuclear weapons , and on syria , which washington insists must withdraw all of its troops and " secret services " from lebanon .
putin recently agreed to sell missile systems to syria , while declaring there is " no evidence " that iran is seeking an atomic bomb and has stepped up russian cooperation with tehran on nuclear technology . afp / dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush prepares to lock horns with putin president bush meets with his russian counterpart vladimir putin in bratislava on thursday armed with a warning that moscow must renew its commitment to democracy and advocating a hard line on iran .

but it is his condemnation of abortion and same-sex marriage in the 227-page book " memory and identity " that has caused sharp criticism and controversy . the 84-year-old muses about the competing forces of good and evil in the world and history within the book , with special attention on the horrors committed by the nazis and by communist regimes . in one passage , after evoking the massacre of jews by the nazis in the holocaust , the pope writes that the democratically elected parliaments that replaced brutal authoritarian regimes in some countries continue to carry out murder on a huge scale by allowing abortion . " there is still , however , a legal extermination of human beings who have been conceived but not yet born , " the pope writes .
" and this time , we are talking about an extermination which has been allowed by nothing less than democratically elected parliaments . " germany 's jews criticize catholic view many critics have drawn a direct line between the pope 's reference to the holocaust and abortion , something jewish groups in germany immediately seized upon .

"
meisner later expressed regret for his comparison . in other areas of the pontiff 's book , the pope discusses the fear within the vatican that rampant relativism and secularism are causing the decay of christian values in europe and beyond .
he uses the debate on same-sex marriages as an example . same-sex marriages part of " new evil " # bhe ponders whether the european parliament has been put under pressure to legalize same-sex marriage as " part of a new ideology of evil , perhaps more insidious and hidden , which attempts to pit human rights against the family and against man .

but it is his condemnation of abortion and same-sex marriage in the 227-page book " memory and identity " that has caused sharp criticism and controversy . the 84-year-old muses about the competing forces of good and evil in the world and history within the book , with special attention on the horrors committed by the nazis and by communist regimes . in one passage , after evoking the massacre of jews by the nazis in the holocaust , the pope writes that the democratically elected parliaments that replaced brutal authoritarian regimes in some countries continue to carry out murder on a huge scale by allowing abortion . " there is still , however , a legal extermination of human beings who have been conceived but not yet born , " the pope writes .
" and this time , we are talking about an extermination which has been allowed by nothing less than democratically elected parliaments . " germany 's jews criticize catholic view many critics have drawn a direct line between the pope 's reference to the holocaust and abortion , something jewish groups in germany immediately seized upon . " the catholic church does not understand or does not want to understand that there is an enormous difference between mass genocide and what women do to their own bodies , " paul spiegel , the president of the central council for jews in germany , said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cardinal joseph ratzinger of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith .
german cardinal joseph ratzinger , prefect of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith , the roman catholic church 's doctrinal watchdog , defended the pope and argued that misinterpretation had resulted in unwarranted criticism . german cardinal defends pontiff ratzinger , who has been touted as a possible successor to the ailing pontiff , told a new conference earlier this week that the pope " was not trying to put the holocaust and abortion on the same plane . "
it was the pope 's intention , he added , to show the pervasiveness of evil , " even in liberal political systems . " the book further echoes similar remarks made by the cardinal of cologne , joachim meisner , who declared in a sermon in january : " first there was herod , who ordered the children of bethlehem to be killed , then there was hitler and stalin among others , and today unborn children are being killed in their millions . "
meisner later expressed regret for his comparison . in other areas of the pontiff 's book , the pope discusses the fear within the vatican that rampant relativism and secularism are causing the decay of christian values in europe and beyond .
he uses the debate on same-sex marriages as an example . same-sex marriages part of " new evil " # bhe ponders whether the european parliament has been put under pressure to legalize same-sex marriage as " part of a new ideology of evil , perhaps more insidious and hidden , which attempts to pit human rights against the family and against man . " the book , based on conversations the pope had in polish with two friends , the philosopher krzysztof michalski and the late father jozef tischner , at the papal summer residence near rome in 1993 , also says terrorist networks represent " a constant threat to the life of millions of innocents , " and specifically mentions the sept .

they marched through the eerily empty downtown .
at the very least , their banners and posters - for example " bush go home , " " war monger , " and " no. 1 terrorist " - proclaimed their dislike and distrust of the u.s. president .
in general , the protesters ' complaints were about bush 's policies in iraq and his refusal to sign the kyoto treaty to curb global warming .
and despite official comments from bush and chancellor schröder about their disagreements being past , the demonstrators in mainz seemed doubtful about any possible rapprochement between the us and german governments .

but some lawmakers lamented the lack of a popular referendum . the german parliament has begun the legislative process leading towards ratification of the eu constitution - amid unusual harmony among politicians of all stripes .
for the most part , german lawmakers have praised the constitution , calling it a milestone on the way to a stronger and more integrated european union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baden-württemberg premier erwin teufel erwin teufel -lrb- photo -rrb- , the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- state premier of baden-württemberg and a member of the eu convention that worked out the document last year , recalled the old divisions and wars in europe which preceded the current climate of peace and unity on the continent .
eu is bigger - and more effective the constitution will give europe " a new shape and a future , " teufel said .
" europe won ’ t grow stronger when it deals with thousands of issues .
europe will only become stronger when it deals with the right issues .
and the constitution guarantees that it will do so . "
german foreign minister joschka fischer , one of the staunchest advocates of the constitution , argued that an enlarged european union is an effective political union , not a bureaucratic behemoth .
" the european union with 15 members hasn ’ t achieved in three summits what the enlarged eu of 25 members managed in only six months and two summits , " fischer said .
" this goes to show that accusations a larger europe is unmanageable are wrong .
the constitutional process has proved the european union is working . "
fischer also said he was convinced that the new constitution would overcome the widespread lack of interest about europe among its populations , and enhance their willingness to participate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. werner hoyer but werner hoyer -lrb- photo -rrb- , a parliamentarian from the liberal free democratic party , retorted that one reason germans are not interested in europe is that they are not given a say in adopting the constitution .
" germans are skeptical , uninterested and misinformed about the constitution because the political establishment doesn ’ t see the need to campaign for the document in a referendum , " he said .
" if we would be forced to wage a public information campaign , all of us would have to work really hard .
parliament ’ s refusal to hold a referendum on the constitution is hugely lamentable and will not serve our common cause . "
numerous eu state have decided to put the constitution to a popular vote .
spanish voters approved the document on sunday , in the first in a series of referendums .
points of controversy in spite of the general , cross-party political consensus in germany on the constitution , there is also controversy on the rights of control by national parliaments to be included in the annex to the draft .
germany ’ s conservative opposition wants parliament to be allowed to reprimand brussels and be given the right to sue before the european court , for example , in cases of violation of the subsidiarity principle .
the subsidiary principle obliges the european commission to restrict itself to legislation whose objectives can not be better achieved by the member states themselves .
they also want a strong national say on the possible entry of turkey into the eu , a move which the cdu flatly rejects at the moment .

but it is his condemnation of abortion and same-sex marriage in the 227-page book " memory and identity " that has caused sharp criticism and controversy . the 84-year-old muses about the competing forces of good and evil in the world and history within the book , with special attention on the horrors committed by the nazis and by communist regimes . in one passage , after evoking the massacre of jews by the nazis in the holocaust , the pope writes that the democratically elected parliaments that replaced brutal authoritarian regimes in some countries continue to carry out murder on a huge scale by allowing abortion . " there is still , however , a legal extermination of human beings who have been conceived but not yet born , " the pope writes .
" and this time , we are talking about an extermination which has been allowed by nothing less than democratically elected parliaments . " germany 's jews criticize catholic view many critics have drawn a direct line between the pope 's reference to the holocaust and abortion , something jewish groups in germany immediately seized upon . " the catholic church does not understand or does not want to understand that there is an enormous difference between mass genocide and what women do to their own bodies , " paul spiegel , the president of the central council for jews in germany , said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cardinal joseph ratzinger of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith .
german cardinal joseph ratzinger , prefect of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith , the roman catholic church 's doctrinal watchdog , defended the pope and argued that misinterpretation had resulted in unwarranted criticism . german cardinal defends pontiff ratzinger , who has been touted as a possible successor to the ailing pontiff , told a new conference earlier this week that the pope " was not trying to put the holocaust and abortion on the same plane . "
it was the pope 's intention , he added , to show the pervasiveness of evil , " even in liberal political systems . " the book further echoes similar remarks made by the cardinal of cologne , joachim meisner , who declared in a sermon in january : " first there was herod , who ordered the children of bethlehem to be killed , then there was hitler and stalin among others , and today unborn children are being killed in their millions . "
meisner later expressed regret for his comparison . in other areas of the pontiff 's book , the pope discusses the fear within the vatican that rampant relativism and secularism are causing the decay of christian values in europe and beyond .
he uses the debate on same-sex marriages as an example . same-sex marriages part of " new evil " # bhe ponders whether the european parliament has been put under pressure to legalize same-sex marriage as " part of a new ideology of evil , perhaps more insidious and hidden , which attempts to pit human rights against the family and against man . " the book , based on conversations the pope had in polish with two friends , the philosopher krzysztof michalski and the late father jozef tischner , at the papal summer residence near rome in 1993 , also says terrorist networks represent " a constant threat to the life of millions of innocents , " and specifically mentions the sept .

but it is his condemnation of abortion and same-sex marriage in the 227-page book " memory and identity " that has caused sharp criticism and controversy . the 84-year-old muses about the competing forces of good and evil in the world and history within the book , with special attention on the horrors committed by the nazis and by communist regimes . in one passage , after evoking the massacre of jews by the nazis in the holocaust , the pope writes that the democratically elected parliaments that replaced brutal authoritarian regimes in some countries continue to carry out murder on a huge scale by allowing abortion . " there is still , however , a legal extermination of human beings who have been conceived but not yet born , " the pope writes .
" and this time , we are talking about an extermination which has been allowed by nothing less than democratically elected parliaments . " germany 's jews criticize catholic view many critics have drawn a direct line between the pope 's reference to the holocaust and abortion , something jewish groups in germany immediately seized upon . " the catholic church does not understand or does not want to understand that there is an enormous difference between mass genocide and what women do to their own bodies , " paul spiegel , the president of the central council for jews in germany , said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cardinal joseph ratzinger of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith .
german cardinal joseph ratzinger , prefect of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith , the roman catholic church 's doctrinal watchdog , defended the pope and argued that misinterpretation had resulted in unwarranted criticism . german cardinal defends pontiff ratzinger , who has been touted as a possible successor to the ailing pontiff , told a new conference earlier this week that the pope " was not trying to put the holocaust and abortion on the same plane . "
it was the pope 's intention , he added , to show the pervasiveness of evil , " even in liberal political systems . " the book further echoes similar remarks made by the cardinal of cologne , joachim meisner , who declared in a sermon in january : " first there was herod , who ordered the children of bethlehem to be killed , then there was hitler and stalin among others , and today unborn children are being killed in their millions . "
meisner later expressed regret for his comparison . in other areas of the pontiff 's book , the pope discusses the fear within the vatican that rampant relativism and secularism are causing the decay of christian values in europe and beyond .
he uses the debate on same-sex marriages as an example . same-sex marriages part of " new evil " # bhe ponders whether the european parliament has been put under pressure to legalize same-sex marriage as " part of a new ideology of evil , perhaps more insidious and hidden , which attempts to pit human rights against the family and against man . " the book , based on conversations the pope had in polish with two friends , the philosopher krzysztof michalski and the late father jozef tischner , at the papal summer residence near rome in 1993 , also says terrorist networks represent " a constant threat to the life of millions of innocents , " and specifically mentions the sept .

the highly populated country is one of the most attractive markets in asia behind china - a fact not lost on german airport operator fraport . in september 2003 , india 's government decided to sell 74 percent of india 's two major airports - delhi and mumbai .
now the government is looking for private companies to invest in the airports ' expansion .
as specialists estimate that the number of airline passengers is going to rise by 16 percent each year until 2010 , the investment in these airports promises a stake in a lucrative growth market . the frankfurt airport operating company fraport has been quick to realize this and has made its intentions towards india clear .
frank thiesen , assistant manager of the global investment and management division at fraport , has been busy preparing the division for the participation in one of the indian airports for the past one and a half years .
the process has been a long one for thiesen and his team .
firstly , partner companies with whom fraport sought to form a consortium with had to be selected .
at the same time the process of rapprochement to the indian government was underway .
fraport is planning to invest a total of € 30 to € 50 million -lrb- $ 40 to $ 66 million -rrb- for a stake of about 10 percent in one of the two airports .
" if we are going to be awarded the contract , we are going to first revise the airport 's internal company processes , " thiesen explained .
for this purpose , fraport personnel have to be sent to india , training programs have to be set up , and the infrastructure needs to be improved .
tough competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt international airport , operated by fraport .
about 10 more applicants are competing for the stake , among them consortia of the airports of paris , singapore , and hong kong .
the incentive is strong as the indian government 's liberalization strategy created new conditions for civil aviation policy .
since august 2003 , low-fare airlines have been given access to india 's domestic market .
more and more private airlines are coming to existence .
two of them , jet airways and air sahara , recently received permission to start service to international destinations .
with more than one billion people and an economic growth of more than eight percent , india is regarded as the most important asian market for the future next to china .
up to now , too much regulation of the aviation market , a thick jungle of bureaucracy and the protection of inefficient , run-down state airlines air india and indian airlines prevented private companies from raising the much invoked potential of the market .
private airlines contend that liberalizing of aviation policies is pointless if infrastructure is not massively extended at the same time .
metropolitan airports suffered from extreme overload , they say .
" if new airlines are to enter the market without infrastructure keeping up , the industry is headed for a disaster , " wolfgang prock-schauer , chief executive of the biggest private airline jet airways , warned .
the indian government has acknowledged this need and intends to invest a two-digit euro million amount into the extension of streets , railway , sea- and airports over the coming years .
a previous investment project failed a few years ago , fraport 's investment in the airport extension at the philippine capital manila was not successful .
europe 's second biggest airport company had to take the blow of losing € 300 million .
ever since , shareholders and analysts have kept a critical eye on fraport 's international activities .
" we learned from the experience , " fraport manager thiesen explains .
" nowadays we concentrate on smaller , specific management tasks and try to be on the safe side as far as possible . "
therefore , the frankfurt company prefers holding several small stakes over a few big ones .
this way , they keep the risk of a great loss smaller .
if fraport will get the chance for participation in india is going be decided in the summer .

the highly populated country is one of the most attractive markets in asia behind china - a fact not lost on german airport operator fraport . in september 2003 , india 's government decided to sell 74 percent of india 's two major airports - delhi and mumbai .
now the government is looking for private companies to invest in the airports ' expansion .
as specialists estimate that the number of airline passengers is going to rise by 16 percent each year until 2010 , the investment in these airports promises a stake in a lucrative growth market . the frankfurt airport operating company fraport has been quick to realize this and has made its intentions towards india clear .
frank thiesen , assistant manager of the global investment and management division at fraport , has been busy preparing the division for the participation in one of the indian airports for the past one and a half years .
the process has been a long one for thiesen and his team .
firstly , partner companies with whom fraport sought to form a consortium with had to be selected .
at the same time the process of rapprochement to the indian government was underway .
fraport is planning to invest a total of € 30 to € 50 million -lrb- $ 40 to $ 66 million -rrb- for a stake of about 10 percent in one of the two airports .
" if we are going to be awarded the contract , we are going to first revise the airport 's internal company processes , " thiesen explained .
for this purpose , fraport personnel have to be sent to india , training programs have to be set up , and the infrastructure needs to be improved .
tough competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt international airport , operated by fraport .
about 10 more applicants are competing for the stake , among them consortia of the airports of paris , singapore , and hong kong .
the incentive is strong as the indian government 's liberalization strategy created new conditions for civil aviation policy .
since august 2003 , low-fare airlines have been given access to india 's domestic market .
more and more private airlines are coming to existence .
two of them , jet airways and air sahara , recently received permission to start service to international destinations .
with more than one billion people and an economic growth of more than eight percent , india is regarded as the most important asian market for the future next to china .
up to now , too much regulation of the aviation market , a thick jungle of bureaucracy and the protection of inefficient , run-down state airlines air india and indian airlines prevented private companies from raising the much invoked potential of the market .
private airlines contend that liberalizing of aviation policies is pointless if infrastructure is not massively extended at the same time .
metropolitan airports suffered from extreme overload , they say .
" if new airlines are to enter the market without infrastructure keeping up , the industry is headed for a disaster , " wolfgang prock-schauer , chief executive of the biggest private airline jet airways , warned .
the indian government has acknowledged this need and intends to invest a two-digit euro million amount into the extension of streets , railway , sea- and airports over the coming years .
a previous investment project failed a few years ago , fraport 's investment in the airport extension at the philippine capital manila was not successful .
europe 's second biggest airport company had to take the blow of losing € 300 million .
ever since , shareholders and analysts have kept a critical eye on fraport 's international activities .
" we learned from the experience , " fraport manager thiesen explains .
" nowadays we concentrate on smaller , specific management tasks and try to be on the safe side as far as possible . "
therefore , the frankfurt company prefers holding several small stakes over a few big ones .
this way , they keep the risk of a great loss smaller .
if fraport will get the chance for participation in india is going be decided in the summer .
then , india 's government will pick which applicant is going to be awarded the contract . ana lehmann -lrb- bm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu favors aviation tax to fund african aid a proposal put forward by germany and france to tax commercial aviation fuel to raise funds for development in africa was endorsed by the european union executive on tuesday .

"
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. president george w. bush , left , listens to russian president vladimir putin during their meeting in the castle in bratislava , slovakia .
the two leaders said they had instructed their trade ministers to accelerate bilateral wto negotiations .
" we will work to identify areas for progress in our bilateral negotiations that will give momentum to russia 's accession to the wto , " they said .
they also agreed to enhance their joint efforts to counter the threat of nuclear terrorism by safeguarding atomic facilities and preparing emergency response capabilities .
the two sides said they agreed that security at nuclear facilities needs to be " constantly enhanced " to thwart terrorists .
the accord between washington and moscow came days after a us intelligence report said theft of radioactive materials from russian nuclear facilities " has occurred . "
missile accord bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovakian riot police equipment hangs on a security fence underneath the bratislava castle , in bratislava the tightly guarded meeting , at bratislava castle , in slovakia , opened with tensions over autocratic reforms in russia and moscow 's nuclear cooperation with iran topping the agenda .
but even before bush and putin crossed the threshold of the castle for their meeting , the two sides announced a deal on curbing the spread of shoulder-fired missiles that terrorists could use to shoot down airplanes .
the world leaders seemed to be trying to inject fresh warmth to their once excellent personal relationship , which has cooled since the iraq war and led to concerns that the former cold war foes may again be turning into rivals .
ahead of their talks , which were due to last at least 90 minutes , bush gave his strongest endorsement yet of european efforts to convince iran not to develop nuclear weapons and said he hoped for a peaceful end to the dispute .
" hopefully we 'll be able to reach a diplomatic solution to this effort .
we 're more likely to do so when we 're all on the same page , " said bush , who in the past has stressed that he can not rule out using force against tehran .
disagreements growing vocal bildunterschrift : view of the bratislava castle where thursday 's summit between u.s. president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin takes place .
bush 's talk with putin was their first in person since an asia-pacific summit in chile last november , when the us leader privately questioned his counterpart on moves that were widely seen as setting back democracy in russia .
their disagreements , muted over the past three years by the war on terrorism , have grown more vocal since bush placed a renewed emphasis in his second term on promoting democracy and confronting iran and syria .
bush began his day by meeting with slovakia 's president ivan gasparovic and prime minister mikulas dzurinda , before making an emotionally charged speech to thousands of cheering slovak citizens in a town square .
bush vowed to stand with slovakia 's young democracy and hailed what he called a " purple revolution " in iraq , where ink of that color was used to mark those who voted in january 30 elections .
pressure over iran expected he likened that vote to the velvet revolution that broke the hold of communism here nearly 16 years ago , saying : " to the iraqi people , this is their 1989 , and they will always remember who stood with them in their quest for freedom . "
bush also predicted thursday that former soviet republics moldova and belarus would embrace democracy , and saluted nato 's eastward expansion - all sources of concern in moscow .
bush was expected to press putin on iran , which washington accuses of trying to acquire nuclear weapons , and on syria , which washington insists must withdraw all of its troops and " secret services " from lebanon .
putin recently agreed to sell missile systems to syria , while declaring there is " no evidence " that iran is seeking an atomic bomb and has stepped up russian cooperation with tehran on nuclear technology . afp / dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush prepares to lock horns with putin president bush meets with his russian counterpart vladimir putin in bratislava on thursday armed with a warning that moscow must renew its commitment to democracy and advocating a hard line on iran .

"
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. president george w. bush , left , listens to russian president vladimir putin during their meeting in the castle in bratislava , slovakia .
the two leaders said they had instructed their trade ministers to accelerate bilateral wto negotiations .
" we will work to identify areas for progress in our bilateral negotiations that will give momentum to russia 's accession to the wto , " they said .
they also agreed to enhance their joint efforts to counter the threat of nuclear terrorism by safeguarding atomic facilities and preparing emergency response capabilities .
the two sides said they agreed that security at nuclear facilities needs to be " constantly enhanced " to thwart terrorists .
the accord between washington and moscow came days after a us intelligence report said theft of radioactive materials from russian nuclear facilities " has occurred . "
missile accord bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovakian riot police equipment hangs on a security fence underneath the bratislava castle , in bratislava the tightly guarded meeting , at bratislava castle , in slovakia , opened with tensions over autocratic reforms in russia and moscow 's nuclear cooperation with iran topping the agenda .
but even before bush and putin crossed the threshold of the castle for their meeting , the two sides announced a deal on curbing the spread of shoulder-fired missiles that terrorists could use to shoot down airplanes .
the world leaders seemed to be trying to inject fresh warmth to their once excellent personal relationship , which has cooled since the iraq war and led to concerns that the former cold war foes may again be turning into rivals .
ahead of their talks , which were due to last at least 90 minutes , bush gave his strongest endorsement yet of european efforts to convince iran not to develop nuclear weapons and said he hoped for a peaceful end to the dispute .
" hopefully we 'll be able to reach a diplomatic solution to this effort .
we 're more likely to do so when we 're all on the same page , " said bush , who in the past has stressed that he can not rule out using force against tehran .
disagreements growing vocal bildunterschrift : view of the bratislava castle where thursday 's summit between u.s. president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin takes place .
bush 's talk with putin was their first in person since an asia-pacific summit in chile last november , when the us leader privately questioned his counterpart on moves that were widely seen as setting back democracy in russia .
their disagreements , muted over the past three years by the war on terrorism , have grown more vocal since bush placed a renewed emphasis in his second term on promoting democracy and confronting iran and syria .
bush began his day by meeting with slovakia 's president ivan gasparovic and prime minister mikulas dzurinda , before making an emotionally charged speech to thousands of cheering slovak citizens in a town square .
bush vowed to stand with slovakia 's young democracy and hailed what he called a " purple revolution " in iraq , where ink of that color was used to mark those who voted in january 30 elections .
pressure over iran expected he likened that vote to the velvet revolution that broke the hold of communism here nearly 16 years ago , saying : " to the iraqi people , this is their 1989 , and they will always remember who stood with them in their quest for freedom . "
bush also predicted thursday that former soviet republics moldova and belarus would embrace democracy , and saluted nato 's eastward expansion - all sources of concern in moscow .
bush was expected to press putin on iran , which washington accuses of trying to acquire nuclear weapons , and on syria , which washington insists must withdraw all of its troops and " secret services " from lebanon .
putin recently agreed to sell missile systems to syria , while declaring there is " no evidence " that iran is seeking an atomic bomb and has stepped up russian cooperation with tehran on nuclear technology . afp / dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush prepares to lock horns with putin president bush meets with his russian counterpart vladimir putin in bratislava on thursday armed with a warning that moscow must renew its commitment to democracy and advocating a hard line on iran .

the highly populated country is one of the most attractive markets in asia behind china - a fact not lost on german airport operator fraport . in september 2003 , india 's government decided to sell 74 percent of india 's two major airports - delhi and mumbai .
now the government is looking for private companies to invest in the airports ' expansion .
as specialists estimate that the number of airline passengers is going to rise by 16 percent each year until 2010 , the investment in these airports promises a stake in a lucrative growth market . the frankfurt airport operating company fraport has been quick to realize this and has made its intentions towards india clear .
frank thiesen , assistant manager of the global investment and management division at fraport , has been busy preparing the division for the participation in one of the indian airports for the past one and a half years .
the process has been a long one for thiesen and his team .
firstly , partner companies with whom fraport sought to form a consortium with had to be selected .
at the same time the process of rapprochement to the indian government was underway .
fraport is planning to invest a total of € 30 to € 50 million -lrb- $ 40 to $ 66 million -rrb- for a stake of about 10 percent in one of the two airports .
" if we are going to be awarded the contract , we are going to first revise the airport 's internal company processes , " thiesen explained .
for this purpose , fraport personnel have to be sent to india , training programs have to be set up , and the infrastructure needs to be improved .
tough competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt international airport , operated by fraport .
about 10 more applicants are competing for the stake , among them consortia of the airports of paris , singapore , and hong kong .
the incentive is strong as the indian government 's liberalization strategy created new conditions for civil aviation policy .
since august 2003 , low-fare airlines have been given access to india 's domestic market .
more and more private airlines are coming to existence .
two of them , jet airways and air sahara , recently received permission to start service to international destinations .
with more than one billion people and an economic growth of more than eight percent , india is regarded as the most important asian market for the future next to china .
up to now , too much regulation of the aviation market , a thick jungle of bureaucracy and the protection of inefficient , run-down state airlines air india and indian airlines prevented private companies from raising the much invoked potential of the market .
private airlines contend that liberalizing of aviation policies is pointless if infrastructure is not massively extended at the same time .
metropolitan airports suffered from extreme overload , they say .
" if new airlines are to enter the market without infrastructure keeping up , the industry is headed for a disaster , " wolfgang prock-schauer , chief executive of the biggest private airline jet airways , warned .
the indian government has acknowledged this need and intends to invest a two-digit euro million amount into the extension of streets , railway , sea- and airports over the coming years .
a previous investment project failed a few years ago , fraport 's investment in the airport extension at the philippine capital manila was not successful .
europe 's second biggest airport company had to take the blow of losing € 300 million .
ever since , shareholders and analysts have kept a critical eye on fraport 's international activities .
" we learned from the experience , " fraport manager thiesen explains .
" nowadays we concentrate on smaller , specific management tasks and try to be on the safe side as far as possible . "
therefore , the frankfurt company prefers holding several small stakes over a few big ones .
this way , they keep the risk of a great loss smaller .
if fraport will get the chance for participation in india is going be decided in the summer .
then , india 's government will pick which applicant is going to be awarded the contract . ana lehmann -lrb- bm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu favors aviation tax to fund african aid a proposal put forward by germany and france to tax commercial aviation fuel to raise funds for development in africa was endorsed by the european union executive on tuesday .

private airlines contend that liberalizing of aviation policies is pointless if infrastructure is not massively extended at the same time .

the highly populated country is one of the most attractive markets in asia behind china - a fact not lost on german airport operator fraport . in september 2003 , india 's government decided to sell 74 percent of india 's two major airports - delhi and mumbai .
now the government is looking for private companies to invest in the airports ' expansion .
as specialists estimate that the number of airline passengers is going to rise by 16 percent each year until 2010 , the investment in these airports promises a stake in a lucrative growth market . the frankfurt airport operating company fraport has been quick to realize this and has made its intentions towards india clear .
frank thiesen , assistant manager of the global investment and management division at fraport , has been busy preparing the division for the participation in one of the indian airports for the past one and a half years .
the process has been a long one for thiesen and his team .
firstly , partner companies with whom fraport sought to form a consortium with had to be selected .
at the same time the process of rapprochement to the indian government was underway .
fraport is planning to invest a total of € 30 to € 50 million -lrb- $ 40 to $ 66 million -rrb- for a stake of about 10 percent in one of the two airports .
" if we are going to be awarded the contract , we are going to first revise the airport 's internal company processes , " thiesen explained .
for this purpose , fraport personnel have to be sent to india , training programs have to be set up , and the infrastructure needs to be improved .
tough competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt international airport , operated by fraport .
about 10 more applicants are competing for the stake , among them consortia of the airports of paris , singapore , and hong kong .
the incentive is strong as the indian government 's liberalization strategy created new conditions for civil aviation policy .
since august 2003 , low-fare airlines have been given access to india 's domestic market .
more and more private airlines are coming to existence .
two of them , jet airways and air sahara , recently received permission to start service to international destinations .
with more than one billion people and an economic growth of more than eight percent , india is regarded as the most important asian market for the future next to china .
up to now , too much regulation of the aviation market , a thick jungle of bureaucracy and the protection of inefficient , run-down state airlines air india and indian airlines prevented private companies from raising the much invoked potential of the market .
private airlines contend that liberalizing of aviation policies is pointless if infrastructure is not massively extended at the same time .
metropolitan airports suffered from extreme overload , they say .
" if new airlines are to enter the market without infrastructure keeping up , the industry is headed for a disaster , " wolfgang prock-schauer , chief executive of the biggest private airline jet airways , warned .
the indian government has acknowledged this need and intends to invest a two-digit euro million amount into the extension of streets , railway , sea- and airports over the coming years .
a previous investment project failed a few years ago , fraport 's investment in the airport extension at the philippine capital manila was not successful .
europe 's second biggest airport company had to take the blow of losing € 300 million .
ever since , shareholders and analysts have kept a critical eye on fraport 's international activities .
" we learned from the experience , " fraport manager thiesen explains .
" nowadays we concentrate on smaller , specific management tasks and try to be on the safe side as far as possible . "
therefore , the frankfurt company prefers holding several small stakes over a few big ones .
this way , they keep the risk of a great loss smaller .
if fraport will get the chance for participation in india is going be decided in the summer .
then , india 's government will pick which applicant is going to be awarded the contract . ana lehmann -lrb- bm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu favors aviation tax to fund african aid a proposal put forward by germany and france to tax commercial aviation fuel to raise funds for development in africa was endorsed by the european union executive on tuesday .

the murder of a turkish woman and the applauding of the crime by some students have left berlin shaken and officials pushing for ethics class .
but how deep does the concept of honor run among some immigrant communities ? on a cold afternoon this week , hatin sürücü gazed gravely from a large poster behind a bus stop lined with flowers , cards and candles . to the people who came to this bleak part of berlin 's tempelhof district for tuesday 's solemn vigil - called not by the city 's muslim community but a gay and lesbian organization - the image of the young woman in a headscarf , a baby in her arms , was familiar from newspapers and television .
a few notes at the memorial read , " hope you get a better deal in your next life , " and " live a life on your own terms . " " it 's a scandal , " said ali k , 33 .
" all muslims in berlin should take to the streets to protest . "
yasemin , 22 , said , " it 's horrific .
all hatin was doing was leading her life the way she wanted . " but it was a choice she paid for with her life .
on feb .
7 , 23-year-old hatin sürücü was gunned down at the aforementioned bus stop .
she died on the spot .
shortly afterwards , three of her brothers - who reportedly had long been threatening her - were arrested .
investigators suspect it was a so-called " honor killing , " given the fact that sürücü 's ultra-conservative turkish-kurdish family strongly disapproved of her modern and " un-islamic " life . sürücü grew up in berlin and was married off at 16 to a cousin in istanbul .
after a few years , she returned to the german capital with her young son , moved into a home for single mothers , completed school and began to train as an electrician .
she stopped wearing a headscarf and was said to be outgoing and vivacious . " she lived like a german " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish women in a mosque in berlin 's kreuzberg district though not the first of its kind , the brazen shooting has sent shockwaves through berlin , home to a large foreign community and which for years has fretted over steady ghetto-building in districts dominated by turkish and arab immigrants .
while the incident has reopened debate on the integration of immigrants and the compatibility of islamic values with western ones , it ’ s the reaction of a small group of turkish students to the murder that has rattled the german capital . days after hatin sürücü was killed , some male students of turkish origin at a high school near the scene of the crime reportedly downplayed the act .
during a class discussion on the murder , one said , " she -lrb- hatin sürücü -rrb- only had herself to blame , " while another remarked " she deserved what she got - the whore lived like a german . "
the school 's director promptly dashed off a letter to parents and students , castigating the students and warning that the school didn ’ t tolerate incitement against freedom .

but , statistics in berlin show that murders ostensibly meant to uphold the honor of the family are high among muslims . at the juvenile prison in the berlin suburb plötzensee , six of the current 529 inmates are serving time of six years and more for manslaughter in so-called " honor crimes . "
all come from the muslim world .
aged between 18 and 22 , one of them , an afghan national , was 16 when he helped relatives kill a widowed aunt who had refused to marry her brother-in-law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prison director marius fiedler said most of the murders are often carefully plotted in the family with the support of all , including women .
" usually the patriarch selects the youngest son to carry out the crime because he knows that judges in germany do n't usually give the maximum sentence of 10 years to a minor for manslaughter , " he said . fiedler admitted that getting the inmates , who undergo psychological therapy , to reform or change their attitudes is difficult .
" many come from rural areas in turkey or lebanon and just do n't know the concept of individualism , " he said .
" they do n't feel any regret for what they did though some even kill their favorite sister .
instead , they 're honored and feel like martyrs for having been chosen to carry out the crime . " ethics class the answer ? the realization that murder and archaic concepts of honor might actually find favor with some teenagers in the city , have caused alarm among berlin 's politicians and some muslim organizations . " it might be a minority , but even one person applauding the murder of hatin sürücü is absolutely unacceptable , " said kenan kolat , head of the turkish association in berlin and brandenburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : open day at a mosque in gelsenkirchen his organization has initiated a discussion with teachers , politicians , parents and imams and is planning to work with turkish newspapers and tv stations in berlin to kick-start a debate on democratic values among the turkish community . " we have to begin speaking about the role of women , about honor concepts , dignity , mutual respect and democratic values , " kolat said .
in addition to city politicians ' plans to introduce a mandatory ethics course in schools across berlin , kolat is pushing for an islamic studies course .
" the mainstream classroom has to be the place where one can get information about islam , not in ' islamic institutes ' who have the theological upper hand in the city , " he said . some , however , are skeptical of such flash-in-the-pan plans .
" every time there 's a controversial incident , politicians routinely come up with ' ethics class ' as a panacea , " said school director wagner .
" but the school ca n't be the only place for learning democratic values .

the murder of a turkish woman and the applauding of the crime by some students have left berlin shaken and officials pushing for ethics class .
but how deep does the concept of honor run among some immigrant communities ? on a cold afternoon this week , hatin sürücü gazed gravely from a large poster behind a bus stop lined with flowers , cards and candles . to the people who came to this bleak part of berlin 's tempelhof district for tuesday 's solemn vigil - called not by the city 's muslim community but a gay and lesbian organization - the image of the young woman in a headscarf , a baby in her arms , was familiar from newspapers and television .
a few notes at the memorial read , " hope you get a better deal in your next life , " and " live a life on your own terms . " " it 's a scandal , " said ali k , 33 .
" all muslims in berlin should take to the streets to protest . "
yasemin , 22 , said , " it 's horrific .
all hatin was doing was leading her life the way she wanted . " but it was a choice she paid for with her life .
on feb .
7 , 23-year-old hatin sürücü was gunned down at the aforementioned bus stop .
she died on the spot .
shortly afterwards , three of her brothers - who reportedly had long been threatening her - were arrested .
investigators suspect it was a so-called " honor killing , " given the fact that sürücü 's ultra-conservative turkish-kurdish family strongly disapproved of her modern and " un-islamic " life . sürücü grew up in berlin and was married off at 16 to a cousin in istanbul .
after a few years , she returned to the german capital with her young son , moved into a home for single mothers , completed school and began to train as an electrician .
she stopped wearing a headscarf and was said to be outgoing and vivacious . " she lived like a german " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish women in a mosque in berlin 's kreuzberg district though not the first of its kind , the brazen shooting has sent shockwaves through berlin , home to a large foreign community and which for years has fretted over steady ghetto-building in districts dominated by turkish and arab immigrants .
while the incident has reopened debate on the integration of immigrants and the compatibility of islamic values with western ones , it ’ s the reaction of a small group of turkish students to the murder that has rattled the german capital . days after hatin sürücü was killed , some male students of turkish origin at a high school near the scene of the crime reportedly downplayed the act .
during a class discussion on the murder , one said , " she -lrb- hatin sürücü -rrb- only had herself to blame , " while another remarked " she deserved what she got - the whore lived like a german . "
the school 's director promptly dashed off a letter to parents and students , castigating the students and warning that the school didn ’ t tolerate incitement against freedom . " her lifestyle did n't fit " the comments have sparked outrage and left many asking if it was just a one-off or whether such thinking is in fact not entirely uncommon among sections of the muslim community in the city . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to some , it is n't .

cui yu hu has been denied an aged parent visa , which she needs in order to stay in melbourne with her daughter .
immigration minister amanda vanstone said she would review the case and treat it with " compassion " .
she said she could not say whether mrs hu would be allowed to stay because she had not received the case file .
" but i can say that the compassion with which the department looked at this and tried to make an arrangement that she could stay here peacefully and lawfully for the rest of her life , is the same compassion that i 'll bring to the file when i finally get it , " senator vanstone told the nine network tv channel .
congratulations mrs hu first came to australia on a 12-month visitor visa in 1995 , but when she tried to leave , no airline would take her because they said she was too old and frail .
so she stayed in australia on a bridging visa , and even received a letter of congratulation from prime minister john howard when she turned 104 earlier this year .
but she has now been told she has no status in australia .
according to the sydney morning herald newspaper , her only surviving relatives are her adopted daughter and son-in-law , who live with her in melbourne .
all her family in china are dead .
through an interpreter , mrs hu told the newspaper that she would be grateful and thankful if she was allowed to stay in australia .
tough rules a spokesman for the immigration department insisted there was no suggestion mrs hu would be deported .
he said that she would have a bridging visa while her appeal was outstanding , and if the appeal was unsuccessful then a minister could intervene in the case .
australia 's tough immigration rules and mandatory detention regime for illegal immigrants have already been heavily criticised by human rights groups .
earlier in february , a mentally ill australian woman was found to have been wrongfully detained in an immigration detention centre for 10 months , because authorities had mistakenly believed she was an illegal german immigrant .
