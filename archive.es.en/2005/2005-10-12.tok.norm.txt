while he has confirmed he is stepping down , schröder 's plans for his future remain private . outgoing german chancellor gerhard schröder on tuesday confirmed that he would not play a role in the country 's next coalition government set to be headed by conservative leader angela merkel .
referring to coming negotiations between his social democrats party -lrb- spd -rrb- and merkel 's christian democrats on forming a new left-right coalition government , schröder , who was making a speech in berlin , said he wanted to " take part -lrb- in the talks -rrb- so they go well .
that 's how how we interpret our mission , even if we no longer belong to the new government . "
in the immediate future , schröder remains the head of government and will visit turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan on wednesday before a working dinner with french president jacques chirac on friday . some reports have said that he will be urged to stay within his social democrats to guide them through government in a coalition led by his conservative archrival angela merkel .
others predicted a future outside politics , including a report that he had been approached about working for russian energy giant gazprom . merkel to lead grand-coalition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel , future chancellor of germany first " grand coaltion " government since the 1960 's .
as merkel announced on monday that she had won the right to lead a coalition of her christian democrats and schröder 's social democrats , the chancellor was nowhere to be seen .
the message seemed to be that the battle to serve a third term was lost and , for once , the man known as the " media chancellor " could not steal her moment .
his only appearance was as the lone figure on the chancellery 's upper floors . it was left to franz müntefering , the social democrats ' party chief , to announce at a separate press conference that schröder would remain to help the party through the coalition negotiations .
müntefering insisted that no decision had been made on who should become vice-chancellor , a role the social democrats will fill in the division of cabinet jobs that is weighted heavily in their favor .
it appears unlikely schröder will accept the job . what comes next for gerhard ? he reportedly told merkel in their late-night crunch talks on sunday that staying in the government was " not in my career plans . "
social democrat sources have told the press that schröder had told his allies that he would not serve " under this woman . "
he may however come under pressure to stay within the social democrats in some role , and he certainly retains a seat in the bundestag lower house of parliament . schröder will face calls from leadership sages on both the right and left .
" in this situation the party can not do without him , they it need him , " said the daily süddeutsche zeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder met with putin in his hometown of st. petersburg friday , oct .
7th , as the german leader took a break from tough political coalition negotiations .
in the immediate future , schröder will remain chancellor and has plans to meet with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan on wednesday before a working dinner with french president jacques chirac on friday .
both meetings are designed to plan the eu summit at hampton court palace , near london , on october 27 - 28 , at which schröder will represent germany . what happens after that is unclear .
at 61 , schröder has the energy , charisma and contacts to make big money in the private sector .
his fourth wife , doris schröder-köpf , 20 years his junior , has expressed a desire to live in new york , although schröder , a trained lawyer , would have to improve his english to work in the united states . the top-selling german newspaper bild , quoting russian media , said he had discussed working for gazprom when he attended the birthday celebrations of close ally russian president vladimir putin over the weekend .
but on that rumor , as with all the others , there has only been silence from schröder . dw staff / afp -lrb- aal -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press : merkel 's historic moment german newspapers called angela merkel 's announcement that she will be the country 's next chancellor an historic moment , but said she faced a tough time leading a left-right coalition .

some say that attacks have been on the increase since then , but the victim himself sees things differently . wolfgang schäuble was ready to call it a day . " i 'm tired and wo n't keep going much longer , " the german interior minister reportedly told his wife on the phone before heading to one last election campaign event late on oct .
12 , 1990 . schäuble did n't come home that night : as he was leaving the meeting , a mentally disturbed man fired three shots at him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble still relies on protection " i think i heard a bang and felt heat , but i do n't remember anything else , " said schäuble , adding that he immediately lost consciousness .
two bullets had hit the minister in the face and the chest .
the third wounded one of schäuble 's bodyguards , who had thrown himself in front of the politician . " if the third shot had hit me as well , i would not have survived , " said schäuble , who is a paraplegic as a result of the attack . a long list of attacks the assassination attempt came less than five months after a mentally disturbed woman stabbed oskar lafontaine , then premier of the state of saarland , in the throat .
since then , other politicians have become victims of - albeit less dangerous - aggression . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the attack raptured fischer 's ear drum .
in 1999 , a protestor against the green party 's agreement to send german troops to the war in kosovo hit german foreign minister joschka fischer on his ear with a paint-filled bag while a man wounded fischer 's party colleague angelika beer with a knife outside her house in 2000 . last year , hamburg ' justice minister was stabbed in the leg by a woman .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , among others , has been slapped in the face while many , including former chancellor helmut kohl and bavarian premier edmund stoiber , have been pelted with eggs . are the media to blame ? media coverage of politicians is largely to blame for an increase in attacks , according to jörg van essen , a member of parliament for the free-market liberal free democrats . " the constant scandalization of people in politics has lowered the inhibition threshold , " van essen said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1991 , former chancellor helmut kohl -lrb- left -rrb- decided to fight back when he was hit with eggs .
recently , the security expert also criticized germany 's secretive secret service , which guards the president , the chancellor and other federal state officials who could be the target of an attack . but van essen said that while the 500-member strong branch of germany 's federal criminal police -lrb- bka -rrb- previously offered insufficient protection due to a lack of bodyguards , the problem has been resolved . " nevertheless , we realize that people who stand in the public 's eye keep getting targeted for attacks , " he said , adding that it was mainly " mentally disturbed persons , who drink themselves into a stupor to attack well-known politicians . " no longer an organized threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf mainly targeted economic leaders such as alfred herrhausen , the head of deutsche bank , who was killed in this bomb attack on his car in november 1989 .
schäuble agreed that mentally disturbed people - like the one who attacked him - posed the greatest danger to politicians after the disbandment of the left-wing radical terrorist group red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , which presented an organized threat to germany 's leaders in the 1970s and 1980s . but he did n't share van essen 's view that more attacks were happening , adding that no incidents became known during the last election campaign . " you can not talk about an increase , " he said . experts also said that the general threat has significantly dropped since the raf 's heyday . back then , bka officials included 70 people in the top risk category for people , meaning they are in serious danger of becoming the target of an attack , said helwig finger , a former bodyguard in the private sector , who now works as a trainer .
that number has dropped to about 15 people since , he said . the risks of public life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder is likely to keep bodyguards after he leaves office .
finger also added that the occasional slap in the face was almost inevitable because of the desire of politicians to rub shoulders with the people . " it looks negligent , not because bka officials are doing a bad job , but because schröder says , ' i do n't want anyone in front of me , " ' he said . schäuble , meanwhile , said that complete protection was impossible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble " any public figure is exposed to personal risks , " he said .
" it 's impossible to protect people 100 percent . " the christian democrat himself could soon oversee the protection of politicians again . while he denied any comment on the matter , the current deputy leader of his party 's parliamentary group stands a good chance of returning to his old job as interior minister in germany 's next government . mathis winkler , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de exhibit takes german terror stain public a controversial exhibition based on the life and times of the red army faction , germany 's own notorious terror group , opens in berlin on saturday in the face of continuing opposition .

some say that attacks have been on the increase since then , but the victim himself sees things differently . wolfgang schäuble was ready to call it a day . " i 'm tired and wo n't keep going much longer , " the german interior minister reportedly told his wife on the phone before heading to one last election campaign event late on oct .
12 , 1990 . schäuble did n't come home that night : as he was leaving the meeting , a mentally disturbed man fired three shots at him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble still relies on protection " i think i heard a bang and felt heat , but i do n't remember anything else , " said schäuble , adding that he immediately lost consciousness .
two bullets had hit the minister in the face and the chest .
the third wounded one of schäuble 's bodyguards , who had thrown himself in front of the politician . " if the third shot had hit me as well , i would not have survived , " said schäuble , who is a paraplegic as a result of the attack . a long list of attacks the assassination attempt came less than five months after a mentally disturbed woman stabbed oskar lafontaine , then premier of the state of saarland , in the throat .
since then , other politicians have become victims of - albeit less dangerous - aggression . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the attack raptured fischer 's ear drum .
in 1999 , a protestor against the green party 's agreement to send german troops to the war in kosovo hit german foreign minister joschka fischer on his ear with a paint-filled bag while a man wounded fischer 's party colleague angelika beer with a knife outside her house in 2000 . last year , hamburg ' justice minister was stabbed in the leg by a woman .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , among others , has been slapped in the face while many , including former chancellor helmut kohl and bavarian premier edmund stoiber , have been pelted with eggs . are the media to blame ? media coverage of politicians is largely to blame for an increase in attacks , according to jörg van essen , a member of parliament for the free-market liberal free democrats . " the constant scandalization of people in politics has lowered the inhibition threshold , " van essen said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1991 , former chancellor helmut kohl -lrb- left -rrb- decided to fight back when he was hit with eggs .
recently , the security expert also criticized germany 's secretive secret service , which guards the president , the chancellor and other federal state officials who could be the target of an attack . but van essen said that while the 500-member strong branch of germany 's federal criminal police -lrb- bka -rrb- previously offered insufficient protection due to a lack of bodyguards , the problem has been resolved . " nevertheless , we realize that people who stand in the public 's eye keep getting targeted for attacks , " he said , adding that it was mainly " mentally disturbed persons , who drink themselves into a stupor to attack well-known politicians . " no longer an organized threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf mainly targeted economic leaders such as alfred herrhausen , the head of deutsche bank , who was killed in this bomb attack on his car in november 1989 .
schäuble agreed that mentally disturbed people - like the one who attacked him - posed the greatest danger to politicians after the disbandment of the left-wing radical terrorist group red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , which presented an organized threat to germany 's leaders in the 1970s and 1980s . but he did n't share van essen 's view that more attacks were happening , adding that no incidents became known during the last election campaign . " you can not talk about an increase , " he said . experts also said that the general threat has significantly dropped since the raf 's heyday . back then , bka officials included 70 people in the top risk category for people , meaning they are in serious danger of becoming the target of an attack , said helwig finger , a former bodyguard in the private sector , who now works as a trainer .
that number has dropped to about 15 people since , he said . the risks of public life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder is likely to keep bodyguards after he leaves office .
finger also added that the occasional slap in the face was almost inevitable because of the desire of politicians to rub shoulders with the people . " it looks negligent , not because bka officials are doing a bad job , but because schröder says , ' i do n't want anyone in front of me , " ' he said . schäuble , meanwhile , said that complete protection was impossible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble " any public figure is exposed to personal risks , " he said .
" it 's impossible to protect people 100 percent .

public finances have already been a source of tension between christian and social democrats . the head of the eurozone group , luxembourg 's premier jean-claude juncker , who also serves as his country 's finance minister , said he had made it " completely clear " to german chancellor gerhard schröder and his probable successor , angela merkel , that " germany has to adhere to all regulations and restrictions that come with the stability and growth pact by 2007 .

church officials meanwhile called for a ban of a swiss group that wants to help terminally ill germans to die . roger kusch , who serves as justice minister in the city state of hamburg , is the first leading cdu politician who has come out in support of assisted suicide for severely ill people after a swiss group called dignitas recently announced it plans to open a german office in hanover to make it assisted suicide more accessible for germans seeking an end to their suffering . " responsible , compassionate assisted suicide does not clash with human basic rights as far as i 'm concerned , " kush wrote in a guest commentary for hamburger abe n dblatt newspaper .
" instead , it 's an expression of christian charity . " the minister backs a change to germany 's law that punishes assisted suicide .
kusch said that he could see assisted suicide to be legal , a doctor would have to determine that a person has a terminal illness and thoroughly advise the patient .
a statement from the patient certified by a notary would also be required . political oppositio n kusch 's statements have caused uproar , with a spokesman for hamburg 's state government hurrying to clarify that the politician had spoken as a private individual . germany 's hospice foundation sharply criticized kusch for his " deeply appalling " remarks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man lies in an intensive care unit eugen brysch , the foundation 's executive director , said terminally ill and dying people do n't need compassion nor mercy , but attention and highly professional care instead . the youth wing of hamburg 's christian democratic union also opposed kusch 's proposal , saying that killing a person could not be the answer to suffering and illness . social democrats also criticized kusch 's comparison of assisted suicide and abortion .
kusch had written that he did n't understand why assisted suicide was punishable with at least six months in prison while abortion was not . promoti n g a ba n the bishop of hanover 's lutheran church , margot kässmann , meanwhile called for a ban on dignitas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margot kässmann -lrb- center -rrb- " if it 's legally possible , this should happen , " she said , adding that the group was opening the door for assisted suicide .
kässmann said that germans had to rethink their approach toward severely sick people , most of whom die anonymously in hospitals . kässmann 's colleague from the southwestern state of baden-württemberg , frank july , also came out in opposition of assisted suicide . lower saxony 's justice minister elisabeth heister-neumann -lrb- cdu -rrb- has announced that she plans to introduce legislation in germany 's upper house that would penalize agencies that help with assisted suicide such as dignitas . german president horst köhler has also come out in opposition of assisted suicide . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when life becomes worse than death in a move which has caused considerable consternation among politicians and the church , the swiss organization for assisted suicide , dignitas , has founded a subsidiary in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.10.2005 schröder ponders life after chancellery großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder will have both political and private options to choose from now that germany has a new leader , there is much speculation about the future of outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder .
while he has confirmed he is stepping down , schröder 's plans for his future remain private . outgoing german chancellor gerhard schröder on tuesday confirmed that he would not play a role in the country 's next coalition government set to be headed by conservative leader angela merkel .
referring to coming negotiations between his social democrats party -lrb- spd -rrb- and merkel 's christian democrats on forming a new left-right coalition government , schröder , who was making a speech in berlin , said he wanted to " take part -lrb- in the talks -rrb- so they go well .
that 's how how we interpret our mission , even if we no longer belong to the new government . "
in the immediate future , schröder remains the head of government and will visit turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan on wednesday before a working dinner with french president jacques chirac on friday . some reports have said that he will be urged to stay within his social democrats to guide them through government in a coalition led by his conservative archrival angela merkel .
others predicted a future outside politics , including a report that he had been approached about working for russian energy giant gazprom . merkel to lead grand-coalition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel , future chancellor of germany first " grand coaltion " government since the 1960 's .

as the flu reached turkey and romania , a german national task force is meeting wednesday to discuss safety measures . high level officials from the federal government and the german states are set to meet in bonn to examine when emergency measures should be implemented and poultry quarantined .
environment minister jürgen trittin , interim head of the consumer affairs and agriculture ministry , has said that the ministry is prepared for the worst and that a ban on poultry is , as yet , unnecessary . he said that if the results of eu tests on infected romanian and turkish cases showed that they did indeed have the highly pathogenic h5n1 virus , " our emergency plans will immediately come into effect . "
the cases in turkey are so far known to be infected with the h5 strain , the same one found in asia .
the disease has not confirmed been confirmed in romania .
the european commission expects to have the test results later in the week . three german states , lower saxony , mecklenburg-western pomerania and north rhine-westphalia , have already called on poultry owners in certain areas to voluntarily confine their fowl to stalls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vaccinating geese in vietnam the avian flu virus is transmitted through physical contact with infected birds and can be carried on clothes or shoes , for example , but not by air .
trittin called on visitors to romania and turkey to avoid going to places where poultry is bred .

while he has confirmed he is stepping down , schröder 's plans for his future remain private . outgoing german chancellor gerhard schröder on tuesday confirmed that he would not play a role in the country 's next coalition government set to be headed by conservative leader angela merkel .
referring to coming negotiations between his social democrats party -lrb- spd -rrb- and merkel 's christian democrats on forming a new left-right coalition government , schröder , who was making a speech in berlin , said he wanted to " take part -lrb- in the talks -rrb- so they go well .
that 's how how we interpret our mission , even if we no longer belong to the new government . "
in the immediate future , schröder remains the head of government and will visit turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan on wednesday before a working dinner with french president jacques chirac on friday . some reports have said that he will be urged to stay within his social democrats to guide them through government in a coalition led by his conservative archrival angela merkel .
others predicted a future outside politics , including a report that he had been approached about working for russian energy giant gazprom . merkel to lead grand-coalition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel , future chancellor of germany first " grand coaltion " government since the 1960 's .
as merkel announced on monday that she had won the right to lead a coalition of her christian democrats and schröder 's social democrats , the chancellor was nowhere to be seen .
the message seemed to be that the battle to serve a third term was lost and , for once , the man known as the " media chancellor " could not steal her moment .
his only appearance was as the lone figure on the chancellery 's upper floors . it was left to franz müntefering , the social democrats ' party chief , to announce at a separate press conference that schröder would remain to help the party through the coalition negotiations .
müntefering insisted that no decision had been made on who should become vice-chancellor , a role the social democrats will fill in the division of cabinet jobs that is weighted heavily in their favor .
it appears unlikely schröder will accept the job . what comes next for gerhard ? he reportedly told merkel in their late-night crunch talks on sunday that staying in the government was " not in my career plans . "
social democrat sources have told the press that schröder had told his allies that he would not serve " under this woman . "
he may however come under pressure to stay within the social democrats in some role , and he certainly retains a seat in the bundestag lower house of parliament . schröder will face calls from leadership sages on both the right and left .
" in this situation the party can not do without him , they it need him , " said the daily süddeutsche zeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder met with putin in his hometown of st. petersburg friday , oct .
7th , as the german leader took a break from tough political coalition negotiations .
in the immediate future , schröder will remain chancellor and has plans to meet with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan on wednesday before a working dinner with french president jacques chirac on friday .
both meetings are designed to plan the eu summit at hampton court palace , near london , on october 27 - 28 , at which schröder will represent germany . what happens after that is unclear .
at 61 , schröder has the energy , charisma and contacts to make big money in the private sector .
his fourth wife , doris schröder-köpf , 20 years his junior , has expressed a desire to live in new york , although schröder , a trained lawyer , would have to improve his english to work in the united states . the top-selling german newspaper bild , quoting russian media , said he had discussed working for gazprom when he attended the birthday celebrations of close ally russian president vladimir putin over the weekend .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.10.2005 schröder ponders life after chancellery großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder will have both political and private options to choose from now that germany has a new leader , there is much speculation about the future of outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder .
while he has confirmed he is stepping down , schröder 's plans for his future remain private . outgoing german chancellor gerhard schröder on tuesday confirmed that he would not play a role in the country 's next coalition government set to be headed by conservative leader angela merkel .
referring to coming negotiations between his social democrats party -lrb- spd -rrb- and merkel 's christian democrats on forming a new left-right coalition government , schröder , who was making a speech in berlin , said he wanted to " take part -lrb- in the talks -rrb- so they go well .
that 's how how we interpret our mission , even if we no longer belong to the new government . "
in the immediate future , schröder remains the head of government and will visit turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan on wednesday before a working dinner with french president jacques chirac on friday . some reports have said that he will be urged to stay within his social democrats to guide them through government in a coalition led by his conservative archrival angela merkel .
others predicted a future outside politics , including a report that he had been approached about working for russian energy giant gazprom . merkel to lead grand-coalition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel , future chancellor of germany first " grand coaltion " government since the 1960 's .
as merkel announced on monday that she had won the right to lead a coalition of her christian democrats and schröder 's social democrats , the chancellor was nowhere to be seen .
the message seemed to be that the battle to serve a third term was lost and , for once , the man known as the " media chancellor " could not steal her moment .
his only appearance was as the lone figure on the chancellery 's upper floors . it was left to franz müntefering , the social democrats ' party chief , to announce at a separate press conference that schröder would remain to help the party through the coalition negotiations .
müntefering insisted that no decision had been made on who should become vice-chancellor , a role the social democrats will fill in the division of cabinet jobs that is weighted heavily in their favor .
it appears unlikely schröder will accept the job . what comes next for gerhard ? he reportedly told merkel in their late-night crunch talks on sunday that staying in the government was " not in my career plans . "
social democrat sources have told the press that schröder had told his allies that he would not serve " under this woman . "
he may however come under pressure to stay within the social democrats in some role , and he certainly retains a seat in the bundestag lower house of parliament . schröder will face calls from leadership sages on both the right and left .
" in this situation the party can not do without him , they it need him , " said the daily süddeutsche zeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder met with putin in his hometown of st. petersburg friday , oct .
7th , as the german leader took a break from tough political coalition negotiations .
in the immediate future , schröder will remain chancellor and has plans to meet with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan on wednesday before a working dinner with french president jacques chirac on friday .
both meetings are designed to plan the eu summit at hampton court palace , near london , on october 27 - 28 , at which schröder will represent germany . what happens after that is unclear .
at 61 , schröder has the energy , charisma and contacts to make big money in the private sector .
his fourth wife , doris schröder-köpf , 20 years his junior , has expressed a desire to live in new york , although schröder , a trained lawyer , would have to improve his english to work in the united states . the top-selling german newspaper bild , quoting russian media , said he had discussed working for gazprom when he attended the birthday celebrations of close ally russian president vladimir putin over the weekend .
but on that rumor , as with all the others , there has only been silence from schröder . dw staff / afp -lrb- aal -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press : merkel 's historic moment german newspapers called angela merkel 's announcement that she will be the country 's next chancellor an historic moment , but said she faced a tough time leading a left-right coalition .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.10.2005 schröder ponders life after chancellery großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder will have both political and private options to choose from now that germany has a new leader , there is much speculation about the future of outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder .
while he has confirmed he is stepping down , schröder 's plans for his future remain private . outgoing german chancellor gerhard schröder on tuesday confirmed that he would not play a role in the country 's next coalition government set to be headed by conservative leader angela merkel .
referring to coming negotiations between his social democrats party -lrb- spd -rrb- and merkel 's christian democrats on forming a new left-right coalition government , schröder , who was making a speech in berlin , said he wanted to " take part -lrb- in the talks -rrb- so they go well .
that 's how how we interpret our mission , even if we no longer belong to the new government . "
in the immediate future , schröder remains the head of government and will visit turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan on wednesday before a working dinner with french president jacques chirac on friday . some reports have said that he will be urged to stay within his social democrats to guide them through government in a coalition led by his conservative archrival angela merkel .
others predicted a future outside politics , including a report that he had been approached about working for russian energy giant gazprom . merkel to lead grand-coalition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel , future chancellor of germany first " grand coaltion " government since the 1960 's .
as merkel announced on monday that she had won the right to lead a coalition of her christian democrats and schröder 's social democrats , the chancellor was nowhere to be seen .
the message seemed to be that the battle to serve a third term was lost and , for once , the man known as the " media chancellor " could not steal her moment .
his only appearance was as the lone figure on the chancellery 's upper floors . it was left to franz müntefering , the social democrats ' party chief , to announce at a separate press conference that schröder would remain to help the party through the coalition negotiations .
müntefering insisted that no decision had been made on who should become vice-chancellor , a role the social democrats will fill in the division of cabinet jobs that is weighted heavily in their favor .
it appears unlikely schröder will accept the job . what comes next for gerhard ? he reportedly told merkel in their late-night crunch talks on sunday that staying in the government was " not in my career plans . "
social democrat sources have told the press that schröder had told his allies that he would not serve " under this woman . "
he may however come under pressure to stay within the social democrats in some role , and he certainly retains a seat in the bundestag lower house of parliament . schröder will face calls from leadership sages on both the right and left .
" in this situation the party can not do without him , they it need him , " said the daily süddeutsche zeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder met with putin in his hometown of st. petersburg friday , oct .
7th , as the german leader took a break from tough political coalition negotiations .
in the immediate future , schröder will remain chancellor and has plans to meet with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan on wednesday before a working dinner with french president jacques chirac on friday .
both meetings are designed to plan the eu summit at hampton court palace , near london , on october 27 - 28 , at which schröder will represent germany . what happens after that is unclear .
at 61 , schröder has the energy , charisma and contacts to make big money in the private sector .
his fourth wife , doris schröder-köpf , 20 years his junior , has expressed a desire to live in new york , although schröder , a trained lawyer , would have to improve his english to work in the united states . the top-selling german newspaper bild , quoting russian media , said he had discussed working for gazprom when he attended the birthday celebrations of close ally russian president vladimir putin over the weekend .
but on that rumor , as with all the others , there has only been silence from schröder . dw staff / afp -lrb- aal -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press : merkel 's historic moment german newspapers called angela merkel 's announcement that she will be the country 's next chancellor an historic moment , but said she faced a tough time leading a left-right coalition .

12 , 1990 . schäuble did n't come home that night : as he was leaving the meeting , a mentally disturbed man fired three shots at him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble still relies on protection " i think i heard a bang and felt heat , but i do n't remember anything else , " said schäuble , adding that he immediately lost consciousness .
two bullets had hit the minister in the face and the chest .
the third wounded one of schäuble 's bodyguards , who had thrown himself in front of the politician . " if the third shot had hit me as well , i would not have survived , " said schäuble , who is a paraplegic as a result of the attack . a long list of attacks the assassination attempt came less than five months after a mentally disturbed woman stabbed oskar lafontaine , then premier of the state of saarland , in the throat .
since then , other politicians have become victims of - albeit less dangerous - aggression . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the attack raptured fischer 's ear drum .
in 1999 , a protestor against the green party 's agreement to send german troops to the war in kosovo hit german foreign minister joschka fischer on his ear with a paint-filled bag while a man wounded fischer 's party colleague angelika beer with a knife outside her house in 2000 . last year , hamburg ' justice minister was stabbed in the leg by a woman .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , among others , has been slapped in the face while many , including former chancellor helmut kohl and bavarian premier edmund stoiber , have been pelted with eggs . are the media to blame ? media coverage of politicians is largely to blame for an increase in attacks , according to jörg van essen , a member of parliament for the free-market liberal free democrats . " the constant scandalization of people in politics has lowered the inhibition threshold , " van essen said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1991 , former chancellor helmut kohl -lrb- left -rrb- decided to fight back when he was hit with eggs .
recently , the security expert also criticized germany 's secretive secret service , which guards the president , the chancellor and other federal state officials who could be the target of an attack . but van essen said that while the 500-member strong branch of germany 's federal criminal police -lrb- bka -rrb- previously offered insufficient protection due to a lack of bodyguards , the problem has been resolved . " nevertheless , we realize that people who stand in the public 's eye keep getting targeted for attacks , " he said , adding that it was mainly " mentally disturbed persons , who drink themselves into a stupor to attack well-known politicians . " no longer an organized threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf mainly targeted economic leaders such as alfred herrhausen , the head of deutsche bank , who was killed in this bomb attack on his car in november 1989 .
schäuble agreed that mentally disturbed people - like the one who attacked him - posed the greatest danger to politicians after the disbandment of the left-wing radical terrorist group red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , which presented an organized threat to germany 's leaders in the 1970s and 1980s . but he did n't share van essen 's view that more attacks were happening , adding that no incidents became known during the last election campaign . " you can not talk about an increase , " he said . experts also said that the general threat has significantly dropped since the raf 's heyday . back then , bka officials included 70 people in the top risk category for people , meaning they are in serious danger of becoming the target of an attack , said helwig finger , a former bodyguard in the private sector , who now works as a trainer .
that number has dropped to about 15 people since , he said . the risks of public life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder is likely to keep bodyguards after he leaves office .
finger also added that the occasional slap in the face was almost inevitable because of the desire of politicians to rub shoulders with the people . " it looks negligent , not because bka officials are doing a bad job , but because schröder says , ' i do n't want anyone in front of me , " ' he said . schäuble , meanwhile , said that complete protection was impossible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble " any public figure is exposed to personal risks , " he said .
" it 's impossible to protect people 100 percent . " the christian democrat himself could soon oversee the protection of politicians again . while he denied any comment on the matter , the current deputy leader of his party 's parliamentary group stands a good chance of returning to his old job as interior minister in germany 's next government . mathis winkler , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de exhibit takes german terror stain public a controversial exhibition based on the life and times of the red army faction , germany 's own notorious terror group , opens in berlin on saturday in the face of continuing opposition .

as the flu reached turkey and romania , a german national task force is meeting wednesday to discuss safety measures . high level officials from the federal government and the german states are set to meet in bonn to examine when emergency measures should be implemented and poultry quarantined .
environment minister jürgen trittin , interim head of the consumer affairs and agriculture ministry , has said that the ministry is prepared for the worst and that a ban on poultry is , as yet , unnecessary . he said that if the results of eu tests on infected romanian and turkish cases showed that they did indeed have the highly pathogenic h5n1 virus , " our emergency plans will immediately come into effect . "
the cases in turkey are so far known to be infected with the h5 strain , the same one found in asia .

trittin called on visitors to romania and turkey to avoid going to places where poultry is bred .
germany poorly prepared ? bernhard ruf , head doctor at leipzig 's st. georg clinic , warned that germany only has enough medication for around 8-10 percent of the population .
the world health organization , however , recommends that states have a reserve of medication for 20-25 percent , " ruf said in an interview with radio broadcaster deutschlandfunk on wednesday . " there is a backlog of demand that must now be met , " ruf said .
the government must take advantage of the time before a pandemic breaks out to prepare , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birds imported illegally present the greatest risk to germany , according to the national research institute for animal health , the friedrich loeffler institute .
it 's less likely that migratory birds will carry the virus from turkey or romania to germany , particularly since they have begun flying south for the winter . the eu has already banned poultry imports from countries where the h5n1 virus has been detected as well as live fowl and feather imports from turkey . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bird flu reaches europe pushing further towards western europe , bird flu has reached turkey and romania , though it is unclear whether the cases there involve the h5n1 viral strain that poses a threat to humans .

likewise , changes will likely be made on defence with marcell jansen suffering from a pulled hamstring and lukas sinkiewics from a bruised foot . in attack , miroslav klose is available , although it remains uncertain whether the werder bremen striker will play .
modesty in the key against kahn and company china 's coach , zhu guanghu is n't leaving anything to chance . in an interview with dw-world he said , " we 've already studied the video of the germany-turkey game " . in spite of the fact that some say the current german team is not up to form zhu remains humble when speaking to the press : " germany is a traditionally dominant force in european soccer . we 've come primarily to learn .

china 's striker , xie hui told dw-world that the chinese had nothing by but praise for the german team and was looking forward to the experience that playing against klinsmann 's team would bring them .

" the eu strategy ... will mark a true turning point to help africa help itself , " added eu aid commissioner louis michel , noting that the strategy still has to be approved by the european parliament and eu governments . the eu initiative comes after the bloc 's 25 member governments agreed in may to increase development aid budget by 20 billion euros per year by 2010 .
from 17 billion euros for africa in 2003 , the figure would rise to 25 billion at the end of the decade , according to eu figures .

queried during a visit to portugal about the issue , un secretary general kofi annan also stressed that improving africans ' lives at home was the way forward .
" if we create reasonable living conditions , people will not feel forced to leave , " the lusa news agency quoted him as saying .
some 14 people have died in recent months while trying to break into spanish enclaves , some of them shot by moroccan security forces .
morocco has also come under fire for dumping hundreds of the would-be immigrants in desert areas near the algerian border . the african union leader said the underlying problems which fueled an exodus of poor africans had to be tackled . " we have to have the courage to broach the problem of farm subsidies , which weaken our economy and impoverish our rural areas , " he said , in a clear reference to the eu 's long-controversial generous farm aid system . konare added that african immigrants like those trying to get into spain " are a reflection of the poverty " of a continent on which 40 percent of the population lives on less than a euro a day . halve poverty by 2015 the eu strategy is designed to help africa achieve the so-called millennium development goals , chief among which is to reduce poverty by half by 2015 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after being abandoned by moroccan police in the country 's south , these illegal immigrants from senegal walked 550 km -lrb- 340 miles -rrb- on their way to oujda , morocco .
six of their group died during the 10-day trek .
above all africa needs peace and stability , said the eu executive , explaining its proposals to strengthen good governance - sorely needed to overturn the continent 's reputation for corruption . but it stressed that the key motor of african development will be strengthening economies , and for that infrastrure - road and rail transport , but also water , energy and telecoms links - is crucial . the creation of such networks will add a " spinal column " for the development of a genuine internal market across the continent , eu officials say . konare agreed that to bolster its own national economies is essential .

" the problem of immigration , the dramatic consequences of which we are witnessing , can only be addressed effectively ... through an ambitious and coordinated development cooperation to fight its root causes , " said barroso . " the eu strategy ... will mark a true turning point to help africa help itself , " added eu aid commissioner louis michel , noting that the strategy still has to be approved by the european parliament and eu governments . the eu initiative comes after the bloc 's 25 member governments agreed in may to increase development aid budget by 20 billion euros per year by 2010 .
from 17 billion euros for africa in 2003 , the figure would rise to 25 billion at the end of the decade , according to eu figures . " walls and prisons " on the immigration problem , konare warned that the " walls and prisons " can not prevent immigrants trying to enter europe illegally , saying the underlying economic and social reasons had to be tackled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain recently increased fortifications to prevent immigrants from climbing over the fence seperating its north african enclave melilla and morocco " it 's not security measures , it 's not prisons in madrid and walls in africa that will solve the problem , " said konare , chair of the au commission , after the brussels talks .
queried during a visit to portugal about the issue , un secretary general kofi annan also stressed that improving africans ' lives at home was the way forward .
" if we create reasonable living conditions , people will not feel forced to leave , " the lusa news agency quoted him as saying .
some 14 people have died in recent months while trying to break into spanish enclaves , some of them shot by moroccan security forces .
morocco has also come under fire for dumping hundreds of the would-be immigrants in desert areas near the algerian border . the african union leader said the underlying problems which fueled an exodus of poor africans had to be tackled . " we have to have the courage to broach the problem of farm subsidies , which weaken our economy and impoverish our rural areas , " he said , in a clear reference to the eu 's long-controversial generous farm aid system . konare added that african immigrants like those trying to get into spain " are a reflection of the poverty " of a continent on which 40 percent of the population lives on less than a euro a day . halve poverty by 2015 the eu strategy is designed to help africa achieve the so-called millennium development goals , chief among which is to reduce poverty by half by 2015 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after being abandoned by moroccan police in the country 's south , these illegal immigrants from senegal walked 550 km -lrb- 340 miles -rrb- on their way to oujda , morocco .
six of their group died during the 10-day trek .
above all africa needs peace and stability , said the eu executive , explaining its proposals to strengthen good governance - sorely needed to overturn the continent 's reputation for corruption . but it stressed that the key motor of african development will be strengthening economies , and for that infrastrure - road and rail transport , but also water , energy and telecoms links - is crucial . the creation of such networks will add a " spinal column " for the development of a genuine internal market across the continent , eu officials say . konare agreed that to bolster its own national economies is essential .
" without an african internal market , it is an illusion to believe that we can strive towards overseas markets , " said konare . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain starts deporting immigrants spain has started deporting illegal immigrants despite concerns about possible human rights violations while a new assault on the spanish border by african immigrants resulted in six deaths .

while he has confirmed he is stepping down , schröder 's plans for his future remain private . outgoing german chancellor gerhard schröder on tuesday confirmed that he would not play a role in the country 's next coalition government set to be headed by conservative leader angela merkel .
referring to coming negotiations between his social democrats party -lrb- spd -rrb- and merkel 's christian democrats on forming a new left-right coalition government , schröder , who was making a speech in berlin , said he wanted to " take part -lrb- in the talks -rrb- so they go well .
that 's how how we interpret our mission , even if we no longer belong to the new government . "
in the immediate future , schröder remains the head of government and will visit turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan on wednesday before a working dinner with french president jacques chirac on friday . some reports have said that he will be urged to stay within his social democrats to guide them through government in a coalition led by his conservative archrival angela merkel .
others predicted a future outside politics , including a report that he had been approached about working for russian energy giant gazprom . merkel to lead grand-coalition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel , future chancellor of germany first " grand coaltion " government since the 1960 's .
as merkel announced on monday that she had won the right to lead a coalition of her christian democrats and schröder 's social democrats , the chancellor was nowhere to be seen .
the message seemed to be that the battle to serve a third term was lost and , for once , the man known as the " media chancellor " could not steal her moment .
his only appearance was as the lone figure on the chancellery 's upper floors . it was left to franz müntefering , the social democrats ' party chief , to announce at a separate press conference that schröder would remain to help the party through the coalition negotiations .
müntefering insisted that no decision had been made on who should become vice-chancellor , a role the social democrats will fill in the division of cabinet jobs that is weighted heavily in their favor .
it appears unlikely schröder will accept the job . what comes next for gerhard ? he reportedly told merkel in their late-night crunch talks on sunday that staying in the government was " not in my career plans . "
social democrat sources have told the press that schröder had told his allies that he would not serve " under this woman . "
he may however come under pressure to stay within the social democrats in some role , and he certainly retains a seat in the bundestag lower house of parliament . schröder will face calls from leadership sages on both the right and left .

both meetings are designed to plan the eu summit at hampton court palace , near london , on october 27 - 28 , at which schröder will represent germany . what happens after that is unclear .
at 61 , schröder has the energy , charisma and contacts to make big money in the private sector .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 12.10.2005 the rhythm of recess großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking an orchestral break a german piano professor has devised a way to get kids into classical music .
on wednesday , pupils in saarlouis discovered their school bell had been replaced by fragments from europe 's greatest composers . " it 's a relief , " 13-year-old julien blass told news broadcaster n-tv .
" if you 've had a tough math assignment beforehand , it makes you happy afterwards . "
blass was referring to the up to 20-second segments of classical music that tell students at the gymnasium am stadtgarten high school in the city of saarlouis , near the french border , when lessons and between-class breaks start and end . wednesday started with a snippet from george bizet 's opera " carmen . "
dubbed " klassik statt klingel " -lrb- classics instead of the bell -rrb- , the new program is meant to promote musical education among kids .
its creator , robert leonardy , head of the saar music festival and a piano professor , compiled a cd of 200 classic jingles , from verdi 's " aida " to theodorakis ' " zorba the greek , " to teach students the fundamentals of his genre . " for the first time , you engage 100 percent of the pupils at a time when , at best , three percent of people regularly listen to classical music , " the maestro explained . back to basics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert leonardy leonardy -lrb- photo -rrb- is hopeful that his idea will catch on nationwide .
he estimates that after two or three years of being exposed to the music every day at school , the students will have a basic knowledge of classical music . but perhaps he 's a bit optimistic .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.10.2005 schröder ponders life after chancellery großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder will have both political and private options to choose from now that germany has a new leader , there is much speculation about the future of outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder .
while he has confirmed he is stepping down , schröder 's plans for his future remain private . outgoing german chancellor gerhard schröder on tuesday confirmed that he would not play a role in the country 's next coalition government set to be headed by conservative leader angela merkel .
referring to coming negotiations between his social democrats party -lrb- spd -rrb- and merkel 's christian democrats on forming a new left-right coalition government , schröder , who was making a speech in berlin , said he wanted to " take part -lrb- in the talks -rrb- so they go well .
that 's how how we interpret our mission , even if we no longer belong to the new government . "
in the immediate future , schröder remains the head of government and will visit turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan on wednesday before a working dinner with french president jacques chirac on friday . some reports have said that he will be urged to stay within his social democrats to guide them through government in a coalition led by his conservative archrival angela merkel .
others predicted a future outside politics , including a report that he had been approached about working for russian energy giant gazprom . merkel to lead grand-coalition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel , future chancellor of germany first " grand coaltion " government since the 1960 's .
as merkel announced on monday that she had won the right to lead a coalition of her christian democrats and schröder 's social democrats , the chancellor was nowhere to be seen .
the message seemed to be that the battle to serve a third term was lost and , for once , the man known as the " media chancellor " could not steal her moment .
his only appearance was as the lone figure on the chancellery 's upper floors . it was left to franz müntefering , the social democrats ' party chief , to announce at a separate press conference that schröder would remain to help the party through the coalition negotiations .
müntefering insisted that no decision had been made on who should become vice-chancellor , a role the social democrats will fill in the division of cabinet jobs that is weighted heavily in their favor .
it appears unlikely schröder will accept the job . what comes next for gerhard ? he reportedly told merkel in their late-night crunch talks on sunday that staying in the government was " not in my career plans . "
social democrat sources have told the press that schröder had told his allies that he would not serve " under this woman . "
he may however come under pressure to stay within the social democrats in some role , and he certainly retains a seat in the bundestag lower house of parliament . schröder will face calls from leadership sages on both the right and left .
" in this situation the party can not do without him , they it need him , " said the daily süddeutsche zeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder met with putin in his hometown of st. petersburg friday , oct .
7th , as the german leader took a break from tough political coalition negotiations .
in the immediate future , schröder will remain chancellor and has plans to meet with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan on wednesday before a working dinner with french president jacques chirac on friday .
both meetings are designed to plan the eu summit at hampton court palace , near london , on october 27 - 28 , at which schröder will represent germany . what happens after that is unclear .
at 61 , schröder has the energy , charisma and contacts to make big money in the private sector .
his fourth wife , doris schröder-köpf , 20 years his junior , has expressed a desire to live in new york , although schröder , a trained lawyer , would have to improve his english to work in the united states . the top-selling german newspaper bild , quoting russian media , said he had discussed working for gazprom when he attended the birthday celebrations of close ally russian president vladimir putin over the weekend .
but on that rumor , as with all the others , there has only been silence from schröder . dw staff / afp -lrb- aal -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press : merkel 's historic moment german newspapers called angela merkel 's announcement that she will be the country 's next chancellor an historic moment , but said she faced a tough time leading a left-right coalition .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.10.2005 schröder ponders life after chancellery großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder will have both political and private options to choose from now that germany has a new leader , there is much speculation about the future of outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder .
while he has confirmed he is stepping down , schröder 's plans for his future remain private . outgoing german chancellor gerhard schröder on tuesday confirmed that he would not play a role in the country 's next coalition government set to be headed by conservative leader angela merkel .
referring to coming negotiations between his social democrats party -lrb- spd -rrb- and merkel 's christian democrats on forming a new left-right coalition government , schröder , who was making a speech in berlin , said he wanted to " take part -lrb- in the talks -rrb- so they go well .
that 's how how we interpret our mission , even if we no longer belong to the new government . "
in the immediate future , schröder remains the head of government and will visit turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan on wednesday before a working dinner with french president jacques chirac on friday . some reports have said that he will be urged to stay within his social democrats to guide them through government in a coalition led by his conservative archrival angela merkel .
others predicted a future outside politics , including a report that he had been approached about working for russian energy giant gazprom . merkel to lead grand-coalition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel , future chancellor of germany first " grand coaltion " government since the 1960 's .
as merkel announced on monday that she had won the right to lead a coalition of her christian democrats and schröder 's social democrats , the chancellor was nowhere to be seen .
the message seemed to be that the battle to serve a third term was lost and , for once , the man known as the " media chancellor " could not steal her moment .
his only appearance was as the lone figure on the chancellery 's upper floors . it was left to franz müntefering , the social democrats ' party chief , to announce at a separate press conference that schröder would remain to help the party through the coalition negotiations .
müntefering insisted that no decision had been made on who should become vice-chancellor , a role the social democrats will fill in the division of cabinet jobs that is weighted heavily in their favor .
it appears unlikely schröder will accept the job . what comes next for gerhard ? he reportedly told merkel in their late-night crunch talks on sunday that staying in the government was " not in my career plans . "
social democrat sources have told the press that schröder had told his allies that he would not serve " under this woman . "
he may however come under pressure to stay within the social democrats in some role , and he certainly retains a seat in the bundestag lower house of parliament . schröder will face calls from leadership sages on both the right and left .
" in this situation the party can not do without him , they it need him , " said the daily süddeutsche zeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder met with putin in his hometown of st. petersburg friday , oct .
7th , as the german leader took a break from tough political coalition negotiations .
in the immediate future , schröder will remain chancellor and has plans to meet with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan on wednesday before a working dinner with french president jacques chirac on friday .
both meetings are designed to plan the eu summit at hampton court palace , near london , on october 27 - 28 , at which schröder will represent germany . what happens after that is unclear .
at 61 , schröder has the energy , charisma and contacts to make big money in the private sector .
his fourth wife , doris schröder-köpf , 20 years his junior , has expressed a desire to live in new york , although schröder , a trained lawyer , would have to improve his english to work in the united states . the top-selling german newspaper bild , quoting russian media , said he had discussed working for gazprom when he attended the birthday celebrations of close ally russian president vladimir putin over the weekend .
but on that rumor , as with all the others , there has only been silence from schröder . dw staff / afp -lrb- aal -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press : merkel 's historic moment german newspapers called angela merkel 's announcement that she will be the country 's next chancellor an historic moment , but said she faced a tough time leading a left-right coalition .

some say that attacks have been on the increase since then , but the victim himself sees things differently . wolfgang schäuble was ready to call it a day . " i 'm tired and wo n't keep going much longer , " the german interior minister reportedly told his wife on the phone before heading to one last election campaign event late on oct .
12 , 1990 . schäuble did n't come home that night : as he was leaving the meeting , a mentally disturbed man fired three shots at him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble still relies on protection " i think i heard a bang and felt heat , but i do n't remember anything else , " said schäuble , adding that he immediately lost consciousness .
two bullets had hit the minister in the face and the chest .
the third wounded one of schäuble 's bodyguards , who had thrown himself in front of the politician . " if the third shot had hit me as well , i would not have survived , " said schäuble , who is a paraplegic as a result of the attack . a long list of attacks the assassination attempt came less than five months after a mentally disturbed woman stabbed oskar lafontaine , then premier of the state of saarland , in the throat .
since then , other politicians have become victims of - albeit less dangerous - aggression . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the attack raptured fischer 's ear drum .
in 1999 , a protestor against the green party 's agreement to send german troops to the war in kosovo hit german foreign minister joschka fischer on his ear with a paint-filled bag while a man wounded fischer 's party colleague angelika beer with a knife outside her house in 2000 . last year , hamburg ' justice minister was stabbed in the leg by a woman .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , among others , has been slapped in the face while many , including former chancellor helmut kohl and bavarian premier edmund stoiber , have been pelted with eggs . are the media to blame ? media coverage of politicians is largely to blame for an increase in attacks , according to jörg van essen , a member of parliament for the free-market liberal free democrats . " the constant scandalization of people in politics has lowered the inhibition threshold , " van essen said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1991 , former chancellor helmut kohl -lrb- left -rrb- decided to fight back when he was hit with eggs .
recently , the security expert also criticized germany 's secretive secret service , which guards the president , the chancellor and other federal state officials who could be the target of an attack . but van essen said that while the 500-member strong branch of germany 's federal criminal police -lrb- bka -rrb- previously offered insufficient protection due to a lack of bodyguards , the problem has been resolved . " nevertheless , we realize that people who stand in the public 's eye keep getting targeted for attacks , " he said , adding that it was mainly " mentally disturbed persons , who drink themselves into a stupor to attack well-known politicians . " no longer an organized threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf mainly targeted economic leaders such as alfred herrhausen , the head of deutsche bank , who was killed in this bomb attack on his car in november 1989 .
schäuble agreed that mentally disturbed people - like the one who attacked him - posed the greatest danger to politicians after the disbandment of the left-wing radical terrorist group red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , which presented an organized threat to germany 's leaders in the 1970s and 1980s . but he did n't share van essen 's view that more attacks were happening , adding that no incidents became known during the last election campaign . " you can not talk about an increase , " he said . experts also said that the general threat has significantly dropped since the raf 's heyday . back then , bka officials included 70 people in the top risk category for people , meaning they are in serious danger of becoming the target of an attack , said helwig finger , a former bodyguard in the private sector , who now works as a trainer .
that number has dropped to about 15 people since , he said . the risks of public life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder is likely to keep bodyguards after he leaves office .
finger also added that the occasional slap in the face was almost inevitable because of the desire of politicians to rub shoulders with the people . " it looks negligent , not because bka officials are doing a bad job , but because schröder says , ' i do n't want anyone in front of me , " ' he said . schäuble , meanwhile , said that complete protection was impossible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble " any public figure is exposed to personal risks , " he said .
" it 's impossible to protect people 100 percent . " the christian democrat himself could soon oversee the protection of politicians again . while he denied any comment on the matter , the current deputy leader of his party 's parliamentary group stands a good chance of returning to his old job as interior minister in germany 's next government . mathis winkler , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de exhibit takes german terror stain public a controversial exhibition based on the life and times of the red army faction , germany 's own notorious terror group , opens in berlin on saturday in the face of continuing opposition .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.10.2005 assessing the threat for german politicians großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian premier edmund stoiber seeking refuge from rotten eggs the worst attempt on the life of a politician in postwar germany occurred 15 years ago wednesday .
some say that attacks have been on the increase since then , but the victim himself sees things differently . wolfgang schäuble was ready to call it a day . " i 'm tired and wo n't keep going much longer , " the german interior minister reportedly told his wife on the phone before heading to one last election campaign event late on oct .
12 , 1990 . schäuble did n't come home that night : as he was leaving the meeting , a mentally disturbed man fired three shots at him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble still relies on protection " i think i heard a bang and felt heat , but i do n't remember anything else , " said schäuble , adding that he immediately lost consciousness .
two bullets had hit the minister in the face and the chest .
the third wounded one of schäuble 's bodyguards , who had thrown himself in front of the politician . " if the third shot had hit me as well , i would not have survived , " said schäuble , who is a paraplegic as a result of the attack . a long list of attacks the assassination attempt came less than five months after a mentally disturbed woman stabbed oskar lafontaine , then premier of the state of saarland , in the throat .
since then , other politicians have become victims of - albeit less dangerous - aggression . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the attack raptured fischer 's ear drum .
in 1999 , a protestor against the green party 's agreement to send german troops to the war in kosovo hit german foreign minister joschka fischer on his ear with a paint-filled bag while a man wounded fischer 's party colleague angelika beer with a knife outside her house in 2000 . last year , hamburg ' justice minister was stabbed in the leg by a woman .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , among others , has been slapped in the face while many , including former chancellor helmut kohl and bavarian premier edmund stoiber , have been pelted with eggs . are the media to blame ? media coverage of politicians is largely to blame for an increase in attacks , according to jörg van essen , a member of parliament for the free-market liberal free democrats . " the constant scandalization of people in politics has lowered the inhibition threshold , " van essen said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1991 , former chancellor helmut kohl -lrb- left -rrb- decided to fight back when he was hit with eggs .
recently , the security expert also criticized germany 's secretive secret service , which guards the president , the chancellor and other federal state officials who could be the target of an attack . but van essen said that while the 500-member strong branch of germany 's federal criminal police -lrb- bka -rrb- previously offered insufficient protection due to a lack of bodyguards , the problem has been resolved . " nevertheless , we realize that people who stand in the public 's eye keep getting targeted for attacks , " he said , adding that it was mainly " mentally disturbed persons , who drink themselves into a stupor to attack well-known politicians . " no longer an organized threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf mainly targeted economic leaders such as alfred herrhausen , the head of deutsche bank , who was killed in this bomb attack on his car in november 1989 .
schäuble agreed that mentally disturbed people - like the one who attacked him - posed the greatest danger to politicians after the disbandment of the left-wing radical terrorist group red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , which presented an organized threat to germany 's leaders in the 1970s and 1980s . but he did n't share van essen 's view that more attacks were happening , adding that no incidents became known during the last election campaign . " you can not talk about an increase , " he said . experts also said that the general threat has significantly dropped since the raf 's heyday . back then , bka officials included 70 people in the top risk category for people , meaning they are in serious danger of becoming the target of an attack , said helwig finger , a former bodyguard in the private sector , who now works as a trainer .

church officials meanwhile called for a ban of a swiss group that wants to help terminally ill germans to die . roger kusch , who serves as justice minister in the city state of hamburg , is the first leading cdu politician who has come out in support of assisted suicide for severely ill people after a swiss group called dignitas recently announced it plans to open a german office in hanover to make it assisted suicide more accessible for germans seeking an end to their suffering . " responsible , compassionate assisted suicide does not clash with human basic rights as far as i 'm concerned , " kush wrote in a guest commentary for hamburger abe n dblatt newspaper .
" instead , it 's an expression of christian charity . " the minister backs a change to germany 's law that punishes assisted suicide .
kusch said that he could see assisted suicide to be legal , a doctor would have to determine that a person has a terminal illness and thoroughly advise the patient .
a statement from the patient certified by a notary would also be required . political oppositio n kusch 's statements have caused uproar , with a spokesman for hamburg 's state government hurrying to clarify that the politician had spoken as a private individual . germany 's hospice foundation sharply criticized kusch for his " deeply appalling " remarks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man lies in an intensive care unit eugen brysch , the foundation 's executive director , said terminally ill and dying people do n't need compassion nor mercy , but attention and highly professional care instead . the youth wing of hamburg 's christian democratic union also opposed kusch 's proposal , saying that killing a person could not be the answer to suffering and illness . social democrats also criticized kusch 's comparison of assisted suicide and abortion .
kusch had written that he did n't understand why assisted suicide was punishable with at least six months in prison while abortion was not . promoti n g a ba n the bishop of hanover 's lutheran church , margot kässmann , meanwhile called for a ban on dignitas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margot kässmann -lrb- center -rrb- " if it 's legally possible , this should happen , " she said , adding that the group was opening the door for assisted suicide .
kässmann said that germans had to rethink their approach toward severely sick people , most of whom die anonymously in hospitals . kässmann 's colleague from the southwestern state of baden-württemberg , frank july , also came out in opposition of assisted suicide . lower saxony 's justice minister elisabeth heister-neumann -lrb- cdu -rrb- has announced that she plans to introduce legislation in germany 's upper house that would penalize agencies that help with assisted suicide such as dignitas . german president horst köhler has also come out in opposition of assisted suicide . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when life becomes worse than death in a move which has caused considerable consternation among politicians and the church , the swiss organization for assisted suicide , dignitas , has founded a subsidiary in germany .

the same can not be said for schröder 's successor , angela merkel . turkish prime minster recep tayyip erdogan will be rolling out the red carpet for schröder , who will be the guest of honor at an iftar dinner in istanbul on wednesday .
iftar is a special meal for muslims after breaking a day of fasting during the holy month of ramadan . " we would like to thank the chancellor for his help during the past three years and would like to honor him because of that , " cuneyed zapsu , erdogan 's european affairs advisor , said of the special treatment afforded to schröder . turkey 's powerful ally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder playing soccer .
zapsu said that although the two leaders come from different sides of the political spectrum , they have much in common .
in addition to a love for soccer , both men have similar humble backgrounds as well as a passion for campaigning . a powerful ally , germany has proved invaluable to turkey , especially as it seeks to join the european union .
the german chancellor ’ s support was crucial , both in december , when eu leaders agreed to start accession talks with turkey , and in negotiations earlier this month to officially open the talks . " psychologically it is very important if there is somebody that understands you and tells they would like to help - that is enough to give you more strength in the psychologically very difficult talks we had , " zapsu said . business leaders look to merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german opposition party leader angela merkel -lrb- l -rrb- and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan -lrb- r -rrb- address the media in ankara , turkey on monday 16 february 2004 .
there are concerns in turkey that angela merkel , now set to succeed gerhard schröder as chancellor , could threaten the country 's aspirations to join the eu .
merkel has repeatedly spoken out against turkish eu membership , calling instead for a " privileged partnership . " but some turkish business leaders with strong links to germany are confident that the political and economic realities will make her change her stance . " when you have the responsibility of government you take wise decisions , so i expect ms merkel will tone down her rhetoric about turkey , " said ishak alaton founder of turkish engineering company alarko .
" i expect investments both from turkey towards germany and investments of german companies in turkey to increase in size and capacity .
so i am looking forward to better and stronger relations between germany and turkey . " erdogan and merkel may not share similar personal interests , but they both come from the center-right of the political spectrum and value strong ties to the united states .
while erdogan will be keen to show gratitude to schröder for his friendship and loyalty , turkish eyes are already looking to the future and , specifically , how to woo germany ’ s next chancellor . dorian jones -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parties disagree on turkey with talks over turkey 's eu entry set to begin on monday , it 's still not clear whether the bloc will offer turkey full membership or an alternative deal - an issue that 's also causing discord among germany 's parties .

church officials meanwhile called for a ban of a swiss group that wants to help terminally ill germans to die . roger kusch , who serves as justice minister in the city state of hamburg , is the first leading cdu politician who has come out in support of assisted suicide for severely ill people after a swiss group called dignitas recently announced it plans to open a german office in hanover to make it assisted suicide more accessible for germans seeking an end to their suffering . " responsible , compassionate assisted suicide does not clash with human basic rights as far as i 'm concerned , " kush wrote in a guest commentary for hamburger abe n dblatt newspaper .
" instead , it 's an expression of christian charity . " the minister backs a change to germany 's law that punishes assisted suicide .
kusch said that he could see assisted suicide to be legal , a doctor would have to determine that a person has a terminal illness and thoroughly advise the patient .
a statement from the patient certified by a notary would also be required . political oppositio n kusch 's statements have caused uproar , with a spokesman for hamburg 's state government hurrying to clarify that the politician had spoken as a private individual . germany 's hospice foundation sharply criticized kusch for his " deeply appalling " remarks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man lies in an intensive care unit eugen brysch , the foundation 's executive director , said terminally ill and dying people do n't need compassion nor mercy , but attention and highly professional care instead . the youth wing of hamburg 's christian democratic union also opposed kusch 's proposal , saying that killing a person could not be the answer to suffering and illness . social democrats also criticized kusch 's comparison of assisted suicide and abortion .
kusch had written that he did n't understand why assisted suicide was punishable with at least six months in prison while abortion was not . promoti n g a ba n the bishop of hanover 's lutheran church , margot kässmann , meanwhile called for a ban on dignitas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margot kässmann -lrb- center -rrb- " if it 's legally possible , this should happen , " she said , adding that the group was opening the door for assisted suicide .
kässmann said that germans had to rethink their approach toward severely sick people , most of whom die anonymously in hospitals . kässmann 's colleague from the southwestern state of baden-württemberg , frank july , also came out in opposition of assisted suicide . lower saxony 's justice minister elisabeth heister-neumann -lrb- cdu -rrb- has announced that she plans to introduce legislation in germany 's upper house that would penalize agencies that help with assisted suicide such as dignitas . german president horst köhler has also come out in opposition of assisted suicide . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when life becomes worse than death in a move which has caused considerable consternation among politicians and the church , the swiss organization for assisted suicide , dignitas , has founded a subsidiary in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.10.2005 schröder ponders life after chancellery großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder will have both political and private options to choose from now that germany has a new leader , there is much speculation about the future of outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder .
while he has confirmed he is stepping down , schröder 's plans for his future remain private . outgoing german chancellor gerhard schröder on tuesday confirmed that he would not play a role in the country 's next coalition government set to be headed by conservative leader angela merkel .
referring to coming negotiations between his social democrats party -lrb- spd -rrb- and merkel 's christian democrats on forming a new left-right coalition government , schröder , who was making a speech in berlin , said he wanted to " take part -lrb- in the talks -rrb- so they go well .
that 's how how we interpret our mission , even if we no longer belong to the new government . "
in the immediate future , schröder remains the head of government and will visit turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan on wednesday before a working dinner with french president jacques chirac on friday . some reports have said that he will be urged to stay within his social democrats to guide them through government in a coalition led by his conservative archrival angela merkel .
others predicted a future outside politics , including a report that he had been approached about working for russian energy giant gazprom . merkel to lead grand-coalition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel , future chancellor of germany first " grand coaltion " government since the 1960 's .
as merkel announced on monday that she had won the right to lead a coalition of her christian democrats and schröder 's social democrats , the chancellor was nowhere to be seen .
the message seemed to be that the battle to serve a third term was lost and , for once , the man known as the " media chancellor " could not steal her moment .
his only appearance was as the lone figure on the chancellery 's upper floors . it was left to franz müntefering , the social democrats ' party chief , to announce at a separate press conference that schröder would remain to help the party through the coalition negotiations .
müntefering insisted that no decision had been made on who should become vice-chancellor , a role the social democrats will fill in the division of cabinet jobs that is weighted heavily in their favor .
it appears unlikely schröder will accept the job . what comes next for gerhard ? he reportedly told merkel in their late-night crunch talks on sunday that staying in the government was " not in my career plans . "
social democrat sources have told the press that schröder had told his allies that he would not serve " under this woman . "
he may however come under pressure to stay within the social democrats in some role , and he certainly retains a seat in the bundestag lower house of parliament . schröder will face calls from leadership sages on both the right and left .
" in this situation the party can not do without him , they it need him , " said the daily süddeutsche zeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder met with putin in his hometown of st. petersburg friday , oct .
7th , as the german leader took a break from tough political coalition negotiations .
in the immediate future , schröder will remain chancellor and has plans to meet with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan on wednesday before a working dinner with french president jacques chirac on friday .
both meetings are designed to plan the eu summit at hampton court palace , near london , on october 27 - 28 , at which schröder will represent germany . what happens after that is unclear .
at 61 , schröder has the energy , charisma and contacts to make big money in the private sector .
his fourth wife , doris schröder-köpf , 20 years his junior , has expressed a desire to live in new york , although schröder , a trained lawyer , would have to improve his english to work in the united states . the top-selling german newspaper bild , quoting russian media , said he had discussed working for gazprom when he attended the birthday celebrations of close ally russian president vladimir putin over the weekend .
but on that rumor , as with all the others , there has only been silence from schröder . dw staff / afp -lrb- aal -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press : merkel 's historic moment german newspapers called angela merkel 's announcement that she will be the country 's next chancellor an historic moment , but said she faced a tough time leading a left-right coalition .

church officials meanwhile called for a ban of a swiss group that wants to help terminally ill germans to die . roger kusch , who serves as justice minister in the city state of hamburg , is the first leading cdu politician who has come out in support of assisted suicide for severely ill people after a swiss group called dignitas recently announced it plans to open a german office in hanover to make it assisted suicide more accessible for germans seeking an end to their suffering . " responsible , compassionate assisted suicide does not clash with human basic rights as far as i 'm concerned , " kush wrote in a guest commentary for hamburger abe n dblatt newspaper .
" instead , it 's an expression of christian charity . " the minister backs a change to germany 's law that punishes assisted suicide .
kusch said that he could see assisted suicide to be legal , a doctor would have to determine that a person has a terminal illness and thoroughly advise the patient .
a statement from the patient certified by a notary would also be required . political oppositio n kusch 's statements have caused uproar , with a spokesman for hamburg 's state government hurrying to clarify that the politician had spoken as a private individual . germany 's hospice foundation sharply criticized kusch for his " deeply appalling " remarks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man lies in an intensive care unit eugen brysch , the foundation 's executive director , said terminally ill and dying people do n't need compassion nor mercy , but attention and highly professional care instead . the youth wing of hamburg 's christian democratic union also opposed kusch 's proposal , saying that killing a person could not be the answer to suffering and illness . social democrats also criticized kusch 's comparison of assisted suicide and abortion .
kusch had written that he did n't understand why assisted suicide was punishable with at least six months in prison while abortion was not . promoti n g a ba n the bishop of hanover 's lutheran church , margot kässmann , meanwhile called for a ban on dignitas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margot kässmann -lrb- center -rrb- " if it 's legally possible , this should happen , " she said , adding that the group was opening the door for assisted suicide .
kässmann said that germans had to rethink their approach toward severely sick people , most of whom die anonymously in hospitals . kässmann 's colleague from the southwestern state of baden-württemberg , frank july , also came out in opposition of assisted suicide . lower saxony 's justice minister elisabeth heister-neumann -lrb- cdu -rrb- has announced that she plans to introduce legislation in germany 's upper house that would penalize agencies that help with assisted suicide such as dignitas . german president horst köhler has also come out in opposition of assisted suicide . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when life becomes worse than death in a move which has caused considerable consternation among politicians and the church , the swiss organization for assisted suicide , dignitas , has founded a subsidiary in germany .

some say that attacks have been on the increase since then , but the victim himself sees things differently . wolfgang schäuble was ready to call it a day . " i 'm tired and wo n't keep going much longer , " the german interior minister reportedly told his wife on the phone before heading to one last election campaign event late on oct .
12 , 1990 . schäuble did n't come home that night : as he was leaving the meeting , a mentally disturbed man fired three shots at him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble still relies on protection " i think i heard a bang and felt heat , but i do n't remember anything else , " said schäuble , adding that he immediately lost consciousness .
two bullets had hit the minister in the face and the chest .
the third wounded one of schäuble 's bodyguards , who had thrown himself in front of the politician . " if the third shot had hit me as well , i would not have survived , " said schäuble , who is a paraplegic as a result of the attack . a long list of attacks the assassination attempt came less than five months after a mentally disturbed woman stabbed oskar lafontaine , then premier of the state of saarland , in the throat .
since then , other politicians have become victims of - albeit less dangerous - aggression . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the attack raptured fischer 's ear drum .
in 1999 , a protestor against the green party 's agreement to send german troops to the war in kosovo hit german foreign minister joschka fischer on his ear with a paint-filled bag while a man wounded fischer 's party colleague angelika beer with a knife outside her house in 2000 . last year , hamburg ' justice minister was stabbed in the leg by a woman .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , among others , has been slapped in the face while many , including former chancellor helmut kohl and bavarian premier edmund stoiber , have been pelted with eggs . are the media to blame ? media coverage of politicians is largely to blame for an increase in attacks , according to jörg van essen , a member of parliament for the free-market liberal free democrats . " the constant scandalization of people in politics has lowered the inhibition threshold , " van essen said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1991 , former chancellor helmut kohl -lrb- left -rrb- decided to fight back when he was hit with eggs .
recently , the security expert also criticized germany 's secretive secret service , which guards the president , the chancellor and other federal state officials who could be the target of an attack . but van essen said that while the 500-member strong branch of germany 's federal criminal police -lrb- bka -rrb- previously offered insufficient protection due to a lack of bodyguards , the problem has been resolved . " nevertheless , we realize that people who stand in the public 's eye keep getting targeted for attacks , " he said , adding that it was mainly " mentally disturbed persons , who drink themselves into a stupor to attack well-known politicians . " no longer an organized threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf mainly targeted economic leaders such as alfred herrhausen , the head of deutsche bank , who was killed in this bomb attack on his car in november 1989 .
schäuble agreed that mentally disturbed people - like the one who attacked him - posed the greatest danger to politicians after the disbandment of the left-wing radical terrorist group red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , which presented an organized threat to germany 's leaders in the 1970s and 1980s . but he did n't share van essen 's view that more attacks were happening , adding that no incidents became known during the last election campaign . " you can not talk about an increase , " he said . experts also said that the general threat has significantly dropped since the raf 's heyday . back then , bka officials included 70 people in the top risk category for people , meaning they are in serious danger of becoming the target of an attack , said helwig finger , a former bodyguard in the private sector , who now works as a trainer .
that number has dropped to about 15 people since , he said . the risks of public life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder is likely to keep bodyguards after he leaves office .
finger also added that the occasional slap in the face was almost inevitable because of the desire of politicians to rub shoulders with the people . " it looks negligent , not because bka officials are doing a bad job , but because schröder says , ' i do n't want anyone in front of me , " ' he said . schäuble , meanwhile , said that complete protection was impossible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble " any public figure is exposed to personal risks , " he said .
" it 's impossible to protect people 100 percent . " the christian democrat himself could soon oversee the protection of politicians again . while he denied any comment on the matter , the current deputy leader of his party 's parliamentary group stands a good chance of returning to his old job as interior minister in germany 's next government . mathis winkler , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de exhibit takes german terror stain public a controversial exhibition based on the life and times of the red army faction , germany 's own notorious terror group , opens in berlin on saturday in the face of continuing opposition .

12 , 1990 . schäuble did n't come home that night : as he was leaving the meeting , a mentally disturbed man fired three shots at him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble still relies on protection " i think i heard a bang and felt heat , but i do n't remember anything else , " said schäuble , adding that he immediately lost consciousness .
two bullets had hit the minister in the face and the chest .
the third wounded one of schäuble 's bodyguards , who had thrown himself in front of the politician . " if the third shot had hit me as well , i would not have survived , " said schäuble , who is a paraplegic as a result of the attack . a long list of attacks the assassination attempt came less than five months after a mentally disturbed woman stabbed oskar lafontaine , then premier of the state of saarland , in the throat .
since then , other politicians have become victims of - albeit less dangerous - aggression . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the attack raptured fischer 's ear drum .
in 1999 , a protestor against the green party 's agreement to send german troops to the war in kosovo hit german foreign minister joschka fischer on his ear with a paint-filled bag while a man wounded fischer 's party colleague angelika beer with a knife outside her house in 2000 . last year , hamburg ' justice minister was stabbed in the leg by a woman .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , among others , has been slapped in the face while many , including former chancellor helmut kohl and bavarian premier edmund stoiber , have been pelted with eggs . are the media to blame ? media coverage of politicians is largely to blame for an increase in attacks , according to jörg van essen , a member of parliament for the free-market liberal free democrats . " the constant scandalization of people in politics has lowered the inhibition threshold , " van essen said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1991 , former chancellor helmut kohl -lrb- left -rrb- decided to fight back when he was hit with eggs .
recently , the security expert also criticized germany 's secretive secret service , which guards the president , the chancellor and other federal state officials who could be the target of an attack . but van essen said that while the 500-member strong branch of germany 's federal criminal police -lrb- bka -rrb- previously offered insufficient protection due to a lack of bodyguards , the problem has been resolved . " nevertheless , we realize that people who stand in the public 's eye keep getting targeted for attacks , " he said , adding that it was mainly " mentally disturbed persons , who drink themselves into a stupor to attack well-known politicians . " no longer an organized threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf mainly targeted economic leaders such as alfred herrhausen , the head of deutsche bank , who was killed in this bomb attack on his car in november 1989 .
schäuble agreed that mentally disturbed people - like the one who attacked him - posed the greatest danger to politicians after the disbandment of the left-wing radical terrorist group red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , which presented an organized threat to germany 's leaders in the 1970s and 1980s . but he did n't share van essen 's view that more attacks were happening , adding that no incidents became known during the last election campaign . " you can not talk about an increase , " he said . experts also said that the general threat has significantly dropped since the raf 's heyday . back then , bka officials included 70 people in the top risk category for people , meaning they are in serious danger of becoming the target of an attack , said helwig finger , a former bodyguard in the private sector , who now works as a trainer .
that number has dropped to about 15 people since , he said . the risks of public life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder is likely to keep bodyguards after he leaves office .
finger also added that the occasional slap in the face was almost inevitable because of the desire of politicians to rub shoulders with the people . " it looks negligent , not because bka officials are doing a bad job , but because schröder says , ' i do n't want anyone in front of me , " ' he said . schäuble , meanwhile , said that complete protection was impossible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble " any public figure is exposed to personal risks , " he said .
" it 's impossible to protect people 100 percent .

china 's coach zhu told dw-world his team is looking for experience but his philosophical outlook masks a desire to cause an upset . germany is hoping that quick and decisive victory against china on wednesday will deflect some of the criticism still circling afte their embarrassing 1:2 loss in istanbul last saturday . still , the million dollar question on everyone 's lips remans : can jürgen klinsmann 's team reinvigorate themselves over the course of a few days and present a new image to the nearly sold-out crowd at hamburg 's aol-arena ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese team captain li weifeng at practice .
speaking to dw-world , germany 's assistant coach joachim löw does n't mince words : " the german team must beat china - there is no alternative .

klose back on the team bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg welcomes the chinese team .
with team captain michael ballack sidelined with the flu , the germans have few options other then to give midfielder torsten frings yet another chance to prove his leadership qualities against china where he will hopefully bounce-back from his poor play against the turks .
likewise , changes will likely be made on defence with marcell jansen suffering from a pulled hamstring and lukas sinkiewics from a bruised foot . in attack , miroslav klose is available , although it remains uncertain whether the werder bremen striker will play .
modesty in the key against kahn and company china 's coach , zhu guanghu is n't leaving anything to chance . in an interview with dw-world he said , " we 've already studied the video of the germany-turkey game " . in spite of the fact that some say the current german team is not up to form zhu remains humble when speaking to the press : " germany is a traditionally dominant force in european soccer . we 've come primarily to learn . "

china 's striker , xie hui told dw-world that the chinese had nothing by but praise for the german team and was looking forward to the experience that playing against klinsmann 's team would bring them .

church officials meanwhile called for a ban of a swiss group that wants to help terminally ill germans to die . roger kusch , who serves as justice minister in the city state of hamburg , is the first leading cdu politician who has come out in support of assisted suicide for severely ill people after a swiss group called dignitas recently announced it plans to open a german office in hanover to make it assisted suicide more accessible for germans seeking an end to their suffering . " responsible , compassionate assisted suicide does not clash with human basic rights as far as i 'm concerned , " kush wrote in a guest commentary for hamburger abe n dblatt newspaper .
" instead , it 's an expression of christian charity . " the minister backs a change to germany 's law that punishes assisted suicide .
kusch said that he could see assisted suicide to be legal , a doctor would have to determine that a person has a terminal illness and thoroughly advise the patient .
a statement from the patient certified by a notary would also be required . political oppositio n kusch 's statements have caused uproar , with a spokesman for hamburg 's state government hurrying to clarify that the politician had spoken as a private individual . germany 's hospice foundation sharply criticized kusch for his " deeply appalling " remarks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man lies in an intensive care unit eugen brysch , the foundation 's executive director , said terminally ill and dying people do n't need compassion nor mercy , but attention and highly professional care instead . the youth wing of hamburg 's christian democratic union also opposed kusch 's proposal , saying that killing a person could not be the answer to suffering and illness . social democrats also criticized kusch 's comparison of assisted suicide and abortion .
kusch had written that he did n't understand why assisted suicide was punishable with at least six months in prison while abortion was not . promoti n g a ba n the bishop of hanover 's lutheran church , margot kässmann , meanwhile called for a ban on dignitas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margot kässmann -lrb- center -rrb- " if it 's legally possible , this should happen , " she said , adding that the group was opening the door for assisted suicide .
kässmann said that germans had to rethink their approach toward severely sick people , most of whom die anonymously in hospitals . kässmann 's colleague from the southwestern state of baden-württemberg , frank july , also came out in opposition of assisted suicide . lower saxony 's justice minister elisabeth heister-neumann -lrb- cdu -rrb- has announced that she plans to introduce legislation in germany 's upper house that would penalize agencies that help with assisted suicide such as dignitas . german president horst köhler has also come out in opposition of assisted suicide . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when life becomes worse than death in a move which has caused considerable consternation among politicians and the church , the swiss organization for assisted suicide , dignitas , has founded a subsidiary in germany .

" instead , it 's an expression of christian charity . " the minister backs a change to germany 's law that punishes assisted suicide .
kusch said that he could see assisted suicide to be legal , a doctor would have to determine that a person has a terminal illness and thoroughly advise the patient .
a statement from the patient certified by a notary would also be required . political oppositio n kusch 's statements have caused uproar , with a spokesman for hamburg 's state government hurrying to clarify that the politician had spoken as a private individual . germany 's hospice foundation sharply criticized kusch for his " deeply appalling " remarks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man lies in an intensive care unit eugen brysch , the foundation 's executive director , said terminally ill and dying people do n't need compassion nor mercy , but attention and highly professional care instead . the youth wing of hamburg 's christian democratic union also opposed kusch 's proposal , saying that killing a person could not be the answer to suffering and illness . social democrats also criticized kusch 's comparison of assisted suicide and abortion .
kusch had written that he did n't understand why assisted suicide was punishable with at least six months in prison while abortion was not . promoti n g a ba n the bishop of hanover 's lutheran church , margot kässmann , meanwhile called for a ban on dignitas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margot kässmann -lrb- center -rrb- " if it 's legally possible , this should happen , " she said , adding that the group was opening the door for assisted suicide .
kässmann said that germans had to rethink their approach toward severely sick people , most of whom die anonymously in hospitals . kässmann 's colleague from the southwestern state of baden-württemberg , frank july , also came out in opposition of assisted suicide . lower saxony 's justice minister elisabeth heister-neumann -lrb- cdu -rrb- has announced that she plans to introduce legislation in germany 's upper house that would penalize agencies that help with assisted suicide such as dignitas . german president horst köhler has also come out in opposition of assisted suicide . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when life becomes worse than death in a move which has caused considerable consternation among politicians and the church , the swiss organization for assisted suicide , dignitas , has founded a subsidiary in germany .

while he has confirmed he is stepping down , schröder 's plans for his future remain private . outgoing german chancellor gerhard schröder on tuesday confirmed that he would not play a role in the country 's next coalition government set to be headed by conservative leader angela merkel .
referring to coming negotiations between his social democrats party -lrb- spd -rrb- and merkel 's christian democrats on forming a new left-right coalition government , schröder , who was making a speech in berlin , said he wanted to " take part -lrb- in the talks -rrb- so they go well .
that 's how how we interpret our mission , even if we no longer belong to the new government . "
in the immediate future , schröder remains the head of government and will visit turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan on wednesday before a working dinner with french president jacques chirac on friday . some reports have said that he will be urged to stay within his social democrats to guide them through government in a coalition led by his conservative archrival angela merkel .
others predicted a future outside politics , including a report that he had been approached about working for russian energy giant gazprom . merkel to lead grand-coalition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel , future chancellor of germany first " grand coaltion " government since the 1960 's .
as merkel announced on monday that she had won the right to lead a coalition of her christian democrats and schröder 's social democrats , the chancellor was nowhere to be seen .
the message seemed to be that the battle to serve a third term was lost and , for once , the man known as the " media chancellor " could not steal her moment .
his only appearance was as the lone figure on the chancellery 's upper floors . it was left to franz müntefering , the social democrats ' party chief , to announce at a separate press conference that schröder would remain to help the party through the coalition negotiations .
müntefering insisted that no decision had been made on who should become vice-chancellor , a role the social democrats will fill in the division of cabinet jobs that is weighted heavily in their favor .
it appears unlikely schröder will accept the job . what comes next for gerhard ? he reportedly told merkel in their late-night crunch talks on sunday that staying in the government was " not in my career plans . "
social democrat sources have told the press that schröder had told his allies that he would not serve " under this woman . "
he may however come under pressure to stay within the social democrats in some role , and he certainly retains a seat in the bundestag lower house of parliament . schröder will face calls from leadership sages on both the right and left .
" in this situation the party can not do without him , they it need him , " said the daily süddeutsche zeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder met with putin in his hometown of st. petersburg friday , oct .
7th , as the german leader took a break from tough political coalition negotiations .
in the immediate future , schröder will remain chancellor and has plans to meet with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan on wednesday before a working dinner with french president jacques chirac on friday .
both meetings are designed to plan the eu summit at hampton court palace , near london , on october 27 - 28 , at which schröder will represent germany . what happens after that is unclear .
at 61 , schröder has the energy , charisma and contacts to make big money in the private sector .
his fourth wife , doris schröder-köpf , 20 years his junior , has expressed a desire to live in new york , although schröder , a trained lawyer , would have to improve his english to work in the united states . the top-selling german newspaper bild , quoting russian media , said he had discussed working for gazprom when he attended the birthday celebrations of close ally russian president vladimir putin over the weekend .
but on that rumor , as with all the others , there has only been silence from schröder . dw staff / afp -lrb- aal -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press : merkel 's historic moment german newspapers called angela merkel 's announcement that she will be the country 's next chancellor an historic moment , but said she faced a tough time leading a left-right coalition .

there are concerns in turkey that angela merkel , now set to succeed gerhard schröder as chancellor , could threaten the country 's aspirations to join the eu .
merkel has repeatedly spoken out against turkish eu membership , calling instead for a " privileged partnership . " but some turkish business leaders with strong links to germany are confident that the political and economic realities will make her change her stance . " when you have the responsibility of government you take wise decisions , so i expect ms merkel will tone down her rhetoric about turkey , " said ishak alaton founder of turkish engineering company alarko .
" i expect investments both from turkey towards germany and investments of german companies in turkey to increase in size and capacity .
so i am looking forward to better and stronger relations between germany and turkey . " erdogan and merkel may not share similar personal interests , but they both come from the center-right of the political spectrum and value strong ties to the united states .
while erdogan will be keen to show gratitude to schröder for his friendship and loyalty , turkish eyes are already looking to the future and , specifically , how to woo germany ’ s next chancellor . dorian jones -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parties disagree on turkey with talks over turkey 's eu entry set to begin on monday , it 's still not clear whether the bloc will offer turkey full membership or an alternative deal - an issue that 's also causing discord among germany 's parties .

church officials meanwhile called for a ban of a swiss group that wants to help terminally ill germans to die . roger kusch , who serves as justice minister in the city state of hamburg , is the first leading cdu politician who has come out in support of assisted suicide for severely ill people after a swiss group called dignitas recently announced it plans to open a german office in hanover to make it assisted suicide more accessible for germans seeking an end to their suffering . " responsible , compassionate assisted suicide does not clash with human basic rights as far as i 'm concerned , " kush wrote in a guest commentary for hamburger abe n dblatt newspaper .
" instead , it 's an expression of christian charity . " the minister backs a change to germany 's law that punishes assisted suicide .
kusch said that he could see assisted suicide to be legal , a doctor would have to determine that a person has a terminal illness and thoroughly advise the patient .
a statement from the patient certified by a notary would also be required . political oppositio n kusch 's statements have caused uproar , with a spokesman for hamburg 's state government hurrying to clarify that the politician had spoken as a private individual . germany 's hospice foundation sharply criticized kusch for his " deeply appalling " remarks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man lies in an intensive care unit eugen brysch , the foundation 's executive director , said terminally ill and dying people do n't need compassion nor mercy , but attention and highly professional care instead . the youth wing of hamburg 's christian democratic union also opposed kusch 's proposal , saying that killing a person could not be the answer to suffering and illness . social democrats also criticized kusch 's comparison of assisted suicide and abortion .
kusch had written that he did n't understand why assisted suicide was punishable with at least six months in prison while abortion was not . promoti n g a ba n the bishop of hanover 's lutheran church , margot kässmann , meanwhile called for a ban on dignitas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margot kässmann -lrb- center -rrb- " if it 's legally possible , this should happen , " she said , adding that the group was opening the door for assisted suicide .
kässmann said that germans had to rethink their approach toward severely sick people , most of whom die anonymously in hospitals . kässmann 's colleague from the southwestern state of baden-württemberg , frank july , also came out in opposition of assisted suicide . lower saxony 's justice minister elisabeth heister-neumann -lrb- cdu -rrb- has announced that she plans to introduce legislation in germany 's upper house that would penalize agencies that help with assisted suicide such as dignitas . german president horst köhler has also come out in opposition of assisted suicide . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when life becomes worse than death in a move which has caused considerable consternation among politicians and the church , the swiss organization for assisted suicide , dignitas , has founded a subsidiary in germany .

as the flu reached turkey and romania , a german national task force is meeting wednesday to discuss safety measures . high level officials from the federal government and the german states are set to meet in bonn to examine when emergency measures should be implemented and poultry quarantined .
environment minister jürgen trittin , interim head of the consumer affairs and agriculture ministry , has said that the ministry is prepared for the worst and that a ban on poultry is , as yet , unnecessary . he said that if the results of eu tests on infected romanian and turkish cases showed that they did indeed have the highly pathogenic h5n1 virus , " our emergency plans will immediately come into effect . "
the cases in turkey are so far known to be infected with the h5 strain , the same one found in asia .
the disease has not confirmed been confirmed in romania .

trittin called on visitors to romania and turkey to avoid going to places where poultry is bred .
germany poorly prepared ? bernhard ruf , head doctor at leipzig 's st. georg clinic , warned that germany only has enough medication for around 8-10 percent of the population .
the world health organization , however , recommends that states have a reserve of medication for 20-25 percent , " ruf said in an interview with radio broadcaster deutschlandfunk on wednesday . " there is a backlog of demand that must now be met , " ruf said .
the government must take advantage of the time before a pandemic breaks out to prepare , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birds imported illegally present the greatest risk to germany , according to the national research institute for animal health , the friedrich loeffler institute .
it 's less likely that migratory birds will carry the virus from turkey or romania to germany , particularly since they have begun flying south for the winter . the eu has already banned poultry imports from countries where the h5n1 virus has been detected as well as live fowl and feather imports from turkey . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bird flu reaches europe pushing further towards western europe , bird flu has reached turkey and romania , though it is unclear whether the cases there involve the h5n1 viral strain that poses a threat to humans .

while he has confirmed he is stepping down , schröder 's plans for his future remain private . outgoing german chancellor gerhard schröder on tuesday confirmed that he would not play a role in the country 's next coalition government set to be headed by conservative leader angela merkel .
referring to coming negotiations between his social democrats party -lrb- spd -rrb- and merkel 's christian democrats on forming a new left-right coalition government , schröder , who was making a speech in berlin , said he wanted to " take part -lrb- in the talks -rrb- so they go well .
that 's how how we interpret our mission , even if we no longer belong to the new government . "
in the immediate future , schröder remains the head of government and will visit turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan on wednesday before a working dinner with french president jacques chirac on friday . some reports have said that he will be urged to stay within his social democrats to guide them through government in a coalition led by his conservative archrival angela merkel .

as merkel announced on monday that she had won the right to lead a coalition of her christian democrats and schröder 's social democrats , the chancellor was nowhere to be seen .
the message seemed to be that the battle to serve a third term was lost and , for once , the man known as the " media chancellor " could not steal her moment .
his only appearance was as the lone figure on the chancellery 's upper floors . it was left to franz müntefering , the social democrats ' party chief , to announce at a separate press conference that schröder would remain to help the party through the coalition negotiations .
müntefering insisted that no decision had been made on who should become vice-chancellor , a role the social democrats will fill in the division of cabinet jobs that is weighted heavily in their favor .
it appears unlikely schröder will accept the job . what comes next for gerhard ? he reportedly told merkel in their late-night crunch talks on sunday that staying in the government was " not in my career plans . "
social democrat sources have told the press that schröder had told his allies that he would not serve " under this woman . "
he may however come under pressure to stay within the social democrats in some role , and he certainly retains a seat in the bundestag lower house of parliament . schröder will face calls from leadership sages on both the right and left .

while he has confirmed he is stepping down , schröder 's plans for his future remain private . outgoing german chancellor gerhard schröder on tuesday confirmed that he would not play a role in the country 's next coalition government set to be headed by conservative leader angela merkel .
referring to coming negotiations between his social democrats party -lrb- spd -rrb- and merkel 's christian democrats on forming a new left-right coalition government , schröder , who was making a speech in berlin , said he wanted to " take part -lrb- in the talks -rrb- so they go well .
that 's how how we interpret our mission , even if we no longer belong to the new government . "
in the immediate future , schröder remains the head of government and will visit turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan on wednesday before a working dinner with french president jacques chirac on friday . some reports have said that he will be urged to stay within his social democrats to guide them through government in a coalition led by his conservative archrival angela merkel .
others predicted a future outside politics , including a report that he had been approached about working for russian energy giant gazprom . merkel to lead grand-coalition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel , future chancellor of germany first " grand coaltion " government since the 1960 's .
as merkel announced on monday that she had won the right to lead a coalition of her christian democrats and schröder 's social democrats , the chancellor was nowhere to be seen .
the message seemed to be that the battle to serve a third term was lost and , for once , the man known as the " media chancellor " could not steal her moment .
his only appearance was as the lone figure on the chancellery 's upper floors . it was left to franz müntefering , the social democrats ' party chief , to announce at a separate press conference that schröder would remain to help the party through the coalition negotiations .
müntefering insisted that no decision had been made on who should become vice-chancellor , a role the social democrats will fill in the division of cabinet jobs that is weighted heavily in their favor .
it appears unlikely schröder will accept the job . what comes next for gerhard ? he reportedly told merkel in their late-night crunch talks on sunday that staying in the government was " not in my career plans . "
social democrat sources have told the press that schröder had told his allies that he would not serve " under this woman . "
he may however come under pressure to stay within the social democrats in some role , and he certainly retains a seat in the bundestag lower house of parliament . schröder will face calls from leadership sages on both the right and left .

at 61 , schröder has the energy , charisma and contacts to make big money in the private sector .
his fourth wife , doris schröder-köpf , 20 years his junior , has expressed a desire to live in new york , although schröder , a trained lawyer , would have to improve his english to work in the united states . the top-selling german newspaper bild , quoting russian media , said he had discussed working for gazprom when he attended the birthday celebrations of close ally russian president vladimir putin over the weekend .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.10.2005 eu launches africa strategy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : povery drives many africans to risk their lives to get to europe the european union launched an ambitious new strategy for africa wednesday including bolstering the continent 's transport infrastructure , saying recent immigrant deaths highlight the need for action . european commission chief jose manuel barroso outlined plans after talks with the chief executive of the african union , alpha oumar konare , who said poverty remained a fundamental problem driving young africans to seek to leave . " the problem of immigration , the dramatic consequences of which we are witnessing , can only be addressed effectively ... through an ambitious and coordinated development cooperation to fight its root causes , " said barroso . " the eu strategy ... will mark a true turning point to help africa help itself , " added eu aid commissioner louis michel , noting that the strategy still has to be approved by the european parliament and eu governments . the eu initiative comes after the bloc 's 25 member governments agreed in may to increase development aid budget by 20 billion euros per year by 2010 .
from 17 billion euros for africa in 2003 , the figure would rise to 25 billion at the end of the decade , according to eu figures . " walls and prisons " on the immigration problem , konare warned that the " walls and prisons " can not prevent immigrants trying to enter europe illegally , saying the underlying economic and social reasons had to be tackled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain recently increased fortifications to prevent immigrants from climbing over the fence seperating its north african enclave melilla and morocco " it 's not security measures , it 's not prisons in madrid and walls in africa that will solve the problem , " said konare , chair of the au commission , after the brussels talks .
queried during a visit to portugal about the issue , un secretary general kofi annan also stressed that improving africans ' lives at home was the way forward .
" if we create reasonable living conditions , people will not feel forced to leave , " the lusa news agency quoted him as saying .
some 14 people have died in recent months while trying to break into spanish enclaves , some of them shot by moroccan security forces .
morocco has also come under fire for dumping hundreds of the would-be immigrants in desert areas near the algerian border . the african union leader said the underlying problems which fueled an exodus of poor africans had to be tackled . " we have to have the courage to broach the problem of farm subsidies , which weaken our economy and impoverish our rural areas , " he said , in a clear reference to the eu 's long-controversial generous farm aid system . konare added that african immigrants like those trying to get into spain " are a reflection of the poverty " of a continent on which 40 percent of the population lives on less than a euro a day . halve poverty by 2015 the eu strategy is designed to help africa achieve the so-called millennium development goals , chief among which is to reduce poverty by half by 2015 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after being abandoned by moroccan police in the country 's south , these illegal immigrants from senegal walked 550 km -lrb- 340 miles -rrb- on their way to oujda , morocco .
six of their group died during the 10-day trek .
above all africa needs peace and stability , said the eu executive , explaining its proposals to strengthen good governance - sorely needed to overturn the continent 's reputation for corruption . but it stressed that the key motor of african development will be strengthening economies , and for that infrastrure - road and rail transport , but also water , energy and telecoms links - is crucial . the creation of such networks will add a " spinal column " for the development of a genuine internal market across the continent , eu officials say . konare agreed that to bolster its own national economies is essential .
" without an african internal market , it is an illusion to believe that we can strive towards overseas markets , " said konare . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain starts deporting immigrants spain has started deporting illegal immigrants despite concerns about possible human rights violations while a new assault on the spanish border by african immigrants resulted in six deaths .

" the problem of immigration , the dramatic consequences of which we are witnessing , can only be addressed effectively ... through an ambitious and coordinated development cooperation to fight its root causes , " said barroso . " the eu strategy ... will mark a true turning point to help africa help itself , " added eu aid commissioner louis michel , noting that the strategy still has to be approved by the european parliament and eu governments . the eu initiative comes after the bloc 's 25 member governments agreed in may to increase development aid budget by 20 billion euros per year by 2010 .
from 17 billion euros for africa in 2003 , the figure would rise to 25 billion at the end of the decade , according to eu figures . " walls and prisons " on the immigration problem , konare warned that the " walls and prisons " can not prevent immigrants trying to enter europe illegally , saying the underlying economic and social reasons had to be tackled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain recently increased fortifications to prevent immigrants from climbing over the fence seperating its north african enclave melilla and morocco " it 's not security measures , it 's not prisons in madrid and walls in africa that will solve the problem , " said konare , chair of the au commission , after the brussels talks .
queried during a visit to portugal about the issue , un secretary general kofi annan also stressed that improving africans ' lives at home was the way forward .
" if we create reasonable living conditions , people will not feel forced to leave , " the lusa news agency quoted him as saying .
some 14 people have died in recent months while trying to break into spanish enclaves , some of them shot by moroccan security forces .
morocco has also come under fire for dumping hundreds of the would-be immigrants in desert areas near the algerian border . the african union leader said the underlying problems which fueled an exodus of poor africans had to be tackled . " we have to have the courage to broach the problem of farm subsidies , which weaken our economy and impoverish our rural areas , " he said , in a clear reference to the eu 's long-controversial generous farm aid system . konare added that african immigrants like those trying to get into spain " are a reflection of the poverty " of a continent on which 40 percent of the population lives on less than a euro a day . halve poverty by 2015 the eu strategy is designed to help africa achieve the so-called millennium development goals , chief among which is to reduce poverty by half by 2015 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after being abandoned by moroccan police in the country 's south , these illegal immigrants from senegal walked 550 km -lrb- 340 miles -rrb- on their way to oujda , morocco .
six of their group died during the 10-day trek .
above all africa needs peace and stability , said the eu executive , explaining its proposals to strengthen good governance - sorely needed to overturn the continent 's reputation for corruption . but it stressed that the key motor of african development will be strengthening economies , and for that infrastrure - road and rail transport , but also water , energy and telecoms links - is crucial . the creation of such networks will add a " spinal column " for the development of a genuine internal market across the continent , eu officials say . konare agreed that to bolster its own national economies is essential .

as the flu reached turkey and romania , a german national task force is meeting wednesday to discuss safety measures . high level officials from the federal government and the german states are set to meet in bonn to examine when emergency measures should be implemented and poultry quarantined .
environment minister jürgen trittin , interim head of the consumer affairs and agriculture ministry , has said that the ministry is prepared for the worst and that a ban on poultry is , as yet , unnecessary . he said that if the results of eu tests on infected romanian and turkish cases showed that they did indeed have the highly pathogenic h5n1 virus , " our emergency plans will immediately come into effect . "
the cases in turkey are so far known to be infected with the h5 strain , the same one found in asia .
the disease has not confirmed been confirmed in romania .
the european commission expects to have the test results later in the week . three german states , lower saxony , mecklenburg-western pomerania and north rhine-westphalia , have already called on poultry owners in certain areas to voluntarily confine their fowl to stalls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vaccinating geese in vietnam the avian flu virus is transmitted through physical contact with infected birds and can be carried on clothes or shoes , for example , but not by air .
trittin called on visitors to romania and turkey to avoid going to places where poultry is bred .
germany poorly prepared ? bernhard ruf , head doctor at leipzig 's st. georg clinic , warned that germany only has enough medication for around 8-10 percent of the population .
the world health organization , however , recommends that states have a reserve of medication for 20-25 percent , " ruf said in an interview with radio broadcaster deutschlandfunk on wednesday . " there is a backlog of demand that must now be met , " ruf said .
the government must take advantage of the time before a pandemic breaks out to prepare , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birds imported illegally present the greatest risk to germany , according to the national research institute for animal health , the friedrich loeffler institute .
it 's less likely that migratory birds will carry the virus from turkey or romania to germany , particularly since they have begun flying south for the winter . the eu has already banned poultry imports from countries where the h5n1 virus has been detected as well as live fowl and feather imports from turkey . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bird flu reaches europe pushing further towards western europe , bird flu has reached turkey and romania , though it is unclear whether the cases there involve the h5n1 viral strain that poses a threat to humans .

" the problem of immigration , the dramatic consequences of which we are witnessing , can only be addressed effectively ... through an ambitious and coordinated development cooperation to fight its root causes , " said barroso . " the eu strategy ... will mark a true turning point to help africa help itself , " added eu aid commissioner louis michel , noting that the strategy still has to be approved by the european parliament and eu governments . the eu initiative comes after the bloc 's 25 member governments agreed in may to increase development aid budget by 20 billion euros per year by 2010 .
from 17 billion euros for africa in 2003 , the figure would rise to 25 billion at the end of the decade , according to eu figures . " walls and prisons " on the immigration problem , konare warned that the " walls and prisons " can not prevent immigrants trying to enter europe illegally , saying the underlying economic and social reasons had to be tackled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain recently increased fortifications to prevent immigrants from climbing over the fence seperating its north african enclave melilla and morocco " it 's not security measures , it 's not prisons in madrid and walls in africa that will solve the problem , " said konare , chair of the au commission , after the brussels talks .
queried during a visit to portugal about the issue , un secretary general kofi annan also stressed that improving africans ' lives at home was the way forward .
" if we create reasonable living conditions , people will not feel forced to leave , " the lusa news agency quoted him as saying .
some 14 people have died in recent months while trying to break into spanish enclaves , some of them shot by moroccan security forces .
morocco has also come under fire for dumping hundreds of the would-be immigrants in desert areas near the algerian border . the african union leader said the underlying problems which fueled an exodus of poor africans had to be tackled . " we have to have the courage to broach the problem of farm subsidies , which weaken our economy and impoverish our rural areas , " he said , in a clear reference to the eu 's long-controversial generous farm aid system . konare added that african immigrants like those trying to get into spain " are a reflection of the poverty " of a continent on which 40 percent of the population lives on less than a euro a day . halve poverty by 2015 the eu strategy is designed to help africa achieve the so-called millennium development goals , chief among which is to reduce poverty by half by 2015 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after being abandoned by moroccan police in the country 's south , these illegal immigrants from senegal walked 550 km -lrb- 340 miles -rrb- on their way to oujda , morocco .
six of their group died during the 10-day trek .
above all africa needs peace and stability , said the eu executive , explaining its proposals to strengthen good governance - sorely needed to overturn the continent 's reputation for corruption . but it stressed that the key motor of african development will be strengthening economies , and for that infrastrure - road and rail transport , but also water , energy and telecoms links - is crucial . the creation of such networks will add a " spinal column " for the development of a genuine internal market across the continent , eu officials say . konare agreed that to bolster its own national economies is essential .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.10.2005 eu launches africa strategy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : povery drives many africans to risk their lives to get to europe the european union launched an ambitious new strategy for africa wednesday including bolstering the continent 's transport infrastructure , saying recent immigrant deaths highlight the need for action . european commission chief jose manuel barroso outlined plans after talks with the chief executive of the african union , alpha oumar konare , who said poverty remained a fundamental problem driving young africans to seek to leave . " the problem of immigration , the dramatic consequences of which we are witnessing , can only be addressed effectively ... through an ambitious and coordinated development cooperation to fight its root causes , " said barroso . " the eu strategy ... will mark a true turning point to help africa help itself , " added eu aid commissioner louis michel , noting that the strategy still has to be approved by the european parliament and eu governments . the eu initiative comes after the bloc 's 25 member governments agreed in may to increase development aid budget by 20 billion euros per year by 2010 .
from 17 billion euros for africa in 2003 , the figure would rise to 25 billion at the end of the decade , according to eu figures . " walls and prisons " on the immigration problem , konare warned that the " walls and prisons " can not prevent immigrants trying to enter europe illegally , saying the underlying economic and social reasons had to be tackled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain recently increased fortifications to prevent immigrants from climbing over the fence seperating its north african enclave melilla and morocco " it 's not security measures , it 's not prisons in madrid and walls in africa that will solve the problem , " said konare , chair of the au commission , after the brussels talks .
queried during a visit to portugal about the issue , un secretary general kofi annan also stressed that improving africans ' lives at home was the way forward .
" if we create reasonable living conditions , people will not feel forced to leave , " the lusa news agency quoted him as saying .
some 14 people have died in recent months while trying to break into spanish enclaves , some of them shot by moroccan security forces .
morocco has also come under fire for dumping hundreds of the would-be immigrants in desert areas near the algerian border . the african union leader said the underlying problems which fueled an exodus of poor africans had to be tackled . " we have to have the courage to broach the problem of farm subsidies , which weaken our economy and impoverish our rural areas , " he said , in a clear reference to the eu 's long-controversial generous farm aid system . konare added that african immigrants like those trying to get into spain " are a reflection of the poverty " of a continent on which 40 percent of the population lives on less than a euro a day . halve poverty by 2015 the eu strategy is designed to help africa achieve the so-called millennium development goals , chief among which is to reduce poverty by half by 2015 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after being abandoned by moroccan police in the country 's south , these illegal immigrants from senegal walked 550 km -lrb- 340 miles -rrb- on their way to oujda , morocco .

some say that attacks have been on the increase since then , but the victim himself sees things differently . wolfgang schäuble was ready to call it a day . " i 'm tired and wo n't keep going much longer , " the german interior minister reportedly told his wife on the phone before heading to one last election campaign event late on oct .

two bullets had hit the minister in the face and the chest .
the third wounded one of schäuble 's bodyguards , who had thrown himself in front of the politician . " if the third shot had hit me as well , i would not have survived , " said schäuble , who is a paraplegic as a result of the attack . a long list of attacks the assassination attempt came less than five months after a mentally disturbed woman stabbed oskar lafontaine , then premier of the state of saarland , in the throat .
since then , other politicians have become victims of - albeit less dangerous - aggression . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the attack raptured fischer 's ear drum .
in 1999 , a protestor against the green party 's agreement to send german troops to the war in kosovo hit german foreign minister joschka fischer on his ear with a paint-filled bag while a man wounded fischer 's party colleague angelika beer with a knife outside her house in 2000 . last year , hamburg ' justice minister was stabbed in the leg by a woman .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , among others , has been slapped in the face while many , including former chancellor helmut kohl and bavarian premier edmund stoiber , have been pelted with eggs . are the media to blame ? media coverage of politicians is largely to blame for an increase in attacks , according to jörg van essen , a member of parliament for the free-market liberal free democrats . " the constant scandalization of people in politics has lowered the inhibition threshold , " van essen said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1991 , former chancellor helmut kohl -lrb- left -rrb- decided to fight back when he was hit with eggs .
recently , the security expert also criticized germany 's secretive secret service , which guards the president , the chancellor and other federal state officials who could be the target of an attack . but van essen said that while the 500-member strong branch of germany 's federal criminal police -lrb- bka -rrb- previously offered insufficient protection due to a lack of bodyguards , the problem has been resolved .

schäuble agreed that mentally disturbed people - like the one who attacked him - posed the greatest danger to politicians after the disbandment of the left-wing radical terrorist group red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , which presented an organized threat to germany 's leaders in the 1970s and 1980s . but he did n't share van essen 's view that more attacks were happening , adding that no incidents became known during the last election campaign . " you can not talk about an increase , " he said . experts also said that the general threat has significantly dropped since the raf 's heyday . back then , bka officials included 70 people in the top risk category for people , meaning they are in serious danger of becoming the target of an attack , said helwig finger , a former bodyguard in the private sector , who now works as a trainer .
that number has dropped to about 15 people since , he said . the risks of public life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder is likely to keep bodyguards after he leaves office .
finger also added that the occasional slap in the face was almost inevitable because of the desire of politicians to rub shoulders with the people .

some say that attacks have been on the increase since then , but the victim himself sees things differently . wolfgang schäuble was ready to call it a day . " i 'm tired and wo n't keep going much longer , " the german interior minister reportedly told his wife on the phone before heading to one last election campaign event late on oct .
12 , 1990 . schäuble did n't come home that night : as he was leaving the meeting , a mentally disturbed man fired three shots at him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble still relies on protection " i think i heard a bang and felt heat , but i do n't remember anything else , " said schäuble , adding that he immediately lost consciousness .
two bullets had hit the minister in the face and the chest .
the third wounded one of schäuble 's bodyguards , who had thrown himself in front of the politician . " if the third shot had hit me as well , i would not have survived , " said schäuble , who is a paraplegic as a result of the attack . a long list of attacks the assassination attempt came less than five months after a mentally disturbed woman stabbed oskar lafontaine , then premier of the state of saarland , in the throat .
since then , other politicians have become victims of - albeit less dangerous - aggression . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the attack raptured fischer 's ear drum .
in 1999 , a protestor against the green party 's agreement to send german troops to the war in kosovo hit german foreign minister joschka fischer on his ear with a paint-filled bag while a man wounded fischer 's party colleague angelika beer with a knife outside her house in 2000 . last year , hamburg ' justice minister was stabbed in the leg by a woman .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , among others , has been slapped in the face while many , including former chancellor helmut kohl and bavarian premier edmund stoiber , have been pelted with eggs . are the media to blame ? media coverage of politicians is largely to blame for an increase in attacks , according to jörg van essen , a member of parliament for the free-market liberal free democrats . " the constant scandalization of people in politics has lowered the inhibition threshold , " van essen said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1991 , former chancellor helmut kohl -lrb- left -rrb- decided to fight back when he was hit with eggs .
recently , the security expert also criticized germany 's secretive secret service , which guards the president , the chancellor and other federal state officials who could be the target of an attack . but van essen said that while the 500-member strong branch of germany 's federal criminal police -lrb- bka -rrb- previously offered insufficient protection due to a lack of bodyguards , the problem has been resolved . " nevertheless , we realize that people who stand in the public 's eye keep getting targeted for attacks , " he said , adding that it was mainly " mentally disturbed persons , who drink themselves into a stupor to attack well-known politicians . " no longer an organized threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf mainly targeted economic leaders such as alfred herrhausen , the head of deutsche bank , who was killed in this bomb attack on his car in november 1989 .
schäuble agreed that mentally disturbed people - like the one who attacked him - posed the greatest danger to politicians after the disbandment of the left-wing radical terrorist group red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , which presented an organized threat to germany 's leaders in the 1970s and 1980s . but he did n't share van essen 's view that more attacks were happening , adding that no incidents became known during the last election campaign . " you can not talk about an increase , " he said . experts also said that the general threat has significantly dropped since the raf 's heyday . back then , bka officials included 70 people in the top risk category for people , meaning they are in serious danger of becoming the target of an attack , said helwig finger , a former bodyguard in the private sector , who now works as a trainer .
that number has dropped to about 15 people since , he said . the risks of public life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder is likely to keep bodyguards after he leaves office .
finger also added that the occasional slap in the face was almost inevitable because of the desire of politicians to rub shoulders with the people .

while he has confirmed he is stepping down , schröder 's plans for his future remain private . outgoing german chancellor gerhard schröder on tuesday confirmed that he would not play a role in the country 's next coalition government set to be headed by conservative leader angela merkel .
referring to coming negotiations between his social democrats party -lrb- spd -rrb- and merkel 's christian democrats on forming a new left-right coalition government , schröder , who was making a speech in berlin , said he wanted to " take part -lrb- in the talks -rrb- so they go well .
that 's how how we interpret our mission , even if we no longer belong to the new government . "
in the immediate future , schröder remains the head of government and will visit turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan on wednesday before a working dinner with french president jacques chirac on friday . some reports have said that he will be urged to stay within his social democrats to guide them through government in a coalition led by his conservative archrival angela merkel .
others predicted a future outside politics , including a report that he had been approached about working for russian energy giant gazprom . merkel to lead grand-coalition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel , future chancellor of germany first " grand coaltion " government since the 1960 's .
as merkel announced on monday that she had won the right to lead a coalition of her christian democrats and schröder 's social democrats , the chancellor was nowhere to be seen .
the message seemed to be that the battle to serve a third term was lost and , for once , the man known as the " media chancellor " could not steal her moment .
his only appearance was as the lone figure on the chancellery 's upper floors . it was left to franz müntefering , the social democrats ' party chief , to announce at a separate press conference that schröder would remain to help the party through the coalition negotiations .
müntefering insisted that no decision had been made on who should become vice-chancellor , a role the social democrats will fill in the division of cabinet jobs that is weighted heavily in their favor .
it appears unlikely schröder will accept the job . what comes next for gerhard ? he reportedly told merkel in their late-night crunch talks on sunday that staying in the government was " not in my career plans . "
social democrat sources have told the press that schröder had told his allies that he would not serve " under this woman . "
he may however come under pressure to stay within the social democrats in some role , and he certainly retains a seat in the bundestag lower house of parliament . schröder will face calls from leadership sages on both the right and left .
" in this situation the party can not do without him , they it need him , " said the daily süddeutsche zeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder met with putin in his hometown of st. petersburg friday , oct .
7th , as the german leader took a break from tough political coalition negotiations .
in the immediate future , schröder will remain chancellor and has plans to meet with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan on wednesday before a working dinner with french president jacques chirac on friday .
both meetings are designed to plan the eu summit at hampton court palace , near london , on october 27 - 28 , at which schröder will represent germany . what happens after that is unclear .
at 61 , schröder has the energy , charisma and contacts to make big money in the private sector .
his fourth wife , doris schröder-köpf , 20 years his junior , has expressed a desire to live in new york , although schröder , a trained lawyer , would have to improve his english to work in the united states . the top-selling german newspaper bild , quoting russian media , said he had discussed working for gazprom when he attended the birthday celebrations of close ally russian president vladimir putin over the weekend .
but on that rumor , as with all the others , there has only been silence from schröder . dw staff / afp -lrb- aal -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press : merkel 's historic moment german newspapers called angela merkel 's announcement that she will be the country 's next chancellor an historic moment , but said she faced a tough time leading a left-right coalition .

while he has confirmed he is stepping down , schröder 's plans for his future remain private . outgoing german chancellor gerhard schröder on tuesday confirmed that he would not play a role in the country 's next coalition government set to be headed by conservative leader angela merkel .
referring to coming negotiations between his social democrats party -lrb- spd -rrb- and merkel 's christian democrats on forming a new left-right coalition government , schröder , who was making a speech in berlin , said he wanted to " take part -lrb- in the talks -rrb- so they go well .
that 's how how we interpret our mission , even if we no longer belong to the new government . "
in the immediate future , schröder remains the head of government and will visit turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan on wednesday before a working dinner with french president jacques chirac on friday . some reports have said that he will be urged to stay within his social democrats to guide them through government in a coalition led by his conservative archrival angela merkel .
others predicted a future outside politics , including a report that he had been approached about working for russian energy giant gazprom . merkel to lead grand-coalition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel , future chancellor of germany first " grand coaltion " government since the 1960 's .
as merkel announced on monday that she had won the right to lead a coalition of her christian democrats and schröder 's social democrats , the chancellor was nowhere to be seen .
the message seemed to be that the battle to serve a third term was lost and , for once , the man known as the " media chancellor " could not steal her moment .
his only appearance was as the lone figure on the chancellery 's upper floors . it was left to franz müntefering , the social democrats ' party chief , to announce at a separate press conference that schröder would remain to help the party through the coalition negotiations .
müntefering insisted that no decision had been made on who should become vice-chancellor , a role the social democrats will fill in the division of cabinet jobs that is weighted heavily in their favor .
it appears unlikely schröder will accept the job . what comes next for gerhard ? he reportedly told merkel in their late-night crunch talks on sunday that staying in the government was " not in my career plans . "
social democrat sources have told the press that schröder had told his allies that he would not serve " under this woman . "
he may however come under pressure to stay within the social democrats in some role , and he certainly retains a seat in the bundestag lower house of parliament . schröder will face calls from leadership sages on both the right and left .

both meetings are designed to plan the eu summit at hampton court palace , near london , on october 27 - 28 , at which schröder will represent germany . what happens after that is unclear .
at 61 , schröder has the energy , charisma and contacts to make big money in the private sector .
his fourth wife , doris schröder-köpf , 20 years his junior , has expressed a desire to live in new york , although schröder , a trained lawyer , would have to improve his english to work in the united states . the top-selling german newspaper bild , quoting russian media , said he had discussed working for gazprom when he attended the birthday celebrations of close ally russian president vladimir putin over the weekend .

as the flu reached turkey and romania , a german national task force is meeting wednesday to discuss safety measures . high level officials from the federal government and the german states are set to meet in bonn to examine when emergency measures should be implemented and poultry quarantined .
environment minister jürgen trittin , interim head of the consumer affairs and agriculture ministry , has said that the ministry is prepared for the worst and that a ban on poultry is , as yet , unnecessary . he said that if the results of eu tests on infected romanian and turkish cases showed that they did indeed have the highly pathogenic h5n1 virus , " our emergency plans will immediately come into effect . "
the cases in turkey are so far known to be infected with the h5 strain , the same one found in asia .

trittin called on visitors to romania and turkey to avoid going to places where poultry is bred .
germany poorly prepared ? bernhard ruf , head doctor at leipzig 's st. georg clinic , warned that germany only has enough medication for around 8-10 percent of the population .
the world health organization , however , recommends that states have a reserve of medication for 20-25 percent , " ruf said in an interview with radio broadcaster deutschlandfunk on wednesday . " there is a backlog of demand that must now be met , " ruf said .
the government must take advantage of the time before a pandemic breaks out to prepare , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birds imported illegally present the greatest risk to germany , according to the national research institute for animal health , the friedrich loeffler institute .
it 's less likely that migratory birds will carry the virus from turkey or romania to germany , particularly since they have begun flying south for the winter . the eu has already banned poultry imports from countries where the h5n1 virus has been detected as well as live fowl and feather imports from turkey . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bird flu reaches europe pushing further towards western europe , bird flu has reached turkey and romania , though it is unclear whether the cases there involve the h5n1 viral strain that poses a threat to humans .

on wednesday , pupils in saarlouis discovered their school bell had been replaced by fragments from europe 's greatest composers . " it 's a relief , " 13-year-old julien blass told news broadcaster n-tv .
" if you 've had a tough math assignment beforehand , it makes you happy afterwards . "
blass was referring to the up to 20-second segments of classical music that tell students at the gymnasium am stadtgarten high school in the city of saarlouis , near the french border , when lessons and between-class breaks start and end . wednesday started with a snippet from george bizet 's opera " carmen . "
dubbed " klassik statt klingel " -lrb- classics instead of the bell -rrb- , the new program is meant to promote musical education among kids .
its creator , robert leonardy , head of the saar music festival and a piano professor , compiled a cd of 200 classic jingles , from verdi 's " aida " to theodorakis ' " zorba the greek , " to teach students the fundamentals of his genre . " for the first time , you engage 100 percent of the pupils at a time when , at best , three percent of people regularly listen to classical music , " the maestro explained . back to basics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert leonardy leonardy -lrb- photo -rrb- is hopeful that his idea will catch on nationwide .
he estimates that after two or three years of being exposed to the music every day at school , the students will have a basic knowledge of classical music . but perhaps he 's a bit optimistic .
julien blass and his schoolmate saskia philippi were , in any case , skeptical after their first day of classical jingles .
neither of them thought the tunes would inspire them to listen to classical music at home , they told n-tv .
and blass was pretty sure he 'd never make his way to a classical concert . and for those kids who loath going to school in the first place , associating classical music with their daily grind could just turn them off bach , tchaikovsky , mozart and co. forever . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de frog fad spawns assault on music industry be afraid ... be very afraid .

definitely not , " the two-term chancellor told a trade union congress in his home town of hanover .
" i genuinely want to support it with all the strength i have .
and that is not meant as a threat . " the 61-year-old , now in his last few weeks as chancellor , also warned the new administration , which will be led by his conservative archrival angela merkel , not to harm germany 's cherished welfare state . schröder this week conceded the chancellery to merkel following a bitter post-election power struggle . " i want to help with this transition .
and i will say one last time , i would ideally have liked to do so in another term in office , but it was not to be , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grand coalition on the way instead , he would now help steer his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- through tough negotiations with merkel 's christian democrat alliance to form germany 's first left-right coalition government since the 1960s . " whether it will be a success , i do not know .
but i want to help ensure it works , " schröder said of the potentially fraught union . he is already credited with having helped secure eight ministries for the spd , including the key foreign and finance posts in the upcoming coalition - two more than the conservatives will hold - in a trade-off for leaving . the parties agreed to the broad outline of a so-called grand coalition just over three weeks after finishing neck-and-neck in september 18 elections , but must now draw up a formal program of government in the negotiations starting next monday . spd to fight for social policies schröder said his party would battle to preserve social policies , while supporting reforms to revive germany 's moribund economy which he began . " eighty percent of voters spoke out in favor of reforms because they know it is inevitable , " he said , adding that social democrats would resist changes threatening the welfare state .
" people do not want the state in their faces , but they want it by their side , " he said . leading party colleagues had urged schröder to remain in the cabinet , but he said he would not serve under merkel after seven years in the top job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus-uwe benneter , general secretary of the social democratic party klaus uwe benneter , the general secretary of the social democrats , said he regretted the decision . " we must unfortunately live with it , but many of us had hoped it would be different , " he told zdf television . takes aim at us president the outgoing chancellor on wednesday also aimed a broadside at us president george w. bush , saying hurricane katrina showed what happened when a state neglected its duty . " i can think of a recent disaster that shows what happens when a country neglects its duties of state towards its people , " said schröder . " my post as chancellor , which i still hold , does not allow me to name that country but you all know that i am talking about america , " he said to laughter and applause . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and bush are n't exactly best of friends .
schröder fell out with bush over the war in iraq when he refused to commit german troops to the war and relations between the two leaders have remained chilly . in another jab at the us president on wednesday , schröder spoke of british prime minister tony blair as " my british friend , who also has other friends , " in a reference to the anglo-american on iraq . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey bids schröder a fond farewell german chancellor gerhard schröder is paying a farewell visit to turkey , where he enjoys popularity due to his support for turkey 's eu membership bid .

church officials meanwhile called for a ban of a swiss group that wants to help terminally ill germans to die . roger kusch , who serves as justice minister in the city state of hamburg , is the first leading cdu politician who has come out in support of assisted suicide for severely ill people after a swiss group called dignitas recently announced it plans to open a german office in hanover to make it assisted suicide more accessible for germans seeking an end to their suffering . " responsible , compassionate assisted suicide does not clash with human basic rights as far as i 'm concerned , " kush wrote in a guest commentary for hamburger abe n dblatt newspaper .
" instead , it 's an expression of christian charity . " the minister backs a change to germany 's law that punishes assisted suicide .
kusch said that he could see assisted suicide to be legal , a doctor would have to determine that a person has a terminal illness and thoroughly advise the patient .
a statement from the patient certified by a notary would also be required . political oppositio n kusch 's statements have caused uproar , with a spokesman for hamburg 's state government hurrying to clarify that the politician had spoken as a private individual . germany 's hospice foundation sharply criticized kusch for his " deeply appalling " remarks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man lies in an intensive care unit eugen brysch , the foundation 's executive director , said terminally ill and dying people do n't need compassion nor mercy , but attention and highly professional care instead . the youth wing of hamburg 's christian democratic union also opposed kusch 's proposal , saying that killing a person could not be the answer to suffering and illness . social democrats also criticized kusch 's comparison of assisted suicide and abortion .
kusch had written that he did n't understand why assisted suicide was punishable with at least six months in prison while abortion was not . promoti n g a ba n the bishop of hanover 's lutheran church , margot kässmann , meanwhile called for a ban on dignitas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margot kässmann -lrb- center -rrb- " if it 's legally possible , this should happen , " she said , adding that the group was opening the door for assisted suicide .
kässmann said that germans had to rethink their approach toward severely sick people , most of whom die anonymously in hospitals . kässmann 's colleague from the southwestern state of baden-württemberg , frank july , also came out in opposition of assisted suicide . lower saxony 's justice minister elisabeth heister-neumann -lrb- cdu -rrb- has announced that she plans to introduce legislation in germany 's upper house that would penalize agencies that help with assisted suicide such as dignitas . german president horst köhler has also come out in opposition of assisted suicide . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when life becomes worse than death in a move which has caused considerable consternation among politicians and the church , the swiss organization for assisted suicide , dignitas , has founded a subsidiary in germany .

the same can not be said for schröder 's successor , angela merkel . turkish prime minster recep tayyip erdogan will be rolling out the red carpet for schröder , who will be the guest of honor at an iftar dinner in istanbul on wednesday .
iftar is a special meal for muslims after breaking a day of fasting during the holy month of ramadan . " we would like to thank the chancellor for his help during the past three years and would like to honor him because of that , " cuneyed zapsu , erdogan 's european affairs advisor , said of the special treatment afforded to schröder . turkey 's powerful ally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder playing soccer .
zapsu said that although the two leaders come from different sides of the political spectrum , they have much in common .
in addition to a love for soccer , both men have similar humble backgrounds as well as a passion for campaigning . a powerful ally , germany has proved invaluable to turkey , especially as it seeks to join the european union .
the german chancellor ’ s support was crucial , both in december , when eu leaders agreed to start accession talks with turkey , and in negotiations earlier this month to officially open the talks . " psychologically it is very important if there is somebody that understands you and tells they would like to help - that is enough to give you more strength in the psychologically very difficult talks we had , " zapsu said . business leaders look to merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german opposition party leader angela merkel -lrb- l -rrb- and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan -lrb- r -rrb- address the media in ankara , turkey on monday 16 february 2004 .
there are concerns in turkey that angela merkel , now set to succeed gerhard schröder as chancellor , could threaten the country 's aspirations to join the eu .
merkel has repeatedly spoken out against turkish eu membership , calling instead for a " privileged partnership . " but some turkish business leaders with strong links to germany are confident that the political and economic realities will make her change her stance . " when you have the responsibility of government you take wise decisions , so i expect ms merkel will tone down her rhetoric about turkey , " said ishak alaton founder of turkish engineering company alarko .
" i expect investments both from turkey towards germany and investments of german companies in turkey to increase in size and capacity .
so i am looking forward to better and stronger relations between germany and turkey . " erdogan and merkel may not share similar personal interests , but they both come from the center-right of the political spectrum and value strong ties to the united states .
while erdogan will be keen to show gratitude to schröder for his friendship and loyalty , turkish eyes are already looking to the future and , specifically , how to woo germany ’ s next chancellor . dorian jones -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parties disagree on turkey with talks over turkey 's eu entry set to begin on monday , it 's still not clear whether the bloc will offer turkey full membership or an alternative deal - an issue that 's also causing discord among germany 's parties .

public finances have already been a source of tension between christian and social democrats . the head of the eurozone group , luxembourg 's premier jean-claude juncker , who also serves as his country 's finance minister , said he had made it " completely clear " to german chancellor gerhard schröder and his probable successor , angela merkel , that " germany has to adhere to all regulations and restrictions that come with the stability and growth pact by 2007 .

the same can not be said for schröder 's successor , angela merkel . turkish prime minster recep tayyip erdogan will be rolling out the red carpet for schröder , who will be the guest of honor at an iftar dinner in istanbul on wednesday .
iftar is a special meal for muslims after breaking a day of fasting during the holy month of ramadan . " we would like to thank the chancellor for his help during the past three years and would like to honor him because of that , " cuneyed zapsu , erdogan 's european affairs advisor , said of the special treatment afforded to schröder . turkey 's powerful ally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder playing soccer .
zapsu said that although the two leaders come from different sides of the political spectrum , they have much in common .
in addition to a love for soccer , both men have similar humble backgrounds as well as a passion for campaigning . a powerful ally , germany has proved invaluable to turkey , especially as it seeks to join the european union .
the german chancellor ’ s support was crucial , both in december , when eu leaders agreed to start accession talks with turkey , and in negotiations earlier this month to officially open the talks . " psychologically it is very important if there is somebody that understands you and tells they would like to help - that is enough to give you more strength in the psychologically very difficult talks we had , " zapsu said . business leaders look to merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german opposition party leader angela merkel -lrb- l -rrb- and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan -lrb- r -rrb- address the media in ankara , turkey on monday 16 february 2004 .
there are concerns in turkey that angela merkel , now set to succeed gerhard schröder as chancellor , could threaten the country 's aspirations to join the eu .
merkel has repeatedly spoken out against turkish eu membership , calling instead for a " privileged partnership . " but some turkish business leaders with strong links to germany are confident that the political and economic realities will make her change her stance . " when you have the responsibility of government you take wise decisions , so i expect ms merkel will tone down her rhetoric about turkey , " said ishak alaton founder of turkish engineering company alarko .
" i expect investments both from turkey towards germany and investments of german companies in turkey to increase in size and capacity .
so i am looking forward to better and stronger relations between germany and turkey . " erdogan and merkel may not share similar personal interests , but they both come from the center-right of the political spectrum and value strong ties to the united states .
while erdogan will be keen to show gratitude to schröder for his friendship and loyalty , turkish eyes are already looking to the future and , specifically , how to woo germany ’ s next chancellor . dorian jones -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parties disagree on turkey with talks over turkey 's eu entry set to begin on monday , it 's still not clear whether the bloc will offer turkey full membership or an alternative deal - an issue that 's also causing discord among germany 's parties .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.10.2005 assessing the threat for german politicians großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian premier edmund stoiber seeking refuge from rotten eggs the worst attempt on the life of a politician in postwar germany occurred 15 years ago wednesday .
some say that attacks have been on the increase since then , but the victim himself sees things differently . wolfgang schäuble was ready to call it a day . " i 'm tired and wo n't keep going much longer , " the german interior minister reportedly told his wife on the phone before heading to one last election campaign event late on oct .
12 , 1990 . schäuble did n't come home that night : as he was leaving the meeting , a mentally disturbed man fired three shots at him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble still relies on protection " i think i heard a bang and felt heat , but i do n't remember anything else , " said schäuble , adding that he immediately lost consciousness .
two bullets had hit the minister in the face and the chest .
the third wounded one of schäuble 's bodyguards , who had thrown himself in front of the politician . " if the third shot had hit me as well , i would not have survived , " said schäuble , who is a paraplegic as a result of the attack . a long list of attacks the assassination attempt came less than five months after a mentally disturbed woman stabbed oskar lafontaine , then premier of the state of saarland , in the throat .
since then , other politicians have become victims of - albeit less dangerous - aggression . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the attack raptured fischer 's ear drum .
in 1999 , a protestor against the green party 's agreement to send german troops to the war in kosovo hit german foreign minister joschka fischer on his ear with a paint-filled bag while a man wounded fischer 's party colleague angelika beer with a knife outside her house in 2000 . last year , hamburg ' justice minister was stabbed in the leg by a woman .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , among others , has been slapped in the face while many , including former chancellor helmut kohl and bavarian premier edmund stoiber , have been pelted with eggs . are the media to blame ? media coverage of politicians is largely to blame for an increase in attacks , according to jörg van essen , a member of parliament for the free-market liberal free democrats . " the constant scandalization of people in politics has lowered the inhibition threshold , " van essen said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1991 , former chancellor helmut kohl -lrb- left -rrb- decided to fight back when he was hit with eggs .
recently , the security expert also criticized germany 's secretive secret service , which guards the president , the chancellor and other federal state officials who could be the target of an attack . but van essen said that while the 500-member strong branch of germany 's federal criminal police -lrb- bka -rrb- previously offered insufficient protection due to a lack of bodyguards , the problem has been resolved . " nevertheless , we realize that people who stand in the public 's eye keep getting targeted for attacks , " he said , adding that it was mainly " mentally disturbed persons , who drink themselves into a stupor to attack well-known politicians . " no longer an organized threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf mainly targeted economic leaders such as alfred herrhausen , the head of deutsche bank , who was killed in this bomb attack on his car in november 1989 .
schäuble agreed that mentally disturbed people - like the one who attacked him - posed the greatest danger to politicians after the disbandment of the left-wing radical terrorist group red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , which presented an organized threat to germany 's leaders in the 1970s and 1980s . but he did n't share van essen 's view that more attacks were happening , adding that no incidents became known during the last election campaign .

some say that attacks have been on the increase since then , but the victim himself sees things differently . wolfgang schäuble was ready to call it a day . " i 'm tired and wo n't keep going much longer , " the german interior minister reportedly told his wife on the phone before heading to one last election campaign event late on oct .
12 , 1990 . schäuble did n't come home that night : as he was leaving the meeting , a mentally disturbed man fired three shots at him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble still relies on protection " i think i heard a bang and felt heat , but i do n't remember anything else , " said schäuble , adding that he immediately lost consciousness .
two bullets had hit the minister in the face and the chest .
the third wounded one of schäuble 's bodyguards , who had thrown himself in front of the politician . " if the third shot had hit me as well , i would not have survived , " said schäuble , who is a paraplegic as a result of the attack . a long list of attacks the assassination attempt came less than five months after a mentally disturbed woman stabbed oskar lafontaine , then premier of the state of saarland , in the throat .
since then , other politicians have become victims of - albeit less dangerous - aggression . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the attack raptured fischer 's ear drum .
in 1999 , a protestor against the green party 's agreement to send german troops to the war in kosovo hit german foreign minister joschka fischer on his ear with a paint-filled bag while a man wounded fischer 's party colleague angelika beer with a knife outside her house in 2000 . last year , hamburg ' justice minister was stabbed in the leg by a woman .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , among others , has been slapped in the face while many , including former chancellor helmut kohl and bavarian premier edmund stoiber , have been pelted with eggs . are the media to blame ? media coverage of politicians is largely to blame for an increase in attacks , according to jörg van essen , a member of parliament for the free-market liberal free democrats . " the constant scandalization of people in politics has lowered the inhibition threshold , " van essen said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1991 , former chancellor helmut kohl -lrb- left -rrb- decided to fight back when he was hit with eggs .
recently , the security expert also criticized germany 's secretive secret service , which guards the president , the chancellor and other federal state officials who could be the target of an attack . but van essen said that while the 500-member strong branch of germany 's federal criminal police -lrb- bka -rrb- previously offered insufficient protection due to a lack of bodyguards , the problem has been resolved . " nevertheless , we realize that people who stand in the public 's eye keep getting targeted for attacks , " he said , adding that it was mainly " mentally disturbed persons , who drink themselves into a stupor to attack well-known politicians . " no longer an organized threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf mainly targeted economic leaders such as alfred herrhausen , the head of deutsche bank , who was killed in this bomb attack on his car in november 1989 .
schäuble agreed that mentally disturbed people - like the one who attacked him - posed the greatest danger to politicians after the disbandment of the left-wing radical terrorist group red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , which presented an organized threat to germany 's leaders in the 1970s and 1980s . but he did n't share van essen 's view that more attacks were happening , adding that no incidents became known during the last election campaign . " you can not talk about an increase , " he said . experts also said that the general threat has significantly dropped since the raf 's heyday . back then , bka officials included 70 people in the top risk category for people , meaning they are in serious danger of becoming the target of an attack , said helwig finger , a former bodyguard in the private sector , who now works as a trainer .

while he has confirmed he is stepping down , schröder 's plans for his future remain private . outgoing german chancellor gerhard schröder on tuesday confirmed that he would not play a role in the country 's next coalition government set to be headed by conservative leader angela merkel .
referring to coming negotiations between his social democrats party -lrb- spd -rrb- and merkel 's christian democrats on forming a new left-right coalition government , schröder , who was making a speech in berlin , said he wanted to " take part -lrb- in the talks -rrb- so they go well .
that 's how how we interpret our mission , even if we no longer belong to the new government . "
in the immediate future , schröder remains the head of government and will visit turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan on wednesday before a working dinner with french president jacques chirac on friday . some reports have said that he will be urged to stay within his social democrats to guide them through government in a coalition led by his conservative archrival angela merkel .
others predicted a future outside politics , including a report that he had been approached about working for russian energy giant gazprom . merkel to lead grand-coalition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel , future chancellor of germany first " grand coaltion " government since the 1960 's .
as merkel announced on monday that she had won the right to lead a coalition of her christian democrats and schröder 's social democrats , the chancellor was nowhere to be seen .
the message seemed to be that the battle to serve a third term was lost and , for once , the man known as the " media chancellor " could not steal her moment .
his only appearance was as the lone figure on the chancellery 's upper floors . it was left to franz müntefering , the social democrats ' party chief , to announce at a separate press conference that schröder would remain to help the party through the coalition negotiations .
müntefering insisted that no decision had been made on who should become vice-chancellor , a role the social democrats will fill in the division of cabinet jobs that is weighted heavily in their favor .
it appears unlikely schröder will accept the job . what comes next for gerhard ? he reportedly told merkel in their late-night crunch talks on sunday that staying in the government was " not in my career plans . "
social democrat sources have told the press that schröder had told his allies that he would not serve " under this woman . "
he may however come under pressure to stay within the social democrats in some role , and he certainly retains a seat in the bundestag lower house of parliament . schröder will face calls from leadership sages on both the right and left .
" in this situation the party can not do without him , they it need him , " said the daily süddeutsche zeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder met with putin in his hometown of st. petersburg friday , oct .
7th , as the german leader took a break from tough political coalition negotiations .
in the immediate future , schröder will remain chancellor and has plans to meet with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan on wednesday before a working dinner with french president jacques chirac on friday .
both meetings are designed to plan the eu summit at hampton court palace , near london , on october 27 - 28 , at which schröder will represent germany . what happens after that is unclear .
at 61 , schröder has the energy , charisma and contacts to make big money in the private sector .
his fourth wife , doris schröder-köpf , 20 years his junior , has expressed a desire to live in new york , although schröder , a trained lawyer , would have to improve his english to work in the united states . the top-selling german newspaper bild , quoting russian media , said he had discussed working for gazprom when he attended the birthday celebrations of close ally russian president vladimir putin over the weekend .
but on that rumor , as with all the others , there has only been silence from schröder . dw staff / afp -lrb- aal -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press : merkel 's historic moment german newspapers called angela merkel 's announcement that she will be the country 's next chancellor an historic moment , but said she faced a tough time leading a left-right coalition .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.10.2005 eu launches africa strategy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : povery drives many africans to risk their lives to get to europe the european union launched an ambitious new strategy for africa wednesday including bolstering the continent 's transport infrastructure , saying recent immigrant deaths highlight the need for action . european commission chief jose manuel barroso outlined plans after talks with the chief executive of the african union , alpha oumar konare , who said poverty remained a fundamental problem driving young africans to seek to leave . " the problem of immigration , the dramatic consequences of which we are witnessing , can only be addressed effectively ... through an ambitious and coordinated development cooperation to fight its root causes , " said barroso . " the eu strategy ... will mark a true turning point to help africa help itself , " added eu aid commissioner louis michel , noting that the strategy still has to be approved by the european parliament and eu governments . the eu initiative comes after the bloc 's 25 member governments agreed in may to increase development aid budget by 20 billion euros per year by 2010 .
from 17 billion euros for africa in 2003 , the figure would rise to 25 billion at the end of the decade , according to eu figures . " walls and prisons " on the immigration problem , konare warned that the " walls and prisons " can not prevent immigrants trying to enter europe illegally , saying the underlying economic and social reasons had to be tackled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain recently increased fortifications to prevent immigrants from climbing over the fence seperating its north african enclave melilla and morocco " it 's not security measures , it 's not prisons in madrid and walls in africa that will solve the problem , " said konare , chair of the au commission , after the brussels talks .
queried during a visit to portugal about the issue , un secretary general kofi annan also stressed that improving africans ' lives at home was the way forward .
" if we create reasonable living conditions , people will not feel forced to leave , " the lusa news agency quoted him as saying .
some 14 people have died in recent months while trying to break into spanish enclaves , some of them shot by moroccan security forces .
morocco has also come under fire for dumping hundreds of the would-be immigrants in desert areas near the algerian border . the african union leader said the underlying problems which fueled an exodus of poor africans had to be tackled .

he also took a swipe a us president bush . " i will not be part of the next federal government .
definitely not , " the two-term chancellor told a trade union congress in his home town of hanover .
" i genuinely want to support it with all the strength i have .
and that is not meant as a threat . " the 61-year-old , now in his last few weeks as chancellor , also warned the new administration , which will be led by his conservative archrival angela merkel , not to harm germany 's cherished welfare state . schröder this week conceded the chancellery to merkel following a bitter post-election power struggle . " i want to help with this transition .
and i will say one last time , i would ideally have liked to do so in another term in office , but it was not to be , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grand coalition on the way instead , he would now help steer his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- through tough negotiations with merkel 's christian democrat alliance to form germany 's first left-right coalition government since the 1960s . " whether it will be a success , i do not know .
but i want to help ensure it works , " schröder said of the potentially fraught union . he is already credited with having helped secure eight ministries for the spd , including the key foreign and finance posts in the upcoming coalition - two more than the conservatives will hold - in a trade-off for leaving . the parties agreed to the broad outline of a so-called grand coalition just over three weeks after finishing neck-and-neck in september 18 elections , but must now draw up a formal program of government in the negotiations starting next monday . spd to fight for social policies schröder said his party would battle to preserve social policies , while supporting reforms to revive germany 's moribund economy which he began . " eighty percent of voters spoke out in favor of reforms because they know it is inevitable , " he said , adding that social democrats would resist changes threatening the welfare state .
" people do not want the state in their faces , but they want it by their side , " he said . leading party colleagues had urged schröder to remain in the cabinet , but he said he would not serve under merkel after seven years in the top job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus-uwe benneter , general secretary of the social democratic party klaus uwe benneter , the general secretary of the social democrats , said he regretted the decision . " we must unfortunately live with it , but many of us had hoped it would be different , " he told zdf television . takes aim at us president the outgoing chancellor on wednesday also aimed a broadside at us president george w. bush , saying hurricane katrina showed what happened when a state neglected its duty . " i can think of a recent disaster that shows what happens when a country neglects its duties of state towards its people , " said schröder . " my post as chancellor , which i still hold , does not allow me to name that country but you all know that i am talking about america , " he said to laughter and applause . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and bush are n't exactly best of friends .
schröder fell out with bush over the war in iraq when he refused to commit german troops to the war and relations between the two leaders have remained chilly . in another jab at the us president on wednesday , schröder spoke of british prime minister tony blair as " my british friend , who also has other friends , " in a reference to the anglo-american on iraq . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey bids schröder a fond farewell german chancellor gerhard schröder is paying a farewell visit to turkey , where he enjoys popularity due to his support for turkey 's eu membership bid .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.10.2005 eu launches africa strategy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : povery drives many africans to risk their lives to get to europe the european union launched an ambitious new strategy for africa wednesday including bolstering the continent 's transport infrastructure , saying recent immigrant deaths highlight the need for action . european commission chief jose manuel barroso outlined plans after talks with the chief executive of the african union , alpha oumar konare , who said poverty remained a fundamental problem driving young africans to seek to leave . " the problem of immigration , the dramatic consequences of which we are witnessing , can only be addressed effectively ... through an ambitious and coordinated development cooperation to fight its root causes , " said barroso . " the eu strategy ... will mark a true turning point to help africa help itself , " added eu aid commissioner louis michel , noting that the strategy still has to be approved by the european parliament and eu governments . the eu initiative comes after the bloc 's 25 member governments agreed in may to increase development aid budget by 20 billion euros per year by 2010 .
from 17 billion euros for africa in 2003 , the figure would rise to 25 billion at the end of the decade , according to eu figures . " walls and prisons " on the immigration problem , konare warned that the " walls and prisons " can not prevent immigrants trying to enter europe illegally , saying the underlying economic and social reasons had to be tackled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain recently increased fortifications to prevent immigrants from climbing over the fence seperating its north african enclave melilla and morocco " it 's not security measures , it 's not prisons in madrid and walls in africa that will solve the problem , " said konare , chair of the au commission , after the brussels talks .
queried during a visit to portugal about the issue , un secretary general kofi annan also stressed that improving africans ' lives at home was the way forward .
" if we create reasonable living conditions , people will not feel forced to leave , " the lusa news agency quoted him as saying .
some 14 people have died in recent months while trying to break into spanish enclaves , some of them shot by moroccan security forces .
morocco has also come under fire for dumping hundreds of the would-be immigrants in desert areas near the algerian border . the african union leader said the underlying problems which fueled an exodus of poor africans had to be tackled . " we have to have the courage to broach the problem of farm subsidies , which weaken our economy and impoverish our rural areas , " he said , in a clear reference to the eu 's long-controversial generous farm aid system . konare added that african immigrants like those trying to get into spain " are a reflection of the poverty " of a continent on which 40 percent of the population lives on less than a euro a day . halve poverty by 2015 the eu strategy is designed to help africa achieve the so-called millennium development goals , chief among which is to reduce poverty by half by 2015 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after being abandoned by moroccan police in the country 's south , these illegal immigrants from senegal walked 550 km -lrb- 340 miles -rrb- on their way to oujda , morocco .
six of their group died during the 10-day trek .
above all africa needs peace and stability , said the eu executive , explaining its proposals to strengthen good governance - sorely needed to overturn the continent 's reputation for corruption . but it stressed that the key motor of african development will be strengthening economies , and for that infrastrure - road and rail transport , but also water , energy and telecoms links - is crucial . the creation of such networks will add a " spinal column " for the development of a genuine internal market across the continent , eu officials say . konare agreed that to bolster its own national economies is essential .
" without an african internal market , it is an illusion to believe that we can strive towards overseas markets , " said konare . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain starts deporting immigrants spain has started deporting illegal immigrants despite concerns about possible human rights violations while a new assault on the spanish border by african immigrants resulted in six deaths .

on wednesday , pupils in saarlouis discovered their school bell had been replaced by fragments from europe 's greatest composers . " it 's a relief , " 13-year-old julien blass told news broadcaster n-tv .
" if you 've had a tough math assignment beforehand , it makes you happy afterwards . "
blass was referring to the up to 20-second segments of classical music that tell students at the gymnasium am stadtgarten high school in the city of saarlouis , near the french border , when lessons and between-class breaks start and end . wednesday started with a snippet from george bizet 's opera " carmen . "
dubbed " klassik statt klingel " -lrb- classics instead of the bell -rrb- , the new program is meant to promote musical education among kids .
its creator , robert leonardy , head of the saar music festival and a piano professor , compiled a cd of 200 classic jingles , from verdi 's " aida " to theodorakis ' " zorba the greek , " to teach students the fundamentals of his genre . " for the first time , you engage 100 percent of the pupils at a time when , at best , three percent of people regularly listen to classical music , " the maestro explained . back to basics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert leonardy leonardy -lrb- photo -rrb- is hopeful that his idea will catch on nationwide .
he estimates that after two or three years of being exposed to the music every day at school , the students will have a basic knowledge of classical music . but perhaps he 's a bit optimistic .
julien blass and his schoolmate saskia philippi were , in any case , skeptical after their first day of classical jingles .
neither of them thought the tunes would inspire them to listen to classical music at home , they told n-tv .
and blass was pretty sure he 'd never make his way to a classical concert . and for those kids who loath going to school in the first place , associating classical music with their daily grind could just turn them off bach , tchaikovsky , mozart and co. forever . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de frog fad spawns assault on music industry be afraid ... be very afraid .

some say that attacks have been on the increase since then , but the victim himself sees things differently . wolfgang schäuble was ready to call it a day . " i 'm tired and wo n't keep going much longer , " the german interior minister reportedly told his wife on the phone before heading to one last election campaign event late on oct .
12 , 1990 . schäuble did n't come home that night : as he was leaving the meeting , a mentally disturbed man fired three shots at him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble still relies on protection " i think i heard a bang and felt heat , but i do n't remember anything else , " said schäuble , adding that he immediately lost consciousness .
two bullets had hit the minister in the face and the chest .
the third wounded one of schäuble 's bodyguards , who had thrown himself in front of the politician . " if the third shot had hit me as well , i would not have survived , " said schäuble , who is a paraplegic as a result of the attack . a long list of attacks the assassination attempt came less than five months after a mentally disturbed woman stabbed oskar lafontaine , then premier of the state of saarland , in the throat .
since then , other politicians have become victims of - albeit less dangerous - aggression . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the attack raptured fischer 's ear drum .
in 1999 , a protestor against the green party 's agreement to send german troops to the war in kosovo hit german foreign minister joschka fischer on his ear with a paint-filled bag while a man wounded fischer 's party colleague angelika beer with a knife outside her house in 2000 . last year , hamburg ' justice minister was stabbed in the leg by a woman .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , among others , has been slapped in the face while many , including former chancellor helmut kohl and bavarian premier edmund stoiber , have been pelted with eggs . are the media to blame ? media coverage of politicians is largely to blame for an increase in attacks , according to jörg van essen , a member of parliament for the free-market liberal free democrats . " the constant scandalization of people in politics has lowered the inhibition threshold , " van essen said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1991 , former chancellor helmut kohl -lrb- left -rrb- decided to fight back when he was hit with eggs .
recently , the security expert also criticized germany 's secretive secret service , which guards the president , the chancellor and other federal state officials who could be the target of an attack . but van essen said that while the 500-member strong branch of germany 's federal criminal police -lrb- bka -rrb- previously offered insufficient protection due to a lack of bodyguards , the problem has been resolved . " nevertheless , we realize that people who stand in the public 's eye keep getting targeted for attacks , " he said , adding that it was mainly " mentally disturbed persons , who drink themselves into a stupor to attack well-known politicians . " no longer an organized threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf mainly targeted economic leaders such as alfred herrhausen , the head of deutsche bank , who was killed in this bomb attack on his car in november 1989 .
schäuble agreed that mentally disturbed people - like the one who attacked him - posed the greatest danger to politicians after the disbandment of the left-wing radical terrorist group red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , which presented an organized threat to germany 's leaders in the 1970s and 1980s . but he did n't share van essen 's view that more attacks were happening , adding that no incidents became known during the last election campaign . " you can not talk about an increase , " he said . experts also said that the general threat has significantly dropped since the raf 's heyday . back then , bka officials included 70 people in the top risk category for people , meaning they are in serious danger of becoming the target of an attack , said helwig finger , a former bodyguard in the private sector , who now works as a trainer .
that number has dropped to about 15 people since , he said . the risks of public life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder is likely to keep bodyguards after he leaves office .
finger also added that the occasional slap in the face was almost inevitable because of the desire of politicians to rub shoulders with the people . " it looks negligent , not because bka officials are doing a bad job , but because schröder says , ' i do n't want anyone in front of me , " ' he said . schäuble , meanwhile , said that complete protection was impossible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble " any public figure is exposed to personal risks , " he said .
" it 's impossible to protect people 100 percent . " the christian democrat himself could soon oversee the protection of politicians again . while he denied any comment on the matter , the current deputy leader of his party 's parliamentary group stands a good chance of returning to his old job as interior minister in germany 's next government . mathis winkler , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de exhibit takes german terror stain public a controversial exhibition based on the life and times of the red army faction , germany 's own notorious terror group , opens in berlin on saturday in the face of continuing opposition .

the same can not be said for schröder 's successor , angela merkel . turkish prime minster recep tayyip erdogan will be rolling out the red carpet for schröder , who will be the guest of honor at an iftar dinner in istanbul on wednesday .
iftar is a special meal for muslims after breaking a day of fasting during the holy month of ramadan . " we would like to thank the chancellor for his help during the past three years and would like to honor him because of that , " cuneyed zapsu , erdogan 's european affairs advisor , said of the special treatment afforded to schröder . turkey 's powerful ally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder playing soccer .
zapsu said that although the two leaders come from different sides of the political spectrum , they have much in common .
in addition to a love for soccer , both men have similar humble backgrounds as well as a passion for campaigning . a powerful ally , germany has proved invaluable to turkey , especially as it seeks to join the european union .
the german chancellor ’ s support was crucial , both in december , when eu leaders agreed to start accession talks with turkey , and in negotiations earlier this month to officially open the talks . " psychologically it is very important if there is somebody that understands you and tells they would like to help - that is enough to give you more strength in the psychologically very difficult talks we had , " zapsu said . business leaders look to merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german opposition party leader angela merkel -lrb- l -rrb- and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan -lrb- r -rrb- address the media in ankara , turkey on monday 16 february 2004 .
there are concerns in turkey that angela merkel , now set to succeed gerhard schröder as chancellor , could threaten the country 's aspirations to join the eu .
merkel has repeatedly spoken out against turkish eu membership , calling instead for a " privileged partnership . " but some turkish business leaders with strong links to germany are confident that the political and economic realities will make her change her stance . " when you have the responsibility of government you take wise decisions , so i expect ms merkel will tone down her rhetoric about turkey , " said ishak alaton founder of turkish engineering company alarko .

some say that attacks have been on the increase since then , but the victim himself sees things differently . wolfgang schäuble was ready to call it a day . " i 'm tired and wo n't keep going much longer , " the german interior minister reportedly told his wife on the phone before heading to one last election campaign event late on oct .
12 , 1990 . schäuble did n't come home that night : as he was leaving the meeting , a mentally disturbed man fired three shots at him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble still relies on protection " i think i heard a bang and felt heat , but i do n't remember anything else , " said schäuble , adding that he immediately lost consciousness .
two bullets had hit the minister in the face and the chest .
the third wounded one of schäuble 's bodyguards , who had thrown himself in front of the politician . " if the third shot had hit me as well , i would not have survived , " said schäuble , who is a paraplegic as a result of the attack . a long list of attacks the assassination attempt came less than five months after a mentally disturbed woman stabbed oskar lafontaine , then premier of the state of saarland , in the throat .
since then , other politicians have become victims of - albeit less dangerous - aggression . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the attack raptured fischer 's ear drum .
in 1999 , a protestor against the green party 's agreement to send german troops to the war in kosovo hit german foreign minister joschka fischer on his ear with a paint-filled bag while a man wounded fischer 's party colleague angelika beer with a knife outside her house in 2000 . last year , hamburg ' justice minister was stabbed in the leg by a woman .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , among others , has been slapped in the face while many , including former chancellor helmut kohl and bavarian premier edmund stoiber , have been pelted with eggs . are the media to blame ? media coverage of politicians is largely to blame for an increase in attacks , according to jörg van essen , a member of parliament for the free-market liberal free democrats . " the constant scandalization of people in politics has lowered the inhibition threshold , " van essen said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1991 , former chancellor helmut kohl -lrb- left -rrb- decided to fight back when he was hit with eggs .
recently , the security expert also criticized germany 's secretive secret service , which guards the president , the chancellor and other federal state officials who could be the target of an attack . but van essen said that while the 500-member strong branch of germany 's federal criminal police -lrb- bka -rrb- previously offered insufficient protection due to a lack of bodyguards , the problem has been resolved . " nevertheless , we realize that people who stand in the public 's eye keep getting targeted for attacks , " he said , adding that it was mainly " mentally disturbed persons , who drink themselves into a stupor to attack well-known politicians . " no longer an organized threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf mainly targeted economic leaders such as alfred herrhausen , the head of deutsche bank , who was killed in this bomb attack on his car in november 1989 .
schäuble agreed that mentally disturbed people - like the one who attacked him - posed the greatest danger to politicians after the disbandment of the left-wing radical terrorist group red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , which presented an organized threat to germany 's leaders in the 1970s and 1980s . but he did n't share van essen 's view that more attacks were happening , adding that no incidents became known during the last election campaign . " you can not talk about an increase , " he said . experts also said that the general threat has significantly dropped since the raf 's heyday . back then , bka officials included 70 people in the top risk category for people , meaning they are in serious danger of becoming the target of an attack , said helwig finger , a former bodyguard in the private sector , who now works as a trainer .
that number has dropped to about 15 people since , he said . the risks of public life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder is likely to keep bodyguards after he leaves office .
finger also added that the occasional slap in the face was almost inevitable because of the desire of politicians to rub shoulders with the people . " it looks negligent , not because bka officials are doing a bad job , but because schröder says , ' i do n't want anyone in front of me , " ' he said . schäuble , meanwhile , said that complete protection was impossible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble " any public figure is exposed to personal risks , " he said .
" it 's impossible to protect people 100 percent . " the christian democrat himself could soon oversee the protection of politicians again . while he denied any comment on the matter , the current deputy leader of his party 's parliamentary group stands a good chance of returning to his old job as interior minister in germany 's next government . mathis winkler , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de exhibit takes german terror stain public a controversial exhibition based on the life and times of the red army faction , germany 's own notorious terror group , opens in berlin on saturday in the face of continuing opposition .

he also took a swipe a us president bush . " i will not be part of the next federal government .
definitely not , " the two-term chancellor told a trade union congress in his home town of hanover .
" i genuinely want to support it with all the strength i have .
and that is not meant as a threat . " the 61-year-old , now in his last few weeks as chancellor , also warned the new administration , which will be led by his conservative archrival angela merkel , not to harm germany 's cherished welfare state . schröder this week conceded the chancellery to merkel following a bitter post-election power struggle . " i want to help with this transition .
and i will say one last time , i would ideally have liked to do so in another term in office , but it was not to be , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grand coalition on the way instead , he would now help steer his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- through tough negotiations with merkel 's christian democrat alliance to form germany 's first left-right coalition government since the 1960s .

but i want to help ensure it works , " schröder said of the potentially fraught union . he is already credited with having helped secure eight ministries for the spd , including the key foreign and finance posts in the upcoming coalition - two more than the conservatives will hold - in a trade-off for leaving . the parties agreed to the broad outline of a so-called grand coalition just over three weeks after finishing neck-and-neck in september 18 elections , but must now draw up a formal program of government in the negotiations starting next monday . spd to fight for social policies schröder said his party would battle to preserve social policies , while supporting reforms to revive germany 's moribund economy which he began . " eighty percent of voters spoke out in favor of reforms because they know it is inevitable , " he said , adding that social democrats would resist changes threatening the welfare state .
" people do not want the state in their faces , but they want it by their side , " he said . leading party colleagues had urged schröder to remain in the cabinet , but he said he would not serve under merkel after seven years in the top job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus-uwe benneter , general secretary of the social democratic party klaus uwe benneter , the general secretary of the social democrats , said he regretted the decision .

schröder fell out with bush over the war in iraq when he refused to commit german troops to the war and relations between the two leaders have remained chilly . in another jab at the us president on wednesday , schröder spoke of british prime minister tony blair as " my british friend , who also has other friends , " in a reference to the anglo-american on iraq . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey bids schröder a fond farewell german chancellor gerhard schröder is paying a farewell visit to turkey , where he enjoys popularity due to his support for turkey 's eu membership bid .

while he has confirmed he is stepping down , schröder 's plans for his future remain private . outgoing german chancellor gerhard schröder on tuesday confirmed that he would not play a role in the country 's next coalition government set to be headed by conservative leader angela merkel .
referring to coming negotiations between his social democrats party -lrb- spd -rrb- and merkel 's christian democrats on forming a new left-right coalition government , schröder , who was making a speech in berlin , said he wanted to " take part -lrb- in the talks -rrb- so they go well .
that 's how how we interpret our mission , even if we no longer belong to the new government . "
in the immediate future , schröder remains the head of government and will visit turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan on wednesday before a working dinner with french president jacques chirac on friday . some reports have said that he will be urged to stay within his social democrats to guide them through government in a coalition led by his conservative archrival angela merkel .
others predicted a future outside politics , including a report that he had been approached about working for russian energy giant gazprom . merkel to lead grand-coalition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel , future chancellor of germany first " grand coaltion " government since the 1960 's .
as merkel announced on monday that she had won the right to lead a coalition of her christian democrats and schröder 's social democrats , the chancellor was nowhere to be seen .
the message seemed to be that the battle to serve a third term was lost and , for once , the man known as the " media chancellor " could not steal her moment .
his only appearance was as the lone figure on the chancellery 's upper floors . it was left to franz müntefering , the social democrats ' party chief , to announce at a separate press conference that schröder would remain to help the party through the coalition negotiations .
müntefering insisted that no decision had been made on who should become vice-chancellor , a role the social democrats will fill in the division of cabinet jobs that is weighted heavily in their favor .
it appears unlikely schröder will accept the job . what comes next for gerhard ? he reportedly told merkel in their late-night crunch talks on sunday that staying in the government was " not in my career plans . "
social democrat sources have told the press that schröder had told his allies that he would not serve " under this woman . "
he may however come under pressure to stay within the social democrats in some role , and he certainly retains a seat in the bundestag lower house of parliament . schröder will face calls from leadership sages on both the right and left .
" in this situation the party can not do without him , they it need him , " said the daily süddeutsche zeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder met with putin in his hometown of st. petersburg friday , oct .
7th , as the german leader took a break from tough political coalition negotiations .
in the immediate future , schröder will remain chancellor and has plans to meet with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan on wednesday before a working dinner with french president jacques chirac on friday .
both meetings are designed to plan the eu summit at hampton court palace , near london , on october 27 - 28 , at which schröder will represent germany . what happens after that is unclear .
at 61 , schröder has the energy , charisma and contacts to make big money in the private sector .
his fourth wife , doris schröder-köpf , 20 years his junior , has expressed a desire to live in new york , although schröder , a trained lawyer , would have to improve his english to work in the united states . the top-selling german newspaper bild , quoting russian media , said he had discussed working for gazprom when he attended the birthday celebrations of close ally russian president vladimir putin over the weekend .

on wednesday , pupils in saarlouis discovered their school bell had been replaced by fragments from europe 's greatest composers . " it 's a relief , " 13-year-old julien blass told news broadcaster n-tv .
" if you 've had a tough math assignment beforehand , it makes you happy afterwards . "
blass was referring to the up to 20-second segments of classical music that tell students at the gymnasium am stadtgarten high school in the city of saarlouis , near the french border , when lessons and between-class breaks start and end . wednesday started with a snippet from george bizet 's opera " carmen . "
dubbed " klassik statt klingel " -lrb- classics instead of the bell -rrb- , the new program is meant to promote musical education among kids .
its creator , robert leonardy , head of the saar music festival and a piano professor , compiled a cd of 200 classic jingles , from verdi 's " aida " to theodorakis ' " zorba the greek , " to teach students the fundamentals of his genre . " for the first time , you engage 100 percent of the pupils at a time when , at best , three percent of people regularly listen to classical music , " the maestro explained . back to basics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert leonardy leonardy -lrb- photo -rrb- is hopeful that his idea will catch on nationwide .
he estimates that after two or three years of being exposed to the music every day at school , the students will have a basic knowledge of classical music . but perhaps he 's a bit optimistic .

definitely not , " the two-term chancellor told a trade union congress in his home town of hanover .
" i genuinely want to support it with all the strength i have .
and that is not meant as a threat . " the 61-year-old , now in his last few weeks as chancellor , also warned the new administration , which will be led by his conservative archrival angela merkel , not to harm germany 's cherished welfare state . schröder this week conceded the chancellery to merkel following a bitter post-election power struggle . " i want to help with this transition .
and i will say one last time , i would ideally have liked to do so in another term in office , but it was not to be , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grand coalition on the way instead , he would now help steer his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- through tough negotiations with merkel 's christian democrat alliance to form germany 's first left-right coalition government since the 1960s . " whether it will be a success , i do not know .
but i want to help ensure it works , " schröder said of the potentially fraught union . he is already credited with having helped secure eight ministries for the spd , including the key foreign and finance posts in the upcoming coalition - two more than the conservatives will hold - in a trade-off for leaving . the parties agreed to the broad outline of a so-called grand coalition just over three weeks after finishing neck-and-neck in september 18 elections , but must now draw up a formal program of government in the negotiations starting next monday . spd to fight for social policies schröder said his party would battle to preserve social policies , while supporting reforms to revive germany 's moribund economy which he began . " eighty percent of voters spoke out in favor of reforms because they know it is inevitable , " he said , adding that social democrats would resist changes threatening the welfare state .
" people do not want the state in their faces , but they want it by their side , " he said . leading party colleagues had urged schröder to remain in the cabinet , but he said he would not serve under merkel after seven years in the top job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus-uwe benneter , general secretary of the social democratic party klaus uwe benneter , the general secretary of the social democrats , said he regretted the decision . " we must unfortunately live with it , but many of us had hoped it would be different , " he told zdf television . takes aim at us president the outgoing chancellor on wednesday also aimed a broadside at us president george w. bush , saying hurricane katrina showed what happened when a state neglected its duty . " i can think of a recent disaster that shows what happens when a country neglects its duties of state towards its people , " said schröder . " my post as chancellor , which i still hold , does not allow me to name that country but you all know that i am talking about america , " he said to laughter and applause . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and bush are n't exactly best of friends .
schröder fell out with bush over the war in iraq when he refused to commit german troops to the war and relations between the two leaders have remained chilly . in another jab at the us president on wednesday , schröder spoke of british prime minister tony blair as " my british friend , who also has other friends , " in a reference to the anglo-american on iraq . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey bids schröder a fond farewell german chancellor gerhard schröder is paying a farewell visit to turkey , where he enjoys popularity due to his support for turkey 's eu membership bid .

" the problem of immigration , the dramatic consequences of which we are witnessing , can only be addressed effectively ... through an ambitious and coordinated development cooperation to fight its root causes , " said barroso . " the eu strategy ... will mark a true turning point to help africa help itself , " added eu aid commissioner louis michel , noting that the strategy still has to be approved by the european parliament and eu governments . the eu initiative comes after the bloc 's 25 member governments agreed in may to increase development aid budget by 20 billion euros per year by 2010 .
from 17 billion euros for africa in 2003 , the figure would rise to 25 billion at the end of the decade , according to eu figures .

some 14 people have died in recent months while trying to break into spanish enclaves , some of them shot by moroccan security forces .
morocco has also come under fire for dumping hundreds of the would-be immigrants in desert areas near the algerian border . the african union leader said the underlying problems which fueled an exodus of poor africans had to be tackled . " we have to have the courage to broach the problem of farm subsidies , which weaken our economy and impoverish our rural areas , " he said , in a clear reference to the eu 's long-controversial generous farm aid system . konare added that african immigrants like those trying to get into spain " are a reflection of the poverty " of a continent on which 40 percent of the population lives on less than a euro a day . halve poverty by 2015 the eu strategy is designed to help africa achieve the so-called millennium development goals , chief among which is to reduce poverty by half by 2015 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after being abandoned by moroccan police in the country 's south , these illegal immigrants from senegal walked 550 km -lrb- 340 miles -rrb- on their way to oujda , morocco .

church officials meanwhile called for a ban of a swiss group that wants to help terminally ill germans to die . roger kusch , who serves as justice minister in the city state of hamburg , is the first leading cdu politician who has come out in support of assisted suicide for severely ill people after a swiss group called dignitas recently announced it plans to open a german office in hanover to make it assisted suicide more accessible for germans seeking an end to their suffering . " responsible , compassionate assisted suicide does not clash with human basic rights as far as i 'm concerned , " kush wrote in a guest commentary for hamburger abe n dblatt newspaper .
" instead , it 's an expression of christian charity . " the minister backs a change to germany 's law that punishes assisted suicide .
kusch said that he could see assisted suicide to be legal , a doctor would have to determine that a person has a terminal illness and thoroughly advise the patient .
a statement from the patient certified by a notary would also be required . political oppositio n kusch 's statements have caused uproar , with a spokesman for hamburg 's state government hurrying to clarify that the politician had spoken as a private individual . germany 's hospice foundation sharply criticized kusch for his " deeply appalling " remarks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man lies in an intensive care unit eugen brysch , the foundation 's executive director , said terminally ill and dying people do n't need compassion nor mercy , but attention and highly professional care instead . the youth wing of hamburg 's christian democratic union also opposed kusch 's proposal , saying that killing a person could not be the answer to suffering and illness . social democrats also criticized kusch 's comparison of assisted suicide and abortion .
kusch had written that he did n't understand why assisted suicide was punishable with at least six months in prison while abortion was not . promoti n g a ba n the bishop of hanover 's lutheran church , margot kässmann , meanwhile called for a ban on dignitas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margot kässmann -lrb- center -rrb- " if it 's legally possible , this should happen , " she said , adding that the group was opening the door for assisted suicide .
kässmann said that germans had to rethink their approach toward severely sick people , most of whom die anonymously in hospitals . kässmann 's colleague from the southwestern state of baden-württemberg , frank july , also came out in opposition of assisted suicide . lower saxony 's justice minister elisabeth heister-neumann -lrb- cdu -rrb- has announced that she plans to introduce legislation in germany 's upper house that would penalize agencies that help with assisted suicide such as dignitas . german president horst köhler has also come out in opposition of assisted suicide . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when life becomes worse than death in a move which has caused considerable consternation among politicians and the church , the swiss organization for assisted suicide , dignitas , has founded a subsidiary in germany .

definitely not , " the two-term chancellor told a trade union congress in his home town of hanover .
" i genuinely want to support it with all the strength i have .
and that is not meant as a threat . " the 61-year-old , now in his last few weeks as chancellor , also warned the new administration , which will be led by his conservative archrival angela merkel , not to harm germany 's cherished welfare state . schröder this week conceded the chancellery to merkel following a bitter post-election power struggle . " i want to help with this transition .
and i will say one last time , i would ideally have liked to do so in another term in office , but it was not to be , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grand coalition on the way instead , he would now help steer his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- through tough negotiations with merkel 's christian democrat alliance to form germany 's first left-right coalition government since the 1960s . " whether it will be a success , i do not know .
but i want to help ensure it works , " schröder said of the potentially fraught union . he is already credited with having helped secure eight ministries for the spd , including the key foreign and finance posts in the upcoming coalition - two more than the conservatives will hold - in a trade-off for leaving . the parties agreed to the broad outline of a so-called grand coalition just over three weeks after finishing neck-and-neck in september 18 elections , but must now draw up a formal program of government in the negotiations starting next monday . spd to fight for social policies schröder said his party would battle to preserve social policies , while supporting reforms to revive germany 's moribund economy which he began . " eighty percent of voters spoke out in favor of reforms because they know it is inevitable , " he said , adding that social democrats would resist changes threatening the welfare state .
" people do not want the state in their faces , but they want it by their side , " he said . leading party colleagues had urged schröder to remain in the cabinet , but he said he would not serve under merkel after seven years in the top job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus-uwe benneter , general secretary of the social democratic party klaus uwe benneter , the general secretary of the social democrats , said he regretted the decision . " we must unfortunately live with it , but many of us had hoped it would be different , " he told zdf television . takes aim at us president the outgoing chancellor on wednesday also aimed a broadside at us president george w. bush , saying hurricane katrina showed what happened when a state neglected its duty . " i can think of a recent disaster that shows what happens when a country neglects its duties of state towards its people , " said schröder . " my post as chancellor , which i still hold , does not allow me to name that country but you all know that i am talking about america , " he said to laughter and applause . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and bush are n't exactly best of friends .
schröder fell out with bush over the war in iraq when he refused to commit german troops to the war and relations between the two leaders have remained chilly . in another jab at the us president on wednesday , schröder spoke of british prime minister tony blair as " my british friend , who also has other friends , " in a reference to the anglo-american on iraq . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey bids schröder a fond farewell german chancellor gerhard schröder is paying a farewell visit to turkey , where he enjoys popularity due to his support for turkey 's eu membership bid .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.10.2005 turkey bids schröder a fond farewell großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a shared passion for soccer and politics german chancellor gerhard schröder is paying a farewell visit to turkey , where he enjoys popularity due to his support for turkey 's eu membership bid .
the same can not be said for schröder 's successor , angela merkel . turkish prime minster recep tayyip erdogan will be rolling out the red carpet for schröder , who will be the guest of honor at an iftar dinner in istanbul on wednesday .
iftar is a special meal for muslims after breaking a day of fasting during the holy month of ramadan . " we would like to thank the chancellor for his help during the past three years and would like to honor him because of that , " cuneyed zapsu , erdogan 's european affairs advisor , said of the special treatment afforded to schröder . turkey 's powerful ally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder playing soccer .
zapsu said that although the two leaders come from different sides of the political spectrum , they have much in common .
in addition to a love for soccer , both men have similar humble backgrounds as well as a passion for campaigning . a powerful ally , germany has proved invaluable to turkey , especially as it seeks to join the european union .
the german chancellor ’ s support was crucial , both in december , when eu leaders agreed to start accession talks with turkey , and in negotiations earlier this month to officially open the talks . " psychologically it is very important if there is somebody that understands you and tells they would like to help - that is enough to give you more strength in the psychologically very difficult talks we had , " zapsu said . business leaders look to merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german opposition party leader angela merkel -lrb- l -rrb- and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan -lrb- r -rrb- address the media in ankara , turkey on monday 16 february 2004 .
there are concerns in turkey that angela merkel , now set to succeed gerhard schröder as chancellor , could threaten the country 's aspirations to join the eu .
merkel has repeatedly spoken out against turkish eu membership , calling instead for a " privileged partnership . " but some turkish business leaders with strong links to germany are confident that the political and economic realities will make her change her stance . " when you have the responsibility of government you take wise decisions , so i expect ms merkel will tone down her rhetoric about turkey , " said ishak alaton founder of turkish engineering company alarko .

klose back on the team bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg welcomes the chinese team .
with team captain michael ballack sidelined with the flu , the germans have few options other then to give midfielder torsten frings yet another chance to prove his leadership qualities against china where he will hopefully bounce-back from his poor play against the turks .

china 's striker , xie hui told dw-world that the chinese had nothing by but praise for the german team and was looking forward to the experience that playing against klinsmann 's team would bring them .

two bullets had hit the minister in the face and the chest .
the third wounded one of schäuble 's bodyguards , who had thrown himself in front of the politician . " if the third shot had hit me as well , i would not have survived , " said schäuble , who is a paraplegic as a result of the attack . a long list of attacks the assassination attempt came less than five months after a mentally disturbed woman stabbed oskar lafontaine , then premier of the state of saarland , in the throat .

two bullets had hit the minister in the face and the chest .
the third wounded one of schäuble 's bodyguards , who had thrown himself in front of the politician . " if the third shot had hit me as well , i would not have survived , " said schäuble , who is a paraplegic as a result of the attack . a long list of attacks the assassination attempt came less than five months after a mentally disturbed woman stabbed oskar lafontaine , then premier of the state of saarland , in the throat .

" the problem of immigration , the dramatic consequences of which we are witnessing , can only be addressed effectively ... through an ambitious and coordinated development cooperation to fight its root causes , " said barroso . " the eu strategy ... will mark a true turning point to help africa help itself , " added eu aid commissioner louis michel , noting that the strategy still has to be approved by the european parliament and eu governments . the eu initiative comes after the bloc 's 25 member governments agreed in may to increase development aid budget by 20 billion euros per year by 2010 .
from 17 billion euros for africa in 2003 , the figure would rise to 25 billion at the end of the decade , according to eu figures . " walls and prisons " on the immigration problem , konare warned that the " walls and prisons " can not prevent immigrants trying to enter europe illegally , saying the underlying economic and social reasons had to be tackled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain recently increased fortifications to prevent immigrants from climbing over the fence seperating its north african enclave melilla and morocco " it 's not security measures , it 's not prisons in madrid and walls in africa that will solve the problem , " said konare , chair of the au commission , after the brussels talks .
queried during a visit to portugal about the issue , un secretary general kofi annan also stressed that improving africans ' lives at home was the way forward .
" if we create reasonable living conditions , people will not feel forced to leave , " the lusa news agency quoted him as saying .
some 14 people have died in recent months while trying to break into spanish enclaves , some of them shot by moroccan security forces .
morocco has also come under fire for dumping hundreds of the would-be immigrants in desert areas near the algerian border . the african union leader said the underlying problems which fueled an exodus of poor africans had to be tackled . " we have to have the courage to broach the problem of farm subsidies , which weaken our economy and impoverish our rural areas , " he said , in a clear reference to the eu 's long-controversial generous farm aid system . konare added that african immigrants like those trying to get into spain " are a reflection of the poverty " of a continent on which 40 percent of the population lives on less than a euro a day . halve poverty by 2015 the eu strategy is designed to help africa achieve the so-called millennium development goals , chief among which is to reduce poverty by half by 2015 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after being abandoned by moroccan police in the country 's south , these illegal immigrants from senegal walked 550 km -lrb- 340 miles -rrb- on their way to oujda , morocco .
six of their group died during the 10-day trek .
above all africa needs peace and stability , said the eu executive , explaining its proposals to strengthen good governance - sorely needed to overturn the continent 's reputation for corruption . but it stressed that the key motor of african development will be strengthening economies , and for that infrastrure - road and rail transport , but also water , energy and telecoms links - is crucial . the creation of such networks will add a " spinal column " for the development of a genuine internal market across the continent , eu officials say . konare agreed that to bolster its own national economies is essential .
" without an african internal market , it is an illusion to believe that we can strive towards overseas markets , " said konare . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain starts deporting immigrants spain has started deporting illegal immigrants despite concerns about possible human rights violations while a new assault on the spanish border by african immigrants resulted in six deaths .

while he has confirmed he is stepping down , schröder 's plans for his future remain private . outgoing german chancellor gerhard schröder on tuesday confirmed that he would not play a role in the country 's next coalition government set to be headed by conservative leader angela merkel .
referring to coming negotiations between his social democrats party -lrb- spd -rrb- and merkel 's christian democrats on forming a new left-right coalition government , schröder , who was making a speech in berlin , said he wanted to " take part -lrb- in the talks -rrb- so they go well .
that 's how how we interpret our mission , even if we no longer belong to the new government . "
in the immediate future , schröder remains the head of government and will visit turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan on wednesday before a working dinner with french president jacques chirac on friday . some reports have said that he will be urged to stay within his social democrats to guide them through government in a coalition led by his conservative archrival angela merkel .
others predicted a future outside politics , including a report that he had been approached about working for russian energy giant gazprom . merkel to lead grand-coalition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel , future chancellor of germany first " grand coaltion " government since the 1960 's .
as merkel announced on monday that she had won the right to lead a coalition of her christian democrats and schröder 's social democrats , the chancellor was nowhere to be seen .
the message seemed to be that the battle to serve a third term was lost and , for once , the man known as the " media chancellor " could not steal her moment .
his only appearance was as the lone figure on the chancellery 's upper floors . it was left to franz müntefering , the social democrats ' party chief , to announce at a separate press conference that schröder would remain to help the party through the coalition negotiations .
müntefering insisted that no decision had been made on who should become vice-chancellor , a role the social democrats will fill in the division of cabinet jobs that is weighted heavily in their favor .
it appears unlikely schröder will accept the job . what comes next for gerhard ? he reportedly told merkel in their late-night crunch talks on sunday that staying in the government was " not in my career plans . "
social democrat sources have told the press that schröder had told his allies that he would not serve " under this woman . "
he may however come under pressure to stay within the social democrats in some role , and he certainly retains a seat in the bundestag lower house of parliament . schröder will face calls from leadership sages on both the right and left .
" in this situation the party can not do without him , they it need him , " said the daily süddeutsche zeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder met with putin in his hometown of st. petersburg friday , oct .
7th , as the german leader took a break from tough political coalition negotiations .
in the immediate future , schröder will remain chancellor and has plans to meet with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan on wednesday before a working dinner with french president jacques chirac on friday .
both meetings are designed to plan the eu summit at hampton court palace , near london , on october 27 - 28 , at which schröder will represent germany . what happens after that is unclear .
at 61 , schröder has the energy , charisma and contacts to make big money in the private sector .
his fourth wife , doris schröder-köpf , 20 years his junior , has expressed a desire to live in new york , although schröder , a trained lawyer , would have to improve his english to work in the united states . the top-selling german newspaper bild , quoting russian media , said he had discussed working for gazprom when he attended the birthday celebrations of close ally russian president vladimir putin over the weekend .

while he has confirmed he is stepping down , schröder 's plans for his future remain private . outgoing german chancellor gerhard schröder on tuesday confirmed that he would not play a role in the country 's next coalition government set to be headed by conservative leader angela merkel .
referring to coming negotiations between his social democrats party -lrb- spd -rrb- and merkel 's christian democrats on forming a new left-right coalition government , schröder , who was making a speech in berlin , said he wanted to " take part -lrb- in the talks -rrb- so they go well .
that 's how how we interpret our mission , even if we no longer belong to the new government . "
in the immediate future , schröder remains the head of government and will visit turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan on wednesday before a working dinner with french president jacques chirac on friday . some reports have said that he will be urged to stay within his social democrats to guide them through government in a coalition led by his conservative archrival angela merkel .
others predicted a future outside politics , including a report that he had been approached about working for russian energy giant gazprom . merkel to lead grand-coalition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel , future chancellor of germany first " grand coaltion " government since the 1960 's .
as merkel announced on monday that she had won the right to lead a coalition of her christian democrats and schröder 's social democrats , the chancellor was nowhere to be seen .
the message seemed to be that the battle to serve a third term was lost and , for once , the man known as the " media chancellor " could not steal her moment .
his only appearance was as the lone figure on the chancellery 's upper floors . it was left to franz müntefering , the social democrats ' party chief , to announce at a separate press conference that schröder would remain to help the party through the coalition negotiations .
müntefering insisted that no decision had been made on who should become vice-chancellor , a role the social democrats will fill in the division of cabinet jobs that is weighted heavily in their favor .
it appears unlikely schröder will accept the job . what comes next for gerhard ? he reportedly told merkel in their late-night crunch talks on sunday that staying in the government was " not in my career plans . "
social democrat sources have told the press that schröder had told his allies that he would not serve " under this woman . "
he may however come under pressure to stay within the social democrats in some role , and he certainly retains a seat in the bundestag lower house of parliament . schröder will face calls from leadership sages on both the right and left .

in the immediate future , schröder will remain chancellor and has plans to meet with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan on wednesday before a working dinner with french president jacques chirac on friday .
both meetings are designed to plan the eu summit at hampton court palace , near london , on october 27 - 28 , at which schröder will represent germany . what happens after that is unclear .
at 61 , schröder has the energy , charisma and contacts to make big money in the private sector .
his fourth wife , doris schröder-köpf , 20 years his junior , has expressed a desire to live in new york , although schröder , a trained lawyer , would have to improve his english to work in the united states . the top-selling german newspaper bild , quoting russian media , said he had discussed working for gazprom when he attended the birthday celebrations of close ally russian president vladimir putin over the weekend .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.10.2005 schröder ponders life after chancellery großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder will have both political and private options to choose from now that germany has a new leader , there is much speculation about the future of outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder .
while he has confirmed he is stepping down , schröder 's plans for his future remain private . outgoing german chancellor gerhard schröder on tuesday confirmed that he would not play a role in the country 's next coalition government set to be headed by conservative leader angela merkel .
referring to coming negotiations between his social democrats party -lrb- spd -rrb- and merkel 's christian democrats on forming a new left-right coalition government , schröder , who was making a speech in berlin , said he wanted to " take part -lrb- in the talks -rrb- so they go well .
that 's how how we interpret our mission , even if we no longer belong to the new government . "
in the immediate future , schröder remains the head of government and will visit turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan on wednesday before a working dinner with french president jacques chirac on friday . some reports have said that he will be urged to stay within his social democrats to guide them through government in a coalition led by his conservative archrival angela merkel .
others predicted a future outside politics , including a report that he had been approached about working for russian energy giant gazprom . merkel to lead grand-coalition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel , future chancellor of germany first " grand coaltion " government since the 1960 's .
as merkel announced on monday that she had won the right to lead a coalition of her christian democrats and schröder 's social democrats , the chancellor was nowhere to be seen .
the message seemed to be that the battle to serve a third term was lost and , for once , the man known as the " media chancellor " could not steal her moment .
his only appearance was as the lone figure on the chancellery 's upper floors . it was left to franz müntefering , the social democrats ' party chief , to announce at a separate press conference that schröder would remain to help the party through the coalition negotiations .
müntefering insisted that no decision had been made on who should become vice-chancellor , a role the social democrats will fill in the division of cabinet jobs that is weighted heavily in their favor .
it appears unlikely schröder will accept the job . what comes next for gerhard ? he reportedly told merkel in their late-night crunch talks on sunday that staying in the government was " not in my career plans . "
social democrat sources have told the press that schröder had told his allies that he would not serve " under this woman . "
he may however come under pressure to stay within the social democrats in some role , and he certainly retains a seat in the bundestag lower house of parliament . schröder will face calls from leadership sages on both the right and left .
" in this situation the party can not do without him , they it need him , " said the daily süddeutsche zeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder met with putin in his hometown of st. petersburg friday , oct .
7th , as the german leader took a break from tough political coalition negotiations .
in the immediate future , schröder will remain chancellor and has plans to meet with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan on wednesday before a working dinner with french president jacques chirac on friday .
both meetings are designed to plan the eu summit at hampton court palace , near london , on october 27 - 28 , at which schröder will represent germany . what happens after that is unclear .
at 61 , schröder has the energy , charisma and contacts to make big money in the private sector .
his fourth wife , doris schröder-köpf , 20 years his junior , has expressed a desire to live in new york , although schröder , a trained lawyer , would have to improve his english to work in the united states . the top-selling german newspaper bild , quoting russian media , said he had discussed working for gazprom when he attended the birthday celebrations of close ally russian president vladimir putin over the weekend .
but on that rumor , as with all the others , there has only been silence from schröder . dw staff / afp -lrb- aal -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press : merkel 's historic moment german newspapers called angela merkel 's announcement that she will be the country 's next chancellor an historic moment , but said she faced a tough time leading a left-right coalition .

" the problem of immigration , the dramatic consequences of which we are witnessing , can only be addressed effectively ... through an ambitious and coordinated development cooperation to fight its root causes , " said barroso . " the eu strategy ... will mark a true turning point to help africa help itself , " added eu aid commissioner louis michel , noting that the strategy still has to be approved by the european parliament and eu governments . the eu initiative comes after the bloc 's 25 member governments agreed in may to increase development aid budget by 20 billion euros per year by 2010 .
from 17 billion euros for africa in 2003 , the figure would rise to 25 billion at the end of the decade , according to eu figures . " walls and prisons " on the immigration problem , konare warned that the " walls and prisons " can not prevent immigrants trying to enter europe illegally , saying the underlying economic and social reasons had to be tackled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain recently increased fortifications to prevent immigrants from climbing over the fence seperating its north african enclave melilla and morocco " it 's not security measures , it 's not prisons in madrid and walls in africa that will solve the problem , " said konare , chair of the au commission , after the brussels talks .
queried during a visit to portugal about the issue , un secretary general kofi annan also stressed that improving africans ' lives at home was the way forward .
" if we create reasonable living conditions , people will not feel forced to leave , " the lusa news agency quoted him as saying .
some 14 people have died in recent months while trying to break into spanish enclaves , some of them shot by moroccan security forces .
morocco has also come under fire for dumping hundreds of the would-be immigrants in desert areas near the algerian border . the african union leader said the underlying problems which fueled an exodus of poor africans had to be tackled . " we have to have the courage to broach the problem of farm subsidies , which weaken our economy and impoverish our rural areas , " he said , in a clear reference to the eu 's long-controversial generous farm aid system . konare added that african immigrants like those trying to get into spain " are a reflection of the poverty " of a continent on which 40 percent of the population lives on less than a euro a day . halve poverty by 2015 the eu strategy is designed to help africa achieve the so-called millennium development goals , chief among which is to reduce poverty by half by 2015 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after being abandoned by moroccan police in the country 's south , these illegal immigrants from senegal walked 550 km -lrb- 340 miles -rrb- on their way to oujda , morocco .
six of their group died during the 10-day trek .
above all africa needs peace and stability , said the eu executive , explaining its proposals to strengthen good governance - sorely needed to overturn the continent 's reputation for corruption . but it stressed that the key motor of african development will be strengthening economies , and for that infrastrure - road and rail transport , but also water , energy and telecoms links - is crucial . the creation of such networks will add a " spinal column " for the development of a genuine internal market across the continent , eu officials say . konare agreed that to bolster its own national economies is essential .

" the problem of immigration , the dramatic consequences of which we are witnessing , can only be addressed effectively ... through an ambitious and coordinated development cooperation to fight its root causes , " said barroso . " the eu strategy ... will mark a true turning point to help africa help itself , " added eu aid commissioner louis michel , noting that the strategy still has to be approved by the european parliament and eu governments . the eu initiative comes after the bloc 's 25 member governments agreed in may to increase development aid budget by 20 billion euros per year by 2010 .
from 17 billion euros for africa in 2003 , the figure would rise to 25 billion at the end of the decade , according to eu figures . " walls and prisons " on the immigration problem , konare warned that the " walls and prisons " can not prevent immigrants trying to enter europe illegally , saying the underlying economic and social reasons had to be tackled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain recently increased fortifications to prevent immigrants from climbing over the fence seperating its north african enclave melilla and morocco " it 's not security measures , it 's not prisons in madrid and walls in africa that will solve the problem , " said konare , chair of the au commission , after the brussels talks .
queried during a visit to portugal about the issue , un secretary general kofi annan also stressed that improving africans ' lives at home was the way forward .
" if we create reasonable living conditions , people will not feel forced to leave , " the lusa news agency quoted him as saying .

church officials meanwhile called for a ban of a swiss group that wants to help terminally ill germans to die . roger kusch , who serves as justice minister in the city state of hamburg , is the first leading cdu politician who has come out in support of assisted suicide for severely ill people after a swiss group called dignitas recently announced it plans to open a german office in hanover to make it assisted suicide more accessible for germans seeking an end to their suffering . " responsible , compassionate assisted suicide does not clash with human basic rights as far as i 'm concerned , " kush wrote in a guest commentary for hamburger abe n dblatt newspaper .
" instead , it 's an expression of christian charity . " the minister backs a change to germany 's law that punishes assisted suicide .
kusch said that he could see assisted suicide to be legal , a doctor would have to determine that a person has a terminal illness and thoroughly advise the patient .
a statement from the patient certified by a notary would also be required . political oppositio n kusch 's statements have caused uproar , with a spokesman for hamburg 's state government hurrying to clarify that the politician had spoken as a private individual . germany 's hospice foundation sharply criticized kusch for his " deeply appalling " remarks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man lies in an intensive care unit eugen brysch , the foundation 's executive director , said terminally ill and dying people do n't need compassion nor mercy , but attention and highly professional care instead . the youth wing of hamburg 's christian democratic union also opposed kusch 's proposal , saying that killing a person could not be the answer to suffering and illness . social democrats also criticized kusch 's comparison of assisted suicide and abortion .
kusch had written that he did n't understand why assisted suicide was punishable with at least six months in prison while abortion was not . promoti n g a ba n the bishop of hanover 's lutheran church , margot kässmann , meanwhile called for a ban on dignitas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margot kässmann -lrb- center -rrb- " if it 's legally possible , this should happen , " she said , adding that the group was opening the door for assisted suicide .
kässmann said that germans had to rethink their approach toward severely sick people , most of whom die anonymously in hospitals . kässmann 's colleague from the southwestern state of baden-württemberg , frank july , also came out in opposition of assisted suicide . lower saxony 's justice minister elisabeth heister-neumann -lrb- cdu -rrb- has announced that she plans to introduce legislation in germany 's upper house that would penalize agencies that help with assisted suicide such as dignitas . german president horst köhler has also come out in opposition of assisted suicide . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when life becomes worse than death in a move which has caused considerable consternation among politicians and the church , the swiss organization for assisted suicide , dignitas , has founded a subsidiary in germany .

" i genuinely want to support it with all the strength i have .
and that is not meant as a threat . " the 61-year-old , now in his last few weeks as chancellor , also warned the new administration , which will be led by his conservative archrival angela merkel , not to harm germany 's cherished welfare state . schröder this week conceded the chancellery to merkel following a bitter post-election power struggle . " i want to help with this transition .

but i want to help ensure it works , " schröder said of the potentially fraught union . he is already credited with having helped secure eight ministries for the spd , including the key foreign and finance posts in the upcoming coalition - two more than the conservatives will hold - in a trade-off for leaving . the parties agreed to the broad outline of a so-called grand coalition just over three weeks after finishing neck-and-neck in september 18 elections , but must now draw up a formal program of government in the negotiations starting next monday . spd to fight for social policies schröder said his party would battle to preserve social policies , while supporting reforms to revive germany 's moribund economy which he began . " eighty percent of voters spoke out in favor of reforms because they know it is inevitable , " he said , adding that social democrats would resist changes threatening the welfare state .
" people do not want the state in their faces , but they want it by their side , " he said . leading party colleagues had urged schröder to remain in the cabinet , but he said he would not serve under merkel after seven years in the top job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus-uwe benneter , general secretary of the social democratic party klaus uwe benneter , the general secretary of the social democrats , said he regretted the decision . " we must unfortunately live with it , but many of us had hoped it would be different , " he told zdf television . takes aim at us president the outgoing chancellor on wednesday also aimed a broadside at us president george w. bush , saying hurricane katrina showed what happened when a state neglected its duty . " i can think of a recent disaster that shows what happens when a country neglects its duties of state towards its people , " said schröder . " my post as chancellor , which i still hold , does not allow me to name that country but you all know that i am talking about america , " he said to laughter and applause . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and bush are n't exactly best of friends .
schröder fell out with bush over the war in iraq when he refused to commit german troops to the war and relations between the two leaders have remained chilly . in another jab at the us president on wednesday , schröder spoke of british prime minister tony blair as " my british friend , who also has other friends , " in a reference to the anglo-american on iraq . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey bids schröder a fond farewell german chancellor gerhard schröder is paying a farewell visit to turkey , where he enjoys popularity due to his support for turkey 's eu membership bid .

he also took a swipe a us president bush . " i will not be part of the next federal government .
definitely not , " the two-term chancellor told a trade union congress in his home town of hanover .
" i genuinely want to support it with all the strength i have .
and that is not meant as a threat . " the 61-year-old , now in his last few weeks as chancellor , also warned the new administration , which will be led by his conservative archrival angela merkel , not to harm germany 's cherished welfare state . schröder this week conceded the chancellery to merkel following a bitter post-election power struggle . " i want to help with this transition .
and i will say one last time , i would ideally have liked to do so in another term in office , but it was not to be , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grand coalition on the way instead , he would now help steer his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- through tough negotiations with merkel 's christian democrat alliance to form germany 's first left-right coalition government since the 1960s . " whether it will be a success , i do not know .
but i want to help ensure it works , " schröder said of the potentially fraught union . he is already credited with having helped secure eight ministries for the spd , including the key foreign and finance posts in the upcoming coalition - two more than the conservatives will hold - in a trade-off for leaving . the parties agreed to the broad outline of a so-called grand coalition just over three weeks after finishing neck-and-neck in september 18 elections , but must now draw up a formal program of government in the negotiations starting next monday . spd to fight for social policies schröder said his party would battle to preserve social policies , while supporting reforms to revive germany 's moribund economy which he began . " eighty percent of voters spoke out in favor of reforms because they know it is inevitable , " he said , adding that social democrats would resist changes threatening the welfare state .
" people do not want the state in their faces , but they want it by their side , " he said . leading party colleagues had urged schröder to remain in the cabinet , but he said he would not serve under merkel after seven years in the top job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus-uwe benneter , general secretary of the social democratic party klaus uwe benneter , the general secretary of the social democrats , said he regretted the decision . " we must unfortunately live with it , but many of us had hoped it would be different , " he told zdf television . takes aim at us president the outgoing chancellor on wednesday also aimed a broadside at us president george w. bush , saying hurricane katrina showed what happened when a state neglected its duty . " i can think of a recent disaster that shows what happens when a country neglects its duties of state towards its people , " said schröder . " my post as chancellor , which i still hold , does not allow me to name that country but you all know that i am talking about america , " he said to laughter and applause . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and bush are n't exactly best of friends .
schröder fell out with bush over the war in iraq when he refused to commit german troops to the war and relations between the two leaders have remained chilly . in another jab at the us president on wednesday , schröder spoke of british prime minister tony blair as " my british friend , who also has other friends , " in a reference to the anglo-american on iraq . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey bids schröder a fond farewell german chancellor gerhard schröder is paying a farewell visit to turkey , where he enjoys popularity due to his support for turkey 's eu membership bid .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 12.10.2005 the rhythm of recess großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking an orchestral break a german piano professor has devised a way to get kids into classical music .
on wednesday , pupils in saarlouis discovered their school bell had been replaced by fragments from europe 's greatest composers . " it 's a relief , " 13-year-old julien blass told news broadcaster n-tv .
" if you 've had a tough math assignment beforehand , it makes you happy afterwards . "
blass was referring to the up to 20-second segments of classical music that tell students at the gymnasium am stadtgarten high school in the city of saarlouis , near the french border , when lessons and between-class breaks start and end . wednesday started with a snippet from george bizet 's opera " carmen . "
dubbed " klassik statt klingel " -lrb- classics instead of the bell -rrb- , the new program is meant to promote musical education among kids .
its creator , robert leonardy , head of the saar music festival and a piano professor , compiled a cd of 200 classic jingles , from verdi 's " aida " to theodorakis ' " zorba the greek , " to teach students the fundamentals of his genre . " for the first time , you engage 100 percent of the pupils at a time when , at best , three percent of people regularly listen to classical music , " the maestro explained . back to basics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert leonardy leonardy -lrb- photo -rrb- is hopeful that his idea will catch on nationwide .
he estimates that after two or three years of being exposed to the music every day at school , the students will have a basic knowledge of classical music . but perhaps he 's a bit optimistic .
julien blass and his schoolmate saskia philippi were , in any case , skeptical after their first day of classical jingles .
neither of them thought the tunes would inspire them to listen to classical music at home , they told n-tv .
and blass was pretty sure he 'd never make his way to a classical concert . and for those kids who loath going to school in the first place , associating classical music with their daily grind could just turn them off bach , tchaikovsky , mozart and co. forever . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de frog fad spawns assault on music industry be afraid ... be very afraid .

" the problem of immigration , the dramatic consequences of which we are witnessing , can only be addressed effectively ... through an ambitious and coordinated development cooperation to fight its root causes , " said barroso . " the eu strategy ... will mark a true turning point to help africa help itself , " added eu aid commissioner louis michel , noting that the strategy still has to be approved by the european parliament and eu governments . the eu initiative comes after the bloc 's 25 member governments agreed in may to increase development aid budget by 20 billion euros per year by 2010 .
from 17 billion euros for africa in 2003 , the figure would rise to 25 billion at the end of the decade , according to eu figures .

" if we create reasonable living conditions , people will not feel forced to leave , " the lusa news agency quoted him as saying .
some 14 people have died in recent months while trying to break into spanish enclaves , some of them shot by moroccan security forces .
morocco has also come under fire for dumping hundreds of the would-be immigrants in desert areas near the algerian border . the african union leader said the underlying problems which fueled an exodus of poor africans had to be tackled . " we have to have the courage to broach the problem of farm subsidies , which weaken our economy and impoverish our rural areas , " he said , in a clear reference to the eu 's long-controversial generous farm aid system . konare added that african immigrants like those trying to get into spain " are a reflection of the poverty " of a continent on which 40 percent of the population lives on less than a euro a day . halve poverty by 2015 the eu strategy is designed to help africa achieve the so-called millennium development goals , chief among which is to reduce poverty by half by 2015 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after being abandoned by moroccan police in the country 's south , these illegal immigrants from senegal walked 550 km -lrb- 340 miles -rrb- on their way to oujda , morocco .

above all africa needs peace and stability , said the eu executive , explaining its proposals to strengthen good governance - sorely needed to overturn the continent 's reputation for corruption . but it stressed that the key motor of african development will be strengthening economies , and for that infrastrure - road and rail transport , but also water , energy and telecoms links - is crucial . the creation of such networks will add a " spinal column " for the development of a genuine internal market across the continent , eu officials say . konare agreed that to bolster its own national economies is essential .

" the problem of immigration , the dramatic consequences of which we are witnessing , can only be addressed effectively ... through an ambitious and coordinated development cooperation to fight its root causes , " said barroso . " the eu strategy ... will mark a true turning point to help africa help itself , " added eu aid commissioner louis michel , noting that the strategy still has to be approved by the european parliament and eu governments . the eu initiative comes after the bloc 's 25 member governments agreed in may to increase development aid budget by 20 billion euros per year by 2010 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 12.10.2005 wounded lions versus crouching tigers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's coach zhu : " we 're coming to learn " germany face china on wednesday in a friendly match in hamburg .
china 's coach zhu told dw-world his team is looking for experience but his philosophical outlook masks a desire to cause an upset . germany is hoping that quick and decisive victory against china on wednesday will deflect some of the criticism still circling afte their embarrassing 1:2 loss in istanbul last saturday . still , the million dollar question on everyone 's lips remans : can jürgen klinsmann 's team reinvigorate themselves over the course of a few days and present a new image to the nearly sold-out crowd at hamburg 's aol-arena ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese team captain li weifeng at practice .
speaking to dw-world , germany 's assistant coach joachim löw does n't mince words : " the german team must beat china - there is no alternative . " intent on not underestimating their rival , löw says the coaching staff has put in overtime " reviewing video footage of the chinese team and discussing tactics " .
klose back on the team bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg welcomes the chinese team .

the same can not be said for schröder 's successor , angela merkel . turkish prime minster recep tayyip erdogan will be rolling out the red carpet for schröder , who will be the guest of honor at an iftar dinner in istanbul on wednesday .
iftar is a special meal for muslims after breaking a day of fasting during the holy month of ramadan . " we would like to thank the chancellor for his help during the past three years and would like to honor him because of that , " cuneyed zapsu , erdogan 's european affairs advisor , said of the special treatment afforded to schröder . turkey 's powerful ally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder playing soccer .

in addition to a love for soccer , both men have similar humble backgrounds as well as a passion for campaigning . a powerful ally , germany has proved invaluable to turkey , especially as it seeks to join the european union .
the german chancellor ’ s support was crucial , both in december , when eu leaders agreed to start accession talks with turkey , and in negotiations earlier this month to officially open the talks .

there are concerns in turkey that angela merkel , now set to succeed gerhard schröder as chancellor , could threaten the country 's aspirations to join the eu .
merkel has repeatedly spoken out against turkish eu membership , calling instead for a " privileged partnership . " but some turkish business leaders with strong links to germany are confident that the political and economic realities will make her change her stance . " when you have the responsibility of government you take wise decisions , so i expect ms merkel will tone down her rhetoric about turkey , " said ishak alaton founder of turkish engineering company alarko .
" i expect investments both from turkey towards germany and investments of german companies in turkey to increase in size and capacity .
so i am looking forward to better and stronger relations between germany and turkey . " erdogan and merkel may not share similar personal interests , but they both come from the center-right of the political spectrum and value strong ties to the united states .

the same can not be said for schröder 's successor , angela merkel . turkish prime minster recep tayyip erdogan will be rolling out the red carpet for schröder , who will be the guest of honor at an iftar dinner in istanbul on wednesday .
iftar is a special meal for muslims after breaking a day of fasting during the holy month of ramadan .

zapsu said that although the two leaders come from different sides of the political spectrum , they have much in common .
in addition to a love for soccer , both men have similar humble backgrounds as well as a passion for campaigning . a powerful ally , germany has proved invaluable to turkey , especially as it seeks to join the european union .
the german chancellor ’ s support was crucial , both in december , when eu leaders agreed to start accession talks with turkey , and in negotiations earlier this month to officially open the talks .

there are concerns in turkey that angela merkel , now set to succeed gerhard schröder as chancellor , could threaten the country 's aspirations to join the eu .

on wednesday , pupils in saarlouis discovered their school bell had been replaced by fragments from europe 's greatest composers . " it 's a relief , " 13-year-old julien blass told news broadcaster n-tv .
" if you 've had a tough math assignment beforehand , it makes you happy afterwards . "
blass was referring to the up to 20-second segments of classical music that tell students at the gymnasium am stadtgarten high school in the city of saarlouis , near the french border , when lessons and between-class breaks start and end . wednesday started with a snippet from george bizet 's opera " carmen . "
dubbed " klassik statt klingel " -lrb- classics instead of the bell -rrb- , the new program is meant to promote musical education among kids .
its creator , robert leonardy , head of the saar music festival and a piano professor , compiled a cd of 200 classic jingles , from verdi 's " aida " to theodorakis ' " zorba the greek , " to teach students the fundamentals of his genre . " for the first time , you engage 100 percent of the pupils at a time when , at best , three percent of people regularly listen to classical music , " the maestro explained . back to basics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert leonardy leonardy -lrb- photo -rrb- is hopeful that his idea will catch on nationwide .
he estimates that after two or three years of being exposed to the music every day at school , the students will have a basic knowledge of classical music . but perhaps he 's a bit optimistic .
julien blass and his schoolmate saskia philippi were , in any case , skeptical after their first day of classical jingles .
neither of them thought the tunes would inspire them to listen to classical music at home , they told n-tv .
and blass was pretty sure he 'd never make his way to a classical concert . and for those kids who loath going to school in the first place , associating classical music with their daily grind could just turn them off bach , tchaikovsky , mozart and co. forever . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de frog fad spawns assault on music industry be afraid ... be very afraid .

the price of light heating oil soared by 40 percent on a 12-month basis and fuel cost 17.4 percent more than it did a year ago , reaching a new record high , destatis said .

the same can not be said for schröder 's successor , angela merkel . turkish prime minster recep tayyip erdogan will be rolling out the red carpet for schröder , who will be the guest of honor at an iftar dinner in istanbul on wednesday .
iftar is a special meal for muslims after breaking a day of fasting during the holy month of ramadan . " we would like to thank the chancellor for his help during the past three years and would like to honor him because of that , " cuneyed zapsu , erdogan 's european affairs advisor , said of the special treatment afforded to schröder . turkey 's powerful ally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder playing soccer .
zapsu said that although the two leaders come from different sides of the political spectrum , they have much in common .
in addition to a love for soccer , both men have similar humble backgrounds as well as a passion for campaigning . a powerful ally , germany has proved invaluable to turkey , especially as it seeks to join the european union .
the german chancellor ’ s support was crucial , both in december , when eu leaders agreed to start accession talks with turkey , and in negotiations earlier this month to officially open the talks . " psychologically it is very important if there is somebody that understands you and tells they would like to help - that is enough to give you more strength in the psychologically very difficult talks we had , " zapsu said . business leaders look to merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german opposition party leader angela merkel -lrb- l -rrb- and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan -lrb- r -rrb- address the media in ankara , turkey on monday 16 february 2004 .
there are concerns in turkey that angela merkel , now set to succeed gerhard schröder as chancellor , could threaten the country 's aspirations to join the eu .
merkel has repeatedly spoken out against turkish eu membership , calling instead for a " privileged partnership . " but some turkish business leaders with strong links to germany are confident that the political and economic realities will make her change her stance . " when you have the responsibility of government you take wise decisions , so i expect ms merkel will tone down her rhetoric about turkey , " said ishak alaton founder of turkish engineering company alarko .

" i can think of a recent disaster that shows what happens when a country neglects its duties of state towards its people , " said schröder . " my post as chancellor , which i still hold , does not allow me to name that country but you all know that i am talking about america , " he said to laughter and applause . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and bush are n't exactly best of friends .
schröder fell out with bush over the war in iraq when he refused to commit german troops to the war and relations between the two leaders have remained chilly . in another jab at the us president on wednesday , schröder spoke of british prime minister tony blair as " my british friend , who also has other friends , " in a reference to the anglo-american on iraq . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey bids schröder a fond farewell german chancellor gerhard schröder is paying a farewell visit to turkey , where he enjoys popularity due to his support for turkey 's eu membership bid .

it comes amid growing concern over the rising number of mothers having caesarean sections .
midwives will be trained in water births , an aromatherapy service will be introduced and hospital birthing environments will be improved .
the aim is to reduce the number of births by caesarean section and ease women 's natural birthing experience .
nationally , 65 % of women give birth naturally , whereas in bromley the figure was just 55.5 % in 2004 , according to department of health figures .
' first choice ' in contrast , 3 % of bromley mothers opted for home births in 2005 , compared with a national rate of 1-2 % .
sarah gregson , practice development midwife at the trust , said : " the normal birth campaign at the trust aims to support the normalisation of childbirth for women who have straightforward pregnancies and to provide a more pleasant environment for all women giving birth in bromley . "
" we are currently in the process of training our staff in aromatherapy and water births as well as actively educating staff and healthcare professionals on the benefits of normal birth . "
the royal college of midwifery , which runs a uk-wide campaign to promote natural childbirth , says despite the challenges , good birth experiences can happen and intervention and caesarean should be the last choice , not the first .

on 12 october 2000 the river ouse broke its banks flooding 800 properties and causing more than £ 80m damage .
the mayor of lewes said work undertaken since 2000 had defended one housing estate , but no shops or businesses .
but the environment agency said £ 3m had gone on massively reinforcing defences which were now far better than required for the flooding levels seen in 2000 .
district councillor and town mayor , jim daly said : " where they have defended , it does n't affect the actual town , just one housing estate .
" for the shops and businesses they 've not put in any defence at all . "
none of this town is undefended " peter midgeley environment agency " it makes me very angry - it 's a typical case of the government spending a lot of money , but not that little bit extra that would complete the job . "
peter midgley , environment agency spokesman , said : " the centre of lewes lies flat in the river 's flood plain , which means there is always going to be a risk .
" people who live here have to listen to the weather forecasts and flood warnings and take action . "
he said defences to the north east of the town had been massively reinforced , and were " far better than the standard required for the flooding five years ago " .
he added : " development proposals are going to take place in the north west of the town .
" we have refurbished the rest of the defences at the same time as building many more defences down on our coast where there are massive risks to people and property .
" none of this town is undefended .
the defences for most of the town are right up to the standard that they were five years ago and the worst-hit quadrant has defences that are much better . "
last month , calls for more action to minimise the risk of flooding in lewes came from insurers .

on 12 october 2000 the river ouse broke its banks flooding 800 properties and causing more than £ 80m damage .
the mayor of lewes said work undertaken since 2000 had defended one housing estate , but no shops or businesses .
but the environment agency said £ 3m had gone on massively reinforcing defences which were now far better than required for the flooding levels seen in 2000 .
district councillor and town mayor , jim daly said : " where they have defended , it does n't affect the actual town , just one housing estate .
" for the shops and businesses they 've not put in any defence at all .
none of this town is undefended peter midgeley environment agency " it makes me very angry - it 's a typical case of the government spending a lot of money , but not that little bit extra that would complete the job . "
peter midgley , environment agency spokesman , said : " the centre of lewes lies flat in the river 's flood plain , which means there is always going to be a risk .
" people who live here have to listen to the weather forecasts and flood warnings and take action . "
he said defences to the north east of the town had been massively reinforced , and were " far better than the standard required for the flooding five years ago " .
underwater dangers included strong currents and lifted drains he added : " development proposals are going to take place in the north west of the town .
" we have refurbished the rest of the defences at the same time as building many more defences down on our coast where there are massive risks to people and property .
" none of this town is undefended .
the defences for most of the town are right up to the standard that they were five years ago and the worst-hit quadrant has defences that are much better . "
last month , calls for more action to minimise the risk of flooding in lewes came from insurers .
the association of british insurers said government investment in defences had increased , but more action was needed .
director general stephen haddrill said that despite flood defence improvements , parts of the town still remained vulnerable .

on 12 october 2000 the river ouse broke its banks flooding 800 properties and causing more than £ 80m damage .
the mayor of lewes said work undertaken since 2000 had defended one housing estate , but no shops or businesses .
but the environment agency said £ 3m had gone on massively reinforcing defences which were now far better than required for the flooding levels seen in 2000 .
district councillor and town mayor , jim daly said : " where they have defended , it does n't affect the actual town , just one housing estate .
" for the shops and businesses they 've not put in any defence at all .
none of this town is undefended peter midgeley environment agency " it makes me very angry - it 's a typical case of the government spending a lot of money , but not that little bit extra that would complete the job . "
peter midgley , environment agency spokesman , said : " the centre of lewes lies flat in the river 's flood plain , which means there is always going to be a risk .
" people who live here have to listen to the weather forecasts and flood warnings and take action . "
he said defences to the north east of the town had been massively reinforced , and were " far better than the standard required for the flooding five years ago " .
underwater dangers included strong currents and lifted drains he added : " development proposals are going to take place in the north west of the town .
" we have refurbished the rest of the defences at the same time as building many more defences down on our coast where there are massive risks to people and property .
" none of this town is undefended .
the defences for most of the town are right up to the standard that they were five years ago and the worst-hit quadrant has defences that are much better . "
last month , calls for more action to minimise the risk of flooding in lewes came from insurers .
the association of british insurers said government investment in defences had increased , but more action was needed .
director general stephen haddrill said that despite flood defence improvements , parts of the town still remained vulnerable .

" it 's a totally selfish drug this crack .
it takes over your life . "
pete said he first started using cocaine when his marriage broke down eight years ago .
initially he was snorting the powdered form of the drug , but after a year he moved on to smoking crack cocaine .
part of the problem was how widely available the drug was , pete recalls .
" there were dealers everywhere , in pubs and clubs and even the social security office .
" it was on every corner .
you could get it by word of mouth . "
tough habit to beat another big factor was the drug 's addictiveness .
pete said he had misused other drugs in the past , including lsd , ecstasy and heroin , but he found crack particularly hard to come off .

it does n't take long at all .
" the cravings it produces are massive .
and you end up using it more frequently because the high is short-lasting , " he said .
when pete first tried to come off crack in the 1990s he had real difficulty finding help .
" initially , there were no services in place to deal with crack addiction .
" when you ca n't find the help you feel totally on your own and extremely isolated . "
opiates focus he says the existing services at that time were geared towards heroin and opiates .
drug services ' not up to crack ' " but now there is far more focus on crack cocaine as a specific problem , " he says .
" having this support is what helps .
without them you are on your own . "
he says he valued being able to talk with people who understood what it was like to be addicted to cocaine .
" it 's not just about developing coping mechanisms to deal with the physical and mental problems that go with addiction .
" it 's also about getting help with social things .
it 's addressing all the other issues that have piled up - you have not paid your rent or your bills . "

in just a few weeks ' time , it will unleash its great white hope of gaming , the xbox 360 , across the world .
but rolling out a next generation games console in the us , europe and japan virtually simultaneously is proving to be a greater challenge than anyone imagined .
" there 's a reason no-one has done this before and we are figuring that out , " said xbox marketing boss peter moore .
" if we knew what we were getting into , we might not have done it , " he admitted at a recent xbox event in amsterdam .
in the past console makers have staggered the release of a new machine , like sony did with the playstation portable .
the device first saw the light of day in japan , three months later in the us and almost a year later in europe .
booking 747s microsoft is trying to do something its rivals have never done and it has 2,500 people working hard to ensure the global launch goes according to plan .
we are going to have some disappointment with retailers and consumers j allard , xbox the software giant has spent millions on its current xbox , trying to build a foothold in a space dominated by sony 's playstation 2 .
by making sure its new xbox 360 is out months ahead of sony 's playstation 3 , microsoft is hoping to win over the wallets and thumbs of gamers .
the downside has been a rush to get the console , the games and the online support ready for the 22 november launch in the us , and in europe for 2 december and japan for 10 december .
" we 're going to ship all around the world ; how we 're going to do that , i do n't know , " said mr moore .
" we 're going to rent every 747 we can find . "
the xbox team admit that despite their best efforts , there will be some logistic issues around getting enough machines into the shops .
" no matter how big the number is , we are going to sell out , " said xbox supremo j allard .
" we are going to have some disappointment with retailers and consumers . "
shooting , racing and sports still , a games console is only as good as the games available for it .
the sci-fi shooter halo became the reason to buy the original xbox and the playstation 2 was largely helped by the exclusive grand theft auto series of games .
project gotham racing 3 promises photo-realistic graphics so microsoft needs to persuade gamers that it is worth paying between $ 299- $ 399 -lrb- £ 209- £ 279 in the uk -rrb- to enter the world of next generation gaming .
at the x05 showcase event last week , microsoft showed off some of the games coming for the 360 , including its three flagship titles , perfect dark zero , project gotham racing 3 and kameo .
but as the launch deadline nears , the xbox team can not guarantee that these key games will be in the shops on the day the 360 goes on sale .
" i 'm hoping it will happen , " said mr allard .
" if something 's not ready we 'll hold it back .
" these games are not far from being done , and if they 're three weeks after the launch or they 're on launch day i do n't think it makes a significant difference . "
certifying games the problem for microsoft is that some of the big names in the business are reluctant to rush out a game as they do not want to damage a franchise with a product that does not live up to expectations .
fifa 06 for the 360 is due out for christmas this is one of the reasons why leading french game maker ubisoft has just delayed the tom clancy ghost recon game for the 360 until february next year .
microsoft can draw some consolation from the support of games giant electronic arts which has promised five games for the holiday season , including versions of its best-selling fifa , burnout and madden games .
the next few weeks will be crucial , as the new games are tested to see if they are ready to go .
" games will arrive with a thousand bugs and get into the certification process , " explained mr moore .
" they make it or they do n't .
it 's no big deal if a game takes another week .
the consumer will get a strong line-up . "

several front page headlines of wednesday 's papers are given over to criticism , from mps , pressure groups and the newspapers themselves .
bbc director general mark thompson says the rise would fund the switch-over to digital tv and bbc on-demand services .
the corporation is to present its bid for the next licence fee settlement to a house of commons select committee .
' greedy ' if the government accepts the bbc 's proposal , the fee would rise by £ 3.14 per year until 2013 , not including inflation .
the current fee is £ 126.50 .
this provoked headline figures of £ 180 in the daily mirror and £ 200 in the daily telegraph , with the daily express asking whether a service funded by the licence fee is still needed .
the times talks about " greedy auntie " bbc , while other papers - the sun and the independent - report on the furious reaction by some mps to the request .
theresa may , shadow secretary for culture , media and sport said the bbc 's proposals amounted to a " stealth tax " and said the corporation was making the increase " without making sufficient savings elsewhere " .
the bbc says it needs an extra £ 5.5bn over the next seven years to pay for more original programmes , new digital and local services and increased costs .
viewers ' groups have also spoken out .
jocelyn hay , chairwoman of the voice of the listener and viewer group told the times it was " totally wrong " for licence payers to " meet the additional cost of bringing a highly desirable social benefit of a kind which has traditionally been paid for out of general taxation " .
help the aged spokesman said many elderly people would be unable to meet the increase .
cost of bbc plans content quality £ 1.6bn eg - cutting repeats digital services £ 1.2bn eg - tv and radio on internet -lrb- above -rrb- digital infrastructure £ 0.7bn eg - high definition tv local relevance £ 0.6bn eg - regional tv and radio base costs £ 1.4bn eg - sports rights bbc spending plans in detail the corporation says it can fund £ 3.9bn of the needed funds through cost-cutting measures and commercial profits .
but the proposed licence fee increase would fund the remaining £ 1.6bn.
" we know that licence fee payers find the licence fee a burden in their household costs , " mr thompson said .
" it is a bigger licence fee , but the bbc gives out of it bigger digital tv and digital radio services .
it is a big step towards digital britain . "
the corporation 's valuation kicks off negotiations that will eventually see the government set the new annual fee .
the current deal ends in april 2007 and the next will last for seven years .
the licence fee currently generates £ 2.94bn a year for the corporation .
digital switchover under the current deal , set in 2000 , the licence fee goes up by 1.5 % above inflation per year .

despite this , up to two-fifths -lrb- 41 % -rrb- are unaware of the threat , an agency survey suggests .
a sample of 1,022 people living in flood risk areas across england and wales were questioned .
devastating floods do happen here too baroness young flooding chaos after rains " although we 're unlikely to see flooding in the uk like that caused by the boxing day tsunami and hurricane katrina , there is still a significant flood threat here from extreme rainfall and coastal surges , " chief executive baroness young said .
" devastating floods do happen here too , like those in autumn 2000 and more recently in boscastle and carlisle . "
the floods of five years ago , during britain 's wettest autumn for 270 years , saw whole villages evacuated as more then 700 areas were battered by storms .
as many as 100,000 homes were damaged in some of the worst floods ever to hit the uk with a financial cost of more than £ 1.3bn.
hundreds rescued in august 2004 , much of the cornish village of boscastle was destroyed by a flash flood with residents being rescued from rooftops as cars were swept into the sea .

" the fact is , it could , we just do n't know when .
" people in this country can not afford to be complacent about flood risk . "

' emotional costs ' more than two-thirds -lrb- 69 % -rrb- of those surveyed by the agency said they were unlikely to take action to protect themselves and their property despite living in a flood risk area .
the research also suggests that only 7 % of people living in flood risk areas know how to get flood warnings and that one-third -lrb- 34 % -rrb- do not know if their buildings and content insurance covered flood damage .
and two-fifths -lrb- 42 % -rrb- admitted they would not know what to do if their property became flooded .

five million people in two million properties in england and wales live in flood risk areas .
despite this , up to two-fifths -lrb- 41 % -rrb- are unaware of the threat , an agency survey suggests .
a sample of 1,022 people living in flood risk areas across england and wales were questioned .
devastating floods do happen here too baroness young flooding chaos after rains " although we 're unlikely to see flooding in the uk like that caused by the boxing day tsunami and hurricane katrina , there is still a significant flood threat here from extreme rainfall and coastal surges , " chief executive baroness young said .
" devastating floods do happen here too , like those in autumn 2000 and more recently in boscastle and carlisle . "
the floods of five years ago , during britain 's wettest autumn for 270 years , saw whole villages evacuated as more then 700 areas were battered by storms .
as many as 100,000 homes were damaged in some of the worst floods ever to hit the uk with a financial cost of more than £ 1.3bn.
hundreds rescued in august 2004 , much of the cornish village of boscastle was destroyed by a flash flood with residents being rescued from rooftops as cars were swept into the sea .
and in january this year , three people died and hundreds had to be rescued in flood-ravaged carlisle .
" there 's a tendency for people to think ' it 'll never happen to me ' , " baroness young said .
" the fact is , it could , we just do n't know when .
" people in this country can not afford to be complacent about flood risk . "
on the fifth anniversary of the october 2000 floods , the environment agency is launching an advertising campaign urging the public to find out if they live or work in areas most at risk from flooding .
' emotional costs ' more than two-thirds -lrb- 69 % -rrb- of those surveyed by the agency said they were unlikely to take action to protect themselves and their property despite living in a flood risk area .
the research also suggests that only 7 % of people living in flood risk areas know how to get flood warnings and that one-third -lrb- 34 % -rrb- do not know if their buildings and content insurance covered flood damage .
and two-fifths -lrb- 42 % -rrb- admitted they would not know what to do if their property became flooded .
" we 're urging people to try to reduce the massive financial and emotional costs of flooding , " said baroness young .
" so the message is be prepared for flooding . "
