the numbers were officially reported , although a final vote count wo n't be published until monday afternoon .

" i 'm not going to pretend , i 'm a little bit sad , " he said .
" if i have disappointed anyone , i ask them to forgive me .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.10.2005 ozone hole could grow bigger than ever großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists still disagree on the stability of ozone layer levels ozone levels looked like they were stabilizing , but this year a bigger than normal hole could open above the south pole . the protective ozone layer over the earth has thinned to its lowest level ever , alarming scientists who believed it had begun to heal .
they ’ re warning that increased ozone loss is allowing additional harmful ultraviolet light to reach us and making us more vulnerable to sunburn , skin cancer and cataracts . about 20 kilometers -lrb- 12.4 miles -rrb- thick , the layer of ozone gas is like a giant umbrella 15 to 35 kilometers over the earth and like any good pair of sunglasses , it acts like a filter by blocking out most ultraviolet rays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a thin layer of ozone protects from numerous health problems the loss of ozone was discovered over the polar regions 20 years ago and has been closely watched ever since .
scientists continue to disagree about the causes and effects of the ozone level 's thinning , with some stating depletion levels have peaked . scientists divided on ozone depletion according to the united nations world meteorological organization 's latest bulletin , the seasonal hole above the south pole and antarctica is shrinking . " it is the third largest ever , more or less as one would expect from present levels of chlorine and bromine in the atmosphere , " geir braathen , the wmo 's top ozone expert , told reporters tuesday .
" it does n't look as if the ozone hole is going to get any bigger -lrb- in coming years -rrb- .
it seems like we have reached a plateau . " others scientists , such as frank jürgen diekmann of the european space agency , expect this year 's hole over the south pole to be the biggest ever , and doubt the danger is over . " if anything , the ozone concentration has stabilized , " he said .
" but especially in 2005 we ’ re expecting record ozone holes above the antarctic .
going on the latest data , we can ’ t say the danger is gone . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists can agree that levels seem to have stablized especially bad in south it ’ s been more than 18 years since 180 countries signed up to the montreal ozone protocol on reducing emissions of chlorofluorocarbons , -lrb- cfcs -rrb- , which up until then were considered indispensable chemicals for modern living . though there 's no actual " hole " in the ozone layer and only a slight thinning occurs over the rest of the world , climatic conditions are especially dangerous at the south pole .
it would take forty to fifty years for the ozone shield to recover completely - the same amount of time chlorofluorocarbons stay in the atmosphere . polar-stratospheric clouds , which form above the south pole when air masses can not mix in the dark winter months and end up collecting more and ore chlorine compounds , are struck by the southern spring 's sunlight from september to november .
that causes them to break into " radicals " that split ozone into an oxygen molecule and an oxygen atom , making it disappear . greenhouse gases dangerous in north these meteorological conditions can also be dangerous in the northern hemisphere , according to christoph brühl , of the max planck institute for chemistry in mainz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenhouse gasses like co2 endanger the northern hemisphere " the public is looking more and more at the antarctic in connection with the ozone hole , " he said .
" in principle though , the danger is just as great in the northern hemisphere , except that it does n't arise there every year because of various meteorological conditions . " greenhouse gas emissions can also influence the ozone , particularly in the northern hemisphere .
the gasses cool the upper stratosphere , the layer important for the formation of ozone .
if the layer gets too cold , a closed area similar to that over the south pole can form in winter , meaning air masses over the northern hemisphere can no longer exchange , damaging the ozone filter over europe , brühl explained . " up to now we 've always been lucky that the weather put an end to it in march , but that needn ’ t always be so , " he added .
" it could quite easily run into april and that would certainly raise the ultraviolet radiation into germany over the june level .

the numbers were officially reported , although a final vote count wo n't be published until monday afternoon . " mr chairman , mission accomplished , " kaczynski said at pis 's election evening in central warsaw , addressing his identical twin jaroslaw , who heads pis , and who last month refused the post of prime minister so as not to jeopardize his brother 's chances of being elected president . turnout for the in a run-off election was slightly more than 50 percent , up on the first round when it was less than 50 percent . last-minute win both of the presidential rivals cut their political teeth in the solidarity movement that in the 1980s helped poland shake off communism , but since then , they have moved apart ideologically . tusk 's civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- party embraced free-market liberalism and kaczynski a breed of polish conservatism that is close to the catholic church .

i did what i could . " he congratulated kaczynski and assured his supporters that , although he had not won the presidency , he and po would " watch over what 's most important of all : the freedom of each and every pole .
we will ensure that the state never wrongs anyone again . " gracious winner kaczynski extended an olive branch to tusk , saying : " he fought a splendid battle … " i ask our friends in po to quickly end talks on forming a government , " he said . kaczynski 's campaign mirrored his conservatism , his traditional catholicism , and played on poles ' nationalism and the social inequality that is still apparent in poland , despite the burgeoning economy since the country joined the european union last year .

" just as we saw in germany , people are scared of reforms . " his virulent anti-gay stance - he twice banned gay pride marches through warsaw - has won him support among poland 's conservative catholic voters .

they ’ re warning that increased ozone loss is allowing additional harmful ultraviolet light to reach us and making us more vulnerable to sunburn , skin cancer and cataracts . about 20 kilometers -lrb- 12.4 miles -rrb- thick , the layer of ozone gas is like a giant umbrella 15 to 35 kilometers over the earth and like any good pair of sunglasses , it acts like a filter by blocking out most ultraviolet rays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a thin layer of ozone protects from numerous health problems the loss of ozone was discovered over the polar regions 20 years ago and has been closely watched ever since .
scientists continue to disagree about the causes and effects of the ozone level 's thinning , with some stating depletion levels have peaked . scientists divided on ozone depletion according to the united nations world meteorological organization 's latest bulletin , the seasonal hole above the south pole and antarctica is shrinking . " it is the third largest ever , more or less as one would expect from present levels of chlorine and bromine in the atmosphere , " geir braathen , the wmo 's top ozone expert , told reporters tuesday .
" it does n't look as if the ozone hole is going to get any bigger -lrb- in coming years -rrb- .
it seems like we have reached a plateau . " others scientists , such as frank jürgen diekmann of the european space agency , expect this year 's hole over the south pole to be the biggest ever , and doubt the danger is over . " if anything , the ozone concentration has stabilized , " he said .
" but especially in 2005 we ’ re expecting record ozone holes above the antarctic .
going on the latest data , we can ’ t say the danger is gone . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists can agree that levels seem to have stablized especially bad in south it ’ s been more than 18 years since 180 countries signed up to the montreal ozone protocol on reducing emissions of chlorofluorocarbons , -lrb- cfcs -rrb- , which up until then were considered indispensable chemicals for modern living . though there 's no actual " hole " in the ozone layer and only a slight thinning occurs over the rest of the world , climatic conditions are especially dangerous at the south pole .
it would take forty to fifty years for the ozone shield to recover completely - the same amount of time chlorofluorocarbons stay in the atmosphere . polar-stratospheric clouds , which form above the south pole when air masses can not mix in the dark winter months and end up collecting more and ore chlorine compounds , are struck by the southern spring 's sunlight from september to november .
that causes them to break into " radicals " that split ozone into an oxygen molecule and an oxygen atom , making it disappear . greenhouse gases dangerous in north these meteorological conditions can also be dangerous in the northern hemisphere , according to christoph brühl , of the max planck institute for chemistry in mainz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenhouse gasses like co2 endanger the northern hemisphere " the public is looking more and more at the antarctic in connection with the ozone hole , " he said .
" in principle though , the danger is just as great in the northern hemisphere , except that it does n't arise there every year because of various meteorological conditions . " greenhouse gas emissions can also influence the ozone , particularly in the northern hemisphere .
the gasses cool the upper stratosphere , the layer important for the formation of ozone .
if the layer gets too cold , a closed area similar to that over the south pole can form in winter , meaning air masses over the northern hemisphere can no longer exchange , damaging the ozone filter over europe , brühl explained . " up to now we 've always been lucky that the weather put an end to it in march , but that needn ’ t always be so , " he added .
" it could quite easily run into april and that would certainly raise the ultraviolet radiation into germany over the june level .

they ’ re warning that increased ozone loss is allowing additional harmful ultraviolet light to reach us and making us more vulnerable to sunburn , skin cancer and cataracts . about 20 kilometers -lrb- 12.4 miles -rrb- thick , the layer of ozone gas is like a giant umbrella 15 to 35 kilometers over the earth and like any good pair of sunglasses , it acts like a filter by blocking out most ultraviolet rays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a thin layer of ozone protects from numerous health problems the loss of ozone was discovered over the polar regions 20 years ago and has been closely watched ever since .
scientists continue to disagree about the causes and effects of the ozone level 's thinning , with some stating depletion levels have peaked . scientists divided on ozone depletion according to the united nations world meteorological organization 's latest bulletin , the seasonal hole above the south pole and antarctica is shrinking . " it is the third largest ever , more or less as one would expect from present levels of chlorine and bromine in the atmosphere , " geir braathen , the wmo 's top ozone expert , told reporters tuesday .
" it does n't look as if the ozone hole is going to get any bigger -lrb- in coming years -rrb- .
it seems like we have reached a plateau . " others scientists , such as frank jürgen diekmann of the european space agency , expect this year 's hole over the south pole to be the biggest ever , and doubt the danger is over . " if anything , the ozone concentration has stabilized , " he said .
" but especially in 2005 we ’ re expecting record ozone holes above the antarctic .
going on the latest data , we can ’ t say the danger is gone . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists can agree that levels seem to have stablized especially bad in south it ’ s been more than 18 years since 180 countries signed up to the montreal ozone protocol on reducing emissions of chlorofluorocarbons , -lrb- cfcs -rrb- , which up until then were considered indispensable chemicals for modern living . though there 's no actual " hole " in the ozone layer and only a slight thinning occurs over the rest of the world , climatic conditions are especially dangerous at the south pole .
it would take forty to fifty years for the ozone shield to recover completely - the same amount of time chlorofluorocarbons stay in the atmosphere . polar-stratospheric clouds , which form above the south pole when air masses can not mix in the dark winter months and end up collecting more and ore chlorine compounds , are struck by the southern spring 's sunlight from september to november .
that causes them to break into " radicals " that split ozone into an oxygen molecule and an oxygen atom , making it disappear . greenhouse gases dangerous in north these meteorological conditions can also be dangerous in the northern hemisphere , according to christoph brühl , of the max planck institute for chemistry in mainz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenhouse gasses like co2 endanger the northern hemisphere " the public is looking more and more at the antarctic in connection with the ozone hole , " he said .
" in principle though , the danger is just as great in the northern hemisphere , except that it does n't arise there every year because of various meteorological conditions . " greenhouse gas emissions can also influence the ozone , particularly in the northern hemisphere .
the gasses cool the upper stratosphere , the layer important for the formation of ozone .
if the layer gets too cold , a closed area similar to that over the south pole can form in winter , meaning air masses over the northern hemisphere can no longer exchange , damaging the ozone filter over europe , brühl explained . " up to now we 've always been lucky that the weather put an end to it in march , but that needn ’ t always be so , " he added .
" it could quite easily run into april and that would certainly raise the ultraviolet radiation into germany over the june level .

" we , the people of the united nations … . "
these are the first words of the preamble of the un charter .
but while it all sounds very lofty , it does n't have anything to do with reality .
in fact , governments , not people make the big decisions regarding the world organization .
and only a portion of these governments are democratically elected . dictatorial regimes have been , and are now , among the mightiest countries , that is , the five permanent security council members whose veto power can condemn the united nations to passivity .
and even countries with freely elected governments do n't always accurately represent their populations ; think of britain 's tony blair and spain 's jose maria aznar voting in favor of the iraq war , although the majority of their countrymen and women opposed it vehemently . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a vote at the un security council the first sentence of the preamble sums up the discrepancies that have plagued the united nations since it was founded 60 years ago .
during the cold war , the security council could only rarely fulfill its intended function : to provide for peace and security in the world .
true , blue-helmeted un peacekeepers have frequently played a role in bringing peace to a region in the aftermath of armed conflict .
but the key word here is " aftermath . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.10.2005 new polish president sends worrying signals großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech kaczynski 's victory has n't exactly reassured europe lech kaczynski , winner of poland 's presidential poll , has taken a tough foreign-policy line toward neighboring germany .
should berlin be worried ?
dw-world spoke to poland expert dieter bingen . the surprise winner of poland 's runoff presidential election on sunday , 56-year-old lech kaczynski of the conservative law and justice party -lrb- pis -rrb- has ruffled feathers by adopting a nationalistic tone during the election campaign , in particular signaling a tougher approach towards germany and russia . dw-world spoke to dieter bingen , head of the german-poland institute in darmstadt about what the election of the populist leader might mean for future ties between berlin and warsaw . dw-world : what have the poles voted for with lech kaczynski 's victory in the presidential runoff election on sunday ? dieter bingen : the poles have voted in favor of the promise to care more for the social concerns of the losers in society - a state with a heart so to speak - and for the promise that corruption and nepotism will be done away with .
in addition , they voted for kaczynski 's vow to pursue a stronger line in dealing with the communist past and the beneficiaries of the regime after 1990 . the media in germany is talking about a " shift towards right-wing attitudes " and that kaczynski is an anti-semite ?
how do you see it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech kaczynski speaks to supporters after his victory that 's absurd .
lech kaczynski is in no way an anti-semite .
he did get the support of groups and parties who have anti-semitic tendencies - he did take that into account , but he 's not anti-semitic himself though he does play on traditional national hostile stereotypes . and kaczynski 's election ca n't really be described unambiguously as a shift toward right-wing attitudes either .
kaczynski also has strong social aspects , particularly when it comes to the economy he 's rather left-leaning and he 's shown himself to be in favor of a welfare state .
these are elements that he courted very consciously in order to lure away a group of voters who supported the left-wing candidate in the first election phase .
thus he 's more structurally conservative if you will , and in an ideal sense paternalistic when it comes to values and also patriotic . what ramifications will the new situation in poland have for germany ? we 'll have to - at least initially - brace ourselves for some unpleasant situations and reckon with some emotional rhetoric that will question poland 's partnership with germany and in particular warsaw 's political relationship with germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and donald tusk in poland in august , 2005 donald tusk -lrb- of the pro-market civic platform who lost the presidential election to lech kaczynski -rrb- and angela merkel -lrb- germany 's new chancellor-designate -rrb- had already made common plans for the future .
do you think there will be any parallels between kaczynski and other parties in germany ? no , kaczynski did n't seek any contacts at all in germany .
he has no experience with foreign affairs and never gave it much importance . and , what does the new situation in poland mean for europe ? poland 's commitment to european integration in the eu 's political arena will probably not be promoted as much and there 's a danger that poland will isolate and marginalize itself .
poland will probably not pursue an active european policy , but will orient itself much more strongly towards the us . at the same time , that may be simply demonstrative and symbolic and things may appear different when it comes implementation - one has to make a distinction here between the heat of the election campaign and real politics . poland has after all profited from its membership in the eu , particularly its farmers .
does that mean that things wo n't fundamentally change with regard to economic and political ties ? precisely .
poland must have an interest in having allies in germany and not isolate itself in crucial looming budget talks .
if poland is n't constructive there , it can lose out badly . so , atmospherically there will be tensions between poland and germany but eventually we have to wait and see what happens next .
it 's all open .
the civic platform as a coalition partner must ensure that the worst fears do n't become reality . the interview was conducted by pablo kummetz -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conservative kaczynski wins polish election poland on sunday elected the conservative , staunchly catholic lech kaczynski president by a definitive margin , bucking pre-vote surveys that had given his liberal rival the lead .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.10.2005 conservative kaczynski wins polish election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warsaw mayor kaczynski beat the odds in a last minute victory poland on sunday elected the conservative , staunchly catholic lech kaczynski president by a definitive margin , bucking pre-vote surveys that had given his liberal rival the lead . kaczynski , of the law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party , garnered 55 percent of the vote compared with 45 percent for his liberal , europe-friendly opponent , donald tusk .
the numbers were officially reported , although a final vote count wo n't be published until monday afternoon . " mr chairman , mission accomplished , " kaczynski said at pis 's election evening in central warsaw , addressing his identical twin jaroslaw , who heads pis , and who last month refused the post of prime minister so as not to jeopardize his brother 's chances of being elected president . turnout for the in a run-off election was slightly more than 50 percent , up on the first round when it was less than 50 percent . last-minute win both of the presidential rivals cut their political teeth in the solidarity movement that in the 1980s helped poland shake off communism , but since then , they have moved apart ideologically . tusk 's civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- party embraced free-market liberalism and kaczynski a breed of polish conservatism that is close to the catholic church .
in the case of his pis party , it favors state intervention in the economy and social aid for the underprivileged . kaczynski 's victory mirrored what happened to his party in last month 's parliamentary election , when it pulled ahead of its opponents in the final straight to finish strongest , winning the right to choose poland 's next prime minister . pre-election polls had predicted since july that tusk would win , and showed the liberal in the lead up until the vote , although that lead had diminished by late friday . tusk lacked ' concept ' " tusk lost because of the mistakes he made in the final week of campaigning : there was no clear concept , and less activity at his headquarters , " said mikolaj czesnik , a political scientist from poland 's institute of sciences . at po 's decidedly more sombre election evening , tusk made no attempt to conceal his disappointment at losing . " i 'm not going to pretend , i 'm a little bit sad , " he said .
" if i have disappointed anyone , i ask them to forgive me .
i did what i could . " he congratulated kaczynski and assured his supporters that , although he had not won the presidency , he and po would " watch over what 's most important of all : the freedom of each and every pole .
we will ensure that the state never wrongs anyone again . " gracious winner kaczynski extended an olive branch to tusk , saying : " he fought a splendid battle … " i ask our friends in po to quickly end talks on forming a government , " he said . kaczynski 's campaign mirrored his conservatism , his traditional catholicism , and played on poles ' nationalism and the social inequality that is still apparent in poland , despite the burgeoning economy since the country joined the european union last year . " lech kaczynski waged a fear-factor campaign in the past few weeks , and he succeeded in scaring people , " said political analyst cornelius ochmann , from germany 's bertelsmann foundation .
" just as we saw in germany , people are scared of reforms . " his virulent anti-gay stance - he twice banned gay pride marches through warsaw - has won him support among poland 's conservative catholic voters .
poland 's next president - the third to be freely elected since the end of communism in 1989 - is to be sworn in on december 23 , when aleksander kwasniewski , who has held the office for two terms , stands down . dw staff / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former solidarity allies prepare for polish election battle two weeks after they finished neck and neck in the first round of poland 's presidential election , former comrades in arms donald tusk and lech kaczynski , are to face off sunday in a decisive vote for the presidency .

they ’ re warning that increased ozone loss is allowing additional harmful ultraviolet light to reach us and making us more vulnerable to sunburn , skin cancer and cataracts . about 20 kilometers -lrb- 12.4 miles -rrb- thick , the layer of ozone gas is like a giant umbrella 15 to 35 kilometers over the earth and like any good pair of sunglasses , it acts like a filter by blocking out most ultraviolet rays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a thin layer of ozone protects from numerous health problems the loss of ozone was discovered over the polar regions 20 years ago and has been closely watched ever since .
scientists continue to disagree about the causes and effects of the ozone level 's thinning , with some stating depletion levels have peaked . scientists divided on ozone depletion according to the united nations world meteorological organization 's latest bulletin , the seasonal hole above the south pole and antarctica is shrinking . " it is the third largest ever , more or less as one would expect from present levels of chlorine and bromine in the atmosphere , " geir braathen , the wmo 's top ozone expert , told reporters tuesday .
" it does n't look as if the ozone hole is going to get any bigger -lrb- in coming years -rrb- .
it seems like we have reached a plateau . " others scientists , such as frank jürgen diekmann of the european space agency , expect this year 's hole over the south pole to be the biggest ever , and doubt the danger is over . " if anything , the ozone concentration has stabilized , " he said .
" but especially in 2005 we ’ re expecting record ozone holes above the antarctic .
going on the latest data , we can ’ t say the danger is gone . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists can agree that levels seem to have stablized especially bad in south it ’ s been more than 18 years since 180 countries signed up to the montreal ozone protocol on reducing emissions of chlorofluorocarbons , -lrb- cfcs -rrb- , which up until then were considered indispensable chemicals for modern living . though there 's no actual " hole " in the ozone layer and only a slight thinning occurs over the rest of the world , climatic conditions are especially dangerous at the south pole .
it would take forty to fifty years for the ozone shield to recover completely - the same amount of time chlorofluorocarbons stay in the atmosphere . polar-stratospheric clouds , which form above the south pole when air masses can not mix in the dark winter months and end up collecting more and ore chlorine compounds , are struck by the southern spring 's sunlight from september to november .
that causes them to break into " radicals " that split ozone into an oxygen molecule and an oxygen atom , making it disappear . greenhouse gases dangerous in north these meteorological conditions can also be dangerous in the northern hemisphere , according to christoph brühl , of the max planck institute for chemistry in mainz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenhouse gasses like co2 endanger the northern hemisphere " the public is looking more and more at the antarctic in connection with the ozone hole , " he said .
" in principle though , the danger is just as great in the northern hemisphere , except that it does n't arise there every year because of various meteorological conditions . " greenhouse gas emissions can also influence the ozone , particularly in the northern hemisphere .
the gasses cool the upper stratosphere , the layer important for the formation of ozone .

they ’ re warning that increased ozone loss is allowing additional harmful ultraviolet light to reach us and making us more vulnerable to sunburn , skin cancer and cataracts . about 20 kilometers -lrb- 12.4 miles -rrb- thick , the layer of ozone gas is like a giant umbrella 15 to 35 kilometers over the earth and like any good pair of sunglasses , it acts like a filter by blocking out most ultraviolet rays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a thin layer of ozone protects from numerous health problems the loss of ozone was discovered over the polar regions 20 years ago and has been closely watched ever since .
scientists continue to disagree about the causes and effects of the ozone level 's thinning , with some stating depletion levels have peaked . scientists divided on ozone depletion according to the united nations world meteorological organization 's latest bulletin , the seasonal hole above the south pole and antarctica is shrinking . " it is the third largest ever , more or less as one would expect from present levels of chlorine and bromine in the atmosphere , " geir braathen , the wmo 's top ozone expert , told reporters tuesday .
" it does n't look as if the ozone hole is going to get any bigger -lrb- in coming years -rrb- .
it seems like we have reached a plateau . " others scientists , such as frank jürgen diekmann of the european space agency , expect this year 's hole over the south pole to be the biggest ever , and doubt the danger is over . " if anything , the ozone concentration has stabilized , " he said .
" but especially in 2005 we ’ re expecting record ozone holes above the antarctic .
going on the latest data , we can ’ t say the danger is gone . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists can agree that levels seem to have stablized especially bad in south it ’ s been more than 18 years since 180 countries signed up to the montreal ozone protocol on reducing emissions of chlorofluorocarbons , -lrb- cfcs -rrb- , which up until then were considered indispensable chemicals for modern living . though there 's no actual " hole " in the ozone layer and only a slight thinning occurs over the rest of the world , climatic conditions are especially dangerous at the south pole .
it would take forty to fifty years for the ozone shield to recover completely - the same amount of time chlorofluorocarbons stay in the atmosphere . polar-stratospheric clouds , which form above the south pole when air masses can not mix in the dark winter months and end up collecting more and ore chlorine compounds , are struck by the southern spring 's sunlight from september to november .
that causes them to break into " radicals " that split ozone into an oxygen molecule and an oxygen atom , making it disappear . greenhouse gases dangerous in north these meteorological conditions can also be dangerous in the northern hemisphere , according to christoph brühl , of the max planck institute for chemistry in mainz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenhouse gasses like co2 endanger the northern hemisphere " the public is looking more and more at the antarctic in connection with the ozone hole , " he said .
" in principle though , the danger is just as great in the northern hemisphere , except that it does n't arise there every year because of various meteorological conditions . " greenhouse gas emissions can also influence the ozone , particularly in the northern hemisphere .
the gasses cool the upper stratosphere , the layer important for the formation of ozone .
if the layer gets too cold , a closed area similar to that over the south pole can form in winter , meaning air masses over the northern hemisphere can no longer exchange , damaging the ozone filter over europe , brühl explained . " up to now we 've always been lucky that the weather put an end to it in march , but that needn ’ t always be so , " he added .

" we , the people of the united nations … . "
these are the first words of the preamble of the un charter .
but while it all sounds very lofty , it does n't have anything to do with reality .
in fact , governments , not people make the big decisions regarding the world organization .
and only a portion of these governments are democratically elected . dictatorial regimes have been , and are now , among the mightiest countries , that is , the five permanent security council members whose veto power can condemn the united nations to passivity .
and even countries with freely elected governments do n't always accurately represent their populations ; think of britain 's tony blair and spain 's jose maria aznar voting in favor of the iraq war , although the majority of their countrymen and women opposed it vehemently . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a vote at the un security council the first sentence of the preamble sums up the discrepancies that have plagued the united nations since it was founded 60 years ago .
during the cold war , the security council could only rarely fulfill its intended function : to provide for peace and security in the world .
true , blue-helmeted un peacekeepers have frequently played a role in bringing peace to a region in the aftermath of armed conflict .
but the key word here is " aftermath . "
in the vast majority of cases - think korea and vietnam - the united nations has been unable to prevent the outbreak of war .
in rwanda , the organization stood by as genocide took place before the eyes of the world . iraq as example it may be worth noting that , since the end of the east-west conflict in the late 1980s , the use of vetoes by the un security council has tended toward zero .
but the latest example , iraq , shows that the highest un committee can only stop armed conflict from occurring when all of the permanent members want to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general kofi annan addressing the general assembly if un secretary general kofi annan had his way , the organization would undergo reforms in this , its 60th year of existence , bringing it up to date with the 21st century .
but annan 's agenda was thoroughly diluted at the united nations summit in mid-september .
the famed " millennium goals " were approved - who would dare oppose fighting poverty and disease ? - but when it came to financing development aid , the countries once again left matters as nonbinding as possible .
furthermore , security council reform was again delayed amid discord .
and members skirted the issue of actually coming up with an official decision on what constitutes terrorism . forum for ideas once again , it became clear how difficult it is to agree on the future of the united nations .
anyone who dreams of a capable and competent world governing body can only be disappointed by the united nations .
a better option would be to view the united nations in a humbler light .
there are , in fact , areas where the organization gets the job done : the human rights charter , sub-organizations - such as the united nations children 's fund -lrb- unicef -rrb- - and international courts of law represent development milestones .
un organizations have repeatedly won the nobel peace prize , and with good reason .
this year the honor went to the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- and its chief , mohammed elbaradei .
in terms of world peace , though , the united nations is above all a form for exchanging ideas .
in certain cases concrete peace measures are undertaken .
but in the end , the un is n't responsible for bringing peace to the world - that is the job of the 191 member states . klaus dahmann -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe , us bicker over development aid members of the european union have called on the united states to commit itself to the fight against poverty and provide more money with fewer restrictions to the developing world .

should berlin be worried ?
dw-world spoke to poland expert dieter bingen . the surprise winner of poland 's runoff presidential election on sunday , 56-year-old lech kaczynski of the conservative law and justice party -lrb- pis -rrb- has ruffled feathers by adopting a nationalistic tone during the election campaign , in particular signaling a tougher approach towards germany and russia . dw-world spoke to dieter bingen , head of the german-poland institute in darmstadt about what the election of the populist leader might mean for future ties between berlin and warsaw . dw-world : what have the poles voted for with lech kaczynski 's victory in the presidential runoff election on sunday ? dieter bingen : the poles have voted in favor of the promise to care more for the social concerns of the losers in society - a state with a heart so to speak - and for the promise that corruption and nepotism will be done away with .
in addition , they voted for kaczynski 's vow to pursue a stronger line in dealing with the communist past and the beneficiaries of the regime after 1990 . the media in germany is talking about a " shift towards right-wing attitudes " and that kaczynski is an anti-semite ?
how do you see it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech kaczynski speaks to supporters after his victory that 's absurd .
lech kaczynski is in no way an anti-semite .
he did get the support of groups and parties who have anti-semitic tendencies - he did take that into account , but he 's not anti-semitic himself though he does play on traditional national hostile stereotypes . and kaczynski 's election ca n't really be described unambiguously as a shift toward right-wing attitudes either .
kaczynski also has strong social aspects , particularly when it comes to the economy he 's rather left-leaning and he 's shown himself to be in favor of a welfare state .
these are elements that he courted very consciously in order to lure away a group of voters who supported the left-wing candidate in the first election phase .
thus he 's more structurally conservative if you will , and in an ideal sense paternalistic when it comes to values and also patriotic . what ramifications will the new situation in poland have for germany ? we 'll have to - at least initially - brace ourselves for some unpleasant situations and reckon with some emotional rhetoric that will question poland 's partnership with germany and in particular warsaw 's political relationship with germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and donald tusk in poland in august , 2005 donald tusk -lrb- of the pro-market civic platform who lost the presidential election to lech kaczynski -rrb- and angela merkel -lrb- germany 's new chancellor-designate -rrb- had already made common plans for the future .
do you think there will be any parallels between kaczynski and other parties in germany ? no , kaczynski did n't seek any contacts at all in germany .
he has no experience with foreign affairs and never gave it much importance . and , what does the new situation in poland mean for europe ? poland 's commitment to european integration in the eu 's political arena will probably not be promoted as much and there 's a danger that poland will isolate and marginalize itself .
poland will probably not pursue an active european policy , but will orient itself much more strongly towards the us . at the same time , that may be simply demonstrative and symbolic and things may appear different when it comes implementation - one has to make a distinction here between the heat of the election campaign and real politics . poland has after all profited from its membership in the eu , particularly its farmers .
does that mean that things wo n't fundamentally change with regard to economic and political ties ? precisely .
poland must have an interest in having allies in germany and not isolate itself in crucial looming budget talks .
if poland is n't constructive there , it can lose out badly . so , atmospherically there will be tensions between poland and germany but eventually we have to wait and see what happens next .
it 's all open .
the civic platform as a coalition partner must ensure that the worst fears do n't become reality . the interview was conducted by pablo kummetz -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conservative kaczynski wins polish election poland on sunday elected the conservative , staunchly catholic lech kaczynski president by a definitive margin , bucking pre-vote surveys that had given his liberal rival the lead .

the numbers were officially reported , although a final vote count wo n't be published until monday afternoon . " mr chairman , mission accomplished , " kaczynski said at pis 's election evening in central warsaw , addressing his identical twin jaroslaw , who heads pis , and who last month refused the post of prime minister so as not to jeopardize his brother 's chances of being elected president . turnout for the in a run-off election was slightly more than 50 percent , up on the first round when it was less than 50 percent . last-minute win both of the presidential rivals cut their political teeth in the solidarity movement that in the 1980s helped poland shake off communism , but since then , they have moved apart ideologically . tusk 's civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- party embraced free-market liberalism and kaczynski a breed of polish conservatism that is close to the catholic church .
in the case of his pis party , it favors state intervention in the economy and social aid for the underprivileged . kaczynski 's victory mirrored what happened to his party in last month 's parliamentary election , when it pulled ahead of its opponents in the final straight to finish strongest , winning the right to choose poland 's next prime minister . pre-election polls had predicted since july that tusk would win , and showed the liberal in the lead up until the vote , although that lead had diminished by late friday . tusk lacked ' concept ' " tusk lost because of the mistakes he made in the final week of campaigning : there was no clear concept , and less activity at his headquarters , " said mikolaj czesnik , a political scientist from poland 's institute of sciences . at po 's decidedly more sombre election evening , tusk made no attempt to conceal his disappointment at losing . " i 'm not going to pretend , i 'm a little bit sad , " he said .
" if i have disappointed anyone , i ask them to forgive me .
i did what i could . " he congratulated kaczynski and assured his supporters that , although he had not won the presidency , he and po would " watch over what 's most important of all : the freedom of each and every pole .
we will ensure that the state never wrongs anyone again . " gracious winner kaczynski extended an olive branch to tusk , saying : " he fought a splendid battle … " i ask our friends in po to quickly end talks on forming a government , " he said . kaczynski 's campaign mirrored his conservatism , his traditional catholicism , and played on poles ' nationalism and the social inequality that is still apparent in poland , despite the burgeoning economy since the country joined the european union last year . " lech kaczynski waged a fear-factor campaign in the past few weeks , and he succeeded in scaring people , " said political analyst cornelius ochmann , from germany 's bertelsmann foundation .
" just as we saw in germany , people are scared of reforms . " his virulent anti-gay stance - he twice banned gay pride marches through warsaw - has won him support among poland 's conservative catholic voters .
poland 's next president - the third to be freely elected since the end of communism in 1989 - is to be sworn in on december 23 , when aleksander kwasniewski , who has held the office for two terms , stands down . dw staff / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former solidarity allies prepare for polish election battle two weeks after they finished neck and neck in the first round of poland 's presidential election , former comrades in arms donald tusk and lech kaczynski , are to face off sunday in a decisive vote for the presidency .

" mr chairman , mission accomplished , " kaczynski said at pis 's election evening in central warsaw , addressing his identical twin jaroslaw , who heads pis , and who last month refused the post of prime minister so as not to jeopardize his brother 's chances of being elected president . turnout for the in a run-off election was slightly more than 50 percent , up on the first round when it was less than 50 percent . last-minute win both of the presidential rivals cut their political teeth in the solidarity movement that in the 1980s helped poland shake off communism , but since then , they have moved apart ideologically . tusk 's civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- party embraced free-market liberalism and kaczynski a breed of polish conservatism that is close to the catholic church .
in the case of his pis party , it favors state intervention in the economy and social aid for the underprivileged . kaczynski 's victory mirrored what happened to his party in last month 's parliamentary election , when it pulled ahead of its opponents in the final straight to finish strongest , winning the right to choose poland 's next prime minister . pre-election polls had predicted since july that tusk would win , and showed the liberal in the lead up until the vote , although that lead had diminished by late friday . tusk lacked ' concept ' " tusk lost because of the mistakes he made in the final week of campaigning : there was no clear concept , and less activity at his headquarters , " said mikolaj czesnik , a political scientist from poland 's institute of sciences . at po 's decidedly more sombre election evening , tusk made no attempt to conceal his disappointment at losing . " i 'm not going to pretend , i 'm a little bit sad , " he said .
" if i have disappointed anyone , i ask them to forgive me .
i did what i could . " he congratulated kaczynski and assured his supporters that , although he had not won the presidency , he and po would " watch over what 's most important of all : the freedom of each and every pole .
we will ensure that the state never wrongs anyone again . " gracious winner kaczynski extended an olive branch to tusk , saying : " he fought a splendid battle … " i ask our friends in po to quickly end talks on forming a government , " he said . kaczynski 's campaign mirrored his conservatism , his traditional catholicism , and played on poles ' nationalism and the social inequality that is still apparent in poland , despite the burgeoning economy since the country joined the european union last year . " lech kaczynski waged a fear-factor campaign in the past few weeks , and he succeeded in scaring people , " said political analyst cornelius ochmann , from germany 's bertelsmann foundation .
" just as we saw in germany , people are scared of reforms . " his virulent anti-gay stance - he twice banned gay pride marches through warsaw - has won him support among poland 's conservative catholic voters .
poland 's next president - the third to be freely elected since the end of communism in 1989 - is to be sworn in on december 23 , when aleksander kwasniewski , who has held the office for two terms , stands down . dw staff / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former solidarity allies prepare for polish election battle two weeks after they finished neck and neck in the first round of poland 's presidential election , former comrades in arms donald tusk and lech kaczynski , are to face off sunday in a decisive vote for the presidency .

they ’ re warning that increased ozone loss is allowing additional harmful ultraviolet light to reach us and making us more vulnerable to sunburn , skin cancer and cataracts . about 20 kilometers -lrb- 12.4 miles -rrb- thick , the layer of ozone gas is like a giant umbrella 15 to 35 kilometers over the earth and like any good pair of sunglasses , it acts like a filter by blocking out most ultraviolet rays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a thin layer of ozone protects from numerous health problems the loss of ozone was discovered over the polar regions 20 years ago and has been closely watched ever since .
scientists continue to disagree about the causes and effects of the ozone level 's thinning , with some stating depletion levels have peaked . scientists divided on ozone depletion according to the united nations world meteorological organization 's latest bulletin , the seasonal hole above the south pole and antarctica is shrinking . " it is the third largest ever , more or less as one would expect from present levels of chlorine and bromine in the atmosphere , " geir braathen , the wmo 's top ozone expert , told reporters tuesday .
" it does n't look as if the ozone hole is going to get any bigger -lrb- in coming years -rrb- .
it seems like we have reached a plateau . " others scientists , such as frank jürgen diekmann of the european space agency , expect this year 's hole over the south pole to be the biggest ever , and doubt the danger is over . " if anything , the ozone concentration has stabilized , " he said .
" but especially in 2005 we ’ re expecting record ozone holes above the antarctic .
going on the latest data , we can ’ t say the danger is gone . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists can agree that levels seem to have stablized especially bad in south it ’ s been more than 18 years since 180 countries signed up to the montreal ozone protocol on reducing emissions of chlorofluorocarbons , -lrb- cfcs -rrb- , which up until then were considered indispensable chemicals for modern living . though there 's no actual " hole " in the ozone layer and only a slight thinning occurs over the rest of the world , climatic conditions are especially dangerous at the south pole .
it would take forty to fifty years for the ozone shield to recover completely - the same amount of time chlorofluorocarbons stay in the atmosphere . polar-stratospheric clouds , which form above the south pole when air masses can not mix in the dark winter months and end up collecting more and ore chlorine compounds , are struck by the southern spring 's sunlight from september to november .
that causes them to break into " radicals " that split ozone into an oxygen molecule and an oxygen atom , making it disappear . greenhouse gases dangerous in north these meteorological conditions can also be dangerous in the northern hemisphere , according to christoph brühl , of the max planck institute for chemistry in mainz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenhouse gasses like co2 endanger the northern hemisphere " the public is looking more and more at the antarctic in connection with the ozone hole , " he said .
" in principle though , the danger is just as great in the northern hemisphere , except that it does n't arise there every year because of various meteorological conditions . " greenhouse gas emissions can also influence the ozone , particularly in the northern hemisphere .
the gasses cool the upper stratosphere , the layer important for the formation of ozone .
if the layer gets too cold , a closed area similar to that over the south pole can form in winter , meaning air masses over the northern hemisphere can no longer exchange , damaging the ozone filter over europe , brühl explained . " up to now we 've always been lucky that the weather put an end to it in march , but that needn ’ t always be so , " he added .
" it could quite easily run into april and that would certainly raise the ultraviolet radiation into germany over the june level .

should berlin be worried ?
dw-world spoke to poland expert dieter bingen . the surprise winner of poland 's runoff presidential election on sunday , 56-year-old lech kaczynski of the conservative law and justice party -lrb- pis -rrb- has ruffled feathers by adopting a nationalistic tone during the election campaign , in particular signaling a tougher approach towards germany and russia . dw-world spoke to dieter bingen , head of the german-poland institute in darmstadt about what the election of the populist leader might mean for future ties between berlin and warsaw . dw-world : what have the poles voted for with lech kaczynski 's victory in the presidential runoff election on sunday ? dieter bingen : the poles have voted in favor of the promise to care more for the social concerns of the losers in society - a state with a heart so to speak - and for the promise that corruption and nepotism will be done away with .
in addition , they voted for kaczynski 's vow to pursue a stronger line in dealing with the communist past and the beneficiaries of the regime after 1990 . the media in germany is talking about a " shift towards right-wing attitudes " and that kaczynski is an anti-semite ?
how do you see it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech kaczynski speaks to supporters after his victory that 's absurd .
lech kaczynski is in no way an anti-semite .
he did get the support of groups and parties who have anti-semitic tendencies - he did take that into account , but he 's not anti-semitic himself though he does play on traditional national hostile stereotypes . and kaczynski 's election ca n't really be described unambiguously as a shift toward right-wing attitudes either .
kaczynski also has strong social aspects , particularly when it comes to the economy he 's rather left-leaning and he 's shown himself to be in favor of a welfare state .
these are elements that he courted very consciously in order to lure away a group of voters who supported the left-wing candidate in the first election phase .
thus he 's more structurally conservative if you will , and in an ideal sense paternalistic when it comes to values and also patriotic . what ramifications will the new situation in poland have for germany ? we 'll have to - at least initially - brace ourselves for some unpleasant situations and reckon with some emotional rhetoric that will question poland 's partnership with germany and in particular warsaw 's political relationship with germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and donald tusk in poland in august , 2005 donald tusk -lrb- of the pro-market civic platform who lost the presidential election to lech kaczynski -rrb- and angela merkel -lrb- germany 's new chancellor-designate -rrb- had already made common plans for the future .
do you think there will be any parallels between kaczynski and other parties in germany ? no , kaczynski did n't seek any contacts at all in germany .
he has no experience with foreign affairs and never gave it much importance . and , what does the new situation in poland mean for europe ? poland 's commitment to european integration in the eu 's political arena will probably not be promoted as much and there 's a danger that poland will isolate and marginalize itself .
poland will probably not pursue an active european policy , but will orient itself much more strongly towards the us . at the same time , that may be simply demonstrative and symbolic and things may appear different when it comes implementation - one has to make a distinction here between the heat of the election campaign and real politics . poland has after all profited from its membership in the eu , particularly its farmers .
does that mean that things wo n't fundamentally change with regard to economic and political ties ? precisely .
poland must have an interest in having allies in germany and not isolate itself in crucial looming budget talks .
if poland is n't constructive there , it can lose out badly . so , atmospherically there will be tensions between poland and germany but eventually we have to wait and see what happens next .
it 's all open .
the civic platform as a coalition partner must ensure that the worst fears do n't become reality . the interview was conducted by pablo kummetz -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conservative kaczynski wins polish election poland on sunday elected the conservative , staunchly catholic lech kaczynski president by a definitive margin , bucking pre-vote surveys that had given his liberal rival the lead .

should berlin be worried ?
dw-world spoke to poland expert dieter bingen . the surprise winner of poland 's runoff presidential election on sunday , 56-year-old lech kaczynski of the conservative law and justice party -lrb- pis -rrb- has ruffled feathers by adopting a nationalistic tone during the election campaign , in particular signaling a tougher approach towards germany and russia . dw-world spoke to dieter bingen , head of the german-poland institute in darmstadt about what the election of the populist leader might mean for future ties between berlin and warsaw . dw-world : what have the poles voted for with lech kaczynski 's victory in the presidential runoff election on sunday ? dieter bingen : the poles have voted in favor of the promise to care more for the social concerns of the losers in society - a state with a heart so to speak - and for the promise that corruption and nepotism will be done away with .
in addition , they voted for kaczynski 's vow to pursue a stronger line in dealing with the communist past and the beneficiaries of the regime after 1990 . the media in germany is talking about a " shift towards right-wing attitudes " and that kaczynski is an anti-semite ?
how do you see it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech kaczynski speaks to supporters after his victory that 's absurd .
lech kaczynski is in no way an anti-semite .
he did get the support of groups and parties who have anti-semitic tendencies - he did take that into account , but he 's not anti-semitic himself though he does play on traditional national hostile stereotypes . and kaczynski 's election ca n't really be described unambiguously as a shift toward right-wing attitudes either .
kaczynski also has strong social aspects , particularly when it comes to the economy he 's rather left-leaning and he 's shown himself to be in favor of a welfare state .
these are elements that he courted very consciously in order to lure away a group of voters who supported the left-wing candidate in the first election phase .
thus he 's more structurally conservative if you will , and in an ideal sense paternalistic when it comes to values and also patriotic . what ramifications will the new situation in poland have for germany ? we 'll have to - at least initially - brace ourselves for some unpleasant situations and reckon with some emotional rhetoric that will question poland 's partnership with germany and in particular warsaw 's political relationship with germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and donald tusk in poland in august , 2005 donald tusk -lrb- of the pro-market civic platform who lost the presidential election to lech kaczynski -rrb- and angela merkel -lrb- germany 's new chancellor-designate -rrb- had already made common plans for the future .
do you think there will be any parallels between kaczynski and other parties in germany ? no , kaczynski did n't seek any contacts at all in germany .
he has no experience with foreign affairs and never gave it much importance . and , what does the new situation in poland mean for europe ? poland 's commitment to european integration in the eu 's political arena will probably not be promoted as much and there 's a danger that poland will isolate and marginalize itself .
poland will probably not pursue an active european policy , but will orient itself much more strongly towards the us . at the same time , that may be simply demonstrative and symbolic and things may appear different when it comes implementation - one has to make a distinction here between the heat of the election campaign and real politics . poland has after all profited from its membership in the eu , particularly its farmers .
does that mean that things wo n't fundamentally change with regard to economic and political ties ? precisely .
poland must have an interest in having allies in germany and not isolate itself in crucial looming budget talks .
if poland is n't constructive there , it can lose out badly . so , atmospherically there will be tensions between poland and germany but eventually we have to wait and see what happens next .
it 's all open .
the civic platform as a coalition partner must ensure that the worst fears do n't become reality . the interview was conducted by pablo kummetz -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conservative kaczynski wins polish election poland on sunday elected the conservative , staunchly catholic lech kaczynski president by a definitive margin , bucking pre-vote surveys that had given his liberal rival the lead .

" we , the people of the united nations … . "
these are the first words of the preamble of the un charter .
but while it all sounds very lofty , it does n't have anything to do with reality .
in fact , governments , not people make the big decisions regarding the world organization .
and only a portion of these governments are democratically elected . dictatorial regimes have been , and are now , among the mightiest countries , that is , the five permanent security council members whose veto power can condemn the united nations to passivity .
and even countries with freely elected governments do n't always accurately represent their populations ; think of britain 's tony blair and spain 's jose maria aznar voting in favor of the iraq war , although the majority of their countrymen and women opposed it vehemently . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a vote at the un security council the first sentence of the preamble sums up the discrepancies that have plagued the united nations since it was founded 60 years ago .
during the cold war , the security council could only rarely fulfill its intended function : to provide for peace and security in the world .
true , blue-helmeted un peacekeepers have frequently played a role in bringing peace to a region in the aftermath of armed conflict .
but the key word here is " aftermath . "
in the vast majority of cases - think korea and vietnam - the united nations has been unable to prevent the outbreak of war .
in rwanda , the organization stood by as genocide took place before the eyes of the world . iraq as example it may be worth noting that , since the end of the east-west conflict in the late 1980s , the use of vetoes by the un security council has tended toward zero .
but the latest example , iraq , shows that the highest un committee can only stop armed conflict from occurring when all of the permanent members want to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general kofi annan addressing the general assembly if un secretary general kofi annan had his way , the organization would undergo reforms in this , its 60th year of existence , bringing it up to date with the 21st century .
but annan 's agenda was thoroughly diluted at the united nations summit in mid-september .
the famed " millennium goals " were approved - who would dare oppose fighting poverty and disease ? - but when it came to financing development aid , the countries once again left matters as nonbinding as possible .
furthermore , security council reform was again delayed amid discord .
and members skirted the issue of actually coming up with an official decision on what constitutes terrorism . forum for ideas once again , it became clear how difficult it is to agree on the future of the united nations .
anyone who dreams of a capable and competent world governing body can only be disappointed by the united nations .
a better option would be to view the united nations in a humbler light .
there are , in fact , areas where the organization gets the job done : the human rights charter , sub-organizations - such as the united nations children 's fund -lrb- unicef -rrb- - and international courts of law represent development milestones .
un organizations have repeatedly won the nobel peace prize , and with good reason .
this year the honor went to the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- and its chief , mohammed elbaradei .
in terms of world peace , though , the united nations is above all a form for exchanging ideas .
in certain cases concrete peace measures are undertaken .
but in the end , the un is n't responsible for bringing peace to the world - that is the job of the 191 member states . klaus dahmann -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe , us bicker over development aid members of the european union have called on the united states to commit itself to the fight against poverty and provide more money with fewer restrictions to the developing world .

the numbers were officially reported , although a final vote count wo n't be published until monday afternoon . " mr chairman , mission accomplished , " kaczynski said at pis 's election evening in central warsaw , addressing his identical twin jaroslaw , who heads pis , and who last month refused the post of prime minister so as not to jeopardize his brother 's chances of being elected president . turnout for the in a run-off election was slightly more than 50 percent , up on the first round when it was less than 50 percent . last-minute win both of the presidential rivals cut their political teeth in the solidarity movement that in the 1980s helped poland shake off communism , but since then , they have moved apart ideologically . tusk 's civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- party embraced free-market liberalism and kaczynski a breed of polish conservatism that is close to the catholic church .
in the case of his pis party , it favors state intervention in the economy and social aid for the underprivileged . kaczynski 's victory mirrored what happened to his party in last month 's parliamentary election , when it pulled ahead of its opponents in the final straight to finish strongest , winning the right to choose poland 's next prime minister . pre-election polls had predicted since july that tusk would win , and showed the liberal in the lead up until the vote , although that lead had diminished by late friday . tusk lacked ' concept ' " tusk lost because of the mistakes he made in the final week of campaigning : there was no clear concept , and less activity at his headquarters , " said mikolaj czesnik , a political scientist from poland 's institute of sciences . at po 's decidedly more sombre election evening , tusk made no attempt to conceal his disappointment at losing . " i 'm not going to pretend , i 'm a little bit sad , " he said .
" if i have disappointed anyone , i ask them to forgive me .
i did what i could . " he congratulated kaczynski and assured his supporters that , although he had not won the presidency , he and po would " watch over what 's most important of all : the freedom of each and every pole .
we will ensure that the state never wrongs anyone again . " gracious winner kaczynski extended an olive branch to tusk , saying : " he fought a splendid battle … " i ask our friends in po to quickly end talks on forming a government , " he said . kaczynski 's campaign mirrored his conservatism , his traditional catholicism , and played on poles ' nationalism and the social inequality that is still apparent in poland , despite the burgeoning economy since the country joined the european union last year . " lech kaczynski waged a fear-factor campaign in the past few weeks , and he succeeded in scaring people , " said political analyst cornelius ochmann , from germany 's bertelsmann foundation .
" just as we saw in germany , people are scared of reforms . " his virulent anti-gay stance - he twice banned gay pride marches through warsaw - has won him support among poland 's conservative catholic voters .
poland 's next president - the third to be freely elected since the end of communism in 1989 - is to be sworn in on december 23 , when aleksander kwasniewski , who has held the office for two terms , stands down . dw staff / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former solidarity allies prepare for polish election battle two weeks after they finished neck and neck in the first round of poland 's presidential election , former comrades in arms donald tusk and lech kaczynski , are to face off sunday in a decisive vote for the presidency .

should berlin be worried ?
dw-world spoke to poland expert dieter bingen . the surprise winner of poland 's runoff presidential election on sunday , 56-year-old lech kaczynski of the conservative law and justice party -lrb- pis -rrb- has ruffled feathers by adopting a nationalistic tone during the election campaign , in particular signaling a tougher approach towards germany and russia . dw-world spoke to dieter bingen , head of the german-poland institute in darmstadt about what the election of the populist leader might mean for future ties between berlin and warsaw . dw-world : what have the poles voted for with lech kaczynski 's victory in the presidential runoff election on sunday ? dieter bingen : the poles have voted in favor of the promise to care more for the social concerns of the losers in society - a state with a heart so to speak - and for the promise that corruption and nepotism will be done away with .
in addition , they voted for kaczynski 's vow to pursue a stronger line in dealing with the communist past and the beneficiaries of the regime after 1990 . the media in germany is talking about a " shift towards right-wing attitudes " and that kaczynski is an anti-semite ?
how do you see it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech kaczynski speaks to supporters after his victory that 's absurd .
lech kaczynski is in no way an anti-semite .
he did get the support of groups and parties who have anti-semitic tendencies - he did take that into account , but he 's not anti-semitic himself though he does play on traditional national hostile stereotypes . and kaczynski 's election ca n't really be described unambiguously as a shift toward right-wing attitudes either .
kaczynski also has strong social aspects , particularly when it comes to the economy he 's rather left-leaning and he 's shown himself to be in favor of a welfare state .
these are elements that he courted very consciously in order to lure away a group of voters who supported the left-wing candidate in the first election phase .
thus he 's more structurally conservative if you will , and in an ideal sense paternalistic when it comes to values and also patriotic . what ramifications will the new situation in poland have for germany ? we 'll have to - at least initially - brace ourselves for some unpleasant situations and reckon with some emotional rhetoric that will question poland 's partnership with germany and in particular warsaw 's political relationship with germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and donald tusk in poland in august , 2005 donald tusk -lrb- of the pro-market civic platform who lost the presidential election to lech kaczynski -rrb- and angela merkel -lrb- germany 's new chancellor-designate -rrb- had already made common plans for the future .
do you think there will be any parallels between kaczynski and other parties in germany ? no , kaczynski did n't seek any contacts at all in germany .
he has no experience with foreign affairs and never gave it much importance . and , what does the new situation in poland mean for europe ? poland 's commitment to european integration in the eu 's political arena will probably not be promoted as much and there 's a danger that poland will isolate and marginalize itself .
poland will probably not pursue an active european policy , but will orient itself much more strongly towards the us . at the same time , that may be simply demonstrative and symbolic and things may appear different when it comes implementation - one has to make a distinction here between the heat of the election campaign and real politics . poland has after all profited from its membership in the eu , particularly its farmers .
does that mean that things wo n't fundamentally change with regard to economic and political ties ? precisely .
poland must have an interest in having allies in germany and not isolate itself in crucial looming budget talks .
if poland is n't constructive there , it can lose out badly . so , atmospherically there will be tensions between poland and germany but eventually we have to wait and see what happens next .
it 's all open .
the civic platform as a coalition partner must ensure that the worst fears do n't become reality . the interview was conducted by pablo kummetz -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conservative kaczynski wins polish election poland on sunday elected the conservative , staunchly catholic lech kaczynski president by a definitive margin , bucking pre-vote surveys that had given his liberal rival the lead .

they ’ re warning that increased ozone loss is allowing additional harmful ultraviolet light to reach us and making us more vulnerable to sunburn , skin cancer and cataracts . about 20 kilometers -lrb- 12.4 miles -rrb- thick , the layer of ozone gas is like a giant umbrella 15 to 35 kilometers over the earth and like any good pair of sunglasses , it acts like a filter by blocking out most ultraviolet rays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a thin layer of ozone protects from numerous health problems the loss of ozone was discovered over the polar regions 20 years ago and has been closely watched ever since .
scientists continue to disagree about the causes and effects of the ozone level 's thinning , with some stating depletion levels have peaked . scientists divided on ozone depletion according to the united nations world meteorological organization 's latest bulletin , the seasonal hole above the south pole and antarctica is shrinking . " it is the third largest ever , more or less as one would expect from present levels of chlorine and bromine in the atmosphere , " geir braathen , the wmo 's top ozone expert , told reporters tuesday .
" it does n't look as if the ozone hole is going to get any bigger -lrb- in coming years -rrb- .
it seems like we have reached a plateau . " others scientists , such as frank jürgen diekmann of the european space agency , expect this year 's hole over the south pole to be the biggest ever , and doubt the danger is over . " if anything , the ozone concentration has stabilized , " he said .
" but especially in 2005 we ’ re expecting record ozone holes above the antarctic .
going on the latest data , we can ’ t say the danger is gone . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists can agree that levels seem to have stablized especially bad in south it ’ s been more than 18 years since 180 countries signed up to the montreal ozone protocol on reducing emissions of chlorofluorocarbons , -lrb- cfcs -rrb- , which up until then were considered indispensable chemicals for modern living . though there 's no actual " hole " in the ozone layer and only a slight thinning occurs over the rest of the world , climatic conditions are especially dangerous at the south pole .
it would take forty to fifty years for the ozone shield to recover completely - the same amount of time chlorofluorocarbons stay in the atmosphere . polar-stratospheric clouds , which form above the south pole when air masses can not mix in the dark winter months and end up collecting more and ore chlorine compounds , are struck by the southern spring 's sunlight from september to november .
that causes them to break into " radicals " that split ozone into an oxygen molecule and an oxygen atom , making it disappear . greenhouse gases dangerous in north these meteorological conditions can also be dangerous in the northern hemisphere , according to christoph brühl , of the max planck institute for chemistry in mainz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenhouse gasses like co2 endanger the northern hemisphere " the public is looking more and more at the antarctic in connection with the ozone hole , " he said .
" in principle though , the danger is just as great in the northern hemisphere , except that it does n't arise there every year because of various meteorological conditions . " greenhouse gas emissions can also influence the ozone , particularly in the northern hemisphere .
the gasses cool the upper stratosphere , the layer important for the formation of ozone .
if the layer gets too cold , a closed area similar to that over the south pole can form in winter , meaning air masses over the northern hemisphere can no longer exchange , damaging the ozone filter over europe , brühl explained . " up to now we 've always been lucky that the weather put an end to it in march , but that needn ’ t always be so , " he added .

should berlin be worried ?
dw-world spoke to poland expert dieter bingen . the surprise winner of poland 's runoff presidential election on sunday , 56-year-old lech kaczynski of the conservative law and justice party -lrb- pis -rrb- has ruffled feathers by adopting a nationalistic tone during the election campaign , in particular signaling a tougher approach towards germany and russia . dw-world spoke to dieter bingen , head of the german-poland institute in darmstadt about what the election of the populist leader might mean for future ties between berlin and warsaw . dw-world : what have the poles voted for with lech kaczynski 's victory in the presidential runoff election on sunday ? dieter bingen : the poles have voted in favor of the promise to care more for the social concerns of the losers in society - a state with a heart so to speak - and for the promise that corruption and nepotism will be done away with .
in addition , they voted for kaczynski 's vow to pursue a stronger line in dealing with the communist past and the beneficiaries of the regime after 1990 . the media in germany is talking about a " shift towards right-wing attitudes " and that kaczynski is an anti-semite ?
how do you see it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech kaczynski speaks to supporters after his victory that 's absurd .
lech kaczynski is in no way an anti-semite .
he did get the support of groups and parties who have anti-semitic tendencies - he did take that into account , but he 's not anti-semitic himself though he does play on traditional national hostile stereotypes . and kaczynski 's election ca n't really be described unambiguously as a shift toward right-wing attitudes either .
kaczynski also has strong social aspects , particularly when it comes to the economy he 's rather left-leaning and he 's shown himself to be in favor of a welfare state .
these are elements that he courted very consciously in order to lure away a group of voters who supported the left-wing candidate in the first election phase .
thus he 's more structurally conservative if you will , and in an ideal sense paternalistic when it comes to values and also patriotic . what ramifications will the new situation in poland have for germany ? we 'll have to - at least initially - brace ourselves for some unpleasant situations and reckon with some emotional rhetoric that will question poland 's partnership with germany and in particular warsaw 's political relationship with germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and donald tusk in poland in august , 2005 donald tusk -lrb- of the pro-market civic platform who lost the presidential election to lech kaczynski -rrb- and angela merkel -lrb- germany 's new chancellor-designate -rrb- had already made common plans for the future .
do you think there will be any parallels between kaczynski and other parties in germany ? no , kaczynski did n't seek any contacts at all in germany .
he has no experience with foreign affairs and never gave it much importance . and , what does the new situation in poland mean for europe ? poland 's commitment to european integration in the eu 's political arena will probably not be promoted as much and there 's a danger that poland will isolate and marginalize itself .
poland will probably not pursue an active european policy , but will orient itself much more strongly towards the us . at the same time , that may be simply demonstrative and symbolic and things may appear different when it comes implementation - one has to make a distinction here between the heat of the election campaign and real politics . poland has after all profited from its membership in the eu , particularly its farmers .
does that mean that things wo n't fundamentally change with regard to economic and political ties ? precisely .
poland must have an interest in having allies in germany and not isolate itself in crucial looming budget talks .
if poland is n't constructive there , it can lose out badly . so , atmospherically there will be tensions between poland and germany but eventually we have to wait and see what happens next .

should berlin be worried ?
dw-world spoke to poland expert dieter bingen . the surprise winner of poland 's runoff presidential election on sunday , 56-year-old lech kaczynski of the conservative law and justice party -lrb- pis -rrb- has ruffled feathers by adopting a nationalistic tone during the election campaign , in particular signaling a tougher approach towards germany and russia . dw-world spoke to dieter bingen , head of the german-poland institute in darmstadt about what the election of the populist leader might mean for future ties between berlin and warsaw . dw-world : what have the poles voted for with lech kaczynski 's victory in the presidential runoff election on sunday ? dieter bingen : the poles have voted in favor of the promise to care more for the social concerns of the losers in society - a state with a heart so to speak - and for the promise that corruption and nepotism will be done away with .
in addition , they voted for kaczynski 's vow to pursue a stronger line in dealing with the communist past and the beneficiaries of the regime after 1990 . the media in germany is talking about a " shift towards right-wing attitudes " and that kaczynski is an anti-semite ?
how do you see it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech kaczynski speaks to supporters after his victory that 's absurd .
lech kaczynski is in no way an anti-semite .
he did get the support of groups and parties who have anti-semitic tendencies - he did take that into account , but he 's not anti-semitic himself though he does play on traditional national hostile stereotypes . and kaczynski 's election ca n't really be described unambiguously as a shift toward right-wing attitudes either .
kaczynski also has strong social aspects , particularly when it comes to the economy he 's rather left-leaning and he 's shown himself to be in favor of a welfare state .
these are elements that he courted very consciously in order to lure away a group of voters who supported the left-wing candidate in the first election phase .
thus he 's more structurally conservative if you will , and in an ideal sense paternalistic when it comes to values and also patriotic . what ramifications will the new situation in poland have for germany ? we 'll have to - at least initially - brace ourselves for some unpleasant situations and reckon with some emotional rhetoric that will question poland 's partnership with germany and in particular warsaw 's political relationship with germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and donald tusk in poland in august , 2005 donald tusk -lrb- of the pro-market civic platform who lost the presidential election to lech kaczynski -rrb- and angela merkel -lrb- germany 's new chancellor-designate -rrb- had already made common plans for the future .
do you think there will be any parallels between kaczynski and other parties in germany ? no , kaczynski did n't seek any contacts at all in germany .
he has no experience with foreign affairs and never gave it much importance . and , what does the new situation in poland mean for europe ? poland 's commitment to european integration in the eu 's political arena will probably not be promoted as much and there 's a danger that poland will isolate and marginalize itself .
poland will probably not pursue an active european policy , but will orient itself much more strongly towards the us . at the same time , that may be simply demonstrative and symbolic and things may appear different when it comes implementation - one has to make a distinction here between the heat of the election campaign and real politics . poland has after all profited from its membership in the eu , particularly its farmers .
does that mean that things wo n't fundamentally change with regard to economic and political ties ? precisely .
poland must have an interest in having allies in germany and not isolate itself in crucial looming budget talks .
if poland is n't constructive there , it can lose out badly . so , atmospherically there will be tensions between poland and germany but eventually we have to wait and see what happens next .
it 's all open .
the civic platform as a coalition partner must ensure that the worst fears do n't become reality . the interview was conducted by pablo kummetz -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conservative kaczynski wins polish election poland on sunday elected the conservative , staunchly catholic lech kaczynski president by a definitive margin , bucking pre-vote surveys that had given his liberal rival the lead .

should berlin be worried ?
dw-world spoke to poland expert dieter bingen . the surprise winner of poland 's runoff presidential election on sunday , 56-year-old lech kaczynski of the conservative law and justice party -lrb- pis -rrb- has ruffled feathers by adopting a nationalistic tone during the election campaign , in particular signaling a tougher approach towards germany and russia . dw-world spoke to dieter bingen , head of the german-poland institute in darmstadt about what the election of the populist leader might mean for future ties between berlin and warsaw . dw-world : what have the poles voted for with lech kaczynski 's victory in the presidential runoff election on sunday ? dieter bingen : the poles have voted in favor of the promise to care more for the social concerns of the losers in society - a state with a heart so to speak - and for the promise that corruption and nepotism will be done away with .
in addition , they voted for kaczynski 's vow to pursue a stronger line in dealing with the communist past and the beneficiaries of the regime after 1990 . the media in germany is talking about a " shift towards right-wing attitudes " and that kaczynski is an anti-semite ?
how do you see it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech kaczynski speaks to supporters after his victory that 's absurd .

should berlin be worried ?
dw-world spoke to poland expert dieter bingen . the surprise winner of poland 's runoff presidential election on sunday , 56-year-old lech kaczynski of the conservative law and justice party -lrb- pis -rrb- has ruffled feathers by adopting a nationalistic tone during the election campaign , in particular signaling a tougher approach towards germany and russia . dw-world spoke to dieter bingen , head of the german-poland institute in darmstadt about what the election of the populist leader might mean for future ties between berlin and warsaw . dw-world : what have the poles voted for with lech kaczynski 's victory in the presidential runoff election on sunday ? dieter bingen : the poles have voted in favor of the promise to care more for the social concerns of the losers in society - a state with a heart so to speak - and for the promise that corruption and nepotism will be done away with .
in addition , they voted for kaczynski 's vow to pursue a stronger line in dealing with the communist past and the beneficiaries of the regime after 1990 . the media in germany is talking about a " shift towards right-wing attitudes " and that kaczynski is an anti-semite ?
how do you see it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech kaczynski speaks to supporters after his victory that 's absurd .

" we , the people of the united nations … . "
these are the first words of the preamble of the un charter .
but while it all sounds very lofty , it does n't have anything to do with reality .
in fact , governments , not people make the big decisions regarding the world organization .
and only a portion of these governments are democratically elected . dictatorial regimes have been , and are now , among the mightiest countries , that is , the five permanent security council members whose veto power can condemn the united nations to passivity .
and even countries with freely elected governments do n't always accurately represent their populations ; think of britain 's tony blair and spain 's jose maria aznar voting in favor of the iraq war , although the majority of their countrymen and women opposed it vehemently . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a vote at the un security council the first sentence of the preamble sums up the discrepancies that have plagued the united nations since it was founded 60 years ago .
during the cold war , the security council could only rarely fulfill its intended function : to provide for peace and security in the world .
true , blue-helmeted un peacekeepers have frequently played a role in bringing peace to a region in the aftermath of armed conflict .
but the key word here is " aftermath . "
in the vast majority of cases - think korea and vietnam - the united nations has been unable to prevent the outbreak of war .
in rwanda , the organization stood by as genocide took place before the eyes of the world . iraq as example it may be worth noting that , since the end of the east-west conflict in the late 1980s , the use of vetoes by the un security council has tended toward zero .
but the latest example , iraq , shows that the highest un committee can only stop armed conflict from occurring when all of the permanent members want to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general kofi annan addressing the general assembly if un secretary general kofi annan had his way , the organization would undergo reforms in this , its 60th year of existence , bringing it up to date with the 21st century .
but annan 's agenda was thoroughly diluted at the united nations summit in mid-september .
the famed " millennium goals " were approved - who would dare oppose fighting poverty and disease ? - but when it came to financing development aid , the countries once again left matters as nonbinding as possible .
furthermore , security council reform was again delayed amid discord .
and members skirted the issue of actually coming up with an official decision on what constitutes terrorism . forum for ideas once again , it became clear how difficult it is to agree on the future of the united nations .
anyone who dreams of a capable and competent world governing body can only be disappointed by the united nations .
a better option would be to view the united nations in a humbler light .
there are , in fact , areas where the organization gets the job done : the human rights charter , sub-organizations - such as the united nations children 's fund -lrb- unicef -rrb- - and international courts of law represent development milestones .
un organizations have repeatedly won the nobel peace prize , and with good reason .
this year the honor went to the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- and its chief , mohammed elbaradei .
in terms of world peace , though , the united nations is above all a form for exchanging ideas .
in certain cases concrete peace measures are undertaken .
but in the end , the un is n't responsible for bringing peace to the world - that is the job of the 191 member states . klaus dahmann -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe , us bicker over development aid members of the european union have called on the united states to commit itself to the fight against poverty and provide more money with fewer restrictions to the developing world .

but rival plans are complicating matters .

monday 's meeting , however , is expected to be overshadowed by infighting in both camps over important party posts and the future shaping of ministries as well as over mistakes made during the autumn election campaign which had left germany in an inconclusive political situation . christian democratic chief and chancellor-designate angela merkel will be entering today 's round of coalition talks with the stigma that her party has shown the worst performance at any general election since 1949 by garnering only slightly more than 35 percent of the vote . a genuine analysis of why the conservatives fared so badly on sept .

the cdu 's rank-and-file believe that a merciless analysis of election campaign mistakes should come at once . it 's the cdu 's youth wing in particular which is calling for a clean breast to be made .

but senior members of the cdu are warning against too much criticism while coalition talks with the social democrats are in progress .
" i believe that all issues related to coalition talks have to take precedence now , " said jürgen rüttgers , the christian democratic premier of north rhine-westphalia . " we 'll see a tough fight over reforms in a variety of key areas , and we 'll have enough on our plate to prevent our manifesto from being taken to pieces completely , " he added .
" if in a situation like this we were to couple this with a large-scale analysis of our showing at the general election , then this would clearly overstretch our abilities .

" most ministries where important reforms have to be masterminded in the four years ahead have gone to the social democrats .
which is to say that our participation in a grand coalition comes at too high a price . " meanwhile the spd 's main negotiator , party chief and parliamentary group leader franz müntefering , is facing inner party criticism as well .
there is opposition to his candidate for the post of spd secretary general , as many within the spd are coming out in favor of a prominent member of the party 's leftist youth wing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering faces a tough start to his job as vice-chancellor .

" we , the people of the united nations … . "
these are the first words of the preamble of the un charter .
but while it all sounds very lofty , it does n't have anything to do with reality .
in fact , governments , not people make the big decisions regarding the world organization .
and only a portion of these governments are democratically elected . dictatorial regimes have been , and are now , among the mightiest countries , that is , the five permanent security council members whose veto power can condemn the united nations to passivity .
and even countries with freely elected governments do n't always accurately represent their populations ; think of britain 's tony blair and spain 's jose maria aznar voting in favor of the iraq war , although the majority of their countrymen and women opposed it vehemently . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a vote at the un security council the first sentence of the preamble sums up the discrepancies that have plagued the united nations since it was founded 60 years ago .
during the cold war , the security council could only rarely fulfill its intended function : to provide for peace and security in the world .
true , blue-helmeted un peacekeepers have frequently played a role in bringing peace to a region in the aftermath of armed conflict .
but the key word here is " aftermath . "
in the vast majority of cases - think korea and vietnam - the united nations has been unable to prevent the outbreak of war .
in rwanda , the organization stood by as genocide took place before the eyes of the world . iraq as example it may be worth noting that , since the end of the east-west conflict in the late 1980s , the use of vetoes by the un security council has tended toward zero .
but the latest example , iraq , shows that the highest un committee can only stop armed conflict from occurring when all of the permanent members want to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general kofi annan addressing the general assembly if un secretary general kofi annan had his way , the organization would undergo reforms in this , its 60th year of existence , bringing it up to date with the 21st century .
but annan 's agenda was thoroughly diluted at the united nations summit in mid-september .
the famed " millennium goals " were approved - who would dare oppose fighting poverty and disease ? - but when it came to financing development aid , the countries once again left matters as nonbinding as possible .
furthermore , security council reform was again delayed amid discord .
and members skirted the issue of actually coming up with an official decision on what constitutes terrorism . forum for ideas once again , it became clear how difficult it is to agree on the future of the united nations .
anyone who dreams of a capable and competent world governing body can only be disappointed by the united nations .
a better option would be to view the united nations in a humbler light .
there are , in fact , areas where the organization gets the job done : the human rights charter , sub-organizations - such as the united nations children 's fund -lrb- unicef -rrb- - and international courts of law represent development milestones .
un organizations have repeatedly won the nobel peace prize , and with good reason .
this year the honor went to the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- and its chief , mohammed elbaradei .
in terms of world peace , though , the united nations is above all a form for exchanging ideas .

monday 's meeting , however , is expected to be overshadowed by infighting in both camps over important party posts and the future shaping of ministries as well as over mistakes made during the autumn election campaign which had left germany in an inconclusive political situation . christian democratic chief and chancellor-designate angela merkel will be entering today 's round of coalition talks with the stigma that her party has shown the worst performance at any general election since 1949 by garnering only slightly more than 35 percent of the vote . a genuine analysis of why the conservatives fared so badly on sept .
18 is still pending .
the cdu 's rank-and-file believe that a merciless analysis of election campaign mistakes should come at once . it 's the cdu 's youth wing in particular which is calling for a clean breast to be made .

" i believe that all issues related to coalition talks have to take precedence now , " said jürgen rüttgers , the christian democratic premier of north rhine-westphalia . " we 'll see a tough fight over reforms in a variety of key areas , and we 'll have enough on our plate to prevent our manifesto from being taken to pieces completely , " he added .
" if in a situation like this we were to couple this with a large-scale analysis of our showing at the general election , then this would clearly overstretch our abilities .

" we 'll be having a huge structural problem in the grand coalition which we 'll most likely see in power at the end of the day , " one delegate to the augsburg meeting argued .
" most ministries where important reforms have to be masterminded in the four years ahead have gone to the social democrats .
which is to say that our participation in a grand coalition comes at too high a price . " meanwhile the spd 's main negotiator , party chief and parliamentary group leader franz müntefering , is facing inner party criticism as well .
there is opposition to his candidate for the post of spd secretary general , as many within the spd are coming out in favor of a prominent member of the party 's leftist youth wing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering faces a tough start to his job as vice-chancellor .
recent attempts to rejuvenate the party leadership wo n't make müntefering 's negotiating position any easier in talks which are already marked by a variety of stumbling blocs .
coalition talks during monday afternoon will be centering on an agreement over the country 's future policies related to consolidating public finances . germany 's finances a major sticking point both sides acknowledge the need to save at least 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 35.8 billion -rrb- in 2006 and 2007 in order to finally meet the deficit criteria set under the eu 's stability and growth pact .
but there 's still a lot of disagreement on how to reach this ambitious aim . monday 's talks are expected to see a breakthrough on whether or not to raise value-added tax by two percent , as proposed by the christian democrats .

should berlin be worried ?
dw-world spoke to poland expert dieter bingen . the surprise winner of poland 's runoff presidential election on sunday , 56-year-old lech kaczynski of the conservative law and justice party -lrb- pis -rrb- has ruffled feathers by adopting a nationalistic tone during the election campaign , in particular signaling a tougher approach towards germany and russia . dw-world spoke to dieter bingen , head of the german-poland institute in darmstadt about what the election of the populist leader might mean for future ties between berlin and warsaw . dw-world : what have the poles voted for with lech kaczynski 's victory in the presidential runoff election on sunday ? dieter bingen : the poles have voted in favor of the promise to care more for the social concerns of the losers in society - a state with a heart so to speak - and for the promise that corruption and nepotism will be done away with .
in addition , they voted for kaczynski 's vow to pursue a stronger line in dealing with the communist past and the beneficiaries of the regime after 1990 . the media in germany is talking about a " shift towards right-wing attitudes " and that kaczynski is an anti-semite ?
how do you see it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech kaczynski speaks to supporters after his victory that 's absurd .
lech kaczynski is in no way an anti-semite .
he did get the support of groups and parties who have anti-semitic tendencies - he did take that into account , but he 's not anti-semitic himself though he does play on traditional national hostile stereotypes . and kaczynski 's election ca n't really be described unambiguously as a shift toward right-wing attitudes either .
kaczynski also has strong social aspects , particularly when it comes to the economy he 's rather left-leaning and he 's shown himself to be in favor of a welfare state .
these are elements that he courted very consciously in order to lure away a group of voters who supported the left-wing candidate in the first election phase .
thus he 's more structurally conservative if you will , and in an ideal sense paternalistic when it comes to values and also patriotic . what ramifications will the new situation in poland have for germany ? we 'll have to - at least initially - brace ourselves for some unpleasant situations and reckon with some emotional rhetoric that will question poland 's partnership with germany and in particular warsaw 's political relationship with germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and donald tusk in poland in august , 2005 donald tusk -lrb- of the pro-market civic platform who lost the presidential election to lech kaczynski -rrb- and angela merkel -lrb- germany 's new chancellor-designate -rrb- had already made common plans for the future .
do you think there will be any parallels between kaczynski and other parties in germany ? no , kaczynski did n't seek any contacts at all in germany .
he has no experience with foreign affairs and never gave it much importance . and , what does the new situation in poland mean for europe ? poland 's commitment to european integration in the eu 's political arena will probably not be promoted as much and there 's a danger that poland will isolate and marginalize itself .
poland will probably not pursue an active european policy , but will orient itself much more strongly towards the us . at the same time , that may be simply demonstrative and symbolic and things may appear different when it comes implementation - one has to make a distinction here between the heat of the election campaign and real politics . poland has after all profited from its membership in the eu , particularly its farmers .
does that mean that things wo n't fundamentally change with regard to economic and political ties ? precisely .
poland must have an interest in having allies in germany and not isolate itself in crucial looming budget talks .
if poland is n't constructive there , it can lose out badly . so , atmospherically there will be tensions between poland and germany but eventually we have to wait and see what happens next .

scientists continue to disagree about the causes and effects of the ozone level 's thinning , with some stating depletion levels have peaked . scientists divided on ozone depletion according to the united nations world meteorological organization 's latest bulletin , the seasonal hole above the south pole and antarctica is shrinking . " it is the third largest ever , more or less as one would expect from present levels of chlorine and bromine in the atmosphere , " geir braathen , the wmo 's top ozone expert , told reporters tuesday .
" it does n't look as if the ozone hole is going to get any bigger -lrb- in coming years -rrb- .
it seems like we have reached a plateau . " others scientists , such as frank jürgen diekmann of the european space agency , expect this year 's hole over the south pole to be the biggest ever , and doubt the danger is over . " if anything , the ozone concentration has stabilized , " he said .
" but especially in 2005 we ’ re expecting record ozone holes above the antarctic .
going on the latest data , we can ’ t say the danger is gone . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists can agree that levels seem to have stablized especially bad in south it ’ s been more than 18 years since 180 countries signed up to the montreal ozone protocol on reducing emissions of chlorofluorocarbons , -lrb- cfcs -rrb- , which up until then were considered indispensable chemicals for modern living . though there 's no actual " hole " in the ozone layer and only a slight thinning occurs over the rest of the world , climatic conditions are especially dangerous at the south pole .
it would take forty to fifty years for the ozone shield to recover completely - the same amount of time chlorofluorocarbons stay in the atmosphere . polar-stratospheric clouds , which form above the south pole when air masses can not mix in the dark winter months and end up collecting more and ore chlorine compounds , are struck by the southern spring 's sunlight from september to november .
that causes them to break into " radicals " that split ozone into an oxygen molecule and an oxygen atom , making it disappear . greenhouse gases dangerous in north these meteorological conditions can also be dangerous in the northern hemisphere , according to christoph brühl , of the max planck institute for chemistry in mainz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenhouse gasses like co2 endanger the northern hemisphere " the public is looking more and more at the antarctic in connection with the ozone hole , " he said .
" in principle though , the danger is just as great in the northern hemisphere , except that it does n't arise there every year because of various meteorological conditions . " greenhouse gas emissions can also influence the ozone , particularly in the northern hemisphere .
the gasses cool the upper stratosphere , the layer important for the formation of ozone .
if the layer gets too cold , a closed area similar to that over the south pole can form in winter , meaning air masses over the northern hemisphere can no longer exchange , damaging the ozone filter over europe , brühl explained . " up to now we 've always been lucky that the weather put an end to it in march , but that needn ’ t always be so , " he added .

scientists continue to disagree about the causes and effects of the ozone level 's thinning , with some stating depletion levels have peaked . scientists divided on ozone depletion according to the united nations world meteorological organization 's latest bulletin , the seasonal hole above the south pole and antarctica is shrinking . " it is the third largest ever , more or less as one would expect from present levels of chlorine and bromine in the atmosphere , " geir braathen , the wmo 's top ozone expert , told reporters tuesday .

it would take forty to fifty years for the ozone shield to recover completely - the same amount of time chlorofluorocarbons stay in the atmosphere . polar-stratospheric clouds , which form above the south pole when air masses can not mix in the dark winter months and end up collecting more and ore chlorine compounds , are struck by the southern spring 's sunlight from september to november .

the gasses cool the upper stratosphere , the layer important for the formation of ozone .
if the layer gets too cold , a closed area similar to that over the south pole can form in winter , meaning air masses over the northern hemisphere can no longer exchange , damaging the ozone filter over europe , brühl explained .

should berlin be worried ?
dw-world spoke to poland expert dieter bingen . the surprise winner of poland 's runoff presidential election on sunday , 56-year-old lech kaczynski of the conservative law and justice party -lrb- pis -rrb- has ruffled feathers by adopting a nationalistic tone during the election campaign , in particular signaling a tougher approach towards germany and russia . dw-world spoke to dieter bingen , head of the german-poland institute in darmstadt about what the election of the populist leader might mean for future ties between berlin and warsaw . dw-world : what have the poles voted for with lech kaczynski 's victory in the presidential runoff election on sunday ? dieter bingen : the poles have voted in favor of the promise to care more for the social concerns of the losers in society - a state with a heart so to speak - and for the promise that corruption and nepotism will be done away with .
in addition , they voted for kaczynski 's vow to pursue a stronger line in dealing with the communist past and the beneficiaries of the regime after 1990 . the media in germany is talking about a " shift towards right-wing attitudes " and that kaczynski is an anti-semite ?
how do you see it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech kaczynski speaks to supporters after his victory that 's absurd .
lech kaczynski is in no way an anti-semite .
he did get the support of groups and parties who have anti-semitic tendencies - he did take that into account , but he 's not anti-semitic himself though he does play on traditional national hostile stereotypes . and kaczynski 's election ca n't really be described unambiguously as a shift toward right-wing attitudes either .
kaczynski also has strong social aspects , particularly when it comes to the economy he 's rather left-leaning and he 's shown himself to be in favor of a welfare state .
these are elements that he courted very consciously in order to lure away a group of voters who supported the left-wing candidate in the first election phase .
thus he 's more structurally conservative if you will , and in an ideal sense paternalistic when it comes to values and also patriotic . what ramifications will the new situation in poland have for germany ? we 'll have to - at least initially - brace ourselves for some unpleasant situations and reckon with some emotional rhetoric that will question poland 's partnership with germany and in particular warsaw 's political relationship with germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and donald tusk in poland in august , 2005 donald tusk -lrb- of the pro-market civic platform who lost the presidential election to lech kaczynski -rrb- and angela merkel -lrb- germany 's new chancellor-designate -rrb- had already made common plans for the future .
do you think there will be any parallels between kaczynski and other parties in germany ? no , kaczynski did n't seek any contacts at all in germany .
he has no experience with foreign affairs and never gave it much importance . and , what does the new situation in poland mean for europe ? poland 's commitment to european integration in the eu 's political arena will probably not be promoted as much and there 's a danger that poland will isolate and marginalize itself .
poland will probably not pursue an active european policy , but will orient itself much more strongly towards the us . at the same time , that may be simply demonstrative and symbolic and things may appear different when it comes implementation - one has to make a distinction here between the heat of the election campaign and real politics . poland has after all profited from its membership in the eu , particularly its farmers .
does that mean that things wo n't fundamentally change with regard to economic and political ties ? precisely .
poland must have an interest in having allies in germany and not isolate itself in crucial looming budget talks .
if poland is n't constructive there , it can lose out badly . so , atmospherically there will be tensions between poland and germany but eventually we have to wait and see what happens next .
it 's all open .
the civic platform as a coalition partner must ensure that the worst fears do n't become reality . the interview was conducted by pablo kummetz -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conservative kaczynski wins polish election poland on sunday elected the conservative , staunchly catholic lech kaczynski president by a definitive margin , bucking pre-vote surveys that had given his liberal rival the lead .

dw-world spoke to poland expert dieter bingen . the surprise winner of poland 's runoff presidential election on sunday , 56-year-old lech kaczynski of the conservative law and justice party -lrb- pis -rrb- has ruffled feathers by adopting a nationalistic tone during the election campaign , in particular signaling a tougher approach towards germany and russia . dw-world spoke to dieter bingen , head of the german-poland institute in darmstadt about what the election of the populist leader might mean for future ties between berlin and warsaw . dw-world : what have the poles voted for with lech kaczynski 's victory in the presidential runoff election on sunday ? dieter bingen : the poles have voted in favor of the promise to care more for the social concerns of the losers in society - a state with a heart so to speak - and for the promise that corruption and nepotism will be done away with .
in addition , they voted for kaczynski 's vow to pursue a stronger line in dealing with the communist past and the beneficiaries of the regime after 1990 . the media in germany is talking about a " shift towards right-wing attitudes " and that kaczynski is an anti-semite ?
how do you see it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech kaczynski speaks to supporters after his victory that 's absurd .
lech kaczynski is in no way an anti-semite .
he did get the support of groups and parties who have anti-semitic tendencies - he did take that into account , but he 's not anti-semitic himself though he does play on traditional national hostile stereotypes . and kaczynski 's election ca n't really be described unambiguously as a shift toward right-wing attitudes either .
kaczynski also has strong social aspects , particularly when it comes to the economy he 's rather left-leaning and he 's shown himself to be in favor of a welfare state .
these are elements that he courted very consciously in order to lure away a group of voters who supported the left-wing candidate in the first election phase .
thus he 's more structurally conservative if you will , and in an ideal sense paternalistic when it comes to values and also patriotic . what ramifications will the new situation in poland have for germany ? we 'll have to - at least initially - brace ourselves for some unpleasant situations and reckon with some emotional rhetoric that will question poland 's partnership with germany and in particular warsaw 's political relationship with germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and donald tusk in poland in august , 2005 donald tusk -lrb- of the pro-market civic platform who lost the presidential election to lech kaczynski -rrb- and angela merkel -lrb- germany 's new chancellor-designate -rrb- had already made common plans for the future .
do you think there will be any parallels between kaczynski and other parties in germany ? no , kaczynski did n't seek any contacts at all in germany .
he has no experience with foreign affairs and never gave it much importance . and , what does the new situation in poland mean for europe ? poland 's commitment to european integration in the eu 's political arena will probably not be promoted as much and there 's a danger that poland will isolate and marginalize itself .
poland will probably not pursue an active european policy , but will orient itself much more strongly towards the us . at the same time , that may be simply demonstrative and symbolic and things may appear different when it comes implementation - one has to make a distinction here between the heat of the election campaign and real politics . poland has after all profited from its membership in the eu , particularly its farmers .
does that mean that things wo n't fundamentally change with regard to economic and political ties ? precisely .
poland must have an interest in having allies in germany and not isolate itself in crucial looming budget talks .
if poland is n't constructive there , it can lose out badly . so , atmospherically there will be tensions between poland and germany but eventually we have to wait and see what happens next .

they ’ re warning that increased ozone loss is allowing additional harmful ultraviolet light to reach us and making us more vulnerable to sunburn , skin cancer and cataracts . about 20 kilometers -lrb- 12.4 miles -rrb- thick , the layer of ozone gas is like a giant umbrella 15 to 35 kilometers over the earth and like any good pair of sunglasses , it acts like a filter by blocking out most ultraviolet rays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a thin layer of ozone protects from numerous health problems the loss of ozone was discovered over the polar regions 20 years ago and has been closely watched ever since .
scientists continue to disagree about the causes and effects of the ozone level 's thinning , with some stating depletion levels have peaked . scientists divided on ozone depletion according to the united nations world meteorological organization 's latest bulletin , the seasonal hole above the south pole and antarctica is shrinking . " it is the third largest ever , more or less as one would expect from present levels of chlorine and bromine in the atmosphere , " geir braathen , the wmo 's top ozone expert , told reporters tuesday .
" it does n't look as if the ozone hole is going to get any bigger -lrb- in coming years -rrb- .
it seems like we have reached a plateau . " others scientists , such as frank jürgen diekmann of the european space agency , expect this year 's hole over the south pole to be the biggest ever , and doubt the danger is over . " if anything , the ozone concentration has stabilized , " he said .
" but especially in 2005 we ’ re expecting record ozone holes above the antarctic .
going on the latest data , we can ’ t say the danger is gone . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists can agree that levels seem to have stablized especially bad in south it ’ s been more than 18 years since 180 countries signed up to the montreal ozone protocol on reducing emissions of chlorofluorocarbons , -lrb- cfcs -rrb- , which up until then were considered indispensable chemicals for modern living . though there 's no actual " hole " in the ozone layer and only a slight thinning occurs over the rest of the world , climatic conditions are especially dangerous at the south pole .
it would take forty to fifty years for the ozone shield to recover completely - the same amount of time chlorofluorocarbons stay in the atmosphere . polar-stratospheric clouds , which form above the south pole when air masses can not mix in the dark winter months and end up collecting more and ore chlorine compounds , are struck by the southern spring 's sunlight from september to november .
that causes them to break into " radicals " that split ozone into an oxygen molecule and an oxygen atom , making it disappear . greenhouse gases dangerous in north these meteorological conditions can also be dangerous in the northern hemisphere , according to christoph brühl , of the max planck institute for chemistry in mainz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenhouse gasses like co2 endanger the northern hemisphere " the public is looking more and more at the antarctic in connection with the ozone hole , " he said .
" in principle though , the danger is just as great in the northern hemisphere , except that it does n't arise there every year because of various meteorological conditions . " greenhouse gas emissions can also influence the ozone , particularly in the northern hemisphere .
the gasses cool the upper stratosphere , the layer important for the formation of ozone .
if the layer gets too cold , a closed area similar to that over the south pole can form in winter , meaning air masses over the northern hemisphere can no longer exchange , damaging the ozone filter over europe , brühl explained . " up to now we 've always been lucky that the weather put an end to it in march , but that needn ’ t always be so , " he added .
" it could quite easily run into april and that would certainly raise the ultraviolet radiation into germany over the june level .

furthermore , security council reform was again delayed amid discord .

anyone who dreams of a capable and competent world governing body can only be disappointed by the united nations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.10.2005 conservative kaczynski wins polish election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warsaw mayor kaczynski beat the odds in a last minute victory poland on sunday elected the conservative , staunchly catholic lech kaczynski president by a definitive margin , bucking pre-vote surveys that had given his liberal rival the lead . kaczynski , of the law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party , garnered 55 percent of the vote compared with 45 percent for his liberal , europe-friendly opponent , donald tusk .
the numbers were officially reported , although a final vote count wo n't be published until monday afternoon . " mr chairman , mission accomplished , " kaczynski said at pis 's election evening in central warsaw , addressing his identical twin jaroslaw , who heads pis , and who last month refused the post of prime minister so as not to jeopardize his brother 's chances of being elected president . turnout for the in a run-off election was slightly more than 50 percent , up on the first round when it was less than 50 percent . last-minute win both of the presidential rivals cut their political teeth in the solidarity movement that in the 1980s helped poland shake off communism , but since then , they have moved apart ideologically . tusk 's civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- party embraced free-market liberalism and kaczynski a breed of polish conservatism that is close to the catholic church .
in the case of his pis party , it favors state intervention in the economy and social aid for the underprivileged . kaczynski 's victory mirrored what happened to his party in last month 's parliamentary election , when it pulled ahead of its opponents in the final straight to finish strongest , winning the right to choose poland 's next prime minister . pre-election polls had predicted since july that tusk would win , and showed the liberal in the lead up until the vote , although that lead had diminished by late friday . tusk lacked ' concept ' " tusk lost because of the mistakes he made in the final week of campaigning : there was no clear concept , and less activity at his headquarters , " said mikolaj czesnik , a political scientist from poland 's institute of sciences . at po 's decidedly more sombre election evening , tusk made no attempt to conceal his disappointment at losing . " i 'm not going to pretend , i 'm a little bit sad , " he said .
" if i have disappointed anyone , i ask them to forgive me .
i did what i could . " he congratulated kaczynski and assured his supporters that , although he had not won the presidency , he and po would " watch over what 's most important of all : the freedom of each and every pole .
we will ensure that the state never wrongs anyone again . " gracious winner kaczynski extended an olive branch to tusk , saying : " he fought a splendid battle … " i ask our friends in po to quickly end talks on forming a government , " he said . kaczynski 's campaign mirrored his conservatism , his traditional catholicism , and played on poles ' nationalism and the social inequality that is still apparent in poland , despite the burgeoning economy since the country joined the european union last year . " lech kaczynski waged a fear-factor campaign in the past few weeks , and he succeeded in scaring people , " said political analyst cornelius ochmann , from germany 's bertelsmann foundation .
" just as we saw in germany , people are scared of reforms . " his virulent anti-gay stance - he twice banned gay pride marches through warsaw - has won him support among poland 's conservative catholic voters .
poland 's next president - the third to be freely elected since the end of communism in 1989 - is to be sworn in on december 23 , when aleksander kwasniewski , who has held the office for two terms , stands down . dw staff / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former solidarity allies prepare for polish election battle two weeks after they finished neck and neck in the first round of poland 's presidential election , former comrades in arms donald tusk and lech kaczynski , are to face off sunday in a decisive vote for the presidency .

" we , the people of the united nations … . "
these are the first words of the preamble of the un charter .
but while it all sounds very lofty , it does n't have anything to do with reality .
in fact , governments , not people make the big decisions regarding the world organization .
and only a portion of these governments are democratically elected . dictatorial regimes have been , and are now , among the mightiest countries , that is , the five permanent security council members whose veto power can condemn the united nations to passivity .
and even countries with freely elected governments do n't always accurately represent their populations ; think of britain 's tony blair and spain 's jose maria aznar voting in favor of the iraq war , although the majority of their countrymen and women opposed it vehemently . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a vote at the un security council the first sentence of the preamble sums up the discrepancies that have plagued the united nations since it was founded 60 years ago .
during the cold war , the security council could only rarely fulfill its intended function : to provide for peace and security in the world .
true , blue-helmeted un peacekeepers have frequently played a role in bringing peace to a region in the aftermath of armed conflict .
but the key word here is " aftermath . "
in the vast majority of cases - think korea and vietnam - the united nations has been unable to prevent the outbreak of war .
in rwanda , the organization stood by as genocide took place before the eyes of the world . iraq as example it may be worth noting that , since the end of the east-west conflict in the late 1980s , the use of vetoes by the un security council has tended toward zero .
but the latest example , iraq , shows that the highest un committee can only stop armed conflict from occurring when all of the permanent members want to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general kofi annan addressing the general assembly if un secretary general kofi annan had his way , the organization would undergo reforms in this , its 60th year of existence , bringing it up to date with the 21st century .
but annan 's agenda was thoroughly diluted at the united nations summit in mid-september .
the famed " millennium goals " were approved - who would dare oppose fighting poverty and disease ? - but when it came to financing development aid , the countries once again left matters as nonbinding as possible .
furthermore , security council reform was again delayed amid discord .
and members skirted the issue of actually coming up with an official decision on what constitutes terrorism . forum for ideas once again , it became clear how difficult it is to agree on the future of the united nations .
anyone who dreams of a capable and competent world governing body can only be disappointed by the united nations .
a better option would be to view the united nations in a humbler light .
there are , in fact , areas where the organization gets the job done : the human rights charter , sub-organizations - such as the united nations children 's fund -lrb- unicef -rrb- - and international courts of law represent development milestones .
un organizations have repeatedly won the nobel peace prize , and with good reason .
this year the honor went to the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- and its chief , mohammed elbaradei .
in terms of world peace , though , the united nations is above all a form for exchanging ideas .

dw-world spoke to poland expert dieter bingen . the surprise winner of poland 's runoff presidential election on sunday , 56-year-old lech kaczynski of the conservative law and justice party -lrb- pis -rrb- has ruffled feathers by adopting a nationalistic tone during the election campaign , in particular signaling a tougher approach towards germany and russia . dw-world spoke to dieter bingen , head of the german-poland institute in darmstadt about what the election of the populist leader might mean for future ties between berlin and warsaw . dw-world : what have the poles voted for with lech kaczynski 's victory in the presidential runoff election on sunday ? dieter bingen : the poles have voted in favor of the promise to care more for the social concerns of the losers in society - a state with a heart so to speak - and for the promise that corruption and nepotism will be done away with .
in addition , they voted for kaczynski 's vow to pursue a stronger line in dealing with the communist past and the beneficiaries of the regime after 1990 . the media in germany is talking about a " shift towards right-wing attitudes " and that kaczynski is an anti-semite ?
how do you see it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech kaczynski speaks to supporters after his victory that 's absurd .
lech kaczynski is in no way an anti-semite .
he did get the support of groups and parties who have anti-semitic tendencies - he did take that into account , but he 's not anti-semitic himself though he does play on traditional national hostile stereotypes . and kaczynski 's election ca n't really be described unambiguously as a shift toward right-wing attitudes either .
kaczynski also has strong social aspects , particularly when it comes to the economy he 's rather left-leaning and he 's shown himself to be in favor of a welfare state .
these are elements that he courted very consciously in order to lure away a group of voters who supported the left-wing candidate in the first election phase .
thus he 's more structurally conservative if you will , and in an ideal sense paternalistic when it comes to values and also patriotic . what ramifications will the new situation in poland have for germany ? we 'll have to - at least initially - brace ourselves for some unpleasant situations and reckon with some emotional rhetoric that will question poland 's partnership with germany and in particular warsaw 's political relationship with germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and donald tusk in poland in august , 2005 donald tusk -lrb- of the pro-market civic platform who lost the presidential election to lech kaczynski -rrb- and angela merkel -lrb- germany 's new chancellor-designate -rrb- had already made common plans for the future .
do you think there will be any parallels between kaczynski and other parties in germany ? no , kaczynski did n't seek any contacts at all in germany .
he has no experience with foreign affairs and never gave it much importance . and , what does the new situation in poland mean for europe ? poland 's commitment to european integration in the eu 's political arena will probably not be promoted as much and there 's a danger that poland will isolate and marginalize itself .
poland will probably not pursue an active european policy , but will orient itself much more strongly towards the us . at the same time , that may be simply demonstrative and symbolic and things may appear different when it comes implementation - one has to make a distinction here between the heat of the election campaign and real politics . poland has after all profited from its membership in the eu , particularly its farmers .
does that mean that things wo n't fundamentally change with regard to economic and political ties ? precisely .
poland must have an interest in having allies in germany and not isolate itself in crucial looming budget talks .
if poland is n't constructive there , it can lose out badly . so , atmospherically there will be tensions between poland and germany but eventually we have to wait and see what happens next .

they ’ re warning that increased ozone loss is allowing additional harmful ultraviolet light to reach us and making us more vulnerable to sunburn , skin cancer and cataracts . about 20 kilometers -lrb- 12.4 miles -rrb- thick , the layer of ozone gas is like a giant umbrella 15 to 35 kilometers over the earth and like any good pair of sunglasses , it acts like a filter by blocking out most ultraviolet rays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a thin layer of ozone protects from numerous health problems the loss of ozone was discovered over the polar regions 20 years ago and has been closely watched ever since .
scientists continue to disagree about the causes and effects of the ozone level 's thinning , with some stating depletion levels have peaked . scientists divided on ozone depletion according to the united nations world meteorological organization 's latest bulletin , the seasonal hole above the south pole and antarctica is shrinking . " it is the third largest ever , more or less as one would expect from present levels of chlorine and bromine in the atmosphere , " geir braathen , the wmo 's top ozone expert , told reporters tuesday .
" it does n't look as if the ozone hole is going to get any bigger -lrb- in coming years -rrb- .
it seems like we have reached a plateau . " others scientists , such as frank jürgen diekmann of the european space agency , expect this year 's hole over the south pole to be the biggest ever , and doubt the danger is over . " if anything , the ozone concentration has stabilized , " he said .
" but especially in 2005 we ’ re expecting record ozone holes above the antarctic .
going on the latest data , we can ’ t say the danger is gone . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists can agree that levels seem to have stablized especially bad in south it ’ s been more than 18 years since 180 countries signed up to the montreal ozone protocol on reducing emissions of chlorofluorocarbons , -lrb- cfcs -rrb- , which up until then were considered indispensable chemicals for modern living . though there 's no actual " hole " in the ozone layer and only a slight thinning occurs over the rest of the world , climatic conditions are especially dangerous at the south pole .
it would take forty to fifty years for the ozone shield to recover completely - the same amount of time chlorofluorocarbons stay in the atmosphere . polar-stratospheric clouds , which form above the south pole when air masses can not mix in the dark winter months and end up collecting more and ore chlorine compounds , are struck by the southern spring 's sunlight from september to november .
that causes them to break into " radicals " that split ozone into an oxygen molecule and an oxygen atom , making it disappear . greenhouse gases dangerous in north these meteorological conditions can also be dangerous in the northern hemisphere , according to christoph brühl , of the max planck institute for chemistry in mainz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenhouse gasses like co2 endanger the northern hemisphere " the public is looking more and more at the antarctic in connection with the ozone hole , " he said .
" in principle though , the danger is just as great in the northern hemisphere , except that it does n't arise there every year because of various meteorological conditions . " greenhouse gas emissions can also influence the ozone , particularly in the northern hemisphere .
the gasses cool the upper stratosphere , the layer important for the formation of ozone .
if the layer gets too cold , a closed area similar to that over the south pole can form in winter , meaning air masses over the northern hemisphere can no longer exchange , damaging the ozone filter over europe , brühl explained . " up to now we 've always been lucky that the weather put an end to it in march , but that needn ’ t always be so , " he added .
" it could quite easily run into april and that would certainly raise the ultraviolet radiation into germany over the june level .

they ’ re warning that increased ozone loss is allowing additional harmful ultraviolet light to reach us and making us more vulnerable to sunburn , skin cancer and cataracts . about 20 kilometers -lrb- 12.4 miles -rrb- thick , the layer of ozone gas is like a giant umbrella 15 to 35 kilometers over the earth and like any good pair of sunglasses , it acts like a filter by blocking out most ultraviolet rays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a thin layer of ozone protects from numerous health problems the loss of ozone was discovered over the polar regions 20 years ago and has been closely watched ever since .
scientists continue to disagree about the causes and effects of the ozone level 's thinning , with some stating depletion levels have peaked . scientists divided on ozone depletion according to the united nations world meteorological organization 's latest bulletin , the seasonal hole above the south pole and antarctica is shrinking . " it is the third largest ever , more or less as one would expect from present levels of chlorine and bromine in the atmosphere , " geir braathen , the wmo 's top ozone expert , told reporters tuesday .
" it does n't look as if the ozone hole is going to get any bigger -lrb- in coming years -rrb- .
it seems like we have reached a plateau . " others scientists , such as frank jürgen diekmann of the european space agency , expect this year 's hole over the south pole to be the biggest ever , and doubt the danger is over . " if anything , the ozone concentration has stabilized , " he said .
" but especially in 2005 we ’ re expecting record ozone holes above the antarctic .
going on the latest data , we can ’ t say the danger is gone . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists can agree that levels seem to have stablized especially bad in south it ’ s been more than 18 years since 180 countries signed up to the montreal ozone protocol on reducing emissions of chlorofluorocarbons , -lrb- cfcs -rrb- , which up until then were considered indispensable chemicals for modern living . though there 's no actual " hole " in the ozone layer and only a slight thinning occurs over the rest of the world , climatic conditions are especially dangerous at the south pole .
it would take forty to fifty years for the ozone shield to recover completely - the same amount of time chlorofluorocarbons stay in the atmosphere . polar-stratospheric clouds , which form above the south pole when air masses can not mix in the dark winter months and end up collecting more and ore chlorine compounds , are struck by the southern spring 's sunlight from september to november .
that causes them to break into " radicals " that split ozone into an oxygen molecule and an oxygen atom , making it disappear . greenhouse gases dangerous in north these meteorological conditions can also be dangerous in the northern hemisphere , according to christoph brühl , of the max planck institute for chemistry in mainz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenhouse gasses like co2 endanger the northern hemisphere " the public is looking more and more at the antarctic in connection with the ozone hole , " he said .
" in principle though , the danger is just as great in the northern hemisphere , except that it does n't arise there every year because of various meteorological conditions . " greenhouse gas emissions can also influence the ozone , particularly in the northern hemisphere .
the gasses cool the upper stratosphere , the layer important for the formation of ozone .
if the layer gets too cold , a closed area similar to that over the south pole can form in winter , meaning air masses over the northern hemisphere can no longer exchange , damaging the ozone filter over europe , brühl explained . " up to now we 've always been lucky that the weather put an end to it in march , but that needn ’ t always be so , " he added .
" it could quite easily run into april and that would certainly raise the ultraviolet radiation into germany over the june level .

should berlin be worried ?
dw-world spoke to poland expert dieter bingen . the surprise winner of poland 's runoff presidential election on sunday , 56-year-old lech kaczynski of the conservative law and justice party -lrb- pis -rrb- has ruffled feathers by adopting a nationalistic tone during the election campaign , in particular signaling a tougher approach towards germany and russia . dw-world spoke to dieter bingen , head of the german-poland institute in darmstadt about what the election of the populist leader might mean for future ties between berlin and warsaw . dw-world : what have the poles voted for with lech kaczynski 's victory in the presidential runoff election on sunday ? dieter bingen : the poles have voted in favor of the promise to care more for the social concerns of the losers in society - a state with a heart so to speak - and for the promise that corruption and nepotism will be done away with .
in addition , they voted for kaczynski 's vow to pursue a stronger line in dealing with the communist past and the beneficiaries of the regime after 1990 . the media in germany is talking about a " shift towards right-wing attitudes " and that kaczynski is an anti-semite ?
how do you see it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech kaczynski speaks to supporters after his victory that 's absurd .
lech kaczynski is in no way an anti-semite .
he did get the support of groups and parties who have anti-semitic tendencies - he did take that into account , but he 's not anti-semitic himself though he does play on traditional national hostile stereotypes . and kaczynski 's election ca n't really be described unambiguously as a shift toward right-wing attitudes either .
kaczynski also has strong social aspects , particularly when it comes to the economy he 's rather left-leaning and he 's shown himself to be in favor of a welfare state .
these are elements that he courted very consciously in order to lure away a group of voters who supported the left-wing candidate in the first election phase .
thus he 's more structurally conservative if you will , and in an ideal sense paternalistic when it comes to values and also patriotic . what ramifications will the new situation in poland have for germany ? we 'll have to - at least initially - brace ourselves for some unpleasant situations and reckon with some emotional rhetoric that will question poland 's partnership with germany and in particular warsaw 's political relationship with germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and donald tusk in poland in august , 2005 donald tusk -lrb- of the pro-market civic platform who lost the presidential election to lech kaczynski -rrb- and angela merkel -lrb- germany 's new chancellor-designate -rrb- had already made common plans for the future .
do you think there will be any parallels between kaczynski and other parties in germany ? no , kaczynski did n't seek any contacts at all in germany .
he has no experience with foreign affairs and never gave it much importance . and , what does the new situation in poland mean for europe ? poland 's commitment to european integration in the eu 's political arena will probably not be promoted as much and there 's a danger that poland will isolate and marginalize itself .
poland will probably not pursue an active european policy , but will orient itself much more strongly towards the us . at the same time , that may be simply demonstrative and symbolic and things may appear different when it comes implementation - one has to make a distinction here between the heat of the election campaign and real politics . poland has after all profited from its membership in the eu , particularly its farmers .
does that mean that things wo n't fundamentally change with regard to economic and political ties ? precisely .
poland must have an interest in having allies in germany and not isolate itself in crucial looming budget talks .
if poland is n't constructive there , it can lose out badly . so , atmospherically there will be tensions between poland and germany but eventually we have to wait and see what happens next .
it 's all open .
the civic platform as a coalition partner must ensure that the worst fears do n't become reality . the interview was conducted by pablo kummetz -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conservative kaczynski wins polish election poland on sunday elected the conservative , staunchly catholic lech kaczynski president by a definitive margin , bucking pre-vote surveys that had given his liberal rival the lead .

the numbers were officially reported , although a final vote count wo n't be published until monday afternoon . " mr chairman , mission accomplished , " kaczynski said at pis 's election evening in central warsaw , addressing his identical twin jaroslaw , who heads pis , and who last month refused the post of prime minister so as not to jeopardize his brother 's chances of being elected president . turnout for the in a run-off election was slightly more than 50 percent , up on the first round when it was less than 50 percent . last-minute win both of the presidential rivals cut their political teeth in the solidarity movement that in the 1980s helped poland shake off communism , but since then , they have moved apart ideologically . tusk 's civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- party embraced free-market liberalism and kaczynski a breed of polish conservatism that is close to the catholic church .
in the case of his pis party , it favors state intervention in the economy and social aid for the underprivileged . kaczynski 's victory mirrored what happened to his party in last month 's parliamentary election , when it pulled ahead of its opponents in the final straight to finish strongest , winning the right to choose poland 's next prime minister . pre-election polls had predicted since july that tusk would win , and showed the liberal in the lead up until the vote , although that lead had diminished by late friday . tusk lacked ' concept ' " tusk lost because of the mistakes he made in the final week of campaigning : there was no clear concept , and less activity at his headquarters , " said mikolaj czesnik , a political scientist from poland 's institute of sciences . at po 's decidedly more sombre election evening , tusk made no attempt to conceal his disappointment at losing . " i 'm not going to pretend , i 'm a little bit sad , " he said .
" if i have disappointed anyone , i ask them to forgive me .
i did what i could . " he congratulated kaczynski and assured his supporters that , although he had not won the presidency , he and po would " watch over what 's most important of all : the freedom of each and every pole .
we will ensure that the state never wrongs anyone again . " gracious winner kaczynski extended an olive branch to tusk , saying : " he fought a splendid battle … " i ask our friends in po to quickly end talks on forming a government , " he said . kaczynski 's campaign mirrored his conservatism , his traditional catholicism , and played on poles ' nationalism and the social inequality that is still apparent in poland , despite the burgeoning economy since the country joined the european union last year . " lech kaczynski waged a fear-factor campaign in the past few weeks , and he succeeded in scaring people , " said political analyst cornelius ochmann , from germany 's bertelsmann foundation .
" just as we saw in germany , people are scared of reforms . " his virulent anti-gay stance - he twice banned gay pride marches through warsaw - has won him support among poland 's conservative catholic voters .
poland 's next president - the third to be freely elected since the end of communism in 1989 - is to be sworn in on december 23 , when aleksander kwasniewski , who has held the office for two terms , stands down . dw staff / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former solidarity allies prepare for polish election battle two weeks after they finished neck and neck in the first round of poland 's presidential election , former comrades in arms donald tusk and lech kaczynski , are to face off sunday in a decisive vote for the presidency .

scientists continue to disagree about the causes and effects of the ozone level 's thinning , with some stating depletion levels have peaked . scientists divided on ozone depletion according to the united nations world meteorological organization 's latest bulletin , the seasonal hole above the south pole and antarctica is shrinking . " it is the third largest ever , more or less as one would expect from present levels of chlorine and bromine in the atmosphere , " geir braathen , the wmo 's top ozone expert , told reporters tuesday .
" it does n't look as if the ozone hole is going to get any bigger -lrb- in coming years -rrb- .
it seems like we have reached a plateau . " others scientists , such as frank jürgen diekmann of the european space agency , expect this year 's hole over the south pole to be the biggest ever , and doubt the danger is over . " if anything , the ozone concentration has stabilized , " he said .

it would take forty to fifty years for the ozone shield to recover completely - the same amount of time chlorofluorocarbons stay in the atmosphere . polar-stratospheric clouds , which form above the south pole when air masses can not mix in the dark winter months and end up collecting more and ore chlorine compounds , are struck by the southern spring 's sunlight from september to november .

" in principle though , the danger is just as great in the northern hemisphere , except that it does n't arise there every year because of various meteorological conditions . " greenhouse gas emissions can also influence the ozone , particularly in the northern hemisphere .
the gasses cool the upper stratosphere , the layer important for the formation of ozone .
if the layer gets too cold , a closed area similar to that over the south pole can form in winter , meaning air masses over the northern hemisphere can no longer exchange , damaging the ozone filter over europe , brühl explained .

" we , the people of the united nations … . "
these are the first words of the preamble of the un charter .
but while it all sounds very lofty , it does n't have anything to do with reality .
in fact , governments , not people make the big decisions regarding the world organization .
and only a portion of these governments are democratically elected . dictatorial regimes have been , and are now , among the mightiest countries , that is , the five permanent security council members whose veto power can condemn the united nations to passivity .
and even countries with freely elected governments do n't always accurately represent their populations ; think of britain 's tony blair and spain 's jose maria aznar voting in favor of the iraq war , although the majority of their countrymen and women opposed it vehemently . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a vote at the un security council the first sentence of the preamble sums up the discrepancies that have plagued the united nations since it was founded 60 years ago .
during the cold war , the security council could only rarely fulfill its intended function : to provide for peace and security in the world .
true , blue-helmeted un peacekeepers have frequently played a role in bringing peace to a region in the aftermath of armed conflict .
but the key word here is " aftermath . "
in the vast majority of cases - think korea and vietnam - the united nations has been unable to prevent the outbreak of war .
in rwanda , the organization stood by as genocide took place before the eyes of the world . iraq as example it may be worth noting that , since the end of the east-west conflict in the late 1980s , the use of vetoes by the un security council has tended toward zero .
but the latest example , iraq , shows that the highest un committee can only stop armed conflict from occurring when all of the permanent members want to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general kofi annan addressing the general assembly if un secretary general kofi annan had his way , the organization would undergo reforms in this , its 60th year of existence , bringing it up to date with the 21st century .
but annan 's agenda was thoroughly diluted at the united nations summit in mid-september .
the famed " millennium goals " were approved - who would dare oppose fighting poverty and disease ? - but when it came to financing development aid , the countries once again left matters as nonbinding as possible .
furthermore , security council reform was again delayed amid discord .
and members skirted the issue of actually coming up with an official decision on what constitutes terrorism . forum for ideas once again , it became clear how difficult it is to agree on the future of the united nations .
anyone who dreams of a capable and competent world governing body can only be disappointed by the united nations .
a better option would be to view the united nations in a humbler light .
there are , in fact , areas where the organization gets the job done : the human rights charter , sub-organizations - such as the united nations children 's fund -lrb- unicef -rrb- - and international courts of law represent development milestones .
un organizations have repeatedly won the nobel peace prize , and with good reason .
this year the honor went to the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- and its chief , mohammed elbaradei .
in terms of world peace , though , the united nations is above all a form for exchanging ideas .
in certain cases concrete peace measures are undertaken .
but in the end , the un is n't responsible for bringing peace to the world - that is the job of the 191 member states . klaus dahmann -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe , us bicker over development aid members of the european union have called on the united states to commit itself to the fight against poverty and provide more money with fewer restrictions to the developing world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.10.2005 ozone hole could grow bigger than ever großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists still disagree on the stability of ozone layer levels ozone levels looked like they were stabilizing , but this year a bigger than normal hole could open above the south pole . the protective ozone layer over the earth has thinned to its lowest level ever , alarming scientists who believed it had begun to heal .
they ’ re warning that increased ozone loss is allowing additional harmful ultraviolet light to reach us and making us more vulnerable to sunburn , skin cancer and cataracts . about 20 kilometers -lrb- 12.4 miles -rrb- thick , the layer of ozone gas is like a giant umbrella 15 to 35 kilometers over the earth and like any good pair of sunglasses , it acts like a filter by blocking out most ultraviolet rays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a thin layer of ozone protects from numerous health problems the loss of ozone was discovered over the polar regions 20 years ago and has been closely watched ever since .
scientists continue to disagree about the causes and effects of the ozone level 's thinning , with some stating depletion levels have peaked . scientists divided on ozone depletion according to the united nations world meteorological organization 's latest bulletin , the seasonal hole above the south pole and antarctica is shrinking . " it is the third largest ever , more or less as one would expect from present levels of chlorine and bromine in the atmosphere , " geir braathen , the wmo 's top ozone expert , told reporters tuesday .
" it does n't look as if the ozone hole is going to get any bigger -lrb- in coming years -rrb- .
it seems like we have reached a plateau . " others scientists , such as frank jürgen diekmann of the european space agency , expect this year 's hole over the south pole to be the biggest ever , and doubt the danger is over . " if anything , the ozone concentration has stabilized , " he said .
" but especially in 2005 we ’ re expecting record ozone holes above the antarctic .
going on the latest data , we can ’ t say the danger is gone . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists can agree that levels seem to have stablized especially bad in south it ’ s been more than 18 years since 180 countries signed up to the montreal ozone protocol on reducing emissions of chlorofluorocarbons , -lrb- cfcs -rrb- , which up until then were considered indispensable chemicals for modern living . though there 's no actual " hole " in the ozone layer and only a slight thinning occurs over the rest of the world , climatic conditions are especially dangerous at the south pole .
it would take forty to fifty years for the ozone shield to recover completely - the same amount of time chlorofluorocarbons stay in the atmosphere . polar-stratospheric clouds , which form above the south pole when air masses can not mix in the dark winter months and end up collecting more and ore chlorine compounds , are struck by the southern spring 's sunlight from september to november .
that causes them to break into " radicals " that split ozone into an oxygen molecule and an oxygen atom , making it disappear . greenhouse gases dangerous in north these meteorological conditions can also be dangerous in the northern hemisphere , according to christoph brühl , of the max planck institute for chemistry in mainz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenhouse gasses like co2 endanger the northern hemisphere " the public is looking more and more at the antarctic in connection with the ozone hole , " he said .
" in principle though , the danger is just as great in the northern hemisphere , except that it does n't arise there every year because of various meteorological conditions . " greenhouse gas emissions can also influence the ozone , particularly in the northern hemisphere .
the gasses cool the upper stratosphere , the layer important for the formation of ozone .
if the layer gets too cold , a closed area similar to that over the south pole can form in winter , meaning air masses over the northern hemisphere can no longer exchange , damaging the ozone filter over europe , brühl explained . " up to now we 've always been lucky that the weather put an end to it in march , but that needn ’ t always be so , " he added .
" it could quite easily run into april and that would certainly raise the ultraviolet radiation into germany over the june level .

should berlin be worried ?
dw-world spoke to poland expert dieter bingen . the surprise winner of poland 's runoff presidential election on sunday , 56-year-old lech kaczynski of the conservative law and justice party -lrb- pis -rrb- has ruffled feathers by adopting a nationalistic tone during the election campaign , in particular signaling a tougher approach towards germany and russia . dw-world spoke to dieter bingen , head of the german-poland institute in darmstadt about what the election of the populist leader might mean for future ties between berlin and warsaw . dw-world : what have the poles voted for with lech kaczynski 's victory in the presidential runoff election on sunday ? dieter bingen : the poles have voted in favor of the promise to care more for the social concerns of the losers in society - a state with a heart so to speak - and for the promise that corruption and nepotism will be done away with .
in addition , they voted for kaczynski 's vow to pursue a stronger line in dealing with the communist past and the beneficiaries of the regime after 1990 . the media in germany is talking about a " shift towards right-wing attitudes " and that kaczynski is an anti-semite ?
how do you see it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech kaczynski speaks to supporters after his victory that 's absurd .
lech kaczynski is in no way an anti-semite .
he did get the support of groups and parties who have anti-semitic tendencies - he did take that into account , but he 's not anti-semitic himself though he does play on traditional national hostile stereotypes . and kaczynski 's election ca n't really be described unambiguously as a shift toward right-wing attitudes either .
kaczynski also has strong social aspects , particularly when it comes to the economy he 's rather left-leaning and he 's shown himself to be in favor of a welfare state .
these are elements that he courted very consciously in order to lure away a group of voters who supported the left-wing candidate in the first election phase .
thus he 's more structurally conservative if you will , and in an ideal sense paternalistic when it comes to values and also patriotic . what ramifications will the new situation in poland have for germany ? we 'll have to - at least initially - brace ourselves for some unpleasant situations and reckon with some emotional rhetoric that will question poland 's partnership with germany and in particular warsaw 's political relationship with germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and donald tusk in poland in august , 2005 donald tusk -lrb- of the pro-market civic platform who lost the presidential election to lech kaczynski -rrb- and angela merkel -lrb- germany 's new chancellor-designate -rrb- had already made common plans for the future .
do you think there will be any parallels between kaczynski and other parties in germany ? no , kaczynski did n't seek any contacts at all in germany .
he has no experience with foreign affairs and never gave it much importance . and , what does the new situation in poland mean for europe ? poland 's commitment to european integration in the eu 's political arena will probably not be promoted as much and there 's a danger that poland will isolate and marginalize itself .
poland will probably not pursue an active european policy , but will orient itself much more strongly towards the us . at the same time , that may be simply demonstrative and symbolic and things may appear different when it comes implementation - one has to make a distinction here between the heat of the election campaign and real politics . poland has after all profited from its membership in the eu , particularly its farmers .
does that mean that things wo n't fundamentally change with regard to economic and political ties ? precisely .
poland must have an interest in having allies in germany and not isolate itself in crucial looming budget talks .
if poland is n't constructive there , it can lose out badly . so , atmospherically there will be tensions between poland and germany but eventually we have to wait and see what happens next .

" we , the people of the united nations … . "
these are the first words of the preamble of the un charter .
but while it all sounds very lofty , it does n't have anything to do with reality .
in fact , governments , not people make the big decisions regarding the world organization .
and only a portion of these governments are democratically elected . dictatorial regimes have been , and are now , among the mightiest countries , that is , the five permanent security council members whose veto power can condemn the united nations to passivity .
and even countries with freely elected governments do n't always accurately represent their populations ; think of britain 's tony blair and spain 's jose maria aznar voting in favor of the iraq war , although the majority of their countrymen and women opposed it vehemently . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a vote at the un security council the first sentence of the preamble sums up the discrepancies that have plagued the united nations since it was founded 60 years ago .
during the cold war , the security council could only rarely fulfill its intended function : to provide for peace and security in the world .
true , blue-helmeted un peacekeepers have frequently played a role in bringing peace to a region in the aftermath of armed conflict .
but the key word here is " aftermath . "
in the vast majority of cases - think korea and vietnam - the united nations has been unable to prevent the outbreak of war .
in rwanda , the organization stood by as genocide took place before the eyes of the world . iraq as example it may be worth noting that , since the end of the east-west conflict in the late 1980s , the use of vetoes by the un security council has tended toward zero .
but the latest example , iraq , shows that the highest un committee can only stop armed conflict from occurring when all of the permanent members want to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general kofi annan addressing the general assembly if un secretary general kofi annan had his way , the organization would undergo reforms in this , its 60th year of existence , bringing it up to date with the 21st century .
but annan 's agenda was thoroughly diluted at the united nations summit in mid-september .
the famed " millennium goals " were approved - who would dare oppose fighting poverty and disease ? - but when it came to financing development aid , the countries once again left matters as nonbinding as possible .
furthermore , security council reform was again delayed amid discord .
and members skirted the issue of actually coming up with an official decision on what constitutes terrorism . forum for ideas once again , it became clear how difficult it is to agree on the future of the united nations .
anyone who dreams of a capable and competent world governing body can only be disappointed by the united nations .
a better option would be to view the united nations in a humbler light .
there are , in fact , areas where the organization gets the job done : the human rights charter , sub-organizations - such as the united nations children 's fund -lrb- unicef -rrb- - and international courts of law represent development milestones .
un organizations have repeatedly won the nobel peace prize , and with good reason .
this year the honor went to the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- and its chief , mohammed elbaradei .
in terms of world peace , though , the united nations is above all a form for exchanging ideas .
in certain cases concrete peace measures are undertaken .
but in the end , the un is n't responsible for bringing peace to the world - that is the job of the 191 member states . klaus dahmann -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe , us bicker over development aid members of the european union have called on the united states to commit itself to the fight against poverty and provide more money with fewer restrictions to the developing world .

3 , 2005 -rrb- competing plans threaten un reform germany , brazil , india and japan have submitted a draft resolution on a proposed expansion of the un security council and want an early vote in the general assembly .
but rival plans are complicating matters .

they ’ re warning that increased ozone loss is allowing additional harmful ultraviolet light to reach us and making us more vulnerable to sunburn , skin cancer and cataracts . about 20 kilometers -lrb- 12.4 miles -rrb- thick , the layer of ozone gas is like a giant umbrella 15 to 35 kilometers over the earth and like any good pair of sunglasses , it acts like a filter by blocking out most ultraviolet rays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a thin layer of ozone protects from numerous health problems the loss of ozone was discovered over the polar regions 20 years ago and has been closely watched ever since .
scientists continue to disagree about the causes and effects of the ozone level 's thinning , with some stating depletion levels have peaked . scientists divided on ozone depletion according to the united nations world meteorological organization 's latest bulletin , the seasonal hole above the south pole and antarctica is shrinking . " it is the third largest ever , more or less as one would expect from present levels of chlorine and bromine in the atmosphere , " geir braathen , the wmo 's top ozone expert , told reporters tuesday .
" it does n't look as if the ozone hole is going to get any bigger -lrb- in coming years -rrb- .
it seems like we have reached a plateau . " others scientists , such as frank jürgen diekmann of the european space agency , expect this year 's hole over the south pole to be the biggest ever , and doubt the danger is over . " if anything , the ozone concentration has stabilized , " he said .
" but especially in 2005 we ’ re expecting record ozone holes above the antarctic .
going on the latest data , we can ’ t say the danger is gone . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists can agree that levels seem to have stablized especially bad in south it ’ s been more than 18 years since 180 countries signed up to the montreal ozone protocol on reducing emissions of chlorofluorocarbons , -lrb- cfcs -rrb- , which up until then were considered indispensable chemicals for modern living . though there 's no actual " hole " in the ozone layer and only a slight thinning occurs over the rest of the world , climatic conditions are especially dangerous at the south pole .
it would take forty to fifty years for the ozone shield to recover completely - the same amount of time chlorofluorocarbons stay in the atmosphere . polar-stratospheric clouds , which form above the south pole when air masses can not mix in the dark winter months and end up collecting more and ore chlorine compounds , are struck by the southern spring 's sunlight from september to november .
that causes them to break into " radicals " that split ozone into an oxygen molecule and an oxygen atom , making it disappear . greenhouse gases dangerous in north these meteorological conditions can also be dangerous in the northern hemisphere , according to christoph brühl , of the max planck institute for chemistry in mainz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenhouse gasses like co2 endanger the northern hemisphere " the public is looking more and more at the antarctic in connection with the ozone hole , " he said .
" in principle though , the danger is just as great in the northern hemisphere , except that it does n't arise there every year because of various meteorological conditions . " greenhouse gas emissions can also influence the ozone , particularly in the northern hemisphere .
the gasses cool the upper stratosphere , the layer important for the formation of ozone .
if the layer gets too cold , a closed area similar to that over the south pole can form in winter , meaning air masses over the northern hemisphere can no longer exchange , damaging the ozone filter over europe , brühl explained . " up to now we 've always been lucky that the weather put an end to it in march , but that needn ’ t always be so , " he added .

dw-world spoke to poland expert dieter bingen . the surprise winner of poland 's runoff presidential election on sunday , 56-year-old lech kaczynski of the conservative law and justice party -lrb- pis -rrb- has ruffled feathers by adopting a nationalistic tone during the election campaign , in particular signaling a tougher approach towards germany and russia . dw-world spoke to dieter bingen , head of the german-poland institute in darmstadt about what the election of the populist leader might mean for future ties between berlin and warsaw . dw-world : what have the poles voted for with lech kaczynski 's victory in the presidential runoff election on sunday ? dieter bingen : the poles have voted in favor of the promise to care more for the social concerns of the losers in society - a state with a heart so to speak - and for the promise that corruption and nepotism will be done away with .
in addition , they voted for kaczynski 's vow to pursue a stronger line in dealing with the communist past and the beneficiaries of the regime after 1990 . the media in germany is talking about a " shift towards right-wing attitudes " and that kaczynski is an anti-semite ?
how do you see it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech kaczynski speaks to supporters after his victory that 's absurd .
lech kaczynski is in no way an anti-semite .
he did get the support of groups and parties who have anti-semitic tendencies - he did take that into account , but he 's not anti-semitic himself though he does play on traditional national hostile stereotypes . and kaczynski 's election ca n't really be described unambiguously as a shift toward right-wing attitudes either .
kaczynski also has strong social aspects , particularly when it comes to the economy he 's rather left-leaning and he 's shown himself to be in favor of a welfare state .
these are elements that he courted very consciously in order to lure away a group of voters who supported the left-wing candidate in the first election phase .
thus he 's more structurally conservative if you will , and in an ideal sense paternalistic when it comes to values and also patriotic . what ramifications will the new situation in poland have for germany ? we 'll have to - at least initially - brace ourselves for some unpleasant situations and reckon with some emotional rhetoric that will question poland 's partnership with germany and in particular warsaw 's political relationship with germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and donald tusk in poland in august , 2005 donald tusk -lrb- of the pro-market civic platform who lost the presidential election to lech kaczynski -rrb- and angela merkel -lrb- germany 's new chancellor-designate -rrb- had already made common plans for the future .
do you think there will be any parallels between kaczynski and other parties in germany ? no , kaczynski did n't seek any contacts at all in germany .
he has no experience with foreign affairs and never gave it much importance . and , what does the new situation in poland mean for europe ? poland 's commitment to european integration in the eu 's political arena will probably not be promoted as much and there 's a danger that poland will isolate and marginalize itself .
poland will probably not pursue an active european policy , but will orient itself much more strongly towards the us . at the same time , that may be simply demonstrative and symbolic and things may appear different when it comes implementation - one has to make a distinction here between the heat of the election campaign and real politics . poland has after all profited from its membership in the eu , particularly its farmers .

" we , the people of the united nations … . "
these are the first words of the preamble of the un charter .
but while it all sounds very lofty , it does n't have anything to do with reality .
in fact , governments , not people make the big decisions regarding the world organization .
and only a portion of these governments are democratically elected . dictatorial regimes have been , and are now , among the mightiest countries , that is , the five permanent security council members whose veto power can condemn the united nations to passivity .
and even countries with freely elected governments do n't always accurately represent their populations ; think of britain 's tony blair and spain 's jose maria aznar voting in favor of the iraq war , although the majority of their countrymen and women opposed it vehemently . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a vote at the un security council the first sentence of the preamble sums up the discrepancies that have plagued the united nations since it was founded 60 years ago .
during the cold war , the security council could only rarely fulfill its intended function : to provide for peace and security in the world .
true , blue-helmeted un peacekeepers have frequently played a role in bringing peace to a region in the aftermath of armed conflict .
but the key word here is " aftermath . "
in the vast majority of cases - think korea and vietnam - the united nations has been unable to prevent the outbreak of war .
in rwanda , the organization stood by as genocide took place before the eyes of the world . iraq as example it may be worth noting that , since the end of the east-west conflict in the late 1980s , the use of vetoes by the un security council has tended toward zero .
but the latest example , iraq , shows that the highest un committee can only stop armed conflict from occurring when all of the permanent members want to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general kofi annan addressing the general assembly if un secretary general kofi annan had his way , the organization would undergo reforms in this , its 60th year of existence , bringing it up to date with the 21st century .
but annan 's agenda was thoroughly diluted at the united nations summit in mid-september .
the famed " millennium goals " were approved - who would dare oppose fighting poverty and disease ? - but when it came to financing development aid , the countries once again left matters as nonbinding as possible .
furthermore , security council reform was again delayed amid discord .
and members skirted the issue of actually coming up with an official decision on what constitutes terrorism . forum for ideas once again , it became clear how difficult it is to agree on the future of the united nations .
anyone who dreams of a capable and competent world governing body can only be disappointed by the united nations .
a better option would be to view the united nations in a humbler light .
there are , in fact , areas where the organization gets the job done : the human rights charter , sub-organizations - such as the united nations children 's fund -lrb- unicef -rrb- - and international courts of law represent development milestones .
un organizations have repeatedly won the nobel peace prize , and with good reason .
this year the honor went to the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- and its chief , mohammed elbaradei .
in terms of world peace , though , the united nations is above all a form for exchanging ideas .
in certain cases concrete peace measures are undertaken .
but in the end , the un is n't responsible for bringing peace to the world - that is the job of the 191 member states . klaus dahmann -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe , us bicker over development aid members of the european union have called on the united states to commit itself to the fight against poverty and provide more money with fewer restrictions to the developing world .

3 , 2005 -rrb- competing plans threaten un reform germany , brazil , india and japan have submitted a draft resolution on a proposed expansion of the un security council and want an early vote in the general assembly .
but rival plans are complicating matters .
-lrb- july 11 , 2005 -rrb- g4 nations bid for permanent security council seat germany , japan , brazil and india - the so-called g4 group - launched a joint effort for permament seats on the united nations security council after meeting on the fringes of the un general assembly in new york .

in addition , they voted for kaczynski 's vow to pursue a stronger line in dealing with the communist past and the beneficiaries of the regime after 1990 . the media in germany is talking about a " shift towards right-wing attitudes " and that kaczynski is an anti-semite ?
how do you see it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech kaczynski speaks to supporters after his victory that 's absurd .
lech kaczynski is in no way an anti-semite .
he did get the support of groups and parties who have anti-semitic tendencies - he did take that into account , but he 's not anti-semitic himself though he does play on traditional national hostile stereotypes . and kaczynski 's election ca n't really be described unambiguously as a shift toward right-wing attitudes either .
kaczynski also has strong social aspects , particularly when it comes to the economy he 's rather left-leaning and he 's shown himself to be in favor of a welfare state .
these are elements that he courted very consciously in order to lure away a group of voters who supported the left-wing candidate in the first election phase .
thus he 's more structurally conservative if you will , and in an ideal sense paternalistic when it comes to values and also patriotic . what ramifications will the new situation in poland have for germany ? we 'll have to - at least initially - brace ourselves for some unpleasant situations and reckon with some emotional rhetoric that will question poland 's partnership with germany and in particular warsaw 's political relationship with germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and donald tusk in poland in august , 2005 donald tusk -lrb- of the pro-market civic platform who lost the presidential election to lech kaczynski -rrb- and angela merkel -lrb- germany 's new chancellor-designate -rrb- had already made common plans for the future .
do you think there will be any parallels between kaczynski and other parties in germany ? no , kaczynski did n't seek any contacts at all in germany .
he has no experience with foreign affairs and never gave it much importance . and , what does the new situation in poland mean for europe ? poland 's commitment to european integration in the eu 's political arena will probably not be promoted as much and there 's a danger that poland will isolate and marginalize itself .
poland will probably not pursue an active european policy , but will orient itself much more strongly towards the us . at the same time , that may be simply demonstrative and symbolic and things may appear different when it comes implementation - one has to make a distinction here between the heat of the election campaign and real politics . poland has after all profited from its membership in the eu , particularly its farmers .
does that mean that things wo n't fundamentally change with regard to economic and political ties ? precisely .
poland must have an interest in having allies in germany and not isolate itself in crucial looming budget talks .
if poland is n't constructive there , it can lose out badly . so , atmospherically there will be tensions between poland and germany but eventually we have to wait and see what happens next .
it 's all open .
the civic platform as a coalition partner must ensure that the worst fears do n't become reality . the interview was conducted by pablo kummetz -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conservative kaczynski wins polish election poland on sunday elected the conservative , staunchly catholic lech kaczynski president by a definitive margin , bucking pre-vote surveys that had given his liberal rival the lead .

" we , the people of the united nations … . "
these are the first words of the preamble of the un charter .
but while it all sounds very lofty , it does n't have anything to do with reality .
in fact , governments , not people make the big decisions regarding the world organization .
and only a portion of these governments are democratically elected . dictatorial regimes have been , and are now , among the mightiest countries , that is , the five permanent security council members whose veto power can condemn the united nations to passivity .
and even countries with freely elected governments do n't always accurately represent their populations ; think of britain 's tony blair and spain 's jose maria aznar voting in favor of the iraq war , although the majority of their countrymen and women opposed it vehemently . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a vote at the un security council the first sentence of the preamble sums up the discrepancies that have plagued the united nations since it was founded 60 years ago .
during the cold war , the security council could only rarely fulfill its intended function : to provide for peace and security in the world .
true , blue-helmeted un peacekeepers have frequently played a role in bringing peace to a region in the aftermath of armed conflict .
but the key word here is " aftermath . "
in the vast majority of cases - think korea and vietnam - the united nations has been unable to prevent the outbreak of war .
in rwanda , the organization stood by as genocide took place before the eyes of the world . iraq as example it may be worth noting that , since the end of the east-west conflict in the late 1980s , the use of vetoes by the un security council has tended toward zero .
but the latest example , iraq , shows that the highest un committee can only stop armed conflict from occurring when all of the permanent members want to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general kofi annan addressing the general assembly if un secretary general kofi annan had his way , the organization would undergo reforms in this , its 60th year of existence , bringing it up to date with the 21st century .
but annan 's agenda was thoroughly diluted at the united nations summit in mid-september .
the famed " millennium goals " were approved - who would dare oppose fighting poverty and disease ? - but when it came to financing development aid , the countries once again left matters as nonbinding as possible .
furthermore , security council reform was again delayed amid discord .
and members skirted the issue of actually coming up with an official decision on what constitutes terrorism . forum for ideas once again , it became clear how difficult it is to agree on the future of the united nations .
anyone who dreams of a capable and competent world governing body can only be disappointed by the united nations .
a better option would be to view the united nations in a humbler light .
there are , in fact , areas where the organization gets the job done : the human rights charter , sub-organizations - such as the united nations children 's fund -lrb- unicef -rrb- - and international courts of law represent development milestones .
un organizations have repeatedly won the nobel peace prize , and with good reason .
this year the honor went to the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- and its chief , mohammed elbaradei .
in terms of world peace , though , the united nations is above all a form for exchanging ideas .
in certain cases concrete peace measures are undertaken .
but in the end , the un is n't responsible for bringing peace to the world - that is the job of the 191 member states . klaus dahmann -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe , us bicker over development aid members of the european union have called on the united states to commit itself to the fight against poverty and provide more money with fewer restrictions to the developing world .

" we , the people of the united nations … . "
these are the first words of the preamble of the un charter .
but while it all sounds very lofty , it does n't have anything to do with reality .
in fact , governments , not people make the big decisions regarding the world organization .
and only a portion of these governments are democratically elected . dictatorial regimes have been , and are now , among the mightiest countries , that is , the five permanent security council members whose veto power can condemn the united nations to passivity .
and even countries with freely elected governments do n't always accurately represent their populations ; think of britain 's tony blair and spain 's jose maria aznar voting in favor of the iraq war , although the majority of their countrymen and women opposed it vehemently . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a vote at the un security council the first sentence of the preamble sums up the discrepancies that have plagued the united nations since it was founded 60 years ago .
during the cold war , the security council could only rarely fulfill its intended function : to provide for peace and security in the world .
true , blue-helmeted un peacekeepers have frequently played a role in bringing peace to a region in the aftermath of armed conflict .
but the key word here is " aftermath . "
in the vast majority of cases - think korea and vietnam - the united nations has been unable to prevent the outbreak of war .
in rwanda , the organization stood by as genocide took place before the eyes of the world . iraq as example it may be worth noting that , since the end of the east-west conflict in the late 1980s , the use of vetoes by the un security council has tended toward zero .
but the latest example , iraq , shows that the highest un committee can only stop armed conflict from occurring when all of the permanent members want to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general kofi annan addressing the general assembly if un secretary general kofi annan had his way , the organization would undergo reforms in this , its 60th year of existence , bringing it up to date with the 21st century .
but annan 's agenda was thoroughly diluted at the united nations summit in mid-september .
the famed " millennium goals " were approved - who would dare oppose fighting poverty and disease ? - but when it came to financing development aid , the countries once again left matters as nonbinding as possible .
furthermore , security council reform was again delayed amid discord .
and members skirted the issue of actually coming up with an official decision on what constitutes terrorism . forum for ideas once again , it became clear how difficult it is to agree on the future of the united nations .
anyone who dreams of a capable and competent world governing body can only be disappointed by the united nations .
a better option would be to view the united nations in a humbler light .
there are , in fact , areas where the organization gets the job done : the human rights charter , sub-organizations - such as the united nations children 's fund -lrb- unicef -rrb- - and international courts of law represent development milestones .
un organizations have repeatedly won the nobel peace prize , and with good reason .
this year the honor went to the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- and its chief , mohammed elbaradei .
in terms of world peace , though , the united nations is above all a form for exchanging ideas .
in certain cases concrete peace measures are undertaken .
but in the end , the un is n't responsible for bringing peace to the world - that is the job of the 191 member states . klaus dahmann -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe , us bicker over development aid members of the european union have called on the united states to commit itself to the fight against poverty and provide more money with fewer restrictions to the developing world .

3 , 2005 -rrb- competing plans threaten un reform germany , brazil , india and japan have submitted a draft resolution on a proposed expansion of the un security council and want an early vote in the general assembly .
but rival plans are complicating matters .

the numbers were officially reported , although a final vote count wo n't be published until monday afternoon . " mr chairman , mission accomplished , " kaczynski said at pis 's election evening in central warsaw , addressing his identical twin jaroslaw , who heads pis , and who last month refused the post of prime minister so as not to jeopardize his brother 's chances of being elected president . turnout for the in a run-off election was slightly more than 50 percent , up on the first round when it was less than 50 percent . last-minute win both of the presidential rivals cut their political teeth in the solidarity movement that in the 1980s helped poland shake off communism , but since then , they have moved apart ideologically . tusk 's civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- party embraced free-market liberalism and kaczynski a breed of polish conservatism that is close to the catholic church .
in the case of his pis party , it favors state intervention in the economy and social aid for the underprivileged . kaczynski 's victory mirrored what happened to his party in last month 's parliamentary election , when it pulled ahead of its opponents in the final straight to finish strongest , winning the right to choose poland 's next prime minister . pre-election polls had predicted since july that tusk would win , and showed the liberal in the lead up until the vote , although that lead had diminished by late friday . tusk lacked ' concept ' " tusk lost because of the mistakes he made in the final week of campaigning : there was no clear concept , and less activity at his headquarters , " said mikolaj czesnik , a political scientist from poland 's institute of sciences . at po 's decidedly more sombre election evening , tusk made no attempt to conceal his disappointment at losing . " i 'm not going to pretend , i 'm a little bit sad , " he said .
" if i have disappointed anyone , i ask them to forgive me .
i did what i could . " he congratulated kaczynski and assured his supporters that , although he had not won the presidency , he and po would " watch over what 's most important of all : the freedom of each and every pole .
we will ensure that the state never wrongs anyone again . " gracious winner kaczynski extended an olive branch to tusk , saying : " he fought a splendid battle … " i ask our friends in po to quickly end talks on forming a government , " he said . kaczynski 's campaign mirrored his conservatism , his traditional catholicism , and played on poles ' nationalism and the social inequality that is still apparent in poland , despite the burgeoning economy since the country joined the european union last year . " lech kaczynski waged a fear-factor campaign in the past few weeks , and he succeeded in scaring people , " said political analyst cornelius ochmann , from germany 's bertelsmann foundation .
" just as we saw in germany , people are scared of reforms . " his virulent anti-gay stance - he twice banned gay pride marches through warsaw - has won him support among poland 's conservative catholic voters .

" we , the people of the united nations … . "
these are the first words of the preamble of the un charter .
but while it all sounds very lofty , it does n't have anything to do with reality .
in fact , governments , not people make the big decisions regarding the world organization .
and only a portion of these governments are democratically elected . dictatorial regimes have been , and are now , among the mightiest countries , that is , the five permanent security council members whose veto power can condemn the united nations to passivity .
and even countries with freely elected governments do n't always accurately represent their populations ; think of britain 's tony blair and spain 's jose maria aznar voting in favor of the iraq war , although the majority of their countrymen and women opposed it vehemently . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a vote at the un security council the first sentence of the preamble sums up the discrepancies that have plagued the united nations since it was founded 60 years ago .
during the cold war , the security council could only rarely fulfill its intended function : to provide for peace and security in the world .
true , blue-helmeted un peacekeepers have frequently played a role in bringing peace to a region in the aftermath of armed conflict .
but the key word here is " aftermath . "
in the vast majority of cases - think korea and vietnam - the united nations has been unable to prevent the outbreak of war .
in rwanda , the organization stood by as genocide took place before the eyes of the world . iraq as example it may be worth noting that , since the end of the east-west conflict in the late 1980s , the use of vetoes by the un security council has tended toward zero .
but the latest example , iraq , shows that the highest un committee can only stop armed conflict from occurring when all of the permanent members want to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general kofi annan addressing the general assembly if un secretary general kofi annan had his way , the organization would undergo reforms in this , its 60th year of existence , bringing it up to date with the 21st century .
but annan 's agenda was thoroughly diluted at the united nations summit in mid-september .
the famed " millennium goals " were approved - who would dare oppose fighting poverty and disease ? - but when it came to financing development aid , the countries once again left matters as nonbinding as possible .
furthermore , security council reform was again delayed amid discord .
and members skirted the issue of actually coming up with an official decision on what constitutes terrorism . forum for ideas once again , it became clear how difficult it is to agree on the future of the united nations .
anyone who dreams of a capable and competent world governing body can only be disappointed by the united nations .
a better option would be to view the united nations in a humbler light .
there are , in fact , areas where the organization gets the job done : the human rights charter , sub-organizations - such as the united nations children 's fund -lrb- unicef -rrb- - and international courts of law represent development milestones .
un organizations have repeatedly won the nobel peace prize , and with good reason .
this year the honor went to the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- and its chief , mohammed elbaradei .
in terms of world peace , though , the united nations is above all a form for exchanging ideas .
in certain cases concrete peace measures are undertaken .
but in the end , the un is n't responsible for bringing peace to the world - that is the job of the 191 member states . klaus dahmann -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe , us bicker over development aid members of the european union have called on the united states to commit itself to the fight against poverty and provide more money with fewer restrictions to the developing world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.10.2005 conservative kaczynski wins polish election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warsaw mayor kaczynski beat the odds in a last minute victory poland on sunday elected the conservative , staunchly catholic lech kaczynski president by a definitive margin , bucking pre-vote surveys that had given his liberal rival the lead . kaczynski , of the law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party , garnered 55 percent of the vote compared with 45 percent for his liberal , europe-friendly opponent , donald tusk .
the numbers were officially reported , although a final vote count wo n't be published until monday afternoon . " mr chairman , mission accomplished , " kaczynski said at pis 's election evening in central warsaw , addressing his identical twin jaroslaw , who heads pis , and who last month refused the post of prime minister so as not to jeopardize his brother 's chances of being elected president . turnout for the in a run-off election was slightly more than 50 percent , up on the first round when it was less than 50 percent . last-minute win both of the presidential rivals cut their political teeth in the solidarity movement that in the 1980s helped poland shake off communism , but since then , they have moved apart ideologically . tusk 's civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- party embraced free-market liberalism and kaczynski a breed of polish conservatism that is close to the catholic church .
in the case of his pis party , it favors state intervention in the economy and social aid for the underprivileged . kaczynski 's victory mirrored what happened to his party in last month 's parliamentary election , when it pulled ahead of its opponents in the final straight to finish strongest , winning the right to choose poland 's next prime minister . pre-election polls had predicted since july that tusk would win , and showed the liberal in the lead up until the vote , although that lead had diminished by late friday . tusk lacked ' concept ' " tusk lost because of the mistakes he made in the final week of campaigning : there was no clear concept , and less activity at his headquarters , " said mikolaj czesnik , a political scientist from poland 's institute of sciences . at po 's decidedly more sombre election evening , tusk made no attempt to conceal his disappointment at losing . " i 'm not going to pretend , i 'm a little bit sad , " he said .
" if i have disappointed anyone , i ask them to forgive me .
i did what i could . " he congratulated kaczynski and assured his supporters that , although he had not won the presidency , he and po would " watch over what 's most important of all : the freedom of each and every pole .
we will ensure that the state never wrongs anyone again . " gracious winner kaczynski extended an olive branch to tusk , saying : " he fought a splendid battle … " i ask our friends in po to quickly end talks on forming a government , " he said . kaczynski 's campaign mirrored his conservatism , his traditional catholicism , and played on poles ' nationalism and the social inequality that is still apparent in poland , despite the burgeoning economy since the country joined the european union last year . " lech kaczynski waged a fear-factor campaign in the past few weeks , and he succeeded in scaring people , " said political analyst cornelius ochmann , from germany 's bertelsmann foundation .
" just as we saw in germany , people are scared of reforms . " his virulent anti-gay stance - he twice banned gay pride marches through warsaw - has won him support among poland 's conservative catholic voters .
poland 's next president - the third to be freely elected since the end of communism in 1989 - is to be sworn in on december 23 , when aleksander kwasniewski , who has held the office for two terms , stands down . dw staff / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former solidarity allies prepare for polish election battle two weeks after they finished neck and neck in the first round of poland 's presidential election , former comrades in arms donald tusk and lech kaczynski , are to face off sunday in a decisive vote for the presidency .

" we , the people of the united nations … . "
these are the first words of the preamble of the un charter .
but while it all sounds very lofty , it does n't have anything to do with reality .
in fact , governments , not people make the big decisions regarding the world organization .
and only a portion of these governments are democratically elected . dictatorial regimes have been , and are now , among the mightiest countries , that is , the five permanent security council members whose veto power can condemn the united nations to passivity .
and even countries with freely elected governments do n't always accurately represent their populations ; think of britain 's tony blair and spain 's jose maria aznar voting in favor of the iraq war , although the majority of their countrymen and women opposed it vehemently . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a vote at the un security council the first sentence of the preamble sums up the discrepancies that have plagued the united nations since it was founded 60 years ago .
during the cold war , the security council could only rarely fulfill its intended function : to provide for peace and security in the world .
true , blue-helmeted un peacekeepers have frequently played a role in bringing peace to a region in the aftermath of armed conflict .
but the key word here is " aftermath . "
in the vast majority of cases - think korea and vietnam - the united nations has been unable to prevent the outbreak of war .
in rwanda , the organization stood by as genocide took place before the eyes of the world . iraq as example it may be worth noting that , since the end of the east-west conflict in the late 1980s , the use of vetoes by the un security council has tended toward zero .
but the latest example , iraq , shows that the highest un committee can only stop armed conflict from occurring when all of the permanent members want to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general kofi annan addressing the general assembly if un secretary general kofi annan had his way , the organization would undergo reforms in this , its 60th year of existence , bringing it up to date with the 21st century .
but annan 's agenda was thoroughly diluted at the united nations summit in mid-september .
the famed " millennium goals " were approved - who would dare oppose fighting poverty and disease ? - but when it came to financing development aid , the countries once again left matters as nonbinding as possible .
furthermore , security council reform was again delayed amid discord .
and members skirted the issue of actually coming up with an official decision on what constitutes terrorism . forum for ideas once again , it became clear how difficult it is to agree on the future of the united nations .
anyone who dreams of a capable and competent world governing body can only be disappointed by the united nations .
a better option would be to view the united nations in a humbler light .
there are , in fact , areas where the organization gets the job done : the human rights charter , sub-organizations - such as the united nations children 's fund -lrb- unicef -rrb- - and international courts of law represent development milestones .
un organizations have repeatedly won the nobel peace prize , and with good reason .
this year the honor went to the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- and its chief , mohammed elbaradei .
in terms of world peace , though , the united nations is above all a form for exchanging ideas .
in certain cases concrete peace measures are undertaken .
but in the end , the un is n't responsible for bringing peace to the world - that is the job of the 191 member states . klaus dahmann -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe , us bicker over development aid members of the european union have called on the united states to commit itself to the fight against poverty and provide more money with fewer restrictions to the developing world .

scientists continue to disagree about the causes and effects of the ozone level 's thinning , with some stating depletion levels have peaked . scientists divided on ozone depletion according to the united nations world meteorological organization 's latest bulletin , the seasonal hole above the south pole and antarctica is shrinking . " it is the third largest ever , more or less as one would expect from present levels of chlorine and bromine in the atmosphere , " geir braathen , the wmo 's top ozone expert , told reporters tuesday .
" it does n't look as if the ozone hole is going to get any bigger -lrb- in coming years -rrb- .
it seems like we have reached a plateau . " others scientists , such as frank jürgen diekmann of the european space agency , expect this year 's hole over the south pole to be the biggest ever , and doubt the danger is over . " if anything , the ozone concentration has stabilized , " he said .
" but especially in 2005 we ’ re expecting record ozone holes above the antarctic .
going on the latest data , we can ’ t say the danger is gone . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists can agree that levels seem to have stablized especially bad in south it ’ s been more than 18 years since 180 countries signed up to the montreal ozone protocol on reducing emissions of chlorofluorocarbons , -lrb- cfcs -rrb- , which up until then were considered indispensable chemicals for modern living . though there 's no actual " hole " in the ozone layer and only a slight thinning occurs over the rest of the world , climatic conditions are especially dangerous at the south pole .
it would take forty to fifty years for the ozone shield to recover completely - the same amount of time chlorofluorocarbons stay in the atmosphere . polar-stratospheric clouds , which form above the south pole when air masses can not mix in the dark winter months and end up collecting more and ore chlorine compounds , are struck by the southern spring 's sunlight from september to november .
that causes them to break into " radicals " that split ozone into an oxygen molecule and an oxygen atom , making it disappear . greenhouse gases dangerous in north these meteorological conditions can also be dangerous in the northern hemisphere , according to christoph brühl , of the max planck institute for chemistry in mainz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenhouse gasses like co2 endanger the northern hemisphere " the public is looking more and more at the antarctic in connection with the ozone hole , " he said .
" in principle though , the danger is just as great in the northern hemisphere , except that it does n't arise there every year because of various meteorological conditions . " greenhouse gas emissions can also influence the ozone , particularly in the northern hemisphere .
the gasses cool the upper stratosphere , the layer important for the formation of ozone .
if the layer gets too cold , a closed area similar to that over the south pole can form in winter , meaning air masses over the northern hemisphere can no longer exchange , damaging the ozone filter over europe , brühl explained . " up to now we 've always been lucky that the weather put an end to it in march , but that needn ’ t always be so , " he added .

that causes them to break into " radicals " that split ozone into an oxygen molecule and an oxygen atom , making it disappear . greenhouse gases dangerous in north these meteorological conditions can also be dangerous in the northern hemisphere , according to christoph brühl , of the max planck institute for chemistry in mainz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenhouse gasses like co2 endanger the northern hemisphere " the public is looking more and more at the antarctic in connection with the ozone hole , " he said .
" in principle though , the danger is just as great in the northern hemisphere , except that it does n't arise there every year because of various meteorological conditions . " greenhouse gas emissions can also influence the ozone , particularly in the northern hemisphere .
the gasses cool the upper stratosphere , the layer important for the formation of ozone .
if the layer gets too cold , a closed area similar to that over the south pole can form in winter , meaning air masses over the northern hemisphere can no longer exchange , damaging the ozone filter over europe , brühl explained . " up to now we 've always been lucky that the weather put an end to it in march , but that needn ’ t always be so , " he added .
" it could quite easily run into april and that would certainly raise the ultraviolet radiation into germany over the june level .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.10.2005 new polish president sends worrying signals großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech kaczynski 's victory has n't exactly reassured europe lech kaczynski , winner of poland 's presidential poll , has taken a tough foreign-policy line toward neighboring germany .
should berlin be worried ?
dw-world spoke to poland expert dieter bingen . the surprise winner of poland 's runoff presidential election on sunday , 56-year-old lech kaczynski of the conservative law and justice party -lrb- pis -rrb- has ruffled feathers by adopting a nationalistic tone during the election campaign , in particular signaling a tougher approach towards germany and russia . dw-world spoke to dieter bingen , head of the german-poland institute in darmstadt about what the election of the populist leader might mean for future ties between berlin and warsaw . dw-world : what have the poles voted for with lech kaczynski 's victory in the presidential runoff election on sunday ? dieter bingen : the poles have voted in favor of the promise to care more for the social concerns of the losers in society - a state with a heart so to speak - and for the promise that corruption and nepotism will be done away with .
in addition , they voted for kaczynski 's vow to pursue a stronger line in dealing with the communist past and the beneficiaries of the regime after 1990 . the media in germany is talking about a " shift towards right-wing attitudes " and that kaczynski is an anti-semite ?
how do you see it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech kaczynski speaks to supporters after his victory that 's absurd .
lech kaczynski is in no way an anti-semite .
he did get the support of groups and parties who have anti-semitic tendencies - he did take that into account , but he 's not anti-semitic himself though he does play on traditional national hostile stereotypes . and kaczynski 's election ca n't really be described unambiguously as a shift toward right-wing attitudes either .
kaczynski also has strong social aspects , particularly when it comes to the economy he 's rather left-leaning and he 's shown himself to be in favor of a welfare state .
these are elements that he courted very consciously in order to lure away a group of voters who supported the left-wing candidate in the first election phase .
thus he 's more structurally conservative if you will , and in an ideal sense paternalistic when it comes to values and also patriotic . what ramifications will the new situation in poland have for germany ? we 'll have to - at least initially - brace ourselves for some unpleasant situations and reckon with some emotional rhetoric that will question poland 's partnership with germany and in particular warsaw 's political relationship with germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and donald tusk in poland in august , 2005 donald tusk -lrb- of the pro-market civic platform who lost the presidential election to lech kaczynski -rrb- and angela merkel -lrb- germany 's new chancellor-designate -rrb- had already made common plans for the future .
do you think there will be any parallels between kaczynski and other parties in germany ? no , kaczynski did n't seek any contacts at all in germany .
he has no experience with foreign affairs and never gave it much importance . and , what does the new situation in poland mean for europe ? poland 's commitment to european integration in the eu 's political arena will probably not be promoted as much and there 's a danger that poland will isolate and marginalize itself .
poland will probably not pursue an active european policy , but will orient itself much more strongly towards the us . at the same time , that may be simply demonstrative and symbolic and things may appear different when it comes implementation - one has to make a distinction here between the heat of the election campaign and real politics . poland has after all profited from its membership in the eu , particularly its farmers .
does that mean that things wo n't fundamentally change with regard to economic and political ties ? precisely .
poland must have an interest in having allies in germany and not isolate itself in crucial looming budget talks .
if poland is n't constructive there , it can lose out badly . so , atmospherically there will be tensions between poland and germany but eventually we have to wait and see what happens next .
it 's all open .
the civic platform as a coalition partner must ensure that the worst fears do n't become reality . the interview was conducted by pablo kummetz -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conservative kaczynski wins polish election poland on sunday elected the conservative , staunchly catholic lech kaczynski president by a definitive margin , bucking pre-vote surveys that had given his liberal rival the lead .

monday 's meeting , however , is expected to be overshadowed by infighting in both camps over important party posts and the future shaping of ministries as well as over mistakes made during the autumn election campaign which had left germany in an inconclusive political situation . christian democratic chief and chancellor-designate angela merkel will be entering today 's round of coalition talks with the stigma that her party has shown the worst performance at any general election since 1949 by garnering only slightly more than 35 percent of the vote . a genuine analysis of why the conservatives fared so badly on sept .
18 is still pending .
the cdu 's rank-and-file believe that a merciless analysis of election campaign mistakes should come at once . it 's the cdu 's youth wing in particular which is calling for a clean breast to be made .
at its national meeting in augsburg on sunday , many conservative youth leaders expressed harsh criticism of how angela merkel and the leader of the cdu 's sister party in bavaria , edmund stoiber , communicated the conservatives ' election manifesto to potential voters . rüttgers : coalition talks must take precendence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen rüttgers wants a resolution to the talks to be the main focus .
but senior members of the cdu are warning against too much criticism while coalition talks with the social democrats are in progress .
" i believe that all issues related to coalition talks have to take precedence now , " said jürgen rüttgers , the christian democratic premier of north rhine-westphalia . " we 'll see a tough fight over reforms in a variety of key areas , and we 'll have enough on our plate to prevent our manifesto from being taken to pieces completely , " he added .
" if in a situation like this we were to couple this with a large-scale analysis of our showing at the general election , then this would clearly overstretch our abilities . " the cdu / csu 's youth wing is alarmed by the concessions that the conservatives have already been forced to make in the bickering over ministerial posts . grand coalition too high a price for cdu for some bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conservative cabinet has its chancellor but does it have power ?
" we 'll be having a huge structural problem in the grand coalition which we 'll most likely see in power at the end of the day , " one delegate to the augsburg meeting argued .
" most ministries where important reforms have to be masterminded in the four years ahead have gone to the social democrats .
which is to say that our participation in a grand coalition comes at too high a price . " meanwhile the spd 's main negotiator , party chief and parliamentary group leader franz müntefering , is facing inner party criticism as well .
there is opposition to his candidate for the post of spd secretary general , as many within the spd are coming out in favor of a prominent member of the party 's leftist youth wing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering faces a tough start to his job as vice-chancellor .
recent attempts to rejuvenate the party leadership wo n't make müntefering 's negotiating position any easier in talks which are already marked by a variety of stumbling blocs .
coalition talks during monday afternoon will be centering on an agreement over the country 's future policies related to consolidating public finances . germany 's finances a major sticking point both sides acknowledge the need to save at least 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 35.8 billion -rrb- in 2006 and 2007 in order to finally meet the deficit criteria set under the eu 's stability and growth pact .
but there 's still a lot of disagreement on how to reach this ambitious aim . monday 's talks are expected to see a breakthrough on whether or not to raise value-added tax by two percent , as proposed by the christian democrats .
the negotiating sides will also have to talk about a large-scale reduction of state subsidies , including those for private home builder . hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts hope merkel gets germany working angela merkel will have to soften some of her radical economic reforms if the so-called grand coalition of left and right is to get germany back to work , analysts said on monday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.10.2005 conservative kaczynski wins polish election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warsaw mayor kaczynski beat the odds in a last minute victory poland on sunday elected the conservative , staunchly catholic lech kaczynski president by a definitive margin , bucking pre-vote surveys that had given his liberal rival the lead . kaczynski , of the law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party , garnered 55 percent of the vote compared with 45 percent for his liberal , europe-friendly opponent , donald tusk .
the numbers were officially reported , although a final vote count wo n't be published until monday afternoon . " mr chairman , mission accomplished , " kaczynski said at pis 's election evening in central warsaw , addressing his identical twin jaroslaw , who heads pis , and who last month refused the post of prime minister so as not to jeopardize his brother 's chances of being elected president . turnout for the in a run-off election was slightly more than 50 percent , up on the first round when it was less than 50 percent . last-minute win both of the presidential rivals cut their political teeth in the solidarity movement that in the 1980s helped poland shake off communism , but since then , they have moved apart ideologically . tusk 's civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- party embraced free-market liberalism and kaczynski a breed of polish conservatism that is close to the catholic church .
in the case of his pis party , it favors state intervention in the economy and social aid for the underprivileged . kaczynski 's victory mirrored what happened to his party in last month 's parliamentary election , when it pulled ahead of its opponents in the final straight to finish strongest , winning the right to choose poland 's next prime minister . pre-election polls had predicted since july that tusk would win , and showed the liberal in the lead up until the vote , although that lead had diminished by late friday . tusk lacked ' concept ' " tusk lost because of the mistakes he made in the final week of campaigning : there was no clear concept , and less activity at his headquarters , " said mikolaj czesnik , a political scientist from poland 's institute of sciences . at po 's decidedly more sombre election evening , tusk made no attempt to conceal his disappointment at losing . " i 'm not going to pretend , i 'm a little bit sad , " he said .
" if i have disappointed anyone , i ask them to forgive me .
i did what i could . " he congratulated kaczynski and assured his supporters that , although he had not won the presidency , he and po would " watch over what 's most important of all : the freedom of each and every pole .
we will ensure that the state never wrongs anyone again . " gracious winner kaczynski extended an olive branch to tusk , saying : " he fought a splendid battle … " i ask our friends in po to quickly end talks on forming a government , " he said . kaczynski 's campaign mirrored his conservatism , his traditional catholicism , and played on poles ' nationalism and the social inequality that is still apparent in poland , despite the burgeoning economy since the country joined the european union last year . " lech kaczynski waged a fear-factor campaign in the past few weeks , and he succeeded in scaring people , " said political analyst cornelius ochmann , from germany 's bertelsmann foundation .
" just as we saw in germany , people are scared of reforms . " his virulent anti-gay stance - he twice banned gay pride marches through warsaw - has won him support among poland 's conservative catholic voters .
poland 's next president - the third to be freely elected since the end of communism in 1989 - is to be sworn in on december 23 , when aleksander kwasniewski , who has held the office for two terms , stands down . dw staff / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former solidarity allies prepare for polish election battle two weeks after they finished neck and neck in the first round of poland 's presidential election , former comrades in arms donald tusk and lech kaczynski , are to face off sunday in a decisive vote for the presidency .

they ’ re warning that increased ozone loss is allowing additional harmful ultraviolet light to reach us and making us more vulnerable to sunburn , skin cancer and cataracts . about 20 kilometers -lrb- 12.4 miles -rrb- thick , the layer of ozone gas is like a giant umbrella 15 to 35 kilometers over the earth and like any good pair of sunglasses , it acts like a filter by blocking out most ultraviolet rays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a thin layer of ozone protects from numerous health problems the loss of ozone was discovered over the polar regions 20 years ago and has been closely watched ever since .
scientists continue to disagree about the causes and effects of the ozone level 's thinning , with some stating depletion levels have peaked . scientists divided on ozone depletion according to the united nations world meteorological organization 's latest bulletin , the seasonal hole above the south pole and antarctica is shrinking . " it is the third largest ever , more or less as one would expect from present levels of chlorine and bromine in the atmosphere , " geir braathen , the wmo 's top ozone expert , told reporters tuesday .
" it does n't look as if the ozone hole is going to get any bigger -lrb- in coming years -rrb- .
it seems like we have reached a plateau . " others scientists , such as frank jürgen diekmann of the european space agency , expect this year 's hole over the south pole to be the biggest ever , and doubt the danger is over . " if anything , the ozone concentration has stabilized , " he said .
" but especially in 2005 we ’ re expecting record ozone holes above the antarctic .
going on the latest data , we can ’ t say the danger is gone . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists can agree that levels seem to have stablized especially bad in south it ’ s been more than 18 years since 180 countries signed up to the montreal ozone protocol on reducing emissions of chlorofluorocarbons , -lrb- cfcs -rrb- , which up until then were considered indispensable chemicals for modern living . though there 's no actual " hole " in the ozone layer and only a slight thinning occurs over the rest of the world , climatic conditions are especially dangerous at the south pole .
it would take forty to fifty years for the ozone shield to recover completely - the same amount of time chlorofluorocarbons stay in the atmosphere . polar-stratospheric clouds , which form above the south pole when air masses can not mix in the dark winter months and end up collecting more and ore chlorine compounds , are struck by the southern spring 's sunlight from september to november .
that causes them to break into " radicals " that split ozone into an oxygen molecule and an oxygen atom , making it disappear . greenhouse gases dangerous in north these meteorological conditions can also be dangerous in the northern hemisphere , according to christoph brühl , of the max planck institute for chemistry in mainz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenhouse gasses like co2 endanger the northern hemisphere " the public is looking more and more at the antarctic in connection with the ozone hole , " he said .
" in principle though , the danger is just as great in the northern hemisphere , except that it does n't arise there every year because of various meteorological conditions . " greenhouse gas emissions can also influence the ozone , particularly in the northern hemisphere .
the gasses cool the upper stratosphere , the layer important for the formation of ozone .
if the layer gets too cold , a closed area similar to that over the south pole can form in winter , meaning air masses over the northern hemisphere can no longer exchange , damaging the ozone filter over europe , brühl explained .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.10.2005 new polish president sends worrying signals großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech kaczynski 's victory has n't exactly reassured europe lech kaczynski , winner of poland 's presidential poll , has taken a tough foreign-policy line toward neighboring germany .
should berlin be worried ?
dw-world spoke to poland expert dieter bingen . the surprise winner of poland 's runoff presidential election on sunday , 56-year-old lech kaczynski of the conservative law and justice party -lrb- pis -rrb- has ruffled feathers by adopting a nationalistic tone during the election campaign , in particular signaling a tougher approach towards germany and russia . dw-world spoke to dieter bingen , head of the german-poland institute in darmstadt about what the election of the populist leader might mean for future ties between berlin and warsaw . dw-world : what have the poles voted for with lech kaczynski 's victory in the presidential runoff election on sunday ? dieter bingen : the poles have voted in favor of the promise to care more for the social concerns of the losers in society - a state with a heart so to speak - and for the promise that corruption and nepotism will be done away with .
in addition , they voted for kaczynski 's vow to pursue a stronger line in dealing with the communist past and the beneficiaries of the regime after 1990 . the media in germany is talking about a " shift towards right-wing attitudes " and that kaczynski is an anti-semite ?
how do you see it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech kaczynski speaks to supporters after his victory that 's absurd .
lech kaczynski is in no way an anti-semite .
he did get the support of groups and parties who have anti-semitic tendencies - he did take that into account , but he 's not anti-semitic himself though he does play on traditional national hostile stereotypes . and kaczynski 's election ca n't really be described unambiguously as a shift toward right-wing attitudes either .
kaczynski also has strong social aspects , particularly when it comes to the economy he 's rather left-leaning and he 's shown himself to be in favor of a welfare state .
these are elements that he courted very consciously in order to lure away a group of voters who supported the left-wing candidate in the first election phase .

in addition , they voted for kaczynski 's vow to pursue a stronger line in dealing with the communist past and the beneficiaries of the regime after 1990 . the media in germany is talking about a " shift towards right-wing attitudes " and that kaczynski is an anti-semite ?

lech kaczynski is in no way an anti-semite .
he did get the support of groups and parties who have anti-semitic tendencies - he did take that into account , but he 's not anti-semitic himself though he does play on traditional national hostile stereotypes . and kaczynski 's election ca n't really be described unambiguously as a shift toward right-wing attitudes either .
kaczynski also has strong social aspects , particularly when it comes to the economy he 's rather left-leaning and he 's shown himself to be in favor of a welfare state .

they ’ re warning that increased ozone loss is allowing additional harmful ultraviolet light to reach us and making us more vulnerable to sunburn , skin cancer and cataracts . about 20 kilometers -lrb- 12.4 miles -rrb- thick , the layer of ozone gas is like a giant umbrella 15 to 35 kilometers over the earth and like any good pair of sunglasses , it acts like a filter by blocking out most ultraviolet rays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a thin layer of ozone protects from numerous health problems the loss of ozone was discovered over the polar regions 20 years ago and has been closely watched ever since .
scientists continue to disagree about the causes and effects of the ozone level 's thinning , with some stating depletion levels have peaked . scientists divided on ozone depletion according to the united nations world meteorological organization 's latest bulletin , the seasonal hole above the south pole and antarctica is shrinking . " it is the third largest ever , more or less as one would expect from present levels of chlorine and bromine in the atmosphere , " geir braathen , the wmo 's top ozone expert , told reporters tuesday .
" it does n't look as if the ozone hole is going to get any bigger -lrb- in coming years -rrb- .
it seems like we have reached a plateau . " others scientists , such as frank jürgen diekmann of the european space agency , expect this year 's hole over the south pole to be the biggest ever , and doubt the danger is over . " if anything , the ozone concentration has stabilized , " he said .
" but especially in 2005 we ’ re expecting record ozone holes above the antarctic .
going on the latest data , we can ’ t say the danger is gone . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists can agree that levels seem to have stablized especially bad in south it ’ s been more than 18 years since 180 countries signed up to the montreal ozone protocol on reducing emissions of chlorofluorocarbons , -lrb- cfcs -rrb- , which up until then were considered indispensable chemicals for modern living . though there 's no actual " hole " in the ozone layer and only a slight thinning occurs over the rest of the world , climatic conditions are especially dangerous at the south pole .
it would take forty to fifty years for the ozone shield to recover completely - the same amount of time chlorofluorocarbons stay in the atmosphere . polar-stratospheric clouds , which form above the south pole when air masses can not mix in the dark winter months and end up collecting more and ore chlorine compounds , are struck by the southern spring 's sunlight from september to november .
that causes them to break into " radicals " that split ozone into an oxygen molecule and an oxygen atom , making it disappear . greenhouse gases dangerous in north these meteorological conditions can also be dangerous in the northern hemisphere , according to christoph brühl , of the max planck institute for chemistry in mainz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenhouse gasses like co2 endanger the northern hemisphere " the public is looking more and more at the antarctic in connection with the ozone hole , " he said .
" in principle though , the danger is just as great in the northern hemisphere , except that it does n't arise there every year because of various meteorological conditions . " greenhouse gas emissions can also influence the ozone , particularly in the northern hemisphere .
the gasses cool the upper stratosphere , the layer important for the formation of ozone .
if the layer gets too cold , a closed area similar to that over the south pole can form in winter , meaning air masses over the northern hemisphere can no longer exchange , damaging the ozone filter over europe , brühl explained . " up to now we 've always been lucky that the weather put an end to it in march , but that needn ’ t always be so , " he added .
" it could quite easily run into april and that would certainly raise the ultraviolet radiation into germany over the june level .

should berlin be worried ?
dw-world spoke to poland expert dieter bingen . the surprise winner of poland 's runoff presidential election on sunday , 56-year-old lech kaczynski of the conservative law and justice party -lrb- pis -rrb- has ruffled feathers by adopting a nationalistic tone during the election campaign , in particular signaling a tougher approach towards germany and russia . dw-world spoke to dieter bingen , head of the german-poland institute in darmstadt about what the election of the populist leader might mean for future ties between berlin and warsaw . dw-world : what have the poles voted for with lech kaczynski 's victory in the presidential runoff election on sunday ? dieter bingen : the poles have voted in favor of the promise to care more for the social concerns of the losers in society - a state with a heart so to speak - and for the promise that corruption and nepotism will be done away with .
in addition , they voted for kaczynski 's vow to pursue a stronger line in dealing with the communist past and the beneficiaries of the regime after 1990 . the media in germany is talking about a " shift towards right-wing attitudes " and that kaczynski is an anti-semite ?
how do you see it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech kaczynski speaks to supporters after his victory that 's absurd .
lech kaczynski is in no way an anti-semite .
he did get the support of groups and parties who have anti-semitic tendencies - he did take that into account , but he 's not anti-semitic himself though he does play on traditional national hostile stereotypes . and kaczynski 's election ca n't really be described unambiguously as a shift toward right-wing attitudes either .
kaczynski also has strong social aspects , particularly when it comes to the economy he 's rather left-leaning and he 's shown himself to be in favor of a welfare state .
these are elements that he courted very consciously in order to lure away a group of voters who supported the left-wing candidate in the first election phase .
thus he 's more structurally conservative if you will , and in an ideal sense paternalistic when it comes to values and also patriotic . what ramifications will the new situation in poland have for germany ? we 'll have to - at least initially - brace ourselves for some unpleasant situations and reckon with some emotional rhetoric that will question poland 's partnership with germany and in particular warsaw 's political relationship with germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and donald tusk in poland in august , 2005 donald tusk -lrb- of the pro-market civic platform who lost the presidential election to lech kaczynski -rrb- and angela merkel -lrb- germany 's new chancellor-designate -rrb- had already made common plans for the future .
do you think there will be any parallels between kaczynski and other parties in germany ? no , kaczynski did n't seek any contacts at all in germany .
he has no experience with foreign affairs and never gave it much importance . and , what does the new situation in poland mean for europe ? poland 's commitment to european integration in the eu 's political arena will probably not be promoted as much and there 's a danger that poland will isolate and marginalize itself .
poland will probably not pursue an active european policy , but will orient itself much more strongly towards the us . at the same time , that may be simply demonstrative and symbolic and things may appear different when it comes implementation - one has to make a distinction here between the heat of the election campaign and real politics . poland has after all profited from its membership in the eu , particularly its farmers .
does that mean that things wo n't fundamentally change with regard to economic and political ties ? precisely .
poland must have an interest in having allies in germany and not isolate itself in crucial looming budget talks .
if poland is n't constructive there , it can lose out badly . so , atmospherically there will be tensions between poland and germany but eventually we have to wait and see what happens next .
it 's all open .
the civic platform as a coalition partner must ensure that the worst fears do n't become reality . the interview was conducted by pablo kummetz -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conservative kaczynski wins polish election poland on sunday elected the conservative , staunchly catholic lech kaczynski president by a definitive margin , bucking pre-vote surveys that had given his liberal rival the lead .

monday 's meeting , however , is expected to be overshadowed by infighting in both camps over important party posts and the future shaping of ministries as well as over mistakes made during the autumn election campaign which had left germany in an inconclusive political situation . christian democratic chief and chancellor-designate angela merkel will be entering today 's round of coalition talks with the stigma that her party has shown the worst performance at any general election since 1949 by garnering only slightly more than 35 percent of the vote . a genuine analysis of why the conservatives fared so badly on sept .
18 is still pending .
the cdu 's rank-and-file believe that a merciless analysis of election campaign mistakes should come at once . it 's the cdu 's youth wing in particular which is calling for a clean breast to be made .
at its national meeting in augsburg on sunday , many conservative youth leaders expressed harsh criticism of how angela merkel and the leader of the cdu 's sister party in bavaria , edmund stoiber , communicated the conservatives ' election manifesto to potential voters . rüttgers : coalition talks must take precendence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen rüttgers wants a resolution to the talks to be the main focus .
but senior members of the cdu are warning against too much criticism while coalition talks with the social democrats are in progress .
" i believe that all issues related to coalition talks have to take precedence now , " said jürgen rüttgers , the christian democratic premier of north rhine-westphalia . " we 'll see a tough fight over reforms in a variety of key areas , and we 'll have enough on our plate to prevent our manifesto from being taken to pieces completely , " he added .
" if in a situation like this we were to couple this with a large-scale analysis of our showing at the general election , then this would clearly overstretch our abilities . " the cdu / csu 's youth wing is alarmed by the concessions that the conservatives have already been forced to make in the bickering over ministerial posts . grand coalition too high a price for cdu for some bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conservative cabinet has its chancellor but does it have power ?
" we 'll be having a huge structural problem in the grand coalition which we 'll most likely see in power at the end of the day , " one delegate to the augsburg meeting argued .
" most ministries where important reforms have to be masterminded in the four years ahead have gone to the social democrats .
which is to say that our participation in a grand coalition comes at too high a price . " meanwhile the spd 's main negotiator , party chief and parliamentary group leader franz müntefering , is facing inner party criticism as well .
there is opposition to his candidate for the post of spd secretary general , as many within the spd are coming out in favor of a prominent member of the party 's leftist youth wing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering faces a tough start to his job as vice-chancellor .
recent attempts to rejuvenate the party leadership wo n't make müntefering 's negotiating position any easier in talks which are already marked by a variety of stumbling blocs .
coalition talks during monday afternoon will be centering on an agreement over the country 's future policies related to consolidating public finances . germany 's finances a major sticking point both sides acknowledge the need to save at least 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 35.8 billion -rrb- in 2006 and 2007 in order to finally meet the deficit criteria set under the eu 's stability and growth pact .
but there 's still a lot of disagreement on how to reach this ambitious aim . monday 's talks are expected to see a breakthrough on whether or not to raise value-added tax by two percent , as proposed by the christian democrats .
the negotiating sides will also have to talk about a large-scale reduction of state subsidies , including those for private home builder . hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts hope merkel gets germany working angela merkel will have to soften some of her radical economic reforms if the so-called grand coalition of left and right is to get germany back to work , analysts said on monday .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists can agree that levels seem to have stablized especially bad in south it ’ s been more than 18 years since 180 countries signed up to the montreal ozone protocol on reducing emissions of chlorofluorocarbons , -lrb- cfcs -rrb- , which up until then were considered indispensable chemicals for modern living . though there 's no actual " hole " in the ozone layer and only a slight thinning occurs over the rest of the world , climatic conditions are especially dangerous at the south pole .
it would take forty to fifty years for the ozone shield to recover completely - the same amount of time chlorofluorocarbons stay in the atmosphere . polar-stratospheric clouds , which form above the south pole when air masses can not mix in the dark winter months and end up collecting more and ore chlorine compounds , are struck by the southern spring 's sunlight from september to november .
that causes them to break into " radicals " that split ozone into an oxygen molecule and an oxygen atom , making it disappear . greenhouse gases dangerous in north these meteorological conditions can also be dangerous in the northern hemisphere , according to christoph brühl , of the max planck institute for chemistry in mainz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenhouse gasses like co2 endanger the northern hemisphere " the public is looking more and more at the antarctic in connection with the ozone hole , " he said .
" in principle though , the danger is just as great in the northern hemisphere , except that it does n't arise there every year because of various meteorological conditions . " greenhouse gas emissions can also influence the ozone , particularly in the northern hemisphere .
the gasses cool the upper stratosphere , the layer important for the formation of ozone .
if the layer gets too cold , a closed area similar to that over the south pole can form in winter , meaning air masses over the northern hemisphere can no longer exchange , damaging the ozone filter over europe , brühl explained . " up to now we 've always been lucky that the weather put an end to it in march , but that needn ’ t always be so , " he added .
" it could quite easily run into april and that would certainly raise the ultraviolet radiation into germany over the june level .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.10.2005 new polish president sends worrying signals großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech kaczynski 's victory has n't exactly reassured europe lech kaczynski , winner of poland 's presidential poll , has taken a tough foreign-policy line toward neighboring germany .
should berlin be worried ?
dw-world spoke to poland expert dieter bingen . the surprise winner of poland 's runoff presidential election on sunday , 56-year-old lech kaczynski of the conservative law and justice party -lrb- pis -rrb- has ruffled feathers by adopting a nationalistic tone during the election campaign , in particular signaling a tougher approach towards germany and russia . dw-world spoke to dieter bingen , head of the german-poland institute in darmstadt about what the election of the populist leader might mean for future ties between berlin and warsaw . dw-world : what have the poles voted for with lech kaczynski 's victory in the presidential runoff election on sunday ? dieter bingen : the poles have voted in favor of the promise to care more for the social concerns of the losers in society - a state with a heart so to speak - and for the promise that corruption and nepotism will be done away with .
in addition , they voted for kaczynski 's vow to pursue a stronger line in dealing with the communist past and the beneficiaries of the regime after 1990 . the media in germany is talking about a " shift towards right-wing attitudes " and that kaczynski is an anti-semite ?
how do you see it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech kaczynski speaks to supporters after his victory that 's absurd .
lech kaczynski is in no way an anti-semite .
he did get the support of groups and parties who have anti-semitic tendencies - he did take that into account , but he 's not anti-semitic himself though he does play on traditional national hostile stereotypes . and kaczynski 's election ca n't really be described unambiguously as a shift toward right-wing attitudes either .
kaczynski also has strong social aspects , particularly when it comes to the economy he 's rather left-leaning and he 's shown himself to be in favor of a welfare state .
these are elements that he courted very consciously in order to lure away a group of voters who supported the left-wing candidate in the first election phase .
thus he 's more structurally conservative if you will , and in an ideal sense paternalistic when it comes to values and also patriotic . what ramifications will the new situation in poland have for germany ? we 'll have to - at least initially - brace ourselves for some unpleasant situations and reckon with some emotional rhetoric that will question poland 's partnership with germany and in particular warsaw 's political relationship with germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and donald tusk in poland in august , 2005 donald tusk -lrb- of the pro-market civic platform who lost the presidential election to lech kaczynski -rrb- and angela merkel -lrb- germany 's new chancellor-designate -rrb- had already made common plans for the future .
do you think there will be any parallels between kaczynski and other parties in germany ? no , kaczynski did n't seek any contacts at all in germany .
he has no experience with foreign affairs and never gave it much importance . and , what does the new situation in poland mean for europe ? poland 's commitment to european integration in the eu 's political arena will probably not be promoted as much and there 's a danger that poland will isolate and marginalize itself .
poland will probably not pursue an active european policy , but will orient itself much more strongly towards the us . at the same time , that may be simply demonstrative and symbolic and things may appear different when it comes implementation - one has to make a distinction here between the heat of the election campaign and real politics . poland has after all profited from its membership in the eu , particularly its farmers .
does that mean that things wo n't fundamentally change with regard to economic and political ties ? precisely .
poland must have an interest in having allies in germany and not isolate itself in crucial looming budget talks .
if poland is n't constructive there , it can lose out badly . so , atmospherically there will be tensions between poland and germany but eventually we have to wait and see what happens next .
it 's all open .
the civic platform as a coalition partner must ensure that the worst fears do n't become reality . the interview was conducted by pablo kummetz -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conservative kaczynski wins polish election poland on sunday elected the conservative , staunchly catholic lech kaczynski president by a definitive margin , bucking pre-vote surveys that had given his liberal rival the lead .

" we , the people of the united nations … . "
these are the first words of the preamble of the un charter .
but while it all sounds very lofty , it does n't have anything to do with reality .
in fact , governments , not people make the big decisions regarding the world organization .
and only a portion of these governments are democratically elected . dictatorial regimes have been , and are now , among the mightiest countries , that is , the five permanent security council members whose veto power can condemn the united nations to passivity .
and even countries with freely elected governments do n't always accurately represent their populations ; think of britain 's tony blair and spain 's jose maria aznar voting in favor of the iraq war , although the majority of their countrymen and women opposed it vehemently . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a vote at the un security council the first sentence of the preamble sums up the discrepancies that have plagued the united nations since it was founded 60 years ago .
during the cold war , the security council could only rarely fulfill its intended function : to provide for peace and security in the world .
true , blue-helmeted un peacekeepers have frequently played a role in bringing peace to a region in the aftermath of armed conflict .
but the key word here is " aftermath . "
in the vast majority of cases - think korea and vietnam - the united nations has been unable to prevent the outbreak of war .
in rwanda , the organization stood by as genocide took place before the eyes of the world . iraq as example it may be worth noting that , since the end of the east-west conflict in the late 1980s , the use of vetoes by the un security council has tended toward zero .
but the latest example , iraq , shows that the highest un committee can only stop armed conflict from occurring when all of the permanent members want to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general kofi annan addressing the general assembly if un secretary general kofi annan had his way , the organization would undergo reforms in this , its 60th year of existence , bringing it up to date with the 21st century .
but annan 's agenda was thoroughly diluted at the united nations summit in mid-september .
the famed " millennium goals " were approved - who would dare oppose fighting poverty and disease ? - but when it came to financing development aid , the countries once again left matters as nonbinding as possible .
furthermore , security council reform was again delayed amid discord .
and members skirted the issue of actually coming up with an official decision on what constitutes terrorism . forum for ideas once again , it became clear how difficult it is to agree on the future of the united nations .
anyone who dreams of a capable and competent world governing body can only be disappointed by the united nations .
a better option would be to view the united nations in a humbler light .
there are , in fact , areas where the organization gets the job done : the human rights charter , sub-organizations - such as the united nations children 's fund -lrb- unicef -rrb- - and international courts of law represent development milestones .
un organizations have repeatedly won the nobel peace prize , and with good reason .
this year the honor went to the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- and its chief , mohammed elbaradei .
in terms of world peace , though , the united nations is above all a form for exchanging ideas .
in certain cases concrete peace measures are undertaken .
but in the end , the un is n't responsible for bringing peace to the world - that is the job of the 191 member states . klaus dahmann -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe , us bicker over development aid members of the european union have called on the united states to commit itself to the fight against poverty and provide more money with fewer restrictions to the developing world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.10.2005 ozone hole could grow bigger than ever großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists still disagree on the stability of ozone layer levels ozone levels looked like they were stabilizing , but this year a bigger than normal hole could open above the south pole . the protective ozone layer over the earth has thinned to its lowest level ever , alarming scientists who believed it had begun to heal .
they ’ re warning that increased ozone loss is allowing additional harmful ultraviolet light to reach us and making us more vulnerable to sunburn , skin cancer and cataracts . about 20 kilometers -lrb- 12.4 miles -rrb- thick , the layer of ozone gas is like a giant umbrella 15 to 35 kilometers over the earth and like any good pair of sunglasses , it acts like a filter by blocking out most ultraviolet rays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a thin layer of ozone protects from numerous health problems the loss of ozone was discovered over the polar regions 20 years ago and has been closely watched ever since .
scientists continue to disagree about the causes and effects of the ozone level 's thinning , with some stating depletion levels have peaked . scientists divided on ozone depletion according to the united nations world meteorological organization 's latest bulletin , the seasonal hole above the south pole and antarctica is shrinking . " it is the third largest ever , more or less as one would expect from present levels of chlorine and bromine in the atmosphere , " geir braathen , the wmo 's top ozone expert , told reporters tuesday .
" it does n't look as if the ozone hole is going to get any bigger -lrb- in coming years -rrb- .
it seems like we have reached a plateau . " others scientists , such as frank jürgen diekmann of the european space agency , expect this year 's hole over the south pole to be the biggest ever , and doubt the danger is over . " if anything , the ozone concentration has stabilized , " he said .
" but especially in 2005 we ’ re expecting record ozone holes above the antarctic .
going on the latest data , we can ’ t say the danger is gone . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists can agree that levels seem to have stablized especially bad in south it ’ s been more than 18 years since 180 countries signed up to the montreal ozone protocol on reducing emissions of chlorofluorocarbons , -lrb- cfcs -rrb- , which up until then were considered indispensable chemicals for modern living . though there 's no actual " hole " in the ozone layer and only a slight thinning occurs over the rest of the world , climatic conditions are especially dangerous at the south pole .
it would take forty to fifty years for the ozone shield to recover completely - the same amount of time chlorofluorocarbons stay in the atmosphere . polar-stratospheric clouds , which form above the south pole when air masses can not mix in the dark winter months and end up collecting more and ore chlorine compounds , are struck by the southern spring 's sunlight from september to november .
that causes them to break into " radicals " that split ozone into an oxygen molecule and an oxygen atom , making it disappear . greenhouse gases dangerous in north these meteorological conditions can also be dangerous in the northern hemisphere , according to christoph brühl , of the max planck institute for chemistry in mainz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenhouse gasses like co2 endanger the northern hemisphere " the public is looking more and more at the antarctic in connection with the ozone hole , " he said .
" in principle though , the danger is just as great in the northern hemisphere , except that it does n't arise there every year because of various meteorological conditions . " greenhouse gas emissions can also influence the ozone , particularly in the northern hemisphere .
the gasses cool the upper stratosphere , the layer important for the formation of ozone .
if the layer gets too cold , a closed area similar to that over the south pole can form in winter , meaning air masses over the northern hemisphere can no longer exchange , damaging the ozone filter over europe , brühl explained . " up to now we 've always been lucky that the weather put an end to it in march , but that needn ’ t always be so , " he added .
" it could quite easily run into april and that would certainly raise the ultraviolet radiation into germany over the june level .

should berlin be worried ?
dw-world spoke to poland expert dieter bingen . the surprise winner of poland 's runoff presidential election on sunday , 56-year-old lech kaczynski of the conservative law and justice party -lrb- pis -rrb- has ruffled feathers by adopting a nationalistic tone during the election campaign , in particular signaling a tougher approach towards germany and russia . dw-world spoke to dieter bingen , head of the german-poland institute in darmstadt about what the election of the populist leader might mean for future ties between berlin and warsaw . dw-world : what have the poles voted for with lech kaczynski 's victory in the presidential runoff election on sunday ? dieter bingen : the poles have voted in favor of the promise to care more for the social concerns of the losers in society - a state with a heart so to speak - and for the promise that corruption and nepotism will be done away with .
in addition , they voted for kaczynski 's vow to pursue a stronger line in dealing with the communist past and the beneficiaries of the regime after 1990 . the media in germany is talking about a " shift towards right-wing attitudes " and that kaczynski is an anti-semite ?
how do you see it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech kaczynski speaks to supporters after his victory that 's absurd .
lech kaczynski is in no way an anti-semite .
he did get the support of groups and parties who have anti-semitic tendencies - he did take that into account , but he 's not anti-semitic himself though he does play on traditional national hostile stereotypes . and kaczynski 's election ca n't really be described unambiguously as a shift toward right-wing attitudes either .
kaczynski also has strong social aspects , particularly when it comes to the economy he 's rather left-leaning and he 's shown himself to be in favor of a welfare state .
these are elements that he courted very consciously in order to lure away a group of voters who supported the left-wing candidate in the first election phase .
thus he 's more structurally conservative if you will , and in an ideal sense paternalistic when it comes to values and also patriotic . what ramifications will the new situation in poland have for germany ? we 'll have to - at least initially - brace ourselves for some unpleasant situations and reckon with some emotional rhetoric that will question poland 's partnership with germany and in particular warsaw 's political relationship with germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and donald tusk in poland in august , 2005 donald tusk -lrb- of the pro-market civic platform who lost the presidential election to lech kaczynski -rrb- and angela merkel -lrb- germany 's new chancellor-designate -rrb- had already made common plans for the future .
do you think there will be any parallels between kaczynski and other parties in germany ? no , kaczynski did n't seek any contacts at all in germany .
he has no experience with foreign affairs and never gave it much importance . and , what does the new situation in poland mean for europe ? poland 's commitment to european integration in the eu 's political arena will probably not be promoted as much and there 's a danger that poland will isolate and marginalize itself .
poland will probably not pursue an active european policy , but will orient itself much more strongly towards the us . at the same time , that may be simply demonstrative and symbolic and things may appear different when it comes implementation - one has to make a distinction here between the heat of the election campaign and real politics . poland has after all profited from its membership in the eu , particularly its farmers .
does that mean that things wo n't fundamentally change with regard to economic and political ties ? precisely .
poland must have an interest in having allies in germany and not isolate itself in crucial looming budget talks .
if poland is n't constructive there , it can lose out badly . so , atmospherically there will be tensions between poland and germany but eventually we have to wait and see what happens next .
it 's all open .
the civic platform as a coalition partner must ensure that the worst fears do n't become reality . the interview was conducted by pablo kummetz -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conservative kaczynski wins polish election poland on sunday elected the conservative , staunchly catholic lech kaczynski president by a definitive margin , bucking pre-vote surveys that had given his liberal rival the lead .

the orange glow lights up anatoly 's face .
he is one of the 56,000 employees .
the auction will start at over twice the original sale price like anatoly , many of them say they are proud to work here because of the heritage of this steel giant .
based in eastern ukraine , kryvorizhstal was established in the early years of the soviet union .
but its future is not so certain .
on monday , it is being auctioned off live on television for a starting price of $ 2bn - but it is not the first time it has been sold .
this is one of the country 's most lucrative assets - it produces almost 7m tonnes of steel a year .
it was the original sale of kryvorizhstal last year which helped to spark the orange revolution , which brought viktor yushchenko to power .
it was bought by a consortium of businessmen closely linked to the former authorities .
for this steel works , which is the size of a small town , they paid $ 800m , while foreign firms had offered almost double .
the sale has since been declared illegal by the courts .
sale reviewed " during the preparations for the privatisation last year , i was in charge of a special parliamentary commission which revealed lots of violations .
but it was only after the orange revolution that the state was able to take back kryvorizhstal , " says valentyna semeniuk , the head of the state property fund which is responsible for privatisations .
workers like anatoly have pride in their work , but want a future this was one of the main issues of the opposition 's presidential election campaign last year which led to the mass street protests in kiev .
once in power , president yushchenko ordered a review of some of the controversial privatisations of the past .
but kryvorizhstal has been unfairly targeted , according to viktor pinchuk , who was part of the consortium that bought the steelworks .
the billionaire is the son in law of ukraine 's ex-president leonid kuchma .
" this kryvorizhstal case was one of the main symbols of the orange revolution and mr yushchenko promised to the people that if he will win he will take this property back to the state , " says mr pinchuk .
" but it is an absolutely political re-privatisation . "
he is now taking the case to the european court of human rights .
" nobody has paid back our $ 800m - that 's why we are sure there is now only one legal owner of kryvorizhstal and that 's our consortium . "
opposition mps who are based in this industrial heartland have tried unsuccessfully try to halt the repeat sale .
growth hit but the president is determined it will go ahead as a showcase privatisation .
the government will get at least $ 2bn , which will help fund the massive increase in social spending since mr yushchenko came to power .

the orange glow lights up anatoly 's face .
he is one of the 56,000 employees .
the auction will start at over twice the original sale price like anatoly , many of them say they are proud to work here because of the heritage of this steel giant .
based in eastern ukraine , kryvorizhstal was established in the early years of the soviet union .
but its future is not so certain .
on monday , it is being auctioned off live on television for a starting price of $ 2bn - but it is not the first time it has been sold .
this is one of the country 's most lucrative assets - it produces almost 7m tonnes of steel a year .
it was the original sale of kryvorizhstal last year which helped to spark the orange revolution , which brought viktor yushchenko to power .
it was bought by a consortium of businessmen closely linked to the former authorities .
for this steel works , which is the size of a small town , they paid $ 800m , while foreign firms had offered almost double .
the sale has since been declared illegal by the courts .
sale reviewed " during the preparations for the privatisation last year , i was in charge of a special parliamentary commission which revealed lots of violations .
but it was only after the orange revolution that the state was able to take back kryvorizhstal , " says valentyna semeniuk , the head of the state property fund which is responsible for privatisations .
workers like anatoly have pride in their work , but want a future this was one of the main issues of the opposition 's presidential election campaign last year which led to the mass street protests in kiev .
once in power , president yushchenko ordered a review of some of the controversial privatisations of the past .
but kryvorizhstal has been unfairly targeted , according to viktor pinchuk , who was part of the consortium that bought the steelworks .
the billionaire is the son in law of ukraine 's ex-president leonid kuchma .
" this kryvorizhstal case was one of the main symbols of the orange revolution and mr yushchenko promised to the people that if he will win he will take this property back to the state , " says mr pinchuk .
" but it is an absolutely political re-privatisation . "
he is now taking the case to the european court of human rights .
" nobody has paid back our $ 800m - that 's why we are sure there is now only one legal owner of kryvorizhstal and that 's our consortium . "
opposition mps who are based in this industrial heartland have tried unsuccessfully try to halt the repeat sale .
growth hit but the president is determined it will go ahead as a showcase privatisation .
the government will get at least $ 2bn , which will help fund the massive increase in social spending since mr yushchenko came to power .

with 91 % of votes counted , he had polled 55 % , compared to 45 % for his liberal rival donald tusk .
mr tusk has already admitted : " today , i must tell myself i did not make it . "
mr kaczynski said his opponent fought " a splendid battle " and called on mr tusk 's civic platform to conclude talks on a forming parliamentary coalition .
turnout was 50.49 % , slightly higher than the first round a fortnight ago , when mr tusk was narrowly ahead .
top jobs mr kaczynski , whose identical twin jaroslaw heads the law and justice party , has been advocating a " moral renewal " and a return to christian values .
the fourth republic of the kaczynskis warsaw daily gazeta wyborcza press hails twin success the bbc 's adam easton , in warsaw , says the result leaves the law and justice party holding the two top jobs in the country .
both mr kaczynski and mr tusk are former activists of the solidarity trade union , which led the country away from communism .
a run-off was needed after neither achieved the required 50 % majority needed for outright victory in the first round .
mr tusk 's campaign spoke of the " great opportunity " offered by poland 's entry to the european union last year .
but mr kaczynski focused his attacks on the outgoing government of ex-communists , accusing it of corruption and calling for " moral change " .
he also promised to maintain social welfare benefits for the poor .
the current president , former communist aleksander kwasniewski , is unable to stand again , having served the maximum two five-year terms permitted .
under poland 's constitution , the president has less power than the country 's prime minister , but retains a significant say in foreign policy .

the charity said it was a " national scandal " and is campaigning for a rise in the basic state pension .
the charity blames the deaths on expensive heating costs , poor standards of housing and low incomes .
the department of work and pensions says the winter fuel allowance is to help pensioners with heating costs .
age concern cymru said in the last five years more than 8,000 people over 65 in wales have died as a result of the winter months - giving wales one of the highest rates of winter deaths in europe .
it said the warning from the met office of a harsh winter this year could mean even more deaths . "
it is a national scandal that so many older people over 65 are put at risk every winter " rob taylor , age concern cymru the cost of heating , the poor standard of welsh housing and low incomes leave older people in wales vulnerable to the cold weather , according to the charity .
the charity said the deaths , caused by " cold-related illness , " could be avoided and is calling on the government to increase the basic state pension to at least £ 109 a week so all older people have enough money to heat their homes .
rob taylor , director of age concern cymru , said : " it is a national scandal that so many older people over 65 are put at risk every winter .
" in the uk , almost 2.4m older people live in homes that are cold enough to cause illness and this is just unacceptable .
" more needs to be done for older people during the winter months so that they can heat their homes adequately without worrying about the cost . "
however , both the department of work and pensions -lrb- dwp -rrb- and the welsh assembly government said there are measures in place to help pensioners through the winter .
' alleviate stress ' a spokesman for the dwp said : " there are no plans to increase the state pension at the moment . "
but he said there £ 200 winter fuel allowance to all households with pensioners over 60 and the extra £ 100 payment for the over-80s were to " alleviate the stress of pensioners in the winter months " .
a spokesperson for the assembly government said it runs the home energy efficiency scheme offering practical help and benefits to improve living conditions and cut fuel costs .
some parts of the country also operate the warm wales programme which aims to tackle fuel poverty with energy efficiency measures like loft and cavity wall insulation and offer benefits advice to householders .
in partnership with age concern cymru and other organisations , it runs the " keep well this winter " campaign which offers advice to help people stay healthy in colder weather , said the spokesperson .

a new £ 1m dam will protect 50 houses in east peckham from the coult stream , and potential damage estimated at £ 12.1m.
but 198 properties are still at risk .
ian walton , who designed the dam , said defences being drawn up for villages such as east peckham may take 20 years .
the environment agency said work took a decade on average depending on priority with some areas not eligible at all .
engineers had to prove that the coult stream was a significant flood risk to obtain government funding for the dam .
anecdotal evidence and analysis found there had been 13 instances of flooding from the stream in 23 years .
villages ' still at risk ' mr walton said the " excitable " coult stream - which reaches its peak flow six hours after maximum rainfall - was " something we felt we could do something about " .
the civil engineer said : " when the first floods hit in 2000 , the whole of kent was under water .
east peckham flood risk 1,000 properties in the village 260 on the outskirts with an east peckham postcode 50 were at risk from the coult stream 198 still at risk in the medway catchment area " everyone at east peckham thought it was the medway .
" they did n't twig that the coult stream was causing the problem .
" people moved back into houses after the floods in 2000 , and then in 2002 it flooded again .
" everyone was up in arms , but the medway had n't come out of its banks . "
three years later , the village has a dam which in wet weather will hold extra water away from the village and other water courses , storing it over farmland .
residents have welcomed the dam but say they are now waiting to see if it works .
mr walton said : " the big problem in the medway valley is that yalding and -lsb- the village of -rsb- collier street are all at risk from the medway , but it ca n't just be overcome .

"
but he said : " the medway work will be 15 to 20 years before it gets done .
" it is still very much on the drawing board . "
an environment agency spokesman said : " not all homes are eligible for flood defences .
" there is a complicated priority scoring system which means each section of land at risk is judged on environmental and economic grounds .
" flood defences tend to take an average of 10 years from inception to completion because we have to make sure we are not moving the problem elsewhere and we need to ensure it 's the most economic option .
" it could take up to 20 years .
it depends on the priority score .
" anyone in a flood plain should make sure they know they are in a flood plain and if they are at risk they should make a flood plan . "

a new £ 1m dam will protect 50 houses in east peckham from the coult stream , and potential damage estimated at £ 12.1m.
but 198 properties are still at risk .
ian walton , who designed the dam , said defences being drawn up for villages such as east peckham may take 20 years .
the environment agency said work took a decade on average depending on priority with some areas not eligible at all .
engineers had to prove that the coult stream was a significant flood risk to obtain government funding for the dam .
anecdotal evidence and analysis found there had been 13 instances of flooding from the stream in 23 years .
villages ' still at risk ' mr walton said the " excitable " coult stream - which reaches its peak flow six hours after maximum rainfall - was " something we felt we could do something about " .
the civil engineer said : " when the first floods hit in 2000 , the whole of kent was under water .
east peckham flood risk 1,000 properties in the village 260 on the outskirts with an east peckham postcode 50 were at risk from the coult stream 198 still at risk in the medway catchment area " everyone at east peckham thought it was the medway .
" they did n't twig that the coult stream was causing the problem .
" people moved back into houses after the floods in 2000 , and then in 2002 it flooded again .
" everyone was up in arms , but the medway had n't come out of its banks . "
three years later , the village has a dam which in wet weather will hold extra water away from the village and other water courses , storing it over farmland .
residents have welcomed the dam but say they are now waiting to see if it works .
mr walton said : " the big problem in the medway valley is that yalding and -lsb- the village of -rsb- collier street are all at risk from the medway , but it ca n't just be overcome .
properties still at risk river eden and eden brook 723 forest row to penshurst 344 penshurst to leigh barrier 60 allington to tonbridge 667 river tiese and lesser tiese -lrb- includes lamberhurst and yalding -rrb- 1,189 river beult -lrb- yalding -rrb- 885 river bourne -lrb- east peckham -rrb- 198 " the environment agency is trying to come up with a range of measures for yalding and parts of east peckham . "
but he said : " the medway work will be 15 to 20 years before it gets done .
" it is still very much on the drawing board . "
an environment agency spokesman said : " not all homes are eligible for flood defences .
" there is a complicated priority scoring system which means each section of land at risk is judged on environmental and economic grounds .
" flood defences tend to take an average of 10 years from inception to completion because we have to make sure we are not moving the problem elsewhere and we need to ensure it 's the most economic option .
" it could take up to 20 years .
it depends on the priority score .
" anyone in a flood plain should make sure they know they are in a flood plain and if they are at risk they should make a flood plan . "

a new £ 1m dam will protect 50 houses in east peckham from the coult stream , and potential damage estimated at £ 12.1m.
but 198 properties are still at risk .
ian walton , who designed the dam , said defences being drawn up for villages such as east peckham may take 20 years .
the environment agency said work took a decade on average depending on priority with some areas not eligible at all .
engineers had to prove that the coult stream was a significant flood risk to obtain government funding for the dam .
anecdotal evidence and analysis found there had been 13 instances of flooding from the stream in 23 years .
villages ' still at risk ' mr walton said the " excitable " coult stream - which reaches its peak flow six hours after maximum rainfall - was " something we felt we could do something about " .
the civil engineer said : " when the first floods hit in 2000 , the whole of kent was under water .
east peckham flood risk 1,000 properties in the village 260 on the outskirts with an east peckham postcode 50 were at risk from the coult stream 198 still at risk in the medway catchment area " everyone at east peckham thought it was the medway .
" they did n't twig that the coult stream was causing the problem .
" people moved back into houses after the floods in 2000 , and then in 2002 it flooded again .
" everyone was up in arms , but the medway had n't come out of its banks . "
three years later , the village has a dam which in wet weather will hold extra water away from the village and other water courses , storing it over farmland .
residents have welcomed the dam but say they are now waiting to see if it works .
mr walton said : " the big problem in the medway valley is that yalding and -lsb- the village of -rsb- collier street are all at risk from the medway , but it ca n't just be overcome .
properties still at risk river eden and eden brook 723 forest row to penshurst 344 penshurst to leigh barrier 60 allington to tonbridge 667 river tiese and lesser tiese -lrb- includes lamberhurst and yalding -rrb- 1,189 river beult -lrb- yalding -rrb- 885 river bourne -lrb- east peckham -rrb- 198 " the environment agency is trying to come up with a range of measures for yalding and parts of east peckham . "
but he said : " the medway work will be 15 to 20 years before it gets done .
" it is still very much on the drawing board . "
an environment agency spokesman said : " not all homes are eligible for flood defences .
" there is a complicated priority scoring system which means each section of land at risk is judged on environmental and economic grounds .
" flood defences tend to take an average of 10 years from inception to completion because we have to make sure we are not moving the problem elsewhere and we need to ensure it 's the most economic option .
" it could take up to 20 years .
it depends on the priority score .
" anyone in a flood plain should make sure they know they are in a flood plain and if they are at risk they should make a flood plan . "

it comes as no surprise to learn this would-be fan of tv 's lost has still not found the time to watch the show - televison dominates hilary bevan jones ' life , but not from the sofa .
having produced a string of tv favourites including red dwarf , black adder and cracker , the 53-year-old set up tightrope pictures in 2003 with shameless screenwriter paul abbott , creating provocative drama like dad and the girl in the cafe .
in addition , her new post at bafta will almost certainly see her step into the role of chairman , taking over from duncan kenworthy , in june 2006 .
should she accept the role , ms bevan jones will become the first woman to chair the british academy of film and television arts in its 60-year history .
since ms bevan jones joined bafta in 1998 , she has put time and effort into championing the craft awards which honour expertise in areas like photography and design .
paul abbott 's award-winning state of play was produced by bevan jones " bafta has enormous weight .
it is a widely respected organisation , both nationally and internationally .
" i joined the bafta council in the year that the craft awards were separated from the production awards , " explains ms bevan jones .
" there were simply too many awards to hand out in the one ceremony .
" but i was passionately concerned that craft did n't become a second-class citizen .
ms bevan jones has gone on to produce the bafta craft awards over the past six years , attracting high-profile stars like bill nighy and robbie coltrane to the annual ceremony in london .
" in terms of winning a craft award , just to be nominated can change your career .
if someone has been nominated , as a producer you know you are dealing with somebody who is seriously good . "
as the newly-appointed deputy chairman , she is also keen to " break down the glass wall between film and television " .
bevan jones is fascinated by " the buzz " surrounding tv 's lost " of course they should be celebrated individually , but one is not better than the other . "
" i just think there should be more mutual respect . "
despite a perceived " gloss " that surrounds the film world , the tv producer believes times are changing .
" i was talking to an american producer recently and he was saying that because of the success of shows like desperate housewives and lost , attention is turning to television from some of the senior figures in the film world . "
already , in the us , we have seen directors of the calibre of steven spielberg -lrb- band of brothers , taken -rrb- and bryan singer -lrb- house -rrb- , moving into television - and ms bevan jones believes the uk will follow suit .
" i asked a high-profile us director whether he would be willing to direct a tv drama over here .
he said , ultimately , what interested him was the script , whether it was tv or film , big or small budget .
it was really heartening . "
moreover , television can have some advantages over the big screen .
richard curtis , who wrote the girl in the cafe , " could have created the drama for any medium he wanted " , explains ms bevan jones .
girl in the cafe was written by love actually director richard curtis " but - as part of the bbc 's africa lives season - we wanted to get the drama seen around the world at the same time - and we managed that .
" it went out just ahead of the g8 - on hbo , cnn and many of the major international broadcasters .
the co-operation was fantastic . "
it 's an example of the " robust " nature of british television and its growing influence outside of the uk .
but ms bevan jones - for all her admiration of america 's lost - is keen to avoid copy-cat success stories .
" of course , if a show has done well there will always be clones .
but i do n't want to do that .
i 'd like to try and come up with new ideas instead . "
