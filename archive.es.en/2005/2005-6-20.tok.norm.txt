after years of cool relations , this meeting comes as trans-atlantic ties are warming up . eu leaders , including the president of the european commission , jose manual barroso , and the president of the european council , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , will meet with george w. bush on monday to discuss a variety of issues , including economic growth and integration , the environment and energy issues . the trip to washington for the eu heads might well be a welcome diversion from all the problems they face in brussels , including the recent rejection by french and dutch voters of the eu constitution and the wrangling over the next eu budget .
the same could not have been said for the last eu-us summit in june 2004 , when divisions over the iraq war were still fresh in leaders ' minds as were differences over us policy toward over iran and its nuclear program . but since that time , relations across the atlantic have improved considerably . " the backdrop of this summit is much more positive than the previous one , " gunnar wiegand , the european commission 's top official dealing with the us , said in an interview .
" we have had our occasional differences but now we work together much better . " partners the motto of monday 's summit will be " working together as global partners " and will be attended by bush , barroso , juncker , eu trade commissioner peter mandelson , us secretary of state condoleezza rice and eu foreign policy chief javier solana , among others . there is a lot to talk about and much common ground , particularly on the economic level .
the eu and the us share the largest trade and investment relationship in the world .
in 2003 , some $ 750 billion -lrb- 610 billion euros -rrb- in goods and services flowed across the big pond and foreign direct investment levels reached $ 1.75 trillion in the same year . topics of discussion will also include the promotion of democracy , un reform , development and humanitarian assistance and security issues , such as counterterrorism , and transport and border security . strong differences still there bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guantanamo bay naval base in guantanamo , cuba but monday 's meeting is n't likely to be purely a love fest .
there are still big differences of opinion in many areas , such as the kyoto treaty on climate change , the international criminal court , guantanamo bay -lrb- photo -rrb- and the eu 's decision to lift its arms embargo against china . the row over subsidies for plane manufactures airbus and boeing is also a sore subject .
although even here , there 's more talk of cooperation than conflict .
both sides announced on friday that thay will hold new talks in a bid to end the subsidies battle . " talks will continue .
my doors are open , " us trade representative rob portman said after a meeting with his eu counterpart , peter mandelson . but stephanie henning , a fellow at the brussels office of the german marshall fund of the united states , admitted that while eu-us relations have improved the bush administration has not undergone a 180-degree turn regarding europe . " bush may have learned some lessons from iraq , but ultimately he will continue to make decisions according to america 's best interests , " she told upi . however , she added that both sides needed a successful summit after bush 's charm offensive in europe during a visit to brussels in february and europe 's recent turmoil over the constitution . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us , eu on collision course over china two senior members of the united states congress warned the european union this week that the lifting of the 15-year arms embargo on china could result in a halt of us sales in military technology to the eu .

the media in germany is often accused , not least by muslims in the country , of being one-sided and clichéd when it comes to reporting on them .
journalists deny it , saying discernment and responsibility are important . not only muslims living in germany , but also cultural experts routinely criticize the german media for reinforcing stereotypes and being too subjective in its reporting of muslim topics . a look at the german media certainly lends some credence to the allegations .
for instance , the newsmagazine focus ran a headline on its cover recently which referred to " unsettling guests . " the story was about muslims of turkish origin living in germany - people who , in reality , have been living in germany for decades and have long ceased being " guests . "
nonetheless , the word " unsettling " presented them collectively as a threat to german society . the facts , no matter how unpleasant however , representatives of the german media have defended themselves against the allegations , insisting that they ca n't be applied across the board to all publications .
jörg lau , a reporter at the respected intellectual weekly die zeit , also found focus ' choice of words " scandalous , " but he insisted that the media could n't just ignore real problems in the country . " it 's the media 's job to call things - which they see as wrong - by what they are , even when it 's viewed as unpleasant by others , " lau said .
" that also applies when people feel discriminated through it . " many muslims in germany feel discriminated against because news stories featuring muslims usually spark an avalanche of stories in the german media which anchor a negative image of their culture in the public consciousness .
the recent case of an alleged honor killing in berlin involving a young turkish woman was such an example . despite balanced reporting by individual journalists on topics such as honor killings or forced marriages , readers are often left with the impression that the entire muslim community is abusive toward women . provocative headlines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spiegel cover on conspiracy theories surrounding the 9-11 terror attacks .
the issue has taken on an added urgency in the aftermath of the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the us , as articles on muslims and islam appear more frequently in the media . jörg lau admitted that not every newspaper and radio or television channel was objective in its reporting , but underlined the importance of considering the source .
for instance , the headline " allah 's daughters without rights " - which ran on the cover of the esteemed newsmagazine spiegel to address the problems faced by turkish women in germany - was perfectly acceptable , said lau . that did n't keep many muslims in germany from being angered by it though . " i did n't find the headline wrong or misleading , after all , the story was about the rights of the affected women , " lau said .
" however the focus headline " unsettling guests " was demagogy - that should be criticized .
there , the german media should be careful and self-critical . " joachim kandel , an expert on islam at the friedrich ebert foundation said that baiting readers with provocative headlines or top stories was part of the german media culture and was n't just confined to islamic topics . " such sentences are provocative but other topics and other minorities are reported on with equally provocative leads , " kandel said . " but when you read the article in full then you conclude that it usually contains balanced arguments . " at the same time , kandel said that the media has to be allowed to air uncomfortable facts .
" we also have a problem with how muslims want to define their lifestyles based on the koran and the sunna -lrb- islamic practices -rrb- when it comes to human rights , democracy , pluralism .
those are serious questions that must be discussed . " responsible or not ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalist lau pointed out that the debate reflected changing realities in germany , adding that people here had ignored for too long the fact that migrants from muslim countries such as turkey would stay permanently in germany . " people are really unnerved , but not because the others are perhaps ' unsettling ' but because people are in a new situation , " lau said . " germany is a country of immigrants now . " kandel hinted at another development : the fact that , in part because of the muslim population , religion today plays a bigger role in germany than it did 10 years ago .
he said that it was good if the german media followed the development - even if they were criticized for it - because it was the only way they could enlighten readers . " i think most media consumers in germany are aware that there is a difference between the religion islam and radical islamism , " kandel said , adding that was a success for the german media . at the same time , kandel said that , compared to other european countries , germany had witnessed less of a backlash on its muslim community in the aftermath of sept .

the media in germany is often accused , not least by muslims in the country , of being one-sided and clichéd when it comes to reporting on them .
journalists deny it , saying discernment and responsibility are important . not only muslims living in germany , but also cultural experts routinely criticize the german media for reinforcing stereotypes and being too subjective in its reporting of muslim topics . a look at the german media certainly lends some credence to the allegations .
for instance , the newsmagazine focus ran a headline on its cover recently which referred to " unsettling guests . " the story was about muslims of turkish origin living in germany - people who , in reality , have been living in germany for decades and have long ceased being " guests . "
nonetheless , the word " unsettling " presented them collectively as a threat to german society . the facts , no matter how unpleasant however , representatives of the german media have defended themselves against the allegations , insisting that they ca n't be applied across the board to all publications .
jörg lau , a reporter at the respected intellectual weekly die zeit , also found focus ' choice of words " scandalous , " but he insisted that the media could n't just ignore real problems in the country . " it 's the media 's job to call things - which they see as wrong - by what they are , even when it 's viewed as unpleasant by others , " lau said .
" that also applies when people feel discriminated through it . " many muslims in germany feel discriminated against because news stories featuring muslims usually spark an avalanche of stories in the german media which anchor a negative image of their culture in the public consciousness .
the recent case of an alleged honor killing in berlin involving a young turkish woman was such an example . despite balanced reporting by individual journalists on topics such as honor killings or forced marriages , readers are often left with the impression that the entire muslim community is abusive toward women . provocative headlines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spiegel cover on conspiracy theories surrounding the 9-11 terror attacks .

after years of cool relations , this meeting comes as trans-atlantic ties are warming up . eu leaders , including the president of the european commission , jose manual barroso , and the president of the european council , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , will meet with george w. bush on monday to discuss a variety of issues , including economic growth and integration , the environment and energy issues . the trip to washington for the eu heads might well be a welcome diversion from all the problems they face in brussels , including the recent rejection by french and dutch voters of the eu constitution and the wrangling over the next eu budget .
the same could not have been said for the last eu-us summit in june 2004 , when divisions over the iraq war were still fresh in leaders ' minds as were differences over us policy toward over iran and its nuclear program . but since that time , relations across the atlantic have improved considerably .

are they really the same species ?
maybe not , since men and women differ on just about everything except the need to breathe .
a new survey has found out their musical preferences during sex are positively antipodean . the survey , carried out for the german editions of glamour and gq magazines , discovered that the two sexes diverge when it comes to the soundtrack of their lovemaking .
the sonorous strings of mozart during the act and then a little champagne after the deed is done is what 30 percent of women asked would prefer . men , on the other hand , like the sonic landscape around sex to be a little harder .
just under a third , or 31 percent , said they 'd rather hear a little rap music coming out of the loudspeakers to accompany all the moaning and groaning .
after things have calmed down a little , they reported , they could dispense with the bubbly , preferring the classic post-coital cigarette instead . but a sizeable number , 11 percent of both men and women , said they 'd rather chill out during sex , listening to some bob marley and smoking a joint afterwards . men and women did come together over dishonesty about unfaithfulness .
men especially indicated that affairs were to be kept secret .
asked if they would " definitely confess to misconduct " in this area , not one said ' yes ' .
women were n't much more truthful .
only two percent said they would definitely fess up . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de scoring in the soccer love shack next year 's soccer world cup will be a boon to a host of german businesses , not least , the sex trade .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.06.2005 are asylum seekers getting a fair shot ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum seekers fear it : the official german stamp meaning ' expelled ' fewer and fewer refugees are being granted asylum in germany .
human rights groups say this reflects unfair immigration practices rather than improved international conditions . if the official number of refugees in germany was an indication of the state of world conflict , earth would be a very peaceful place indeed .
while germany had 11,000 official asylum seekers in 1998 , in 2004 there were just 2000 .
but a glance at the newspapers shows this is not the case .
crises continue to rage in sudan and iraq ; closer to germany , the political persecution of kurds in turkey and the ongoing conflict in chechnya give hundreds of thousands of people a reason flee their homelands .
' extreme mistrust ' yet just 1.5 percent of the 35,000 people who applied for asylum in germany got it , according to the federal office for migration and refugees .
" there is extreme mistrust and tendency toward refusal on the part of immigration officials , " said bernd mesovic of pro asyl , a nonprofit human rights organization for refugees .
germany is shifting the responsibility for refugees onto other countries , and as a last resort , to the country of origin , his group says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum seeker in germany pro asyl , amnesty international , an association of german magistrates and other organizations have examined how refugees are questioned during their asylum application .
" in cases of doubt , the federal migration office decides against asylum seekers , " said wolfgang grenz , a refugee expert at amnesty international .
he gave the example of a kurdish woman who sought asylum on the basis of allegedly having been tortured in her homeland .
but the application can be denied on the grounds that the torture was n't described in detail .
" in that case , " said grenz , " the official breached his duty by not asking the person to give details . "
personal interview is key the personal interview is the heart of the asylum process .
after they have fled their countries , most applicants have no hard proof of their political oppression ; torturers do n't issue " official torture certificates . "
the decision therefore is usually a subjective one , made by the interviewer who questions the refugee .
is the kurdish woman 's story is true or invented ?
in many cases , it is a difficult call to make .
barbara stolterfoht of the paritätischer wohlfahrtsverband , a leading german social welfare support group , said that officials increasingly assume asylum applicants are not telling the truth and are merely abusing the system .
this assumption can even be subconscious , she said , but either way , it is deadly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people seeking asylum in frankfurt airport .
" the social climate has developed toward being anti-asylum , even though the asylum seekers are just exercising their constitutionally chartered rights , " she said .
according to pro asyl , asylum cases are often seen less as individual situations and are instead standardized to the extent possible .
the group said it frequently sees cases where officials ask questions in order to elicit answers that fit neatly into prearranged categories , rather than dealing with each individual .
" you can be happy when a report caries five or six sentences having to do with the person 's particular situation , " said pro asyl 's mesovic .
fair hearings ?
mesovic also said the person 's country of origin has enormous influence on the outcome of a hearing .
" if officials believe that people are n't tortured in a given country , then that often has more weight than the statement of the refugee who says he or she was tortured , " mesovic said .
the federal migration office denies that is the case .
" the hearings are fair and each applicant has the chance to make detailed statements , and to correct and amplify the statements , " said a spokesperson .

human rights groups say this reflects unfair immigration practices rather than improved international conditions . if the official number of refugees in germany was an indication of the state of world conflict , earth would be a very peaceful place indeed .
while germany had 11,000 official asylum seekers in 1998 , in 2004 there were just 2000 .
but a glance at the newspapers shows this is not the case .
crises continue to rage in sudan and iraq ; closer to germany , the political persecution of kurds in turkey and the ongoing conflict in chechnya give hundreds of thousands of people a reason flee their homelands .
' extreme mistrust ' yet just 1.5 percent of the 35,000 people who applied for asylum in germany got it , according to the federal office for migration and refugees .
" there is extreme mistrust and tendency toward refusal on the part of immigration officials , " said bernd mesovic of pro asyl , a nonprofit human rights organization for refugees .
germany is shifting the responsibility for refugees onto other countries , and as a last resort , to the country of origin , his group says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum seeker in germany pro asyl , amnesty international , an association of german magistrates and other organizations have examined how refugees are questioned during their asylum application .
" in cases of doubt , the federal migration office decides against asylum seekers , " said wolfgang grenz , a refugee expert at amnesty international .
he gave the example of a kurdish woman who sought asylum on the basis of allegedly having been tortured in her homeland .
but the application can be denied on the grounds that the torture was n't described in detail .
" in that case , " said grenz , " the official breached his duty by not asking the person to give details . "
personal interview is key the personal interview is the heart of the asylum process .
after they have fled their countries , most applicants have no hard proof of their political oppression ; torturers do n't issue " official torture certificates . "
the decision therefore is usually a subjective one , made by the interviewer who questions the refugee .
is the kurdish woman 's story is true or invented ?
in many cases , it is a difficult call to make .
barbara stolterfoht of the paritätischer wohlfahrtsverband , a leading german social welfare support group , said that officials increasingly assume asylum applicants are not telling the truth and are merely abusing the system .
this assumption can even be subconscious , she said , but either way , it is deadly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people seeking asylum in frankfurt airport .
" the social climate has developed toward being anti-asylum , even though the asylum seekers are just exercising their constitutionally chartered rights , " she said .
according to pro asyl , asylum cases are often seen less as individual situations and are instead standardized to the extent possible .
the group said it frequently sees cases where officials ask questions in order to elicit answers that fit neatly into prearranged categories , rather than dealing with each individual .
" you can be happy when a report caries five or six sentences having to do with the person 's particular situation , " said pro asyl 's mesovic .
fair hearings ?
mesovic also said the person 's country of origin has enormous influence on the outcome of a hearing .
" if officials believe that people are n't tortured in a given country , then that often has more weight than the statement of the refugee who says he or she was tortured , " mesovic said .
the federal migration office denies that is the case .

but the eu 's current crisis is bound to come up for discussion . rumor has it that us president george w. bush is feeling a bit of schadenfreude these days .
after all , " old europe , " which now faces one of its worst crises after eu budget talks failed last week , opposed his plans to go to war in iraq . officially , however , washington is eager to show its commitment and faith in the union on the other side of the atlantic .
preparing monday 's eu-us summit with her european colleagues , us secretary of state condoleezza rice did her best to pamper the sickly 25-nation bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice -lrb- left -rrb- with solana and asselborn during a meeting in luxembourg in february " europe and the european union is alive , " she said after a meeting with luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn , eu foreign policy chief javier solana and eu external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner .
asselborn currently holds the eu presidency . " we understand that europe is going through a difficult phase right now , " rice added .
" but we continue to hope for an outward-looking europe , not an inward-looking one . " some are gleeful despite rice 's statements , others in washington are gleefully watching europe 's agony from the sidelines .
they have not forgotten vocal opposition to the war in iraq , said michael o 'hanlon , a senior fellow in foreign policy studies at the brookings institution in the us capital . " if we look at europe 's deep division over the iraq war , it 's not clear to everyone in the us why a united and strong eu is really necessary , " he told german public broadcaster ndr . bush needs europe while that may be the thinking of the average american , the us leadership does need a united europe , o 'hanlon said .
bush needs the bloc 's help in rebuilding iraq , in pushing for peace in the middle east and in dealing with iran 's nuclear ambitions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush -lrb- left -rrb- with schröder and chirac in evian , france during the g8 summit in june 2003 despite recent trade disputes such as the airbus-boeing row and fights over steel and banana tariffs , the us and eu economies are also closely intertwined .
in short , bush can not afford a weak eu , o 'hanlon said . " he needs europe 's help , " the political scientist added .
" bush leads a country that has lost 1,700 soldiers in iraq , that has spent $ 200 billion -lrb- 163.6 billion euros -rrb- on a war without seeing results .
bush is n't much better off than -lrb- french president -rrb- jacques chirac or -lrb- german chancellor -rrb- gerhard schröder .

the oil concern relented , but the standoff changed greenpeace , shell and the north sea . in the spring of 1995 , the shell oil exploration company and greenpeace were in the midst of a standoff .
shell announced it would sink the brent spar oil platform in the north sea , and greenpeace activists occupied the platform for a full two weeks in protest .
the media and politicians were drawn to the issue .
helmut kohl , germany 's chancellor at the time , came out opposed to the company 's plan .

" the real success came three years later , when the ospar conference -lrb- a meeting of the convention for the protection of the marine environment of the north-east atlantic -rrb- passed a general ban against sinking oil platforms .

since then , a whole new business has sprung up specialized in recycling oil platforms , smid noted happily .
lessons learned however , greenpeace warns , the north sea remains at risk beyond sunken oil platforms .
simply by carrying out its normal production , the oil industry removes 14,000 tons of petroleum each year from this part of the atlantic .
at the same time as the environmental group celebrates a historic victory , the event led to a widespread questioning of greenpeace 's credibility .
shortly before shell gave in , greenpeace admitted it had estimated the amount of poisonous oil residues in the platform as being much too high .
and the group 's believability - its stock in trade - took a big hit with the public , schmid said .
this led to some changes for greenpeace .

" since then , we have learned to bring new projects into the public sphere for discussion , so we can take public concerns into consideration during the planning phases .

the oil concern relented , but the standoff changed greenpeace , shell and the north sea . in the spring of 1995 , the shell oil exploration company and greenpeace were in the midst of a standoff .
shell announced it would sink the brent spar oil platform in the north sea , and greenpeace activists occupied the platform for a full two weeks in protest .
the media and politicians were drawn to the issue .
helmut kohl , germany 's chancellor at the time , came out opposed to the company 's plan .
a widespread call to boycott shell gas stations in germany overrode party lines .
winning the standoff on june 20 , 1995 , shell said it would dispose of the brent spar on land .
but although it took place 10 years ago , the standoff is still fresh in the minds of many who were involved .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a shell worker in an offshore oil platform in the niger delta karsten smid of greenpeace germany remembers the joy he and his colleagues felt when they realized their protests had been successful .
he sees the campaign as a great victory for environmentalists , even if it was only the first battle won in the larger war .
" the real success came three years later , when the ospar conference -lrb- a meeting of the convention for the protection of the marine environment of the north-east atlantic -rrb- passed a general ban against sinking oil platforms .
no oil platforms have been sunk in the north sea since 1995 .
today it is clear that all obsolete platforms are disposed of on land .
so actually , the big success took place in 1998 , " smid said .
since then , a whole new business has sprung up specialized in recycling oil platforms , smid noted happily .
lessons learned however , greenpeace warns , the north sea remains at risk beyond sunken oil platforms .
simply by carrying out its normal production , the oil industry removes 14,000 tons of petroleum each year from this part of the atlantic .
at the same time as the environmental group celebrates a historic victory , the event led to a widespread questioning of greenpeace 's credibility .
shortly before shell gave in , greenpeace admitted it had estimated the amount of poisonous oil residues in the platform as being much too high .
and the group 's believability - its stock in trade - took a big hit with the public , schmid said .
this led to some changes for greenpeace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a norwegian petrolium drilling platform , " troll " " after that , we formed a research department , to test whether the information that we publicized was correct , " said smid .
" measurements have to be made by two independent laboratories , before the information is made public .
in that way , we very much improved our quality control . "
shell , too , learned some lessons from the brent spar debacle .
rainer winzenried , spokesman for shell in germany , said the company learned that sometimes thing that are legal are not necessarily acceptable to the public .
" since then , we have learned to bring new projects into the public sphere for discussion , so we can take public concerns into consideration during the planning phases .
we do this via so-called " shareholder forums , " said winzenried .
from the brent spar debate , the company also learned to take debates to an international level , even if its individual actions take place within one nation 's borders , winzenried said .
shell 's pr problems shortly after the brent spar debacle , shell faced another international debate : over the company 's actions in nigeria .
in november 1995 , the military regime that was then in power in the west african nation executed nine civil rights activists , including novelist ken saro-wiwa , who had denounced the environmental damage the oil industry had wrought on their homeland .
shell 's image took yet another knock .
today , winzenried said , shell has reduced the burning off of excess petrol that is part of the exploration process .
also , the company has changed its relationship to the people who live in oil-exploration regions .

now that push is coming to shove , the players will have to step up . inter milan 's star striker adriano was racing alone towards mexican keeper oswaldo sanchez and had the opportunity to put the selecao in the lead .
with only light pressure from behind and sanchez charging from the line , adriano looked for the lower right-hand corner and pushed it just outside the right post .
the shot was not exactly one for the schoolbooks .
at halftime , german television commentator and former national player günter netzer jumped all over one of the world 's best players .
" -lrb- germany 's -rrb- lukas podolski would not have missed that shot , " netzer said on german television .
and it was n't just pure jingoistic banter on his part .
just over two weeks ago podolski scored a similar goal against northern ireland - with a defender pulling on his arm and the goalkeeper much closer to him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to his supporters , lukas podolski is " prince poldi " lukas podolski , only 20 years old , has made his mark in a short time .
last june was his first appearance with the german squad but it was n't until his two-goal performance against thailand last december that he made his breakthrough .
since then , " prince poldi " has accumulated another three goals in five matches .
the fc cologne striker just bubbles over with enthusiasm for the game .
for many a young player , this excitement degenerates into arrogance and a failure to make the right decision at important points in a game .
podolski , however , acts like a seasoned veteran .
on saturday , he made the key pass that led to the foul against michael ballack in the tunisian penalty box , and in turn the go-ahead goal .
minutes later , he fed his close friend sebastian schweinsteiger the pass that put germany up 2-0 , all in his home stadium in cologne .
scoring goals naturally would have been more spectacular , but his assists put jürgen klinsmann 's side through to the semi-finals .
john aloisi top scorer after two matches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia 's john aloisi -lrb- back -rrb- has gone on a scoring rampage .
here , he launches a shot past german defender robert huth adriano and robinho from brazil .
or argentina 's juan roman riquleme .
also host country germany 's midfielder michael ballack .
these are some of the names that people had on their list as possible top scorers .
but socceroo john aloisi ?
who 's he , let alone at which club does he earn his keep ?
well , to answer the first question , aloisi has scored four goals against two the confedrations cup favorites , germany and argentina and leads the chase for the golden boot in the tournament .
for those who might make light of the fact that his 21 goals in 34 matches for the roos came against lightweights like the solomon islands or papua new guinea in the oceania confederation now have to eat their words .
the good performance could n't have come at a better time for the 29-year old striker .
that 's how the second question can be answered .
his contract with spanish side osasuna will expire at the end of the month and it wo n't be extended .
so , he 's looking for a new employer .
two premiereship sides have shown interest .
" i could picture myself playing in the bundesliga , " is what he told the sport magazine kicker .
another goal or two in the socceroos ' final match against tunisia would turn enough heads in germany to make that a possibility .
one out of three is bad mexico 's jared borgetti could have been the tragic figure on sunday night against brazil .
despite missing on two of three penalty attempts in the 30th minute , the final one saved by brazilian keeper dida , he shook off the failures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's jared borgetti , partially obscured at rear , was a head taller than the brazilians on his goal on sunday in the 59th minute , he headed in what would be the game winner for the " tri . "
in the process , mexico has turned into a nemesis for the five-time world champions brazil .
starting with the confed cup final in 1999 , which mexico won over the selecao 4-3 , mexico have beaten the brazilian five times , losing only once and drawing once .

human rights groups say this reflects unfair immigration practices rather than improved international conditions . if the official number of refugees in germany was an indication of the state of world conflict , earth would be a very peaceful place indeed .
while germany had 11,000 official asylum seekers in 1998 , in 2004 there were just 2000 .
but a glance at the newspapers shows this is not the case .
crises continue to rage in sudan and iraq ; closer to germany , the political persecution of kurds in turkey and the ongoing conflict in chechnya give hundreds of thousands of people a reason flee their homelands .
' extreme mistrust ' yet just 1.5 percent of the 35,000 people who applied for asylum in germany got it , according to the federal office for migration and refugees .

" in cases of doubt , the federal migration office decides against asylum seekers , " said wolfgang grenz , a refugee expert at amnesty international .
he gave the example of a kurdish woman who sought asylum on the basis of allegedly having been tortured in her homeland .
but the application can be denied on the grounds that the torture was n't described in detail .

the decision therefore is usually a subjective one , made by the interviewer who questions the refugee .
is the kurdish woman 's story is true or invented ?
in many cases , it is a difficult call to make .
barbara stolterfoht of the paritätischer wohlfahrtsverband , a leading german social welfare support group , said that officials increasingly assume asylum applicants are not telling the truth and are merely abusing the system .
this assumption can even be subconscious , she said , but either way , it is deadly .

according to pro asyl , asylum cases are often seen less as individual situations and are instead standardized to the extent possible .
the group said it frequently sees cases where officials ask questions in order to elicit answers that fit neatly into prearranged categories , rather than dealing with each individual .

mesovic also said the person 's country of origin has enormous influence on the outcome of a hearing .
" if officials believe that people are n't tortured in a given country , then that often has more weight than the statement of the refugee who says he or she was tortured , " mesovic said .

pro asyl compared notes taken during hearings that resulted in asylum denials and found that many people were turned down when contradictions in their stories made their reasons for seeking asylum less credible .
yet in the transcripts of the hearings , there was no mention of the contradictions .

the oil concern relented , but the standoff changed greenpeace , shell and the north sea . in the spring of 1995 , the shell oil exploration company and greenpeace were in the midst of a standoff .
shell announced it would sink the brent spar oil platform in the north sea , and greenpeace activists occupied the platform for a full two weeks in protest .
the media and politicians were drawn to the issue .
helmut kohl , germany 's chancellor at the time , came out opposed to the company 's plan .
a widespread call to boycott shell gas stations in germany overrode party lines .

" the real success came three years later , when the ospar conference -lrb- a meeting of the convention for the protection of the marine environment of the north-east atlantic -rrb- passed a general ban against sinking oil platforms .
no oil platforms have been sunk in the north sea since 1995 .

since then , a whole new business has sprung up specialized in recycling oil platforms , smid noted happily .
lessons learned however , greenpeace warns , the north sea remains at risk beyond sunken oil platforms .
simply by carrying out its normal production , the oil industry removes 14,000 tons of petroleum each year from this part of the atlantic .
at the same time as the environmental group celebrates a historic victory , the event led to a widespread questioning of greenpeace 's credibility .
shortly before shell gave in , greenpeace admitted it had estimated the amount of poisonous oil residues in the platform as being much too high .
and the group 's believability - its stock in trade - took a big hit with the public , schmid said .
this led to some changes for greenpeace .

rainer winzenried , spokesman for shell in germany , said the company learned that sometimes thing that are legal are not necessarily acceptable to the public .
" since then , we have learned to bring new projects into the public sphere for discussion , so we can take public concerns into consideration during the planning phases .

in november 1995 , the military regime that was then in power in the west african nation executed nine civil rights activists , including novelist ken saro-wiwa , who had denounced the environmental damage the oil industry had wrought on their homeland .
shell 's image took yet another knock .
today , winzenried said , shell has reduced the burning off of excess petrol that is part of the exploration process .

the oil concern relented , but the standoff changed greenpeace , shell and the north sea . in the spring of 1995 , the shell oil exploration company and greenpeace were in the midst of a standoff .
shell announced it would sink the brent spar oil platform in the north sea , and greenpeace activists occupied the platform for a full two weeks in protest .
the media and politicians were drawn to the issue .
helmut kohl , germany 's chancellor at the time , came out opposed to the company 's plan .
a widespread call to boycott shell gas stations in germany overrode party lines .

but the eu 's current crisis is bound to come up for discussion . rumor has it that us president george w. bush is feeling a bit of schadenfreude these days .
after all , " old europe , " which now faces one of its worst crises after eu budget talks failed last week , opposed his plans to go to war in iraq . officially , however , washington is eager to show its commitment and faith in the union on the other side of the atlantic .
preparing monday 's eu-us summit with her european colleagues , us secretary of state condoleezza rice did her best to pamper the sickly 25-nation bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice -lrb- left -rrb- with solana and asselborn during a meeting in luxembourg in february " europe and the european union is alive , " she said after a meeting with luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn , eu foreign policy chief javier solana and eu external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner .
asselborn currently holds the eu presidency . " we understand that europe is going through a difficult phase right now , " rice added .
" but we continue to hope for an outward-looking europe , not an inward-looking one . " some are gleeful despite rice 's statements , others in washington are gleefully watching europe 's agony from the sidelines .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.06.2005 are asylum seekers getting a fair shot ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum seekers fear it : the official german stamp meaning ' expelled ' fewer and fewer refugees are being granted asylum in germany .
human rights groups say this reflects unfair immigration practices rather than improved international conditions . if the official number of refugees in germany was an indication of the state of world conflict , earth would be a very peaceful place indeed .
while germany had 11,000 official asylum seekers in 1998 , in 2004 there were just 2000 .
but a glance at the newspapers shows this is not the case .
crises continue to rage in sudan and iraq ; closer to germany , the political persecution of kurds in turkey and the ongoing conflict in chechnya give hundreds of thousands of people a reason flee their homelands .
' extreme mistrust ' yet just 1.5 percent of the 35,000 people who applied for asylum in germany got it , according to the federal office for migration and refugees .
" there is extreme mistrust and tendency toward refusal on the part of immigration officials , " said bernd mesovic of pro asyl , a nonprofit human rights organization for refugees .
germany is shifting the responsibility for refugees onto other countries , and as a last resort , to the country of origin , his group says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum seeker in germany pro asyl , amnesty international , an association of german magistrates and other organizations have examined how refugees are questioned during their asylum application .
" in cases of doubt , the federal migration office decides against asylum seekers , " said wolfgang grenz , a refugee expert at amnesty international .
he gave the example of a kurdish woman who sought asylum on the basis of allegedly having been tortured in her homeland .
but the application can be denied on the grounds that the torture was n't described in detail .
" in that case , " said grenz , " the official breached his duty by not asking the person to give details . "
personal interview is key the personal interview is the heart of the asylum process .
after they have fled their countries , most applicants have no hard proof of their political oppression ; torturers do n't issue " official torture certificates . "
the decision therefore is usually a subjective one , made by the interviewer who questions the refugee .
is the kurdish woman 's story is true or invented ?
in many cases , it is a difficult call to make .
barbara stolterfoht of the paritätischer wohlfahrtsverband , a leading german social welfare support group , said that officials increasingly assume asylum applicants are not telling the truth and are merely abusing the system .
this assumption can even be subconscious , she said , but either way , it is deadly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people seeking asylum in frankfurt airport .
" the social climate has developed toward being anti-asylum , even though the asylum seekers are just exercising their constitutionally chartered rights , " she said .
according to pro asyl , asylum cases are often seen less as individual situations and are instead standardized to the extent possible .
the group said it frequently sees cases where officials ask questions in order to elicit answers that fit neatly into prearranged categories , rather than dealing with each individual .
" you can be happy when a report caries five or six sentences having to do with the person 's particular situation , " said pro asyl 's mesovic .
fair hearings ?
mesovic also said the person 's country of origin has enormous influence on the outcome of a hearing .
" if officials believe that people are n't tortured in a given country , then that often has more weight than the statement of the refugee who says he or she was tortured , " mesovic said .
the federal migration office denies that is the case .
" the hearings are fair and each applicant has the chance to make detailed statements , and to correct and amplify the statements , " said a spokesperson .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugees in darfur but pro asyl and amnesty say otherwise .
in their experience , the groups have said , applicants are n't informed of contradictions in their statements , and therefore forego their legal right to change their statements .
pro asyl compared notes taken during hearings that resulted in asylum denials and found that many people were turned down when contradictions in their stories made their reasons for seeking asylum less credible .
yet in the transcripts of the hearings , there was no mention of the contradictions .
political decisionmaking ?
thus the asylum seekers did n't know which part of the hearing was important in deciding their case .
pro asyl 's mesovic attributed the practice to a political move .
" the quota of asylum cases that are granted are steered politically , " he said .
" the federal migration office is doing nothing more or less than carrying out the concept of interior minister -lrb- otto -rrb- schily . "
for his part , schily has said he hopes to move the asylum process at least in part to refugee camps in north africa . manfred götzke -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu approves refugee camp pilot schemes after debating proposals put forward by germany 's otto schily , the european commission has agreed to set up pilot schemes in five north african countries to cope with the influx of refugees heading to europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 20.06.2005 conservatives : scale back immigration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservatives say germany has n't absorbed the immigrants it has germany ’ s opposition conservatives are stirring up controversy after announcing they will seek to impose more limits on immigration if they win september ’ s general election in germany . only 7 months after a landmark new immigration law came into force in germany , the country ’ s conservatives are seeking to impose substantial curbs on the influx of foreigners . günther beckstein , interior minister from the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- in the state of bavaria , said this weekend that germany had not yet digested the wave of new immigrants who came here after the collapse of the iron curtain .
he said calls for freer access to germany were utterly wrong . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein " we have not yet come to grips with the wave of immigration in the past decade , " he said .
" we are still struggling to integrate those immigrants already here , which requires a strong political effort and a willingness by immigrants to fully embrace this country . " influx from former ussr in the past 15 years , germany has seen a dramatic influx of foreigners mainly from the former soviet union where ethnic germans were allowed to emigrate after the collapse of communism there . in the early 1990s , almost 200,000 russians of german origin came here each year under laws giving them german citizenship automatically .
they were people who have often found it difficult to adapt to western life and culture . the conservatives also aim to limit immigration of people from other countries who come to germany under new immigration rules .
the new laws , which were recently adopted with the support of the conservatives , allow for increased immigration to offset the demographic imbalances created by an ageing german population and dwindling birth rates . but wolfgang bosbach , a senior christian democrat , says that the quality of immigrants will take precedence over quantity under a future conservative government . " some people claim we need even more immigration to be able to stabilize our social security systems , " he said .
" such arguments overlook the fact that we need people who contribute to the system and don ’ t prove to be a drain on it as is currently the case . " antiquated arguments the suggestions about curbing immigration have drawn much criticism , especially from germany ’ s green party , which has been a champion of a more liberal immigration policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth " arguments suggesting germany doesn ’ t need any more immigration and calling on german women to have more babies is absolutely antiquated , " said claudia roth , chairwoman of the green party .
" the conservatives have retrieved an old dusted hat from the cupboard of history which unfortunately fits their anti-immigration campaign platform . " however , the anti-immigration drive is only one of a series of controversial moves planned by germany ’ s conservatives after a likely takeover of central power in berlin . bolstered by an almost 20-point lead over the ruling spd in the opinion polls , they ’ ve become bolder in their campaign , planning also a substantial overhaul of the tax system , which is expected to include reductions in income taxes and social contributions in exchange for scrapping some subsidies and hiking the value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- . uwe hessler -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a german amnesty for illegal immigrants ?
an initiative in germany wants to secure the basic rights of its around one million illegal immigrants .
but , the country still lags far behind other eu countries when it comes to dealing with the issue .
march 10 , 2005 government says immigrant wave receding in germany immigration into germany in the year 2003 , for the first time in many decades , dropped below 800,000 as the influx of foreigners throughout the 1990s has receded , according to government statistics released on monday .

human rights groups say this reflects unfair immigration practices rather than improved international conditions . if the official number of refugees in germany was an indication of the state of world conflict , earth would be a very peaceful place indeed .
while germany had 11,000 official asylum seekers in 1998 , in 2004 there were just 2000 .
but a glance at the newspapers shows this is not the case .
crises continue to rage in sudan and iraq ; closer to germany , the political persecution of kurds in turkey and the ongoing conflict in chechnya give hundreds of thousands of people a reason flee their homelands .
' extreme mistrust ' yet just 1.5 percent of the 35,000 people who applied for asylum in germany got it , according to the federal office for migration and refugees .
" there is extreme mistrust and tendency toward refusal on the part of immigration officials , " said bernd mesovic of pro asyl , a nonprofit human rights organization for refugees .
germany is shifting the responsibility for refugees onto other countries , and as a last resort , to the country of origin , his group says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum seeker in germany pro asyl , amnesty international , an association of german magistrates and other organizations have examined how refugees are questioned during their asylum application .
" in cases of doubt , the federal migration office decides against asylum seekers , " said wolfgang grenz , a refugee expert at amnesty international .
he gave the example of a kurdish woman who sought asylum on the basis of allegedly having been tortured in her homeland .
but the application can be denied on the grounds that the torture was n't described in detail .
" in that case , " said grenz , " the official breached his duty by not asking the person to give details . "
personal interview is key the personal interview is the heart of the asylum process .
after they have fled their countries , most applicants have no hard proof of their political oppression ; torturers do n't issue " official torture certificates . "
the decision therefore is usually a subjective one , made by the interviewer who questions the refugee .
is the kurdish woman 's story is true or invented ?
in many cases , it is a difficult call to make .
barbara stolterfoht of the paritätischer wohlfahrtsverband , a leading german social welfare support group , said that officials increasingly assume asylum applicants are not telling the truth and are merely abusing the system .
this assumption can even be subconscious , she said , but either way , it is deadly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people seeking asylum in frankfurt airport .
" the social climate has developed toward being anti-asylum , even though the asylum seekers are just exercising their constitutionally chartered rights , " she said .
according to pro asyl , asylum cases are often seen less as individual situations and are instead standardized to the extent possible .
the group said it frequently sees cases where officials ask questions in order to elicit answers that fit neatly into prearranged categories , rather than dealing with each individual .
" you can be happy when a report caries five or six sentences having to do with the person 's particular situation , " said pro asyl 's mesovic .
fair hearings ?
mesovic also said the person 's country of origin has enormous influence on the outcome of a hearing .
" if officials believe that people are n't tortured in a given country , then that often has more weight than the statement of the refugee who says he or she was tortured , " mesovic said .
the federal migration office denies that is the case .
" the hearings are fair and each applicant has the chance to make detailed statements , and to correct and amplify the statements , " said a spokesperson .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugees in darfur but pro asyl and amnesty say otherwise .
in their experience , the groups have said , applicants are n't informed of contradictions in their statements , and therefore forego their legal right to change their statements .
pro asyl compared notes taken during hearings that resulted in asylum denials and found that many people were turned down when contradictions in their stories made their reasons for seeking asylum less credible .
yet in the transcripts of the hearings , there was no mention of the contradictions .
political decisionmaking ?
thus the asylum seekers did n't know which part of the hearing was important in deciding their case .
pro asyl 's mesovic attributed the practice to a political move .
" the quota of asylum cases that are granted are steered politically , " he said .
" the federal migration office is doing nothing more or less than carrying out the concept of interior minister -lrb- otto -rrb- schily . "
for his part , schily has said he hopes to move the asylum process at least in part to refugee camps in north africa . manfred götzke -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu approves refugee camp pilot schemes after debating proposals put forward by germany 's otto schily , the european commission has agreed to set up pilot schemes in five north african countries to cope with the influx of refugees heading to europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 20.06.2005 conservatives : scale back immigration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservatives say germany has n't absorbed the immigrants it has germany ’ s opposition conservatives are stirring up controversy after announcing they will seek to impose more limits on immigration if they win september ’ s general election in germany . only 7 months after a landmark new immigration law came into force in germany , the country ’ s conservatives are seeking to impose substantial curbs on the influx of foreigners . günther beckstein , interior minister from the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- in the state of bavaria , said this weekend that germany had not yet digested the wave of new immigrants who came here after the collapse of the iron curtain .
he said calls for freer access to germany were utterly wrong . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein " we have not yet come to grips with the wave of immigration in the past decade , " he said .
" we are still struggling to integrate those immigrants already here , which requires a strong political effort and a willingness by immigrants to fully embrace this country . " influx from former ussr in the past 15 years , germany has seen a dramatic influx of foreigners mainly from the former soviet union where ethnic germans were allowed to emigrate after the collapse of communism there . in the early 1990s , almost 200,000 russians of german origin came here each year under laws giving them german citizenship automatically .
they were people who have often found it difficult to adapt to western life and culture . the conservatives also aim to limit immigration of people from other countries who come to germany under new immigration rules .
the new laws , which were recently adopted with the support of the conservatives , allow for increased immigration to offset the demographic imbalances created by an ageing german population and dwindling birth rates . but wolfgang bosbach , a senior christian democrat , says that the quality of immigrants will take precedence over quantity under a future conservative government . " some people claim we need even more immigration to be able to stabilize our social security systems , " he said .
" such arguments overlook the fact that we need people who contribute to the system and don ’ t prove to be a drain on it as is currently the case . " antiquated arguments the suggestions about curbing immigration have drawn much criticism , especially from germany ’ s green party , which has been a champion of a more liberal immigration policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth " arguments suggesting germany doesn ’ t need any more immigration and calling on german women to have more babies is absolutely antiquated , " said claudia roth , chairwoman of the green party .
" the conservatives have retrieved an old dusted hat from the cupboard of history which unfortunately fits their anti-immigration campaign platform . " however , the anti-immigration drive is only one of a series of controversial moves planned by germany ’ s conservatives after a likely takeover of central power in berlin . bolstered by an almost 20-point lead over the ruling spd in the opinion polls , they ’ ve become bolder in their campaign , planning also a substantial overhaul of the tax system , which is expected to include reductions in income taxes and social contributions in exchange for scrapping some subsidies and hiking the value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- . uwe hessler -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a german amnesty for illegal immigrants ?
an initiative in germany wants to secure the basic rights of its around one million illegal immigrants .
but , the country still lags far behind other eu countries when it comes to dealing with the issue .
march 10 , 2005 government says immigrant wave receding in germany immigration into germany in the year 2003 , for the first time in many decades , dropped below 800,000 as the influx of foreigners throughout the 1990s has receded , according to government statistics released on monday .

are they really the same species ?
maybe not , since men and women differ on just about everything except the need to breathe .
a new survey has found out their musical preferences during sex are positively antipodean . the survey , carried out for the german editions of glamour and gq magazines , discovered that the two sexes diverge when it comes to the soundtrack of their lovemaking .
the sonorous strings of mozart during the act and then a little champagne after the deed is done is what 30 percent of women asked would prefer . men , on the other hand , like the sonic landscape around sex to be a little harder .
just under a third , or 31 percent , said they 'd rather hear a little rap music coming out of the loudspeakers to accompany all the moaning and groaning .
after things have calmed down a little , they reported , they could dispense with the bubbly , preferring the classic post-coital cigarette instead . but a sizeable number , 11 percent of both men and women , said they 'd rather chill out during sex , listening to some bob marley and smoking a joint afterwards . men and women did come together over dishonesty about unfaithfulness .
men especially indicated that affairs were to be kept secret .
asked if they would " definitely confess to misconduct " in this area , not one said ' yes ' .
women were n't much more truthful .
only two percent said they would definitely fess up . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de scoring in the soccer love shack next year 's soccer world cup will be a boon to a host of german businesses , not least , the sex trade .

now that push is coming to shove , the players will have to step up . inter milan 's star striker adriano was racing alone towards mexican keeper oswaldo sanchez and had the opportunity to put the selecao in the lead .
with only light pressure from behind and sanchez charging from the line , adriano looked for the lower right-hand corner and pushed it just outside the right post .
the shot was not exactly one for the schoolbooks .
at halftime , german television commentator and former national player günter netzer jumped all over one of the world 's best players .
" -lrb- germany 's -rrb- lukas podolski would not have missed that shot , " netzer said on german television .
and it was n't just pure jingoistic banter on his part .
just over two weeks ago podolski scored a similar goal against northern ireland - with a defender pulling on his arm and the goalkeeper much closer to him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to his supporters , lukas podolski is " prince poldi " lukas podolski , only 20 years old , has made his mark in a short time .
last june was his first appearance with the german squad but it was n't until his two-goal performance against thailand last december that he made his breakthrough .
since then , " prince poldi " has accumulated another three goals in five matches .
the fc cologne striker just bubbles over with enthusiasm for the game .
for many a young player , this excitement degenerates into arrogance and a failure to make the right decision at important points in a game .
podolski , however , acts like a seasoned veteran .
on saturday , he made the key pass that led to the foul against michael ballack in the tunisian penalty box , and in turn the go-ahead goal .
minutes later , he fed his close friend sebastian schweinsteiger the pass that put germany up 2-0 , all in his home stadium in cologne .
scoring goals naturally would have been more spectacular , but his assists put jürgen klinsmann 's side through to the semi-finals .
john aloisi top scorer after two matches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia 's john aloisi -lrb- back -rrb- has gone on a scoring rampage .
here , he launches a shot past german defender robert huth adriano and robinho from brazil .
or argentina 's juan roman riquleme .
also host country germany 's midfielder michael ballack .
these are some of the names that people had on their list as possible top scorers .
but socceroo john aloisi ?
who 's he , let alone at which club does he earn his keep ?
well , to answer the first question , aloisi has scored four goals against two the confedrations cup favorites , germany and argentina and leads the chase for the golden boot in the tournament .
for those who might make light of the fact that his 21 goals in 34 matches for the roos came against lightweights like the solomon islands or papua new guinea in the oceania confederation now have to eat their words .
the good performance could n't have come at a better time for the 29-year old striker .
that 's how the second question can be answered .
his contract with spanish side osasuna will expire at the end of the month and it wo n't be extended .
so , he 's looking for a new employer .
two premiereship sides have shown interest .
" i could picture myself playing in the bundesliga , " is what he told the sport magazine kicker .
another goal or two in the socceroos ' final match against tunisia would turn enough heads in germany to make that a possibility .
one out of three is bad mexico 's jared borgetti could have been the tragic figure on sunday night against brazil .
despite missing on two of three penalty attempts in the 30th minute , the final one saved by brazilian keeper dida , he shook off the failures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's jared borgetti , partially obscured at rear , was a head taller than the brazilians on his goal on sunday in the 59th minute , he headed in what would be the game winner for the " tri . "
in the process , mexico has turned into a nemesis for the five-time world champions brazil .
starting with the confed cup final in 1999 , which mexico won over the selecao 4-3 , mexico have beaten the brazilian five times , losing only once and drawing once .
this victory has put mexico in the semi-finals while tournament favorite brazil must at least achieve a tie against japan to secure the second group b semi-final spot . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no masterpiece from brazil 's soccer artists mexico provide the first big surprise in the confederations cup by knocking off world champs brazil , 1-0 .

just over two weeks ago podolski scored a similar goal against northern ireland - with a defender pulling on his arm and the goalkeeper much closer to him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to his supporters , lukas podolski is " prince poldi " lukas podolski , only 20 years old , has made his mark in a short time .
last june was his first appearance with the german squad but it was n't until his two-goal performance against thailand last december that he made his breakthrough .
since then , " prince poldi " has accumulated another three goals in five matches .
the fc cologne striker just bubbles over with enthusiasm for the game .
for many a young player , this excitement degenerates into arrogance and a failure to make the right decision at important points in a game .
podolski , however , acts like a seasoned veteran .
on saturday , he made the key pass that led to the foul against michael ballack in the tunisian penalty box , and in turn the go-ahead goal .
minutes later , he fed his close friend sebastian schweinsteiger the pass that put germany up 2-0 , all in his home stadium in cologne .
scoring goals naturally would have been more spectacular , but his assists put jürgen klinsmann 's side through to the semi-finals .
john aloisi top scorer after two matches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia 's john aloisi -lrb- back -rrb- has gone on a scoring rampage .
here , he launches a shot past german defender robert huth adriano and robinho from brazil .
or argentina 's juan roman riquleme .
also host country germany 's midfielder michael ballack .
these are some of the names that people had on their list as possible top scorers .
but socceroo john aloisi ?
who 's he , let alone at which club does he earn his keep ?
well , to answer the first question , aloisi has scored four goals against two the confedrations cup favorites , germany and argentina and leads the chase for the golden boot in the tournament .
for those who might make light of the fact that his 21 goals in 34 matches for the roos came against lightweights like the solomon islands or papua new guinea in the oceania confederation now have to eat their words .
the good performance could n't have come at a better time for the 29-year old striker .
that 's how the second question can be answered .
his contract with spanish side osasuna will expire at the end of the month and it wo n't be extended .
so , he 's looking for a new employer .
two premiereship sides have shown interest .
" i could picture myself playing in the bundesliga , " is what he told the sport magazine kicker .
another goal or two in the socceroos ' final match against tunisia would turn enough heads in germany to make that a possibility .
one out of three is bad mexico 's jared borgetti could have been the tragic figure on sunday night against brazil .
despite missing on two of three penalty attempts in the 30th minute , the final one saved by brazilian keeper dida , he shook off the failures .

starting with the confed cup final in 1999 , which mexico won over the selecao 4-3 , mexico have beaten the brazilian five times , losing only once and drawing once .

now that push is coming to shove , the players will have to step up . inter milan 's star striker adriano was racing alone towards mexican keeper oswaldo sanchez and had the opportunity to put the selecao in the lead .
with only light pressure from behind and sanchez charging from the line , adriano looked for the lower right-hand corner and pushed it just outside the right post .
the shot was not exactly one for the schoolbooks .
at halftime , german television commentator and former national player günter netzer jumped all over one of the world 's best players .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.06.2005 german media under fire from muslims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does the german media serve up stereotypes ?
the media in germany is often accused , not least by muslims in the country , of being one-sided and clichéd when it comes to reporting on them .
journalists deny it , saying discernment and responsibility are important . not only muslims living in germany , but also cultural experts routinely criticize the german media for reinforcing stereotypes and being too subjective in its reporting of muslim topics . a look at the german media certainly lends some credence to the allegations .
for instance , the newsmagazine focus ran a headline on its cover recently which referred to " unsettling guests . " the story was about muslims of turkish origin living in germany - people who , in reality , have been living in germany for decades and have long ceased being " guests . "
nonetheless , the word " unsettling " presented them collectively as a threat to german society . the facts , no matter how unpleasant however , representatives of the german media have defended themselves against the allegations , insisting that they ca n't be applied across the board to all publications .
jörg lau , a reporter at the respected intellectual weekly die zeit , also found focus ' choice of words " scandalous , " but he insisted that the media could n't just ignore real problems in the country . " it 's the media 's job to call things - which they see as wrong - by what they are , even when it 's viewed as unpleasant by others , " lau said .
" that also applies when people feel discriminated through it . " many muslims in germany feel discriminated against because news stories featuring muslims usually spark an avalanche of stories in the german media which anchor a negative image of their culture in the public consciousness .
the recent case of an alleged honor killing in berlin involving a young turkish woman was such an example . despite balanced reporting by individual journalists on topics such as honor killings or forced marriages , readers are often left with the impression that the entire muslim community is abusive toward women . provocative headlines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spiegel cover on conspiracy theories surrounding the 9-11 terror attacks .
the issue has taken on an added urgency in the aftermath of the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the us , as articles on muslims and islam appear more frequently in the media . jörg lau admitted that not every newspaper and radio or television channel was objective in its reporting , but underlined the importance of considering the source .
for instance , the headline " allah 's daughters without rights " - which ran on the cover of the esteemed newsmagazine spiegel to address the problems faced by turkish women in germany - was perfectly acceptable , said lau . that did n't keep many muslims in germany from being angered by it though . " i did n't find the headline wrong or misleading , after all , the story was about the rights of the affected women , " lau said .
" however the focus headline " unsettling guests " was demagogy - that should be criticized .
there , the german media should be careful and self-critical . " joachim kandel , an expert on islam at the friedrich ebert foundation said that baiting readers with provocative headlines or top stories was part of the german media culture and was n't just confined to islamic topics . " such sentences are provocative but other topics and other minorities are reported on with equally provocative leads , " kandel said . " but when you read the article in full then you conclude that it usually contains balanced arguments . " at the same time , kandel said that the media has to be allowed to air uncomfortable facts .
" we also have a problem with how muslims want to define their lifestyles based on the koran and the sunna -lrb- islamic practices -rrb- when it comes to human rights , democracy , pluralism .
those are serious questions that must be discussed . " responsible or not ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalist lau pointed out that the debate reflected changing realities in germany , adding that people here had ignored for too long the fact that migrants from muslim countries such as turkey would stay permanently in germany . " people are really unnerved , but not because the others are perhaps ' unsettling ' but because people are in a new situation , " lau said . " germany is a country of immigrants now . " kandel hinted at another development : the fact that , in part because of the muslim population , religion today plays a bigger role in germany than it did 10 years ago .
he said that it was good if the german media followed the development - even if they were criticized for it - because it was the only way they could enlighten readers . " i think most media consumers in germany are aware that there is a difference between the religion islam and radical islamism , " kandel said , adding that was a success for the german media . at the same time , kandel said that , compared to other european countries , germany had witnessed less of a backlash on its muslim community in the aftermath of sept .

the media in germany is often accused , not least by muslims in the country , of being one-sided and clichéd when it comes to reporting on them .
journalists deny it , saying discernment and responsibility are important . not only muslims living in germany , but also cultural experts routinely criticize the german media for reinforcing stereotypes and being too subjective in its reporting of muslim topics . a look at the german media certainly lends some credence to the allegations .
for instance , the newsmagazine focus ran a headline on its cover recently which referred to " unsettling guests . " the story was about muslims of turkish origin living in germany - people who , in reality , have been living in germany for decades and have long ceased being " guests . "
nonetheless , the word " unsettling " presented them collectively as a threat to german society . the facts , no matter how unpleasant however , representatives of the german media have defended themselves against the allegations , insisting that they ca n't be applied across the board to all publications .
jörg lau , a reporter at the respected intellectual weekly die zeit , also found focus ' choice of words " scandalous , " but he insisted that the media could n't just ignore real problems in the country . " it 's the media 's job to call things - which they see as wrong - by what they are , even when it 's viewed as unpleasant by others , " lau said .
" that also applies when people feel discriminated through it . " many muslims in germany feel discriminated against because news stories featuring muslims usually spark an avalanche of stories in the german media which anchor a negative image of their culture in the public consciousness .
the recent case of an alleged honor killing in berlin involving a young turkish woman was such an example . despite balanced reporting by individual journalists on topics such as honor killings or forced marriages , readers are often left with the impression that the entire muslim community is abusive toward women . provocative headlines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spiegel cover on conspiracy theories surrounding the 9-11 terror attacks .

the media in germany is often accused , not least by muslims in the country , of being one-sided and clichéd when it comes to reporting on them .
journalists deny it , saying discernment and responsibility are important . not only muslims living in germany , but also cultural experts routinely criticize the german media for reinforcing stereotypes and being too subjective in its reporting of muslim topics . a look at the german media certainly lends some credence to the allegations .
for instance , the newsmagazine focus ran a headline on its cover recently which referred to " unsettling guests . " the story was about muslims of turkish origin living in germany - people who , in reality , have been living in germany for decades and have long ceased being " guests . "
nonetheless , the word " unsettling " presented them collectively as a threat to german society . the facts , no matter how unpleasant however , representatives of the german media have defended themselves against the allegations , insisting that they ca n't be applied across the board to all publications .
jörg lau , a reporter at the respected intellectual weekly die zeit , also found focus ' choice of words " scandalous , " but he insisted that the media could n't just ignore real problems in the country . " it 's the media 's job to call things - which they see as wrong - by what they are , even when it 's viewed as unpleasant by others , " lau said .
" that also applies when people feel discriminated through it . " many muslims in germany feel discriminated against because news stories featuring muslims usually spark an avalanche of stories in the german media which anchor a negative image of their culture in the public consciousness .
the recent case of an alleged honor killing in berlin involving a young turkish woman was such an example . despite balanced reporting by individual journalists on topics such as honor killings or forced marriages , readers are often left with the impression that the entire muslim community is abusive toward women . provocative headlines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spiegel cover on conspiracy theories surrounding the 9-11 terror attacks .
the issue has taken on an added urgency in the aftermath of the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the us , as articles on muslims and islam appear more frequently in the media . jörg lau admitted that not every newspaper and radio or television channel was objective in its reporting , but underlined the importance of considering the source .
for instance , the headline " allah 's daughters without rights " - which ran on the cover of the esteemed newsmagazine spiegel to address the problems faced by turkish women in germany - was perfectly acceptable , said lau . that did n't keep many muslims in germany from being angered by it though . " i did n't find the headline wrong or misleading , after all , the story was about the rights of the affected women , " lau said .
" however the focus headline " unsettling guests " was demagogy - that should be criticized .
there , the german media should be careful and self-critical . " joachim kandel , an expert on islam at the friedrich ebert foundation said that baiting readers with provocative headlines or top stories was part of the german media culture and was n't just confined to islamic topics . " such sentences are provocative but other topics and other minorities are reported on with equally provocative leads , " kandel said . " but when you read the article in full then you conclude that it usually contains balanced arguments . " at the same time , kandel said that the media has to be allowed to air uncomfortable facts .
" we also have a problem with how muslims want to define their lifestyles based on the koran and the sunna -lrb- islamic practices -rrb- when it comes to human rights , democracy , pluralism .
those are serious questions that must be discussed . " responsible or not ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalist lau pointed out that the debate reflected changing realities in germany , adding that people here had ignored for too long the fact that migrants from muslim countries such as turkey would stay permanently in germany . " people are really unnerved , but not because the others are perhaps ' unsettling ' but because people are in a new situation , " lau said . " germany is a country of immigrants now . " kandel hinted at another development : the fact that , in part because of the muslim population , religion today plays a bigger role in germany than it did 10 years ago .
he said that it was good if the german media followed the development - even if they were criticized for it - because it was the only way they could enlighten readers . " i think most media consumers in germany are aware that there is a difference between the religion islam and radical islamism , " kandel said , adding that was a success for the german media . at the same time , kandel said that , compared to other european countries , germany had witnessed less of a backlash on its muslim community in the aftermath of sept .

the oil concern relented , but the standoff changed greenpeace , shell and the north sea . in the spring of 1995 , the shell oil exploration company and greenpeace were in the midst of a standoff .
shell announced it would sink the brent spar oil platform in the north sea , and greenpeace activists occupied the platform for a full two weeks in protest .
the media and politicians were drawn to the issue .
helmut kohl , germany 's chancellor at the time , came out opposed to the company 's plan .
a widespread call to boycott shell gas stations in germany overrode party lines .
winning the standoff on june 20 , 1995 , shell said it would dispose of the brent spar on land .

he sees the campaign as a great victory for environmentalists , even if it was only the first battle won in the larger war .
" the real success came three years later , when the ospar conference -lrb- a meeting of the convention for the protection of the marine environment of the north-east atlantic -rrb- passed a general ban against sinking oil platforms .
no oil platforms have been sunk in the north sea since 1995 .

since then , a whole new business has sprung up specialized in recycling oil platforms , smid noted happily .
lessons learned however , greenpeace warns , the north sea remains at risk beyond sunken oil platforms .
simply by carrying out its normal production , the oil industry removes 14,000 tons of petroleum each year from this part of the atlantic .
at the same time as the environmental group celebrates a historic victory , the event led to a widespread questioning of greenpeace 's credibility .
shortly before shell gave in , greenpeace admitted it had estimated the amount of poisonous oil residues in the platform as being much too high .
and the group 's believability - its stock in trade - took a big hit with the public , schmid said .
this led to some changes for greenpeace .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.06.2005 brent spar revisited , 10 years on großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north sea : no longer a junkyard for floating oil platforms like this one in 1995 , greenpeace stood up against shell oil , which wanted to sink an obsolete oil platform in the north sea .
the oil concern relented , but the standoff changed greenpeace , shell and the north sea . in the spring of 1995 , the shell oil exploration company and greenpeace were in the midst of a standoff .
shell announced it would sink the brent spar oil platform in the north sea , and greenpeace activists occupied the platform for a full two weeks in protest .
the media and politicians were drawn to the issue .
helmut kohl , germany 's chancellor at the time , came out opposed to the company 's plan .
a widespread call to boycott shell gas stations in germany overrode party lines .
winning the standoff on june 20 , 1995 , shell said it would dispose of the brent spar on land .
but although it took place 10 years ago , the standoff is still fresh in the minds of many who were involved .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a shell worker in an offshore oil platform in the niger delta karsten smid of greenpeace germany remembers the joy he and his colleagues felt when they realized their protests had been successful .
he sees the campaign as a great victory for environmentalists , even if it was only the first battle won in the larger war .
" the real success came three years later , when the ospar conference -lrb- a meeting of the convention for the protection of the marine environment of the north-east atlantic -rrb- passed a general ban against sinking oil platforms .
no oil platforms have been sunk in the north sea since 1995 .
today it is clear that all obsolete platforms are disposed of on land .
so actually , the big success took place in 1998 , " smid said .
since then , a whole new business has sprung up specialized in recycling oil platforms , smid noted happily .
lessons learned however , greenpeace warns , the north sea remains at risk beyond sunken oil platforms .
simply by carrying out its normal production , the oil industry removes 14,000 tons of petroleum each year from this part of the atlantic .
at the same time as the environmental group celebrates a historic victory , the event led to a widespread questioning of greenpeace 's credibility .
shortly before shell gave in , greenpeace admitted it had estimated the amount of poisonous oil residues in the platform as being much too high .
and the group 's believability - its stock in trade - took a big hit with the public , schmid said .
this led to some changes for greenpeace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a norwegian petrolium drilling platform , " troll " " after that , we formed a research department , to test whether the information that we publicized was correct , " said smid .
" measurements have to be made by two independent laboratories , before the information is made public .
in that way , we very much improved our quality control . "
shell , too , learned some lessons from the brent spar debacle .
rainer winzenried , spokesman for shell in germany , said the company learned that sometimes thing that are legal are not necessarily acceptable to the public .
" since then , we have learned to bring new projects into the public sphere for discussion , so we can take public concerns into consideration during the planning phases .
we do this via so-called " shareholder forums , " said winzenried .
from the brent spar debate , the company also learned to take debates to an international level , even if its individual actions take place within one nation 's borders , winzenried said .
shell 's pr problems shortly after the brent spar debacle , shell faced another international debate : over the company 's actions in nigeria .
in november 1995 , the military regime that was then in power in the west african nation executed nine civil rights activists , including novelist ken saro-wiwa , who had denounced the environmental damage the oil industry had wrought on their homeland .
shell 's image took yet another knock .
today , winzenried said , shell has reduced the burning off of excess petrol that is part of the exploration process .
also , the company has changed its relationship to the people who live in oil-exploration regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil refinery on the niger delta " we no longer - to put it rudely - just give communities money in the hope they will stay quiet and leave us alone .
we work with non-governmental agencies to create put lasting development programs into effect . "
greenpeace and nigerian environmental and civil rights groups counter that even 10 years later , little has changed in the niger delta .
what shell hopes to sell as its new policy is above all cosmetic , greenpeace 's smid said .
next stop : russia ?
the company abuses nature not only in africa , but elsewhere as well , said smid .
greenpeace and shell 's latest battle is over an oil exploration project near sachalin island , off the russian coast in the northern pacific .
shell is endangering the feeding grounds of a rare species of grey whale , smid said .
for its part , shell points to its plans to carry out the project in cooperation with the world conservation union -lrb- iucn -rrb- in its defense . thomas mösch -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de energy firms seek new german sources the winter in germany has been cold and the demand for heating oil and gas has risen sharply .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.06.2005 are asylum seekers getting a fair shot ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum seekers fear it : the official german stamp meaning ' expelled ' fewer and fewer refugees are being granted asylum in germany .
human rights groups say this reflects unfair immigration practices rather than improved international conditions . if the official number of refugees in germany was an indication of the state of world conflict , earth would be a very peaceful place indeed .
while germany had 11,000 official asylum seekers in 1998 , in 2004 there were just 2000 .
but a glance at the newspapers shows this is not the case .
crises continue to rage in sudan and iraq ; closer to germany , the political persecution of kurds in turkey and the ongoing conflict in chechnya give hundreds of thousands of people a reason flee their homelands .
' extreme mistrust ' yet just 1.5 percent of the 35,000 people who applied for asylum in germany got it , according to the federal office for migration and refugees .
" there is extreme mistrust and tendency toward refusal on the part of immigration officials , " said bernd mesovic of pro asyl , a nonprofit human rights organization for refugees .
germany is shifting the responsibility for refugees onto other countries , and as a last resort , to the country of origin , his group says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum seeker in germany pro asyl , amnesty international , an association of german magistrates and other organizations have examined how refugees are questioned during their asylum application .
" in cases of doubt , the federal migration office decides against asylum seekers , " said wolfgang grenz , a refugee expert at amnesty international .
he gave the example of a kurdish woman who sought asylum on the basis of allegedly having been tortured in her homeland .
but the application can be denied on the grounds that the torture was n't described in detail .
" in that case , " said grenz , " the official breached his duty by not asking the person to give details . "
personal interview is key the personal interview is the heart of the asylum process .
after they have fled their countries , most applicants have no hard proof of their political oppression ; torturers do n't issue " official torture certificates . "
the decision therefore is usually a subjective one , made by the interviewer who questions the refugee .
is the kurdish woman 's story is true or invented ?
in many cases , it is a difficult call to make .
barbara stolterfoht of the paritätischer wohlfahrtsverband , a leading german social welfare support group , said that officials increasingly assume asylum applicants are not telling the truth and are merely abusing the system .
this assumption can even be subconscious , she said , but either way , it is deadly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people seeking asylum in frankfurt airport .
" the social climate has developed toward being anti-asylum , even though the asylum seekers are just exercising their constitutionally chartered rights , " she said .
according to pro asyl , asylum cases are often seen less as individual situations and are instead standardized to the extent possible .
the group said it frequently sees cases where officials ask questions in order to elicit answers that fit neatly into prearranged categories , rather than dealing with each individual .
" you can be happy when a report caries five or six sentences having to do with the person 's particular situation , " said pro asyl 's mesovic .
fair hearings ?
mesovic also said the person 's country of origin has enormous influence on the outcome of a hearing .
" if officials believe that people are n't tortured in a given country , then that often has more weight than the statement of the refugee who says he or she was tortured , " mesovic said .
the federal migration office denies that is the case .
" the hearings are fair and each applicant has the chance to make detailed statements , and to correct and amplify the statements , " said a spokesperson .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugees in darfur but pro asyl and amnesty say otherwise .
in their experience , the groups have said , applicants are n't informed of contradictions in their statements , and therefore forego their legal right to change their statements .
pro asyl compared notes taken during hearings that resulted in asylum denials and found that many people were turned down when contradictions in their stories made their reasons for seeking asylum less credible .
yet in the transcripts of the hearings , there was no mention of the contradictions .
political decisionmaking ?
thus the asylum seekers did n't know which part of the hearing was important in deciding their case .
pro asyl 's mesovic attributed the practice to a political move .

human rights groups say this reflects unfair immigration practices rather than improved international conditions . if the official number of refugees in germany was an indication of the state of world conflict , earth would be a very peaceful place indeed .
while germany had 11,000 official asylum seekers in 1998 , in 2004 there were just 2000 .
but a glance at the newspapers shows this is not the case .
crises continue to rage in sudan and iraq ; closer to germany , the political persecution of kurds in turkey and the ongoing conflict in chechnya give hundreds of thousands of people a reason flee their homelands .
' extreme mistrust ' yet just 1.5 percent of the 35,000 people who applied for asylum in germany got it , according to the federal office for migration and refugees .
" there is extreme mistrust and tendency toward refusal on the part of immigration officials , " said bernd mesovic of pro asyl , a nonprofit human rights organization for refugees .
germany is shifting the responsibility for refugees onto other countries , and as a last resort , to the country of origin , his group says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum seeker in germany pro asyl , amnesty international , an association of german magistrates and other organizations have examined how refugees are questioned during their asylum application .
" in cases of doubt , the federal migration office decides against asylum seekers , " said wolfgang grenz , a refugee expert at amnesty international .
he gave the example of a kurdish woman who sought asylum on the basis of allegedly having been tortured in her homeland .
but the application can be denied on the grounds that the torture was n't described in detail .
" in that case , " said grenz , " the official breached his duty by not asking the person to give details . "
personal interview is key the personal interview is the heart of the asylum process .
after they have fled their countries , most applicants have no hard proof of their political oppression ; torturers do n't issue " official torture certificates . "
the decision therefore is usually a subjective one , made by the interviewer who questions the refugee .
is the kurdish woman 's story is true or invented ?
in many cases , it is a difficult call to make .
barbara stolterfoht of the paritätischer wohlfahrtsverband , a leading german social welfare support group , said that officials increasingly assume asylum applicants are not telling the truth and are merely abusing the system .
this assumption can even be subconscious , she said , but either way , it is deadly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people seeking asylum in frankfurt airport .
" the social climate has developed toward being anti-asylum , even though the asylum seekers are just exercising their constitutionally chartered rights , " she said .
according to pro asyl , asylum cases are often seen less as individual situations and are instead standardized to the extent possible .
the group said it frequently sees cases where officials ask questions in order to elicit answers that fit neatly into prearranged categories , rather than dealing with each individual .
" you can be happy when a report caries five or six sentences having to do with the person 's particular situation , " said pro asyl 's mesovic .
fair hearings ?
mesovic also said the person 's country of origin has enormous influence on the outcome of a hearing .
" if officials believe that people are n't tortured in a given country , then that often has more weight than the statement of the refugee who says he or she was tortured , " mesovic said .
the federal migration office denies that is the case .
" the hearings are fair and each applicant has the chance to make detailed statements , and to correct and amplify the statements , " said a spokesperson .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugees in darfur but pro asyl and amnesty say otherwise .
in their experience , the groups have said , applicants are n't informed of contradictions in their statements , and therefore forego their legal right to change their statements .
pro asyl compared notes taken during hearings that resulted in asylum denials and found that many people were turned down when contradictions in their stories made their reasons for seeking asylum less credible .
yet in the transcripts of the hearings , there was no mention of the contradictions .
political decisionmaking ?
thus the asylum seekers did n't know which part of the hearing was important in deciding their case .
pro asyl 's mesovic attributed the practice to a political move .
" the quota of asylum cases that are granted are steered politically , " he said .
" the federal migration office is doing nothing more or less than carrying out the concept of interior minister -lrb- otto -rrb- schily . "
for his part , schily has said he hopes to move the asylum process at least in part to refugee camps in north africa . manfred götzke -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu approves refugee camp pilot schemes after debating proposals put forward by germany 's otto schily , the european commission has agreed to set up pilot schemes in five north african countries to cope with the influx of refugees heading to europe .

maybe not , since men and women differ on just about everything except the need to breathe .
a new survey has found out their musical preferences during sex are positively antipodean . the survey , carried out for the german editions of glamour and gq magazines , discovered that the two sexes diverge when it comes to the soundtrack of their lovemaking .
the sonorous strings of mozart during the act and then a little champagne after the deed is done is what 30 percent of women asked would prefer . men , on the other hand , like the sonic landscape around sex to be a little harder .
just under a third , or 31 percent , said they 'd rather hear a little rap music coming out of the loudspeakers to accompany all the moaning and groaning .
after things have calmed down a little , they reported , they could dispense with the bubbly , preferring the classic post-coital cigarette instead . but a sizeable number , 11 percent of both men and women , said they 'd rather chill out during sex , listening to some bob marley and smoking a joint afterwards . men and women did come together over dishonesty about unfaithfulness .
men especially indicated that affairs were to be kept secret .
asked if they would " definitely confess to misconduct " in this area , not one said ' yes ' .
women were n't much more truthful .

now that push is coming to shove , the players will have to step up . inter milan 's star striker adriano was racing alone towards mexican keeper oswaldo sanchez and had the opportunity to put the selecao in the lead .
with only light pressure from behind and sanchez charging from the line , adriano looked for the lower right-hand corner and pushed it just outside the right post .
the shot was not exactly one for the schoolbooks .
at halftime , german television commentator and former national player günter netzer jumped all over one of the world 's best players .
" -lrb- germany 's -rrb- lukas podolski would not have missed that shot , " netzer said on german television .
and it was n't just pure jingoistic banter on his part .
just over two weeks ago podolski scored a similar goal against northern ireland - with a defender pulling on his arm and the goalkeeper much closer to him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to his supporters , lukas podolski is " prince poldi " lukas podolski , only 20 years old , has made his mark in a short time .
last june was his first appearance with the german squad but it was n't until his two-goal performance against thailand last december that he made his breakthrough .
since then , " prince poldi " has accumulated another three goals in five matches .
the fc cologne striker just bubbles over with enthusiasm for the game .
for many a young player , this excitement degenerates into arrogance and a failure to make the right decision at important points in a game .
podolski , however , acts like a seasoned veteran .
on saturday , he made the key pass that led to the foul against michael ballack in the tunisian penalty box , and in turn the go-ahead goal .
minutes later , he fed his close friend sebastian schweinsteiger the pass that put germany up 2-0 , all in his home stadium in cologne .
scoring goals naturally would have been more spectacular , but his assists put jürgen klinsmann 's side through to the semi-finals .
john aloisi top scorer after two matches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia 's john aloisi -lrb- back -rrb- has gone on a scoring rampage .
here , he launches a shot past german defender robert huth adriano and robinho from brazil .
or argentina 's juan roman riquleme .
also host country germany 's midfielder michael ballack .
these are some of the names that people had on their list as possible top scorers .
but socceroo john aloisi ?
who 's he , let alone at which club does he earn his keep ?
well , to answer the first question , aloisi has scored four goals against two the confedrations cup favorites , germany and argentina and leads the chase for the golden boot in the tournament .
for those who might make light of the fact that his 21 goals in 34 matches for the roos came against lightweights like the solomon islands or papua new guinea in the oceania confederation now have to eat their words .
the good performance could n't have come at a better time for the 29-year old striker .
that 's how the second question can be answered .
his contract with spanish side osasuna will expire at the end of the month and it wo n't be extended .
so , he 's looking for a new employer .
two premiereship sides have shown interest .
" i could picture myself playing in the bundesliga , " is what he told the sport magazine kicker .
another goal or two in the socceroos ' final match against tunisia would turn enough heads in germany to make that a possibility .
one out of three is bad mexico 's jared borgetti could have been the tragic figure on sunday night against brazil .
despite missing on two of three penalty attempts in the 30th minute , the final one saved by brazilian keeper dida , he shook off the failures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's jared borgetti , partially obscured at rear , was a head taller than the brazilians on his goal on sunday in the 59th minute , he headed in what would be the game winner for the " tri . "
in the process , mexico has turned into a nemesis for the five-time world champions brazil .
starting with the confed cup final in 1999 , which mexico won over the selecao 4-3 , mexico have beaten the brazilian five times , losing only once and drawing once .
this victory has put mexico in the semi-finals while tournament favorite brazil must at least achieve a tie against japan to secure the second group b semi-final spot . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no masterpiece from brazil 's soccer artists mexico provide the first big surprise in the confederations cup by knocking off world champs brazil , 1-0 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.06.2005 are asylum seekers getting a fair shot ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum seekers fear it : the official german stamp meaning ' expelled ' fewer and fewer refugees are being granted asylum in germany .
human rights groups say this reflects unfair immigration practices rather than improved international conditions . if the official number of refugees in germany was an indication of the state of world conflict , earth would be a very peaceful place indeed .
while germany had 11,000 official asylum seekers in 1998 , in 2004 there were just 2000 .
but a glance at the newspapers shows this is not the case .
crises continue to rage in sudan and iraq ; closer to germany , the political persecution of kurds in turkey and the ongoing conflict in chechnya give hundreds of thousands of people a reason flee their homelands .
' extreme mistrust ' yet just 1.5 percent of the 35,000 people who applied for asylum in germany got it , according to the federal office for migration and refugees .
" there is extreme mistrust and tendency toward refusal on the part of immigration officials , " said bernd mesovic of pro asyl , a nonprofit human rights organization for refugees .
germany is shifting the responsibility for refugees onto other countries , and as a last resort , to the country of origin , his group says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum seeker in germany pro asyl , amnesty international , an association of german magistrates and other organizations have examined how refugees are questioned during their asylum application .
" in cases of doubt , the federal migration office decides against asylum seekers , " said wolfgang grenz , a refugee expert at amnesty international .
he gave the example of a kurdish woman who sought asylum on the basis of allegedly having been tortured in her homeland .
but the application can be denied on the grounds that the torture was n't described in detail .
" in that case , " said grenz , " the official breached his duty by not asking the person to give details . "
personal interview is key the personal interview is the heart of the asylum process .
after they have fled their countries , most applicants have no hard proof of their political oppression ; torturers do n't issue " official torture certificates . "
the decision therefore is usually a subjective one , made by the interviewer who questions the refugee .
is the kurdish woman 's story is true or invented ?
in many cases , it is a difficult call to make .
barbara stolterfoht of the paritätischer wohlfahrtsverband , a leading german social welfare support group , said that officials increasingly assume asylum applicants are not telling the truth and are merely abusing the system .
this assumption can even be subconscious , she said , but either way , it is deadly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people seeking asylum in frankfurt airport .
" the social climate has developed toward being anti-asylum , even though the asylum seekers are just exercising their constitutionally chartered rights , " she said .
according to pro asyl , asylum cases are often seen less as individual situations and are instead standardized to the extent possible .
the group said it frequently sees cases where officials ask questions in order to elicit answers that fit neatly into prearranged categories , rather than dealing with each individual .
" you can be happy when a report caries five or six sentences having to do with the person 's particular situation , " said pro asyl 's mesovic .
fair hearings ?
mesovic also said the person 's country of origin has enormous influence on the outcome of a hearing .
" if officials believe that people are n't tortured in a given country , then that often has more weight than the statement of the refugee who says he or she was tortured , " mesovic said .
the federal migration office denies that is the case .
" the hearings are fair and each applicant has the chance to make detailed statements , and to correct and amplify the statements , " said a spokesperson .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugees in darfur but pro asyl and amnesty say otherwise .
in their experience , the groups have said , applicants are n't informed of contradictions in their statements , and therefore forego their legal right to change their statements .
pro asyl compared notes taken during hearings that resulted in asylum denials and found that many people were turned down when contradictions in their stories made their reasons for seeking asylum less credible .
yet in the transcripts of the hearings , there was no mention of the contradictions .
political decisionmaking ?

human rights groups say this reflects unfair immigration practices rather than improved international conditions . if the official number of refugees in germany was an indication of the state of world conflict , earth would be a very peaceful place indeed .
while germany had 11,000 official asylum seekers in 1998 , in 2004 there were just 2000 .
but a glance at the newspapers shows this is not the case .
crises continue to rage in sudan and iraq ; closer to germany , the political persecution of kurds in turkey and the ongoing conflict in chechnya give hundreds of thousands of people a reason flee their homelands .
' extreme mistrust ' yet just 1.5 percent of the 35,000 people who applied for asylum in germany got it , according to the federal office for migration and refugees .
" there is extreme mistrust and tendency toward refusal on the part of immigration officials , " said bernd mesovic of pro asyl , a nonprofit human rights organization for refugees .
germany is shifting the responsibility for refugees onto other countries , and as a last resort , to the country of origin , his group says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum seeker in germany pro asyl , amnesty international , an association of german magistrates and other organizations have examined how refugees are questioned during their asylum application .
" in cases of doubt , the federal migration office decides against asylum seekers , " said wolfgang grenz , a refugee expert at amnesty international .
he gave the example of a kurdish woman who sought asylum on the basis of allegedly having been tortured in her homeland .
but the application can be denied on the grounds that the torture was n't described in detail .
" in that case , " said grenz , " the official breached his duty by not asking the person to give details . "
personal interview is key the personal interview is the heart of the asylum process .
after they have fled their countries , most applicants have no hard proof of their political oppression ; torturers do n't issue " official torture certificates . "
the decision therefore is usually a subjective one , made by the interviewer who questions the refugee .
is the kurdish woman 's story is true or invented ?
in many cases , it is a difficult call to make .
barbara stolterfoht of the paritätischer wohlfahrtsverband , a leading german social welfare support group , said that officials increasingly assume asylum applicants are not telling the truth and are merely abusing the system .
this assumption can even be subconscious , she said , but either way , it is deadly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people seeking asylum in frankfurt airport .
" the social climate has developed toward being anti-asylum , even though the asylum seekers are just exercising their constitutionally chartered rights , " she said .
according to pro asyl , asylum cases are often seen less as individual situations and are instead standardized to the extent possible .
the group said it frequently sees cases where officials ask questions in order to elicit answers that fit neatly into prearranged categories , rather than dealing with each individual .
" you can be happy when a report caries five or six sentences having to do with the person 's particular situation , " said pro asyl 's mesovic .
fair hearings ?
mesovic also said the person 's country of origin has enormous influence on the outcome of a hearing .
" if officials believe that people are n't tortured in a given country , then that often has more weight than the statement of the refugee who says he or she was tortured , " mesovic said .
the federal migration office denies that is the case .
" the hearings are fair and each applicant has the chance to make detailed statements , and to correct and amplify the statements , " said a spokesperson .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugees in darfur but pro asyl and amnesty say otherwise .
in their experience , the groups have said , applicants are n't informed of contradictions in their statements , and therefore forego their legal right to change their statements .
pro asyl compared notes taken during hearings that resulted in asylum denials and found that many people were turned down when contradictions in their stories made their reasons for seeking asylum less credible .
yet in the transcripts of the hearings , there was no mention of the contradictions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.06.2005 warmer ties to mark eu-us summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not exactly of one mind , but coming closer eu leaders travel to washington on monday for a one-day summit with the united states hosted by president george w. bush .
after years of cool relations , this meeting comes as trans-atlantic ties are warming up . eu leaders , including the president of the european commission , jose manual barroso , and the president of the european council , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , will meet with george w. bush on monday to discuss a variety of issues , including economic growth and integration , the environment and energy issues . the trip to washington for the eu heads might well be a welcome diversion from all the problems they face in brussels , including the recent rejection by french and dutch voters of the eu constitution and the wrangling over the next eu budget .
the same could not have been said for the last eu-us summit in june 2004 , when divisions over the iraq war were still fresh in leaders ' minds as were differences over us policy toward over iran and its nuclear program . but since that time , relations across the atlantic have improved considerably . " the backdrop of this summit is much more positive than the previous one , " gunnar wiegand , the european commission 's top official dealing with the us , said in an interview .
" we have had our occasional differences but now we work together much better . " partners the motto of monday 's summit will be " working together as global partners " and will be attended by bush , barroso , juncker , eu trade commissioner peter mandelson , us secretary of state condoleezza rice and eu foreign policy chief javier solana , among others . there is a lot to talk about and much common ground , particularly on the economic level .
the eu and the us share the largest trade and investment relationship in the world .
in 2003 , some $ 750 billion -lrb- 610 billion euros -rrb- in goods and services flowed across the big pond and foreign direct investment levels reached $ 1.75 trillion in the same year . topics of discussion will also include the promotion of democracy , un reform , development and humanitarian assistance and security issues , such as counterterrorism , and transport and border security . strong differences still there bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guantanamo bay naval base in guantanamo , cuba but monday 's meeting is n't likely to be purely a love fest .
there are still big differences of opinion in many areas , such as the kyoto treaty on climate change , the international criminal court , guantanamo bay -lrb- photo -rrb- and the eu 's decision to lift its arms embargo against china . the row over subsidies for plane manufactures airbus and boeing is also a sore subject .
although even here , there 's more talk of cooperation than conflict .
both sides announced on friday that thay will hold new talks in a bid to end the subsidies battle . " talks will continue .
my doors are open , " us trade representative rob portman said after a meeting with his eu counterpart , peter mandelson . but stephanie henning , a fellow at the brussels office of the german marshall fund of the united states , admitted that while eu-us relations have improved the bush administration has not undergone a 180-degree turn regarding europe . " bush may have learned some lessons from iraq , but ultimately he will continue to make decisions according to america 's best interests , " she told upi . however , she added that both sides needed a successful summit after bush 's charm offensive in europe during a visit to brussels in february and europe 's recent turmoil over the constitution . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us , eu on collision course over china two senior members of the united states congress warned the european union this week that the lifting of the 15-year arms embargo on china could result in a halt of us sales in military technology to the eu .

after years of cool relations , this meeting comes as trans-atlantic ties are warming up . eu leaders , including the president of the european commission , jose manual barroso , and the president of the european council , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , will meet with george w. bush on monday to discuss a variety of issues , including economic growth and integration , the environment and energy issues . the trip to washington for the eu heads might well be a welcome diversion from all the problems they face in brussels , including the recent rejection by french and dutch voters of the eu constitution and the wrangling over the next eu budget .
the same could not have been said for the last eu-us summit in june 2004 , when divisions over the iraq war were still fresh in leaders ' minds as were differences over us policy toward over iran and its nuclear program . but since that time , relations across the atlantic have improved considerably . " the backdrop of this summit is much more positive than the previous one , " gunnar wiegand , the european commission 's top official dealing with the us , said in an interview .
" we have had our occasional differences but now we work together much better . " partners the motto of monday 's summit will be " working together as global partners " and will be attended by bush , barroso , juncker , eu trade commissioner peter mandelson , us secretary of state condoleezza rice and eu foreign policy chief javier solana , among others . there is a lot to talk about and much common ground , particularly on the economic level .
the eu and the us share the largest trade and investment relationship in the world .
in 2003 , some $ 750 billion -lrb- 610 billion euros -rrb- in goods and services flowed across the big pond and foreign direct investment levels reached $ 1.75 trillion in the same year . topics of discussion will also include the promotion of democracy , un reform , development and humanitarian assistance and security issues , such as counterterrorism , and transport and border security . strong differences still there bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guantanamo bay naval base in guantanamo , cuba but monday 's meeting is n't likely to be purely a love fest .
there are still big differences of opinion in many areas , such as the kyoto treaty on climate change , the international criminal court , guantanamo bay -lrb- photo -rrb- and the eu 's decision to lift its arms embargo against china . the row over subsidies for plane manufactures airbus and boeing is also a sore subject .
although even here , there 's more talk of cooperation than conflict .
both sides announced on friday that thay will hold new talks in a bid to end the subsidies battle . " talks will continue .
my doors are open , " us trade representative rob portman said after a meeting with his eu counterpart , peter mandelson . but stephanie henning , a fellow at the brussels office of the german marshall fund of the united states , admitted that while eu-us relations have improved the bush administration has not undergone a 180-degree turn regarding europe . " bush may have learned some lessons from iraq , but ultimately he will continue to make decisions according to america 's best interests , " she told upi . however , she added that both sides needed a successful summit after bush 's charm offensive in europe during a visit to brussels in february and europe 's recent turmoil over the constitution . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us , eu on collision course over china two senior members of the united states congress warned the european union this week that the lifting of the 15-year arms embargo on china could result in a halt of us sales in military technology to the eu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 20.06.2005 pleasant player surprises so far großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukas podolski -lrb- 20 -rrb- is one of germany 's rising stars each team in the confederations cup has only played twice , but experts and fans are already talking about which players have shined in the tournament .
now that push is coming to shove , the players will have to step up . inter milan 's star striker adriano was racing alone towards mexican keeper oswaldo sanchez and had the opportunity to put the selecao in the lead .
with only light pressure from behind and sanchez charging from the line , adriano looked for the lower right-hand corner and pushed it just outside the right post .
the shot was not exactly one for the schoolbooks .
at halftime , german television commentator and former national player günter netzer jumped all over one of the world 's best players .
" -lrb- germany 's -rrb- lukas podolski would not have missed that shot , " netzer said on german television .
and it was n't just pure jingoistic banter on his part .
just over two weeks ago podolski scored a similar goal against northern ireland - with a defender pulling on his arm and the goalkeeper much closer to him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to his supporters , lukas podolski is " prince poldi " lukas podolski , only 20 years old , has made his mark in a short time .
last june was his first appearance with the german squad but it was n't until his two-goal performance against thailand last december that he made his breakthrough .
since then , " prince poldi " has accumulated another three goals in five matches .
the fc cologne striker just bubbles over with enthusiasm for the game .
for many a young player , this excitement degenerates into arrogance and a failure to make the right decision at important points in a game .
podolski , however , acts like a seasoned veteran .
on saturday , he made the key pass that led to the foul against michael ballack in the tunisian penalty box , and in turn the go-ahead goal .
minutes later , he fed his close friend sebastian schweinsteiger the pass that put germany up 2-0 , all in his home stadium in cologne .
scoring goals naturally would have been more spectacular , but his assists put jürgen klinsmann 's side through to the semi-finals .
john aloisi top scorer after two matches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia 's john aloisi -lrb- back -rrb- has gone on a scoring rampage .
here , he launches a shot past german defender robert huth adriano and robinho from brazil .
or argentina 's juan roman riquleme .
also host country germany 's midfielder michael ballack .
these are some of the names that people had on their list as possible top scorers .
but socceroo john aloisi ?
who 's he , let alone at which club does he earn his keep ?
well , to answer the first question , aloisi has scored four goals against two the confedrations cup favorites , germany and argentina and leads the chase for the golden boot in the tournament .
for those who might make light of the fact that his 21 goals in 34 matches for the roos came against lightweights like the solomon islands or papua new guinea in the oceania confederation now have to eat their words .
the good performance could n't have come at a better time for the 29-year old striker .
that 's how the second question can be answered .
his contract with spanish side osasuna will expire at the end of the month and it wo n't be extended .
so , he 's looking for a new employer .
two premiereship sides have shown interest .
" i could picture myself playing in the bundesliga , " is what he told the sport magazine kicker .
another goal or two in the socceroos ' final match against tunisia would turn enough heads in germany to make that a possibility .
one out of three is bad mexico 's jared borgetti could have been the tragic figure on sunday night against brazil .
despite missing on two of three penalty attempts in the 30th minute , the final one saved by brazilian keeper dida , he shook off the failures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's jared borgetti , partially obscured at rear , was a head taller than the brazilians on his goal on sunday in the 59th minute , he headed in what would be the game winner for the " tri . "
in the process , mexico has turned into a nemesis for the five-time world champions brazil .
starting with the confed cup final in 1999 , which mexico won over the selecao 4-3 , mexico have beaten the brazilian five times , losing only once and drawing once .
this victory has put mexico in the semi-finals while tournament favorite brazil must at least achieve a tie against japan to secure the second group b semi-final spot . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no masterpiece from brazil 's soccer artists mexico provide the first big surprise in the confederations cup by knocking off world champs brazil , 1-0 .

now that push is coming to shove , the players will have to step up . inter milan 's star striker adriano was racing alone towards mexican keeper oswaldo sanchez and had the opportunity to put the selecao in the lead .
with only light pressure from behind and sanchez charging from the line , adriano looked for the lower right-hand corner and pushed it just outside the right post .
the shot was not exactly one for the schoolbooks .
at halftime , german television commentator and former national player günter netzer jumped all over one of the world 's best players .
" -lrb- germany 's -rrb- lukas podolski would not have missed that shot , " netzer said on german television .
and it was n't just pure jingoistic banter on his part .
just over two weeks ago podolski scored a similar goal against northern ireland - with a defender pulling on his arm and the goalkeeper much closer to him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to his supporters , lukas podolski is " prince poldi " lukas podolski , only 20 years old , has made his mark in a short time .
last june was his first appearance with the german squad but it was n't until his two-goal performance against thailand last december that he made his breakthrough .
since then , " prince poldi " has accumulated another three goals in five matches .
the fc cologne striker just bubbles over with enthusiasm for the game .
for many a young player , this excitement degenerates into arrogance and a failure to make the right decision at important points in a game .
podolski , however , acts like a seasoned veteran .
on saturday , he made the key pass that led to the foul against michael ballack in the tunisian penalty box , and in turn the go-ahead goal .
minutes later , he fed his close friend sebastian schweinsteiger the pass that put germany up 2-0 , all in his home stadium in cologne .
scoring goals naturally would have been more spectacular , but his assists put jürgen klinsmann 's side through to the semi-finals .

also host country germany 's midfielder michael ballack .
these are some of the names that people had on their list as possible top scorers .
but socceroo john aloisi ?
who 's he , let alone at which club does he earn his keep ?
well , to answer the first question , aloisi has scored four goals against two the confedrations cup favorites , germany and argentina and leads the chase for the golden boot in the tournament .
for those who might make light of the fact that his 21 goals in 34 matches for the roos came against lightweights like the solomon islands or papua new guinea in the oceania confederation now have to eat their words .
the good performance could n't have come at a better time for the 29-year old striker .
that 's how the second question can be answered .
his contract with spanish side osasuna will expire at the end of the month and it wo n't be extended .
so , he 's looking for a new employer .
two premiereship sides have shown interest .
" i could picture myself playing in the bundesliga , " is what he told the sport magazine kicker .
another goal or two in the socceroos ' final match against tunisia would turn enough heads in germany to make that a possibility .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.06.2005 brent spar revisited , 10 years on großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north sea : no longer a junkyard for floating oil platforms like this one in 1995 , greenpeace stood up against shell oil , which wanted to sink an obsolete oil platform in the north sea .
the oil concern relented , but the standoff changed greenpeace , shell and the north sea . in the spring of 1995 , the shell oil exploration company and greenpeace were in the midst of a standoff .
shell announced it would sink the brent spar oil platform in the north sea , and greenpeace activists occupied the platform for a full two weeks in protest .
the media and politicians were drawn to the issue .
helmut kohl , germany 's chancellor at the time , came out opposed to the company 's plan .
a widespread call to boycott shell gas stations in germany overrode party lines .
winning the standoff on june 20 , 1995 , shell said it would dispose of the brent spar on land .
but although it took place 10 years ago , the standoff is still fresh in the minds of many who were involved .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a shell worker in an offshore oil platform in the niger delta karsten smid of greenpeace germany remembers the joy he and his colleagues felt when they realized their protests had been successful .
he sees the campaign as a great victory for environmentalists , even if it was only the first battle won in the larger war .
" the real success came three years later , when the ospar conference -lrb- a meeting of the convention for the protection of the marine environment of the north-east atlantic -rrb- passed a general ban against sinking oil platforms .
no oil platforms have been sunk in the north sea since 1995 .
today it is clear that all obsolete platforms are disposed of on land .
so actually , the big success took place in 1998 , " smid said .
since then , a whole new business has sprung up specialized in recycling oil platforms , smid noted happily .
lessons learned however , greenpeace warns , the north sea remains at risk beyond sunken oil platforms .
simply by carrying out its normal production , the oil industry removes 14,000 tons of petroleum each year from this part of the atlantic .
at the same time as the environmental group celebrates a historic victory , the event led to a widespread questioning of greenpeace 's credibility .
shortly before shell gave in , greenpeace admitted it had estimated the amount of poisonous oil residues in the platform as being much too high .
and the group 's believability - its stock in trade - took a big hit with the public , schmid said .
this led to some changes for greenpeace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a norwegian petrolium drilling platform , " troll " " after that , we formed a research department , to test whether the information that we publicized was correct , " said smid .
" measurements have to be made by two independent laboratories , before the information is made public .
in that way , we very much improved our quality control . "
shell , too , learned some lessons from the brent spar debacle .
rainer winzenried , spokesman for shell in germany , said the company learned that sometimes thing that are legal are not necessarily acceptable to the public .
" since then , we have learned to bring new projects into the public sphere for discussion , so we can take public concerns into consideration during the planning phases .
we do this via so-called " shareholder forums , " said winzenried .
from the brent spar debate , the company also learned to take debates to an international level , even if its individual actions take place within one nation 's borders , winzenried said .
shell 's pr problems shortly after the brent spar debacle , shell faced another international debate : over the company 's actions in nigeria .
in november 1995 , the military regime that was then in power in the west african nation executed nine civil rights activists , including novelist ken saro-wiwa , who had denounced the environmental damage the oil industry had wrought on their homeland .
shell 's image took yet another knock .
today , winzenried said , shell has reduced the burning off of excess petrol that is part of the exploration process .
also , the company has changed its relationship to the people who live in oil-exploration regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil refinery on the niger delta " we no longer - to put it rudely - just give communities money in the hope they will stay quiet and leave us alone .

the oil concern relented , but the standoff changed greenpeace , shell and the north sea . in the spring of 1995 , the shell oil exploration company and greenpeace were in the midst of a standoff .
shell announced it would sink the brent spar oil platform in the north sea , and greenpeace activists occupied the platform for a full two weeks in protest .
the media and politicians were drawn to the issue .
helmut kohl , germany 's chancellor at the time , came out opposed to the company 's plan .
a widespread call to boycott shell gas stations in germany overrode party lines .
winning the standoff on june 20 , 1995 , shell said it would dispose of the brent spar on land .
but although it took place 10 years ago , the standoff is still fresh in the minds of many who were involved .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a shell worker in an offshore oil platform in the niger delta karsten smid of greenpeace germany remembers the joy he and his colleagues felt when they realized their protests had been successful .
he sees the campaign as a great victory for environmentalists , even if it was only the first battle won in the larger war .
" the real success came three years later , when the ospar conference -lrb- a meeting of the convention for the protection of the marine environment of the north-east atlantic -rrb- passed a general ban against sinking oil platforms .
no oil platforms have been sunk in the north sea since 1995 .
today it is clear that all obsolete platforms are disposed of on land .
so actually , the big success took place in 1998 , " smid said .
since then , a whole new business has sprung up specialized in recycling oil platforms , smid noted happily .
lessons learned however , greenpeace warns , the north sea remains at risk beyond sunken oil platforms .
simply by carrying out its normal production , the oil industry removes 14,000 tons of petroleum each year from this part of the atlantic .
at the same time as the environmental group celebrates a historic victory , the event led to a widespread questioning of greenpeace 's credibility .
shortly before shell gave in , greenpeace admitted it had estimated the amount of poisonous oil residues in the platform as being much too high .
and the group 's believability - its stock in trade - took a big hit with the public , schmid said .
this led to some changes for greenpeace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a norwegian petrolium drilling platform , " troll " " after that , we formed a research department , to test whether the information that we publicized was correct , " said smid .
" measurements have to be made by two independent laboratories , before the information is made public .
in that way , we very much improved our quality control . "
shell , too , learned some lessons from the brent spar debacle .
rainer winzenried , spokesman for shell in germany , said the company learned that sometimes thing that are legal are not necessarily acceptable to the public .
" since then , we have learned to bring new projects into the public sphere for discussion , so we can take public concerns into consideration during the planning phases .
we do this via so-called " shareholder forums , " said winzenried .
from the brent spar debate , the company also learned to take debates to an international level , even if its individual actions take place within one nation 's borders , winzenried said .
shell 's pr problems shortly after the brent spar debacle , shell faced another international debate : over the company 's actions in nigeria .
in november 1995 , the military regime that was then in power in the west african nation executed nine civil rights activists , including novelist ken saro-wiwa , who had denounced the environmental damage the oil industry had wrought on their homeland .
shell 's image took yet another knock .
today , winzenried said , shell has reduced the burning off of excess petrol that is part of the exploration process .
also , the company has changed its relationship to the people who live in oil-exploration regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil refinery on the niger delta " we no longer - to put it rudely - just give communities money in the hope they will stay quiet and leave us alone .
we work with non-governmental agencies to create put lasting development programs into effect . "

the media in germany is often accused , not least by muslims in the country , of being one-sided and clichéd when it comes to reporting on them .
journalists deny it , saying discernment and responsibility are important . not only muslims living in germany , but also cultural experts routinely criticize the german media for reinforcing stereotypes and being too subjective in its reporting of muslim topics . a look at the german media certainly lends some credence to the allegations .
for instance , the newsmagazine focus ran a headline on its cover recently which referred to " unsettling guests . " the story was about muslims of turkish origin living in germany - people who , in reality , have been living in germany for decades and have long ceased being " guests . "
nonetheless , the word " unsettling " presented them collectively as a threat to german society . the facts , no matter how unpleasant however , representatives of the german media have defended themselves against the allegations , insisting that they ca n't be applied across the board to all publications .
jörg lau , a reporter at the respected intellectual weekly die zeit , also found focus ' choice of words " scandalous , " but he insisted that the media could n't just ignore real problems in the country . " it 's the media 's job to call things - which they see as wrong - by what they are , even when it 's viewed as unpleasant by others , " lau said .
" that also applies when people feel discriminated through it . " many muslims in germany feel discriminated against because news stories featuring muslims usually spark an avalanche of stories in the german media which anchor a negative image of their culture in the public consciousness .
the recent case of an alleged honor killing in berlin involving a young turkish woman was such an example . despite balanced reporting by individual journalists on topics such as honor killings or forced marriages , readers are often left with the impression that the entire muslim community is abusive toward women . provocative headlines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spiegel cover on conspiracy theories surrounding the 9-11 terror attacks .
the issue has taken on an added urgency in the aftermath of the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the us , as articles on muslims and islam appear more frequently in the media . jörg lau admitted that not every newspaper and radio or television channel was objective in its reporting , but underlined the importance of considering the source .
for instance , the headline " allah 's daughters without rights " - which ran on the cover of the esteemed newsmagazine spiegel to address the problems faced by turkish women in germany - was perfectly acceptable , said lau . that did n't keep many muslims in germany from being angered by it though . " i did n't find the headline wrong or misleading , after all , the story was about the rights of the affected women , " lau said .
" however the focus headline " unsettling guests " was demagogy - that should be criticized .
there , the german media should be careful and self-critical . " joachim kandel , an expert on islam at the friedrich ebert foundation said that baiting readers with provocative headlines or top stories was part of the german media culture and was n't just confined to islamic topics . " such sentences are provocative but other topics and other minorities are reported on with equally provocative leads , " kandel said . " but when you read the article in full then you conclude that it usually contains balanced arguments . " at the same time , kandel said that the media has to be allowed to air uncomfortable facts .
" we also have a problem with how muslims want to define their lifestyles based on the koran and the sunna -lrb- islamic practices -rrb- when it comes to human rights , democracy , pluralism .
those are serious questions that must be discussed . " responsible or not ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalist lau pointed out that the debate reflected changing realities in germany , adding that people here had ignored for too long the fact that migrants from muslim countries such as turkey would stay permanently in germany . " people are really unnerved , but not because the others are perhaps ' unsettling ' but because people are in a new situation , " lau said . " germany is a country of immigrants now . " kandel hinted at another development : the fact that , in part because of the muslim population , religion today plays a bigger role in germany than it did 10 years ago .
he said that it was good if the german media followed the development - even if they were criticized for it - because it was the only way they could enlighten readers . " i think most media consumers in germany are aware that there is a difference between the religion islam and radical islamism , " kandel said , adding that was a success for the german media . at the same time , kandel said that , compared to other european countries , germany had witnessed less of a backlash on its muslim community in the aftermath of sept .

the media in germany is often accused , not least by muslims in the country , of being one-sided and clichéd when it comes to reporting on them .
journalists deny it , saying discernment and responsibility are important . not only muslims living in germany , but also cultural experts routinely criticize the german media for reinforcing stereotypes and being too subjective in its reporting of muslim topics . a look at the german media certainly lends some credence to the allegations .
for instance , the newsmagazine focus ran a headline on its cover recently which referred to " unsettling guests . " the story was about muslims of turkish origin living in germany - people who , in reality , have been living in germany for decades and have long ceased being " guests . "
nonetheless , the word " unsettling " presented them collectively as a threat to german society . the facts , no matter how unpleasant however , representatives of the german media have defended themselves against the allegations , insisting that they ca n't be applied across the board to all publications .
jörg lau , a reporter at the respected intellectual weekly die zeit , also found focus ' choice of words " scandalous , " but he insisted that the media could n't just ignore real problems in the country . " it 's the media 's job to call things - which they see as wrong - by what they are , even when it 's viewed as unpleasant by others , " lau said .
" that also applies when people feel discriminated through it . " many muslims in germany feel discriminated against because news stories featuring muslims usually spark an avalanche of stories in the german media which anchor a negative image of their culture in the public consciousness .
the recent case of an alleged honor killing in berlin involving a young turkish woman was such an example . despite balanced reporting by individual journalists on topics such as honor killings or forced marriages , readers are often left with the impression that the entire muslim community is abusive toward women . provocative headlines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spiegel cover on conspiracy theories surrounding the 9-11 terror attacks .
the issue has taken on an added urgency in the aftermath of the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the us , as articles on muslims and islam appear more frequently in the media . jörg lau admitted that not every newspaper and radio or television channel was objective in its reporting , but underlined the importance of considering the source .
for instance , the headline " allah 's daughters without rights " - which ran on the cover of the esteemed newsmagazine spiegel to address the problems faced by turkish women in germany - was perfectly acceptable , said lau . that did n't keep many muslims in germany from being angered by it though . " i did n't find the headline wrong or misleading , after all , the story was about the rights of the affected women , " lau said .
" however the focus headline " unsettling guests " was demagogy - that should be criticized .
there , the german media should be careful and self-critical . " joachim kandel , an expert on islam at the friedrich ebert foundation said that baiting readers with provocative headlines or top stories was part of the german media culture and was n't just confined to islamic topics . " such sentences are provocative but other topics and other minorities are reported on with equally provocative leads , " kandel said . " but when you read the article in full then you conclude that it usually contains balanced arguments . " at the same time , kandel said that the media has to be allowed to air uncomfortable facts .
" we also have a problem with how muslims want to define their lifestyles based on the koran and the sunna -lrb- islamic practices -rrb- when it comes to human rights , democracy , pluralism .
those are serious questions that must be discussed . " responsible or not ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalist lau pointed out that the debate reflected changing realities in germany , adding that people here had ignored for too long the fact that migrants from muslim countries such as turkey would stay permanently in germany . " people are really unnerved , but not because the others are perhaps ' unsettling ' but because people are in a new situation , " lau said . " germany is a country of immigrants now . " kandel hinted at another development : the fact that , in part because of the muslim population , religion today plays a bigger role in germany than it did 10 years ago .
he said that it was good if the german media followed the development - even if they were criticized for it - because it was the only way they could enlighten readers . " i think most media consumers in germany are aware that there is a difference between the religion islam and radical islamism , " kandel said , adding that was a success for the german media . at the same time , kandel said that , compared to other european countries , germany had witnessed less of a backlash on its muslim community in the aftermath of sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 20.06.2005 conservatives : scale back immigration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservatives say germany has n't absorbed the immigrants it has germany ’ s opposition conservatives are stirring up controversy after announcing they will seek to impose more limits on immigration if they win september ’ s general election in germany . only 7 months after a landmark new immigration law came into force in germany , the country ’ s conservatives are seeking to impose substantial curbs on the influx of foreigners . günther beckstein , interior minister from the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- in the state of bavaria , said this weekend that germany had not yet digested the wave of new immigrants who came here after the collapse of the iron curtain .
he said calls for freer access to germany were utterly wrong . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein " we have not yet come to grips with the wave of immigration in the past decade , " he said .
" we are still struggling to integrate those immigrants already here , which requires a strong political effort and a willingness by immigrants to fully embrace this country . " influx from former ussr in the past 15 years , germany has seen a dramatic influx of foreigners mainly from the former soviet union where ethnic germans were allowed to emigrate after the collapse of communism there . in the early 1990s , almost 200,000 russians of german origin came here each year under laws giving them german citizenship automatically .
they were people who have often found it difficult to adapt to western life and culture . the conservatives also aim to limit immigration of people from other countries who come to germany under new immigration rules .
the new laws , which were recently adopted with the support of the conservatives , allow for increased immigration to offset the demographic imbalances created by an ageing german population and dwindling birth rates . but wolfgang bosbach , a senior christian democrat , says that the quality of immigrants will take precedence over quantity under a future conservative government . " some people claim we need even more immigration to be able to stabilize our social security systems , " he said .
" such arguments overlook the fact that we need people who contribute to the system and don ’ t prove to be a drain on it as is currently the case . " antiquated arguments the suggestions about curbing immigration have drawn much criticism , especially from germany ’ s green party , which has been a champion of a more liberal immigration policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth " arguments suggesting germany doesn ’ t need any more immigration and calling on german women to have more babies is absolutely antiquated , " said claudia roth , chairwoman of the green party .
" the conservatives have retrieved an old dusted hat from the cupboard of history which unfortunately fits their anti-immigration campaign platform . " however , the anti-immigration drive is only one of a series of controversial moves planned by germany ’ s conservatives after a likely takeover of central power in berlin . bolstered by an almost 20-point lead over the ruling spd in the opinion polls , they ’ ve become bolder in their campaign , planning also a substantial overhaul of the tax system , which is expected to include reductions in income taxes and social contributions in exchange for scrapping some subsidies and hiking the value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- . uwe hessler -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a german amnesty for illegal immigrants ?
an initiative in germany wants to secure the basic rights of its around one million illegal immigrants .
but , the country still lags far behind other eu countries when it comes to dealing with the issue .

after years of cool relations , this meeting comes as trans-atlantic ties are warming up . eu leaders , including the president of the european commission , jose manual barroso , and the president of the european council , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , will meet with george w. bush on monday to discuss a variety of issues , including economic growth and integration , the environment and energy issues . the trip to washington for the eu heads might well be a welcome diversion from all the problems they face in brussels , including the recent rejection by french and dutch voters of the eu constitution and the wrangling over the next eu budget .
the same could not have been said for the last eu-us summit in june 2004 , when divisions over the iraq war were still fresh in leaders ' minds as were differences over us policy toward over iran and its nuclear program . but since that time , relations across the atlantic have improved considerably .

both sides announced on friday that thay will hold new talks in a bid to end the subsidies battle . " talks will continue .
my doors are open , " us trade representative rob portman said after a meeting with his eu counterpart , peter mandelson . but stephanie henning , a fellow at the brussels office of the german marshall fund of the united states , admitted that while eu-us relations have improved the bush administration has not undergone a 180-degree turn regarding europe . " bush may have learned some lessons from iraq , but ultimately he will continue to make decisions according to america 's best interests , " she told upi . however , she added that both sides needed a successful summit after bush 's charm offensive in europe during a visit to brussels in february and europe 's recent turmoil over the constitution . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us , eu on collision course over china two senior members of the united states congress warned the european union this week that the lifting of the 15-year arms embargo on china could result in a halt of us sales in military technology to the eu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.06.2005 german media under fire from muslims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does the german media serve up stereotypes ?
the media in germany is often accused , not least by muslims in the country , of being one-sided and clichéd when it comes to reporting on them .
journalists deny it , saying discernment and responsibility are important . not only muslims living in germany , but also cultural experts routinely criticize the german media for reinforcing stereotypes and being too subjective in its reporting of muslim topics . a look at the german media certainly lends some credence to the allegations .
for instance , the newsmagazine focus ran a headline on its cover recently which referred to " unsettling guests . " the story was about muslims of turkish origin living in germany - people who , in reality , have been living in germany for decades and have long ceased being " guests . "
nonetheless , the word " unsettling " presented them collectively as a threat to german society . the facts , no matter how unpleasant however , representatives of the german media have defended themselves against the allegations , insisting that they ca n't be applied across the board to all publications .
jörg lau , a reporter at the respected intellectual weekly die zeit , also found focus ' choice of words " scandalous , " but he insisted that the media could n't just ignore real problems in the country . " it 's the media 's job to call things - which they see as wrong - by what they are , even when it 's viewed as unpleasant by others , " lau said .
" that also applies when people feel discriminated through it . " many muslims in germany feel discriminated against because news stories featuring muslims usually spark an avalanche of stories in the german media which anchor a negative image of their culture in the public consciousness .
the recent case of an alleged honor killing in berlin involving a young turkish woman was such an example . despite balanced reporting by individual journalists on topics such as honor killings or forced marriages , readers are often left with the impression that the entire muslim community is abusive toward women . provocative headlines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spiegel cover on conspiracy theories surrounding the 9-11 terror attacks .
the issue has taken on an added urgency in the aftermath of the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the us , as articles on muslims and islam appear more frequently in the media . jörg lau admitted that not every newspaper and radio or television channel was objective in its reporting , but underlined the importance of considering the source .
for instance , the headline " allah 's daughters without rights " - which ran on the cover of the esteemed newsmagazine spiegel to address the problems faced by turkish women in germany - was perfectly acceptable , said lau . that did n't keep many muslims in germany from being angered by it though . " i did n't find the headline wrong or misleading , after all , the story was about the rights of the affected women , " lau said .
" however the focus headline " unsettling guests " was demagogy - that should be criticized .
there , the german media should be careful and self-critical . " joachim kandel , an expert on islam at the friedrich ebert foundation said that baiting readers with provocative headlines or top stories was part of the german media culture and was n't just confined to islamic topics . " such sentences are provocative but other topics and other minorities are reported on with equally provocative leads , " kandel said . " but when you read the article in full then you conclude that it usually contains balanced arguments . " at the same time , kandel said that the media has to be allowed to air uncomfortable facts .
" we also have a problem with how muslims want to define their lifestyles based on the koran and the sunna -lrb- islamic practices -rrb- when it comes to human rights , democracy , pluralism .
those are serious questions that must be discussed . " responsible or not ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalist lau pointed out that the debate reflected changing realities in germany , adding that people here had ignored for too long the fact that migrants from muslim countries such as turkey would stay permanently in germany . " people are really unnerved , but not because the others are perhaps ' unsettling ' but because people are in a new situation , " lau said . " germany is a country of immigrants now . " kandel hinted at another development : the fact that , in part because of the muslim population , religion today plays a bigger role in germany than it did 10 years ago .
he said that it was good if the german media followed the development - even if they were criticized for it - because it was the only way they could enlighten readers . " i think most media consumers in germany are aware that there is a difference between the religion islam and radical islamism , " kandel said , adding that was a success for the german media . at the same time , kandel said that , compared to other european countries , germany had witnessed less of a backlash on its muslim community in the aftermath of sept .

the media in germany is often accused , not least by muslims in the country , of being one-sided and clichéd when it comes to reporting on them .
journalists deny it , saying discernment and responsibility are important . not only muslims living in germany , but also cultural experts routinely criticize the german media for reinforcing stereotypes and being too subjective in its reporting of muslim topics . a look at the german media certainly lends some credence to the allegations .
for instance , the newsmagazine focus ran a headline on its cover recently which referred to " unsettling guests . " the story was about muslims of turkish origin living in germany - people who , in reality , have been living in germany for decades and have long ceased being " guests . "
nonetheless , the word " unsettling " presented them collectively as a threat to german society . the facts , no matter how unpleasant however , representatives of the german media have defended themselves against the allegations , insisting that they ca n't be applied across the board to all publications .
jörg lau , a reporter at the respected intellectual weekly die zeit , also found focus ' choice of words " scandalous , " but he insisted that the media could n't just ignore real problems in the country . " it 's the media 's job to call things - which they see as wrong - by what they are , even when it 's viewed as unpleasant by others , " lau said .
" that also applies when people feel discriminated through it . " many muslims in germany feel discriminated against because news stories featuring muslims usually spark an avalanche of stories in the german media which anchor a negative image of their culture in the public consciousness .
the recent case of an alleged honor killing in berlin involving a young turkish woman was such an example . despite balanced reporting by individual journalists on topics such as honor killings or forced marriages , readers are often left with the impression that the entire muslim community is abusive toward women . provocative headlines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spiegel cover on conspiracy theories surrounding the 9-11 terror attacks .
the issue has taken on an added urgency in the aftermath of the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the us , as articles on muslims and islam appear more frequently in the media . jörg lau admitted that not every newspaper and radio or television channel was objective in its reporting , but underlined the importance of considering the source .
for instance , the headline " allah 's daughters without rights " - which ran on the cover of the esteemed newsmagazine spiegel to address the problems faced by turkish women in germany - was perfectly acceptable , said lau . that did n't keep many muslims in germany from being angered by it though . " i did n't find the headline wrong or misleading , after all , the story was about the rights of the affected women , " lau said .
" however the focus headline " unsettling guests " was demagogy - that should be criticized .
there , the german media should be careful and self-critical . " joachim kandel , an expert on islam at the friedrich ebert foundation said that baiting readers with provocative headlines or top stories was part of the german media culture and was n't just confined to islamic topics . " such sentences are provocative but other topics and other minorities are reported on with equally provocative leads , " kandel said . " but when you read the article in full then you conclude that it usually contains balanced arguments . " at the same time , kandel said that the media has to be allowed to air uncomfortable facts .
" we also have a problem with how muslims want to define their lifestyles based on the koran and the sunna -lrb- islamic practices -rrb- when it comes to human rights , democracy , pluralism .
those are serious questions that must be discussed . " responsible or not ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalist lau pointed out that the debate reflected changing realities in germany , adding that people here had ignored for too long the fact that migrants from muslim countries such as turkey would stay permanently in germany . " people are really unnerved , but not because the others are perhaps ' unsettling ' but because people are in a new situation , " lau said . " germany is a country of immigrants now . " kandel hinted at another development : the fact that , in part because of the muslim population , religion today plays a bigger role in germany than it did 10 years ago .
he said that it was good if the german media followed the development - even if they were criticized for it - because it was the only way they could enlighten readers . " i think most media consumers in germany are aware that there is a difference between the religion islam and radical islamism , " kandel said , adding that was a success for the german media . at the same time , kandel said that , compared to other european countries , germany had witnessed less of a backlash on its muslim community in the aftermath of sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.06.2005 german media under fire from muslims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does the german media serve up stereotypes ?
the media in germany is often accused , not least by muslims in the country , of being one-sided and clichéd when it comes to reporting on them .
journalists deny it , saying discernment and responsibility are important . not only muslims living in germany , but also cultural experts routinely criticize the german media for reinforcing stereotypes and being too subjective in its reporting of muslim topics . a look at the german media certainly lends some credence to the allegations .
for instance , the newsmagazine focus ran a headline on its cover recently which referred to " unsettling guests . " the story was about muslims of turkish origin living in germany - people who , in reality , have been living in germany for decades and have long ceased being " guests . "
nonetheless , the word " unsettling " presented them collectively as a threat to german society . the facts , no matter how unpleasant however , representatives of the german media have defended themselves against the allegations , insisting that they ca n't be applied across the board to all publications .
jörg lau , a reporter at the respected intellectual weekly die zeit , also found focus ' choice of words " scandalous , " but he insisted that the media could n't just ignore real problems in the country . " it 's the media 's job to call things - which they see as wrong - by what they are , even when it 's viewed as unpleasant by others , " lau said .
" that also applies when people feel discriminated through it . " many muslims in germany feel discriminated against because news stories featuring muslims usually spark an avalanche of stories in the german media which anchor a negative image of their culture in the public consciousness .
the recent case of an alleged honor killing in berlin involving a young turkish woman was such an example . despite balanced reporting by individual journalists on topics such as honor killings or forced marriages , readers are often left with the impression that the entire muslim community is abusive toward women . provocative headlines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spiegel cover on conspiracy theories surrounding the 9-11 terror attacks .
the issue has taken on an added urgency in the aftermath of the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the us , as articles on muslims and islam appear more frequently in the media . jörg lau admitted that not every newspaper and radio or television channel was objective in its reporting , but underlined the importance of considering the source .
for instance , the headline " allah 's daughters without rights " - which ran on the cover of the esteemed newsmagazine spiegel to address the problems faced by turkish women in germany - was perfectly acceptable , said lau . that did n't keep many muslims in germany from being angered by it though . " i did n't find the headline wrong or misleading , after all , the story was about the rights of the affected women , " lau said .
" however the focus headline " unsettling guests " was demagogy - that should be criticized .
there , the german media should be careful and self-critical . " joachim kandel , an expert on islam at the friedrich ebert foundation said that baiting readers with provocative headlines or top stories was part of the german media culture and was n't just confined to islamic topics . " such sentences are provocative but other topics and other minorities are reported on with equally provocative leads , " kandel said . " but when you read the article in full then you conclude that it usually contains balanced arguments . " at the same time , kandel said that the media has to be allowed to air uncomfortable facts .
" we also have a problem with how muslims want to define their lifestyles based on the koran and the sunna -lrb- islamic practices -rrb- when it comes to human rights , democracy , pluralism .
those are serious questions that must be discussed . " responsible or not ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalist lau pointed out that the debate reflected changing realities in germany , adding that people here had ignored for too long the fact that migrants from muslim countries such as turkey would stay permanently in germany . " people are really unnerved , but not because the others are perhaps ' unsettling ' but because people are in a new situation , " lau said . " germany is a country of immigrants now . " kandel hinted at another development : the fact that , in part because of the muslim population , religion today plays a bigger role in germany than it did 10 years ago .
he said that it was good if the german media followed the development - even if they were criticized for it - because it was the only way they could enlighten readers . " i think most media consumers in germany are aware that there is a difference between the religion islam and radical islamism , " kandel said , adding that was a success for the german media . at the same time , kandel said that , compared to other european countries , germany had witnessed less of a backlash on its muslim community in the aftermath of sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.06.2005 are asylum seekers getting a fair shot ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum seekers fear it : the official german stamp meaning ' expelled ' fewer and fewer refugees are being granted asylum in germany .
human rights groups say this reflects unfair immigration practices rather than improved international conditions . if the official number of refugees in germany was an indication of the state of world conflict , earth would be a very peaceful place indeed .
while germany had 11,000 official asylum seekers in 1998 , in 2004 there were just 2000 .
but a glance at the newspapers shows this is not the case .
crises continue to rage in sudan and iraq ; closer to germany , the political persecution of kurds in turkey and the ongoing conflict in chechnya give hundreds of thousands of people a reason flee their homelands .
' extreme mistrust ' yet just 1.5 percent of the 35,000 people who applied for asylum in germany got it , according to the federal office for migration and refugees .
" there is extreme mistrust and tendency toward refusal on the part of immigration officials , " said bernd mesovic of pro asyl , a nonprofit human rights organization for refugees .
germany is shifting the responsibility for refugees onto other countries , and as a last resort , to the country of origin , his group says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum seeker in germany pro asyl , amnesty international , an association of german magistrates and other organizations have examined how refugees are questioned during their asylum application .
" in cases of doubt , the federal migration office decides against asylum seekers , " said wolfgang grenz , a refugee expert at amnesty international .
he gave the example of a kurdish woman who sought asylum on the basis of allegedly having been tortured in her homeland .
but the application can be denied on the grounds that the torture was n't described in detail .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.06.2005 brent spar revisited , 10 years on großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north sea : no longer a junkyard for floating oil platforms like this one in 1995 , greenpeace stood up against shell oil , which wanted to sink an obsolete oil platform in the north sea .
the oil concern relented , but the standoff changed greenpeace , shell and the north sea . in the spring of 1995 , the shell oil exploration company and greenpeace were in the midst of a standoff .
shell announced it would sink the brent spar oil platform in the north sea , and greenpeace activists occupied the platform for a full two weeks in protest .
the media and politicians were drawn to the issue .
helmut kohl , germany 's chancellor at the time , came out opposed to the company 's plan .
a widespread call to boycott shell gas stations in germany overrode party lines .
winning the standoff on june 20 , 1995 , shell said it would dispose of the brent spar on land .
but although it took place 10 years ago , the standoff is still fresh in the minds of many who were involved .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a shell worker in an offshore oil platform in the niger delta karsten smid of greenpeace germany remembers the joy he and his colleagues felt when they realized their protests had been successful .
he sees the campaign as a great victory for environmentalists , even if it was only the first battle won in the larger war .
" the real success came three years later , when the ospar conference -lrb- a meeting of the convention for the protection of the marine environment of the north-east atlantic -rrb- passed a general ban against sinking oil platforms .
no oil platforms have been sunk in the north sea since 1995 .
today it is clear that all obsolete platforms are disposed of on land .
so actually , the big success took place in 1998 , " smid said .
since then , a whole new business has sprung up specialized in recycling oil platforms , smid noted happily .
lessons learned however , greenpeace warns , the north sea remains at risk beyond sunken oil platforms .
simply by carrying out its normal production , the oil industry removes 14,000 tons of petroleum each year from this part of the atlantic .
at the same time as the environmental group celebrates a historic victory , the event led to a widespread questioning of greenpeace 's credibility .
shortly before shell gave in , greenpeace admitted it had estimated the amount of poisonous oil residues in the platform as being much too high .
and the group 's believability - its stock in trade - took a big hit with the public , schmid said .
this led to some changes for greenpeace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a norwegian petrolium drilling platform , " troll " " after that , we formed a research department , to test whether the information that we publicized was correct , " said smid .
" measurements have to be made by two independent laboratories , before the information is made public .
in that way , we very much improved our quality control . "
shell , too , learned some lessons from the brent spar debacle .
rainer winzenried , spokesman for shell in germany , said the company learned that sometimes thing that are legal are not necessarily acceptable to the public .
" since then , we have learned to bring new projects into the public sphere for discussion , so we can take public concerns into consideration during the planning phases .
we do this via so-called " shareholder forums , " said winzenried .

the oil concern relented , but the standoff changed greenpeace , shell and the north sea . in the spring of 1995 , the shell oil exploration company and greenpeace were in the midst of a standoff .
shell announced it would sink the brent spar oil platform in the north sea , and greenpeace activists occupied the platform for a full two weeks in protest .
the media and politicians were drawn to the issue .
helmut kohl , germany 's chancellor at the time , came out opposed to the company 's plan .
a widespread call to boycott shell gas stations in germany overrode party lines .
winning the standoff on june 20 , 1995 , shell said it would dispose of the brent spar on land .
but although it took place 10 years ago , the standoff is still fresh in the minds of many who were involved .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a shell worker in an offshore oil platform in the niger delta karsten smid of greenpeace germany remembers the joy he and his colleagues felt when they realized their protests had been successful .
he sees the campaign as a great victory for environmentalists , even if it was only the first battle won in the larger war .
" the real success came three years later , when the ospar conference -lrb- a meeting of the convention for the protection of the marine environment of the north-east atlantic -rrb- passed a general ban against sinking oil platforms .
no oil platforms have been sunk in the north sea since 1995 .
today it is clear that all obsolete platforms are disposed of on land .
so actually , the big success took place in 1998 , " smid said .
since then , a whole new business has sprung up specialized in recycling oil platforms , smid noted happily .
lessons learned however , greenpeace warns , the north sea remains at risk beyond sunken oil platforms .
simply by carrying out its normal production , the oil industry removes 14,000 tons of petroleum each year from this part of the atlantic .
at the same time as the environmental group celebrates a historic victory , the event led to a widespread questioning of greenpeace 's credibility .
shortly before shell gave in , greenpeace admitted it had estimated the amount of poisonous oil residues in the platform as being much too high .
and the group 's believability - its stock in trade - took a big hit with the public , schmid said .
this led to some changes for greenpeace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a norwegian petrolium drilling platform , " troll " " after that , we formed a research department , to test whether the information that we publicized was correct , " said smid .
" measurements have to be made by two independent laboratories , before the information is made public .
in that way , we very much improved our quality control . "
shell , too , learned some lessons from the brent spar debacle .
rainer winzenried , spokesman for shell in germany , said the company learned that sometimes thing that are legal are not necessarily acceptable to the public .
" since then , we have learned to bring new projects into the public sphere for discussion , so we can take public concerns into consideration during the planning phases .
we do this via so-called " shareholder forums , " said winzenried .

now that push is coming to shove , the players will have to step up . inter milan 's star striker adriano was racing alone towards mexican keeper oswaldo sanchez and had the opportunity to put the selecao in the lead .
with only light pressure from behind and sanchez charging from the line , adriano looked for the lower right-hand corner and pushed it just outside the right post .
the shot was not exactly one for the schoolbooks .
at halftime , german television commentator and former national player günter netzer jumped all over one of the world 's best players .
" -lrb- germany 's -rrb- lukas podolski would not have missed that shot , " netzer said on german television .
and it was n't just pure jingoistic banter on his part .
just over two weeks ago podolski scored a similar goal against northern ireland - with a defender pulling on his arm and the goalkeeper much closer to him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to his supporters , lukas podolski is " prince poldi " lukas podolski , only 20 years old , has made his mark in a short time .
last june was his first appearance with the german squad but it was n't until his two-goal performance against thailand last december that he made his breakthrough .
since then , " prince poldi " has accumulated another three goals in five matches .
the fc cologne striker just bubbles over with enthusiasm for the game .
for many a young player , this excitement degenerates into arrogance and a failure to make the right decision at important points in a game .
podolski , however , acts like a seasoned veteran .
on saturday , he made the key pass that led to the foul against michael ballack in the tunisian penalty box , and in turn the go-ahead goal .
minutes later , he fed his close friend sebastian schweinsteiger the pass that put germany up 2-0 , all in his home stadium in cologne .
scoring goals naturally would have been more spectacular , but his assists put jürgen klinsmann 's side through to the semi-finals .

also host country germany 's midfielder michael ballack .
these are some of the names that people had on their list as possible top scorers .
but socceroo john aloisi ?
who 's he , let alone at which club does he earn his keep ?
well , to answer the first question , aloisi has scored four goals against two the confedrations cup favorites , germany and argentina and leads the chase for the golden boot in the tournament .
for those who might make light of the fact that his 21 goals in 34 matches for the roos came against lightweights like the solomon islands or papua new guinea in the oceania confederation now have to eat their words .
the good performance could n't have come at a better time for the 29-year old striker .
that 's how the second question can be answered .
his contract with spanish side osasuna will expire at the end of the month and it wo n't be extended .
so , he 's looking for a new employer .
two premiereship sides have shown interest .
" i could picture myself playing in the bundesliga , " is what he told the sport magazine kicker .
another goal or two in the socceroos ' final match against tunisia would turn enough heads in germany to make that a possibility .
one out of three is bad mexico 's jared borgetti could have been the tragic figure on sunday night against brazil .

in the process , mexico has turned into a nemesis for the five-time world champions brazil .
starting with the confed cup final in 1999 , which mexico won over the selecao 4-3 , mexico have beaten the brazilian five times , losing only once and drawing once .

now that push is coming to shove , the players will have to step up . inter milan 's star striker adriano was racing alone towards mexican keeper oswaldo sanchez and had the opportunity to put the selecao in the lead .
with only light pressure from behind and sanchez charging from the line , adriano looked for the lower right-hand corner and pushed it just outside the right post .
the shot was not exactly one for the schoolbooks .
at halftime , german television commentator and former national player günter netzer jumped all over one of the world 's best players .
" -lrb- germany 's -rrb- lukas podolski would not have missed that shot , " netzer said on german television .
and it was n't just pure jingoistic banter on his part .
just over two weeks ago podolski scored a similar goal against northern ireland - with a defender pulling on his arm and the goalkeeper much closer to him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to his supporters , lukas podolski is " prince poldi " lukas podolski , only 20 years old , has made his mark in a short time .
last june was his first appearance with the german squad but it was n't until his two-goal performance against thailand last december that he made his breakthrough .
since then , " prince poldi " has accumulated another three goals in five matches .
the fc cologne striker just bubbles over with enthusiasm for the game .
for many a young player , this excitement degenerates into arrogance and a failure to make the right decision at important points in a game .
podolski , however , acts like a seasoned veteran .
on saturday , he made the key pass that led to the foul against michael ballack in the tunisian penalty box , and in turn the go-ahead goal .
minutes later , he fed his close friend sebastian schweinsteiger the pass that put germany up 2-0 , all in his home stadium in cologne .
scoring goals naturally would have been more spectacular , but his assists put jürgen klinsmann 's side through to the semi-finals .
john aloisi top scorer after two matches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia 's john aloisi -lrb- back -rrb- has gone on a scoring rampage .
here , he launches a shot past german defender robert huth adriano and robinho from brazil .
or argentina 's juan roman riquleme .
also host country germany 's midfielder michael ballack .
these are some of the names that people had on their list as possible top scorers .
but socceroo john aloisi ?
who 's he , let alone at which club does he earn his keep ?
well , to answer the first question , aloisi has scored four goals against two the confedrations cup favorites , germany and argentina and leads the chase for the golden boot in the tournament .
for those who might make light of the fact that his 21 goals in 34 matches for the roos came against lightweights like the solomon islands or papua new guinea in the oceania confederation now have to eat their words .
the good performance could n't have come at a better time for the 29-year old striker .
that 's how the second question can be answered .
his contract with spanish side osasuna will expire at the end of the month and it wo n't be extended .
so , he 's looking for a new employer .
two premiereship sides have shown interest .
" i could picture myself playing in the bundesliga , " is what he told the sport magazine kicker .
another goal or two in the socceroos ' final match against tunisia would turn enough heads in germany to make that a possibility .
one out of three is bad mexico 's jared borgetti could have been the tragic figure on sunday night against brazil .
despite missing on two of three penalty attempts in the 30th minute , the final one saved by brazilian keeper dida , he shook off the failures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's jared borgetti , partially obscured at rear , was a head taller than the brazilians on his goal on sunday in the 59th minute , he headed in what would be the game winner for the " tri . "
in the process , mexico has turned into a nemesis for the five-time world champions brazil .
starting with the confed cup final in 1999 , which mexico won over the selecao 4-3 , mexico have beaten the brazilian five times , losing only once and drawing once .
this victory has put mexico in the semi-finals while tournament favorite brazil must at least achieve a tie against japan to secure the second group b semi-final spot . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no masterpiece from brazil 's soccer artists mexico provide the first big surprise in the confederations cup by knocking off world champs brazil , 1-0 .

shell announced it would sink the brent spar oil platform in the north sea , and greenpeace activists occupied the platform for a full two weeks in protest .
the media and politicians were drawn to the issue .
helmut kohl , germany 's chancellor at the time , came out opposed to the company 's plan .
a widespread call to boycott shell gas stations in germany overrode party lines .

since then , a whole new business has sprung up specialized in recycling oil platforms , smid noted happily .
lessons learned however , greenpeace warns , the north sea remains at risk beyond sunken oil platforms .
simply by carrying out its normal production , the oil industry removes 14,000 tons of petroleum each year from this part of the atlantic .
at the same time as the environmental group celebrates a historic victory , the event led to a widespread questioning of greenpeace 's credibility .
shortly before shell gave in , greenpeace admitted it had estimated the amount of poisonous oil residues in the platform as being much too high .

human rights groups say this reflects unfair immigration practices rather than improved international conditions . if the official number of refugees in germany was an indication of the state of world conflict , earth would be a very peaceful place indeed .
while germany had 11,000 official asylum seekers in 1998 , in 2004 there were just 2000 .
but a glance at the newspapers shows this is not the case .
crises continue to rage in sudan and iraq ; closer to germany , the political persecution of kurds in turkey and the ongoing conflict in chechnya give hundreds of thousands of people a reason flee their homelands .
' extreme mistrust ' yet just 1.5 percent of the 35,000 people who applied for asylum in germany got it , according to the federal office for migration and refugees .
" there is extreme mistrust and tendency toward refusal on the part of immigration officials , " said bernd mesovic of pro asyl , a nonprofit human rights organization for refugees .
germany is shifting the responsibility for refugees onto other countries , and as a last resort , to the country of origin , his group says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum seeker in germany pro asyl , amnesty international , an association of german magistrates and other organizations have examined how refugees are questioned during their asylum application .
" in cases of doubt , the federal migration office decides against asylum seekers , " said wolfgang grenz , a refugee expert at amnesty international .
he gave the example of a kurdish woman who sought asylum on the basis of allegedly having been tortured in her homeland .
but the application can be denied on the grounds that the torture was n't described in detail .
" in that case , " said grenz , " the official breached his duty by not asking the person to give details . "
personal interview is key the personal interview is the heart of the asylum process .
after they have fled their countries , most applicants have no hard proof of their political oppression ; torturers do n't issue " official torture certificates . "
the decision therefore is usually a subjective one , made by the interviewer who questions the refugee .
is the kurdish woman 's story is true or invented ?
in many cases , it is a difficult call to make .
barbara stolterfoht of the paritätischer wohlfahrtsverband , a leading german social welfare support group , said that officials increasingly assume asylum applicants are not telling the truth and are merely abusing the system .
this assumption can even be subconscious , she said , but either way , it is deadly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people seeking asylum in frankfurt airport .
" the social climate has developed toward being anti-asylum , even though the asylum seekers are just exercising their constitutionally chartered rights , " she said .
according to pro asyl , asylum cases are often seen less as individual situations and are instead standardized to the extent possible .
the group said it frequently sees cases where officials ask questions in order to elicit answers that fit neatly into prearranged categories , rather than dealing with each individual .
" you can be happy when a report caries five or six sentences having to do with the person 's particular situation , " said pro asyl 's mesovic .
fair hearings ?
mesovic also said the person 's country of origin has enormous influence on the outcome of a hearing .
" if officials believe that people are n't tortured in a given country , then that often has more weight than the statement of the refugee who says he or she was tortured , " mesovic said .
the federal migration office denies that is the case .
" the hearings are fair and each applicant has the chance to make detailed statements , and to correct and amplify the statements , " said a spokesperson .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugees in darfur but pro asyl and amnesty say otherwise .
in their experience , the groups have said , applicants are n't informed of contradictions in their statements , and therefore forego their legal right to change their statements .
pro asyl compared notes taken during hearings that resulted in asylum denials and found that many people were turned down when contradictions in their stories made their reasons for seeking asylum less credible .
yet in the transcripts of the hearings , there was no mention of the contradictions .
political decisionmaking ?
thus the asylum seekers did n't know which part of the hearing was important in deciding their case .
pro asyl 's mesovic attributed the practice to a political move .
" the quota of asylum cases that are granted are steered politically , " he said .
" the federal migration office is doing nothing more or less than carrying out the concept of interior minister -lrb- otto -rrb- schily . "
for his part , schily has said he hopes to move the asylum process at least in part to refugee camps in north africa . manfred götzke -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu approves refugee camp pilot schemes after debating proposals put forward by germany 's otto schily , the european commission has agreed to set up pilot schemes in five north african countries to cope with the influx of refugees heading to europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.06.2005 warmer ties to mark eu-us summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not exactly of one mind , but coming closer eu leaders travel to washington on monday for a one-day summit with the united states hosted by president george w. bush .
after years of cool relations , this meeting comes as trans-atlantic ties are warming up . eu leaders , including the president of the european commission , jose manual barroso , and the president of the european council , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , will meet with george w. bush on monday to discuss a variety of issues , including economic growth and integration , the environment and energy issues . the trip to washington for the eu heads might well be a welcome diversion from all the problems they face in brussels , including the recent rejection by french and dutch voters of the eu constitution and the wrangling over the next eu budget .
the same could not have been said for the last eu-us summit in june 2004 , when divisions over the iraq war were still fresh in leaders ' minds as were differences over us policy toward over iran and its nuclear program . but since that time , relations across the atlantic have improved considerably . " the backdrop of this summit is much more positive than the previous one , " gunnar wiegand , the european commission 's top official dealing with the us , said in an interview .
" we have had our occasional differences but now we work together much better . " partners the motto of monday 's summit will be " working together as global partners " and will be attended by bush , barroso , juncker , eu trade commissioner peter mandelson , us secretary of state condoleezza rice and eu foreign policy chief javier solana , among others . there is a lot to talk about and much common ground , particularly on the economic level .
the eu and the us share the largest trade and investment relationship in the world .
in 2003 , some $ 750 billion -lrb- 610 billion euros -rrb- in goods and services flowed across the big pond and foreign direct investment levels reached $ 1.75 trillion in the same year . topics of discussion will also include the promotion of democracy , un reform , development and humanitarian assistance and security issues , such as counterterrorism , and transport and border security . strong differences still there bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guantanamo bay naval base in guantanamo , cuba but monday 's meeting is n't likely to be purely a love fest .
there are still big differences of opinion in many areas , such as the kyoto treaty on climate change , the international criminal court , guantanamo bay -lrb- photo -rrb- and the eu 's decision to lift its arms embargo against china . the row over subsidies for plane manufactures airbus and boeing is also a sore subject .
although even here , there 's more talk of cooperation than conflict .
both sides announced on friday that thay will hold new talks in a bid to end the subsidies battle . " talks will continue .
my doors are open , " us trade representative rob portman said after a meeting with his eu counterpart , peter mandelson . but stephanie henning , a fellow at the brussels office of the german marshall fund of the united states , admitted that while eu-us relations have improved the bush administration has not undergone a 180-degree turn regarding europe . " bush may have learned some lessons from iraq , but ultimately he will continue to make decisions according to america 's best interests , " she told upi . however , she added that both sides needed a successful summit after bush 's charm offensive in europe during a visit to brussels in february and europe 's recent turmoil over the constitution . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us , eu on collision course over china two senior members of the united states congress warned the european union this week that the lifting of the 15-year arms embargo on china could result in a halt of us sales in military technology to the eu .

but the eu 's current crisis is bound to come up for discussion . rumor has it that us president george w. bush is feeling a bit of schadenfreude these days .
after all , " old europe , " which now faces one of its worst crises after eu budget talks failed last week , opposed his plans to go to war in iraq . officially , however , washington is eager to show its commitment and faith in the union on the other side of the atlantic .
preparing monday 's eu-us summit with her european colleagues , us secretary of state condoleezza rice did her best to pamper the sickly 25-nation bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice -lrb- left -rrb- with solana and asselborn during a meeting in luxembourg in february " europe and the european union is alive , " she said after a meeting with luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn , eu foreign policy chief javier solana and eu external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner .
asselborn currently holds the eu presidency . " we understand that europe is going through a difficult phase right now , " rice added .
" but we continue to hope for an outward-looking europe , not an inward-looking one . " some are gleeful despite rice 's statements , others in washington are gleefully watching europe 's agony from the sidelines .
they have not forgotten vocal opposition to the war in iraq , said michael o 'hanlon , a senior fellow in foreign policy studies at the brookings institution in the us capital . " if we look at europe 's deep division over the iraq war , it 's not clear to everyone in the us why a united and strong eu is really necessary , " he told german public broadcaster ndr . bush needs europe while that may be the thinking of the average american , the us leadership does need a united europe , o 'hanlon said .
bush needs the bloc 's help in rebuilding iraq , in pushing for peace in the middle east and in dealing with iran 's nuclear ambitions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush -lrb- left -rrb- with schröder and chirac in evian , france during the g8 summit in june 2003 despite recent trade disputes such as the airbus-boeing row and fights over steel and banana tariffs , the us and eu economies are also closely intertwined .
in short , bush can not afford a weak eu , o 'hanlon said . " he needs europe 's help , " the political scientist added .
" bush leads a country that has lost 1,700 soldiers in iraq , that has spent $ 200 billion -lrb- 163.6 billion euros -rrb- on a war without seeing results .
bush is n't much better off than -lrb- french president -rrb- jacques chirac or -lrb- german chancellor -rrb- gerhard schröder .

he said calls for freer access to germany were utterly wrong . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein " we have not yet come to grips with the wave of immigration in the past decade , " he said .
" we are still struggling to integrate those immigrants already here , which requires a strong political effort and a willingness by immigrants to fully embrace this country . " influx from former ussr in the past 15 years , germany has seen a dramatic influx of foreigners mainly from the former soviet union where ethnic germans were allowed to emigrate after the collapse of communism there . in the early 1990s , almost 200,000 russians of german origin came here each year under laws giving them german citizenship automatically .
they were people who have often found it difficult to adapt to western life and culture . the conservatives also aim to limit immigration of people from other countries who come to germany under new immigration rules .
the new laws , which were recently adopted with the support of the conservatives , allow for increased immigration to offset the demographic imbalances created by an ageing german population and dwindling birth rates . but wolfgang bosbach , a senior christian democrat , says that the quality of immigrants will take precedence over quantity under a future conservative government .

the media in germany is often accused , not least by muslims in the country , of being one-sided and clichéd when it comes to reporting on them .
journalists deny it , saying discernment and responsibility are important . not only muslims living in germany , but also cultural experts routinely criticize the german media for reinforcing stereotypes and being too subjective in its reporting of muslim topics . a look at the german media certainly lends some credence to the allegations .
for instance , the newsmagazine focus ran a headline on its cover recently which referred to " unsettling guests . " the story was about muslims of turkish origin living in germany - people who , in reality , have been living in germany for decades and have long ceased being " guests . "
nonetheless , the word " unsettling " presented them collectively as a threat to german society . the facts , no matter how unpleasant however , representatives of the german media have defended themselves against the allegations , insisting that they ca n't be applied across the board to all publications .
jörg lau , a reporter at the respected intellectual weekly die zeit , also found focus ' choice of words " scandalous , " but he insisted that the media could n't just ignore real problems in the country . " it 's the media 's job to call things - which they see as wrong - by what they are , even when it 's viewed as unpleasant by others , " lau said .
" that also applies when people feel discriminated through it . " many muslims in germany feel discriminated against because news stories featuring muslims usually spark an avalanche of stories in the german media which anchor a negative image of their culture in the public consciousness .
the recent case of an alleged honor killing in berlin involving a young turkish woman was such an example . despite balanced reporting by individual journalists on topics such as honor killings or forced marriages , readers are often left with the impression that the entire muslim community is abusive toward women . provocative headlines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spiegel cover on conspiracy theories surrounding the 9-11 terror attacks .
the issue has taken on an added urgency in the aftermath of the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the us , as articles on muslims and islam appear more frequently in the media . jörg lau admitted that not every newspaper and radio or television channel was objective in its reporting , but underlined the importance of considering the source .
for instance , the headline " allah 's daughters without rights " - which ran on the cover of the esteemed newsmagazine spiegel to address the problems faced by turkish women in germany - was perfectly acceptable , said lau . that did n't keep many muslims in germany from being angered by it though . " i did n't find the headline wrong or misleading , after all , the story was about the rights of the affected women , " lau said .
" however the focus headline " unsettling guests " was demagogy - that should be criticized .
there , the german media should be careful and self-critical . " joachim kandel , an expert on islam at the friedrich ebert foundation said that baiting readers with provocative headlines or top stories was part of the german media culture and was n't just confined to islamic topics . " such sentences are provocative but other topics and other minorities are reported on with equally provocative leads , " kandel said . " but when you read the article in full then you conclude that it usually contains balanced arguments . " at the same time , kandel said that the media has to be allowed to air uncomfortable facts .
" we also have a problem with how muslims want to define their lifestyles based on the koran and the sunna -lrb- islamic practices -rrb- when it comes to human rights , democracy , pluralism .
those are serious questions that must be discussed . " responsible or not ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalist lau pointed out that the debate reflected changing realities in germany , adding that people here had ignored for too long the fact that migrants from muslim countries such as turkey would stay permanently in germany . " people are really unnerved , but not because the others are perhaps ' unsettling ' but because people are in a new situation , " lau said . " germany is a country of immigrants now . " kandel hinted at another development : the fact that , in part because of the muslim population , religion today plays a bigger role in germany than it did 10 years ago .
he said that it was good if the german media followed the development - even if they were criticized for it - because it was the only way they could enlighten readers . " i think most media consumers in germany are aware that there is a difference between the religion islam and radical islamism , " kandel said , adding that was a success for the german media . at the same time , kandel said that , compared to other european countries , germany had witnessed less of a backlash on its muslim community in the aftermath of sept .

the media in germany is often accused , not least by muslims in the country , of being one-sided and clichéd when it comes to reporting on them .
journalists deny it , saying discernment and responsibility are important . not only muslims living in germany , but also cultural experts routinely criticize the german media for reinforcing stereotypes and being too subjective in its reporting of muslim topics . a look at the german media certainly lends some credence to the allegations .
for instance , the newsmagazine focus ran a headline on its cover recently which referred to " unsettling guests . " the story was about muslims of turkish origin living in germany - people who , in reality , have been living in germany for decades and have long ceased being " guests . "
nonetheless , the word " unsettling " presented them collectively as a threat to german society . the facts , no matter how unpleasant however , representatives of the german media have defended themselves against the allegations , insisting that they ca n't be applied across the board to all publications .
jörg lau , a reporter at the respected intellectual weekly die zeit , also found focus ' choice of words " scandalous , " but he insisted that the media could n't just ignore real problems in the country . " it 's the media 's job to call things - which they see as wrong - by what they are , even when it 's viewed as unpleasant by others , " lau said .
" that also applies when people feel discriminated through it . " many muslims in germany feel discriminated against because news stories featuring muslims usually spark an avalanche of stories in the german media which anchor a negative image of their culture in the public consciousness .
the recent case of an alleged honor killing in berlin involving a young turkish woman was such an example . despite balanced reporting by individual journalists on topics such as honor killings or forced marriages , readers are often left with the impression that the entire muslim community is abusive toward women . provocative headlines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spiegel cover on conspiracy theories surrounding the 9-11 terror attacks .
the issue has taken on an added urgency in the aftermath of the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the us , as articles on muslims and islam appear more frequently in the media . jörg lau admitted that not every newspaper and radio or television channel was objective in its reporting , but underlined the importance of considering the source .
for instance , the headline " allah 's daughters without rights " - which ran on the cover of the esteemed newsmagazine spiegel to address the problems faced by turkish women in germany - was perfectly acceptable , said lau . that did n't keep many muslims in germany from being angered by it though . " i did n't find the headline wrong or misleading , after all , the story was about the rights of the affected women , " lau said .
" however the focus headline " unsettling guests " was demagogy - that should be criticized .
there , the german media should be careful and self-critical . " joachim kandel , an expert on islam at the friedrich ebert foundation said that baiting readers with provocative headlines or top stories was part of the german media culture and was n't just confined to islamic topics . " such sentences are provocative but other topics and other minorities are reported on with equally provocative leads , " kandel said . " but when you read the article in full then you conclude that it usually contains balanced arguments . " at the same time , kandel said that the media has to be allowed to air uncomfortable facts .

now that push is coming to shove , the players will have to step up . inter milan 's star striker adriano was racing alone towards mexican keeper oswaldo sanchez and had the opportunity to put the selecao in the lead .
with only light pressure from behind and sanchez charging from the line , adriano looked for the lower right-hand corner and pushed it just outside the right post .
the shot was not exactly one for the schoolbooks .
at halftime , german television commentator and former national player günter netzer jumped all over one of the world 's best players .
" -lrb- germany 's -rrb- lukas podolski would not have missed that shot , " netzer said on german television .
and it was n't just pure jingoistic banter on his part .
just over two weeks ago podolski scored a similar goal against northern ireland - with a defender pulling on his arm and the goalkeeper much closer to him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to his supporters , lukas podolski is " prince poldi " lukas podolski , only 20 years old , has made his mark in a short time .
last june was his first appearance with the german squad but it was n't until his two-goal performance against thailand last december that he made his breakthrough .
since then , " prince poldi " has accumulated another three goals in five matches .
the fc cologne striker just bubbles over with enthusiasm for the game .
for many a young player , this excitement degenerates into arrogance and a failure to make the right decision at important points in a game .
podolski , however , acts like a seasoned veteran .
on saturday , he made the key pass that led to the foul against michael ballack in the tunisian penalty box , and in turn the go-ahead goal .
minutes later , he fed his close friend sebastian schweinsteiger the pass that put germany up 2-0 , all in his home stadium in cologne .
scoring goals naturally would have been more spectacular , but his assists put jürgen klinsmann 's side through to the semi-finals .
john aloisi top scorer after two matches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia 's john aloisi -lrb- back -rrb- has gone on a scoring rampage .
here , he launches a shot past german defender robert huth adriano and robinho from brazil .
or argentina 's juan roman riquleme .
also host country germany 's midfielder michael ballack .
these are some of the names that people had on their list as possible top scorers .
but socceroo john aloisi ?
who 's he , let alone at which club does he earn his keep ?
well , to answer the first question , aloisi has scored four goals against two the confedrations cup favorites , germany and argentina and leads the chase for the golden boot in the tournament .
for those who might make light of the fact that his 21 goals in 34 matches for the roos came against lightweights like the solomon islands or papua new guinea in the oceania confederation now have to eat their words .
the good performance could n't have come at a better time for the 29-year old striker .
that 's how the second question can be answered .
his contract with spanish side osasuna will expire at the end of the month and it wo n't be extended .
so , he 's looking for a new employer .
two premiereship sides have shown interest .
" i could picture myself playing in the bundesliga , " is what he told the sport magazine kicker .
another goal or two in the socceroos ' final match against tunisia would turn enough heads in germany to make that a possibility .
one out of three is bad mexico 's jared borgetti could have been the tragic figure on sunday night against brazil .
despite missing on two of three penalty attempts in the 30th minute , the final one saved by brazilian keeper dida , he shook off the failures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's jared borgetti , partially obscured at rear , was a head taller than the brazilians on his goal on sunday in the 59th minute , he headed in what would be the game winner for the " tri . "
in the process , mexico has turned into a nemesis for the five-time world champions brazil .
starting with the confed cup final in 1999 , which mexico won over the selecao 4-3 , mexico have beaten the brazilian five times , losing only once and drawing once .
this victory has put mexico in the semi-finals while tournament favorite brazil must at least achieve a tie against japan to secure the second group b semi-final spot . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no masterpiece from brazil 's soccer artists mexico provide the first big surprise in the confederations cup by knocking off world champs brazil , 1-0 .

human rights groups say this reflects unfair immigration practices rather than improved international conditions . if the official number of refugees in germany was an indication of the state of world conflict , earth would be a very peaceful place indeed .
while germany had 11,000 official asylum seekers in 1998 , in 2004 there were just 2000 .
but a glance at the newspapers shows this is not the case .
crises continue to rage in sudan and iraq ; closer to germany , the political persecution of kurds in turkey and the ongoing conflict in chechnya give hundreds of thousands of people a reason flee their homelands .
' extreme mistrust ' yet just 1.5 percent of the 35,000 people who applied for asylum in germany got it , according to the federal office for migration and refugees .
" there is extreme mistrust and tendency toward refusal on the part of immigration officials , " said bernd mesovic of pro asyl , a nonprofit human rights organization for refugees .
germany is shifting the responsibility for refugees onto other countries , and as a last resort , to the country of origin , his group says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum seeker in germany pro asyl , amnesty international , an association of german magistrates and other organizations have examined how refugees are questioned during their asylum application .
" in cases of doubt , the federal migration office decides against asylum seekers , " said wolfgang grenz , a refugee expert at amnesty international .
he gave the example of a kurdish woman who sought asylum on the basis of allegedly having been tortured in her homeland .
but the application can be denied on the grounds that the torture was n't described in detail .
" in that case , " said grenz , " the official breached his duty by not asking the person to give details . "
personal interview is key the personal interview is the heart of the asylum process .
after they have fled their countries , most applicants have no hard proof of their political oppression ; torturers do n't issue " official torture certificates . "
the decision therefore is usually a subjective one , made by the interviewer who questions the refugee .
is the kurdish woman 's story is true or invented ?
in many cases , it is a difficult call to make .
barbara stolterfoht of the paritätischer wohlfahrtsverband , a leading german social welfare support group , said that officials increasingly assume asylum applicants are not telling the truth and are merely abusing the system .
this assumption can even be subconscious , she said , but either way , it is deadly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people seeking asylum in frankfurt airport .
" the social climate has developed toward being anti-asylum , even though the asylum seekers are just exercising their constitutionally chartered rights , " she said .
according to pro asyl , asylum cases are often seen less as individual situations and are instead standardized to the extent possible .
the group said it frequently sees cases where officials ask questions in order to elicit answers that fit neatly into prearranged categories , rather than dealing with each individual .
" you can be happy when a report caries five or six sentences having to do with the person 's particular situation , " said pro asyl 's mesovic .
fair hearings ?
mesovic also said the person 's country of origin has enormous influence on the outcome of a hearing .
" if officials believe that people are n't tortured in a given country , then that often has more weight than the statement of the refugee who says he or she was tortured , " mesovic said .
the federal migration office denies that is the case .
" the hearings are fair and each applicant has the chance to make detailed statements , and to correct and amplify the statements , " said a spokesperson .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugees in darfur but pro asyl and amnesty say otherwise .
in their experience , the groups have said , applicants are n't informed of contradictions in their statements , and therefore forego their legal right to change their statements .
pro asyl compared notes taken during hearings that resulted in asylum denials and found that many people were turned down when contradictions in their stories made their reasons for seeking asylum less credible .
yet in the transcripts of the hearings , there was no mention of the contradictions .
political decisionmaking ?
thus the asylum seekers did n't know which part of the hearing was important in deciding their case .
pro asyl 's mesovic attributed the practice to a political move .
" the quota of asylum cases that are granted are steered politically , " he said .
" the federal migration office is doing nothing more or less than carrying out the concept of interior minister -lrb- otto -rrb- schily . "
for his part , schily has said he hopes to move the asylum process at least in part to refugee camps in north africa . manfred götzke -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu approves refugee camp pilot schemes after debating proposals put forward by germany 's otto schily , the european commission has agreed to set up pilot schemes in five north african countries to cope with the influx of refugees heading to europe .

but the eu 's current crisis is bound to come up for discussion . rumor has it that us president george w. bush is feeling a bit of schadenfreude these days .
after all , " old europe , " which now faces one of its worst crises after eu budget talks failed last week , opposed his plans to go to war in iraq . officially , however , washington is eager to show its commitment and faith in the union on the other side of the atlantic .
preparing monday 's eu-us summit with her european colleagues , us secretary of state condoleezza rice did her best to pamper the sickly 25-nation bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice -lrb- left -rrb- with solana and asselborn during a meeting in luxembourg in february " europe and the european union is alive , " she said after a meeting with luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn , eu foreign policy chief javier solana and eu external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner .
asselborn currently holds the eu presidency . " we understand that europe is going through a difficult phase right now , " rice added .
" but we continue to hope for an outward-looking europe , not an inward-looking one . " some are gleeful despite rice 's statements , others in washington are gleefully watching europe 's agony from the sidelines .
they have not forgotten vocal opposition to the war in iraq , said michael o 'hanlon , a senior fellow in foreign policy studies at the brookings institution in the us capital . " if we look at europe 's deep division over the iraq war , it 's not clear to everyone in the us why a united and strong eu is really necessary , " he told german public broadcaster ndr . bush needs europe while that may be the thinking of the average american , the us leadership does need a united europe , o 'hanlon said .
bush needs the bloc 's help in rebuilding iraq , in pushing for peace in the middle east and in dealing with iran 's nuclear ambitions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush -lrb- left -rrb- with schröder and chirac in evian , france during the g8 summit in june 2003 despite recent trade disputes such as the airbus-boeing row and fights over steel and banana tariffs , the us and eu economies are also closely intertwined .
in short , bush can not afford a weak eu , o 'hanlon said . " he needs europe 's help , " the political scientist added .
" bush leads a country that has lost 1,700 soldiers in iraq , that has spent $ 200 billion -lrb- 163.6 billion euros -rrb- on a war without seeing results .
bush is n't much better off than -lrb- french president -rrb- jacques chirac or -lrb- german chancellor -rrb- gerhard schröder .

but the bonn-based agency added that the numbers of job seekers are increasing while offers are declining .

" we are still struggling to integrate those immigrants already here , which requires a strong political effort and a willingness by immigrants to fully embrace this country .

now that push is coming to shove , the players will have to step up . inter milan 's star striker adriano was racing alone towards mexican keeper oswaldo sanchez and had the opportunity to put the selecao in the lead .
with only light pressure from behind and sanchez charging from the line , adriano looked for the lower right-hand corner and pushed it just outside the right post .
the shot was not exactly one for the schoolbooks .
at halftime , german television commentator and former national player günter netzer jumped all over one of the world 's best players .
" -lrb- germany 's -rrb- lukas podolski would not have missed that shot , " netzer said on german television .
and it was n't just pure jingoistic banter on his part .
just over two weeks ago podolski scored a similar goal against northern ireland - with a defender pulling on his arm and the goalkeeper much closer to him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to his supporters , lukas podolski is " prince poldi " lukas podolski , only 20 years old , has made his mark in a short time .
last june was his first appearance with the german squad but it was n't until his two-goal performance against thailand last december that he made his breakthrough .
since then , " prince poldi " has accumulated another three goals in five matches .
the fc cologne striker just bubbles over with enthusiasm for the game .
for many a young player , this excitement degenerates into arrogance and a failure to make the right decision at important points in a game .
podolski , however , acts like a seasoned veteran .
on saturday , he made the key pass that led to the foul against michael ballack in the tunisian penalty box , and in turn the go-ahead goal .
minutes later , he fed his close friend sebastian schweinsteiger the pass that put germany up 2-0 , all in his home stadium in cologne .
scoring goals naturally would have been more spectacular , but his assists put jürgen klinsmann 's side through to the semi-finals .
john aloisi top scorer after two matches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia 's john aloisi -lrb- back -rrb- has gone on a scoring rampage .
here , he launches a shot past german defender robert huth adriano and robinho from brazil .
or argentina 's juan roman riquleme .
also host country germany 's midfielder michael ballack .
these are some of the names that people had on their list as possible top scorers .
but socceroo john aloisi ?
who 's he , let alone at which club does he earn his keep ?
well , to answer the first question , aloisi has scored four goals against two the confedrations cup favorites , germany and argentina and leads the chase for the golden boot in the tournament .
for those who might make light of the fact that his 21 goals in 34 matches for the roos came against lightweights like the solomon islands or papua new guinea in the oceania confederation now have to eat their words .
the good performance could n't have come at a better time for the 29-year old striker .
that 's how the second question can be answered .
his contract with spanish side osasuna will expire at the end of the month and it wo n't be extended .
so , he 's looking for a new employer .
two premiereship sides have shown interest .
" i could picture myself playing in the bundesliga , " is what he told the sport magazine kicker .
another goal or two in the socceroos ' final match against tunisia would turn enough heads in germany to make that a possibility .
one out of three is bad mexico 's jared borgetti could have been the tragic figure on sunday night against brazil .
despite missing on two of three penalty attempts in the 30th minute , the final one saved by brazilian keeper dida , he shook off the failures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's jared borgetti , partially obscured at rear , was a head taller than the brazilians on his goal on sunday in the 59th minute , he headed in what would be the game winner for the " tri . "
in the process , mexico has turned into a nemesis for the five-time world champions brazil .
starting with the confed cup final in 1999 , which mexico won over the selecao 4-3 , mexico have beaten the brazilian five times , losing only once and drawing once .
this victory has put mexico in the semi-finals while tournament favorite brazil must at least achieve a tie against japan to secure the second group b semi-final spot . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no masterpiece from brazil 's soccer artists mexico provide the first big surprise in the confederations cup by knocking off world champs brazil , 1-0 .

the four local and two german employees of bilfinger gas and oil services , were captured at sea on wednesday by ijaw youths complaining that the shell oil company had reneged on a memorandum promising to contribute to local economic development .
warowei said the hostages had " confirmed they have not been maltreated , " and that there was no violence . " they just talk about the psychological trauma they have experienced .
" they were released unconditionally , " he added .
" no ransom was paid . "
according to warowei , the kidnappers said the volatile niger delta region .
activists in the delta have carried out several such kidnappings , accusing the foreign oil companies of polluting the environment of the southern coastal states of nigeria and failing to put wealth back into region .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.06.2005 are asylum seekers getting a fair shot ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum seekers fear it : the official german stamp meaning ' expelled ' fewer and fewer refugees are being granted asylum in germany .
human rights groups say this reflects unfair immigration practices rather than improved international conditions . if the official number of refugees in germany was an indication of the state of world conflict , earth would be a very peaceful place indeed .
while germany had 11,000 official asylum seekers in 1998 , in 2004 there were just 2000 .
but a glance at the newspapers shows this is not the case .
crises continue to rage in sudan and iraq ; closer to germany , the political persecution of kurds in turkey and the ongoing conflict in chechnya give hundreds of thousands of people a reason flee their homelands .
' extreme mistrust ' yet just 1.5 percent of the 35,000 people who applied for asylum in germany got it , according to the federal office for migration and refugees .
" there is extreme mistrust and tendency toward refusal on the part of immigration officials , " said bernd mesovic of pro asyl , a nonprofit human rights organization for refugees .
germany is shifting the responsibility for refugees onto other countries , and as a last resort , to the country of origin , his group says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum seeker in germany pro asyl , amnesty international , an association of german magistrates and other organizations have examined how refugees are questioned during their asylum application .
" in cases of doubt , the federal migration office decides against asylum seekers , " said wolfgang grenz , a refugee expert at amnesty international .
he gave the example of a kurdish woman who sought asylum on the basis of allegedly having been tortured in her homeland .
but the application can be denied on the grounds that the torture was n't described in detail .
" in that case , " said grenz , " the official breached his duty by not asking the person to give details . "
personal interview is key the personal interview is the heart of the asylum process .
after they have fled their countries , most applicants have no hard proof of their political oppression ; torturers do n't issue " official torture certificates . "
the decision therefore is usually a subjective one , made by the interviewer who questions the refugee .
is the kurdish woman 's story is true or invented ?
in many cases , it is a difficult call to make .
barbara stolterfoht of the paritätischer wohlfahrtsverband , a leading german social welfare support group , said that officials increasingly assume asylum applicants are not telling the truth and are merely abusing the system .
this assumption can even be subconscious , she said , but either way , it is deadly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people seeking asylum in frankfurt airport .
" the social climate has developed toward being anti-asylum , even though the asylum seekers are just exercising their constitutionally chartered rights , " she said .
according to pro asyl , asylum cases are often seen less as individual situations and are instead standardized to the extent possible .
the group said it frequently sees cases where officials ask questions in order to elicit answers that fit neatly into prearranged categories , rather than dealing with each individual .
" you can be happy when a report caries five or six sentences having to do with the person 's particular situation , " said pro asyl 's mesovic .
fair hearings ?
mesovic also said the person 's country of origin has enormous influence on the outcome of a hearing .
" if officials believe that people are n't tortured in a given country , then that often has more weight than the statement of the refugee who says he or she was tortured , " mesovic said .
the federal migration office denies that is the case .
" the hearings are fair and each applicant has the chance to make detailed statements , and to correct and amplify the statements , " said a spokesperson .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugees in darfur but pro asyl and amnesty say otherwise .
in their experience , the groups have said , applicants are n't informed of contradictions in their statements , and therefore forego their legal right to change their statements .
pro asyl compared notes taken during hearings that resulted in asylum denials and found that many people were turned down when contradictions in their stories made their reasons for seeking asylum less credible .
yet in the transcripts of the hearings , there was no mention of the contradictions .
political decisionmaking ?
thus the asylum seekers did n't know which part of the hearing was important in deciding their case .
pro asyl 's mesovic attributed the practice to a political move .
" the quota of asylum cases that are granted are steered politically , " he said .
" the federal migration office is doing nothing more or less than carrying out the concept of interior minister -lrb- otto -rrb- schily . "
for his part , schily has said he hopes to move the asylum process at least in part to refugee camps in north africa . manfred götzke -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu approves refugee camp pilot schemes after debating proposals put forward by germany 's otto schily , the european commission has agreed to set up pilot schemes in five north african countries to cope with the influx of refugees heading to europe .

after years of cool relations , this meeting comes as trans-atlantic ties are warming up . eu leaders , including the president of the european commission , jose manual barroso , and the president of the european council , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , will meet with george w. bush on monday to discuss a variety of issues , including economic growth and integration , the environment and energy issues . the trip to washington for the eu heads might well be a welcome diversion from all the problems they face in brussels , including the recent rejection by french and dutch voters of the eu constitution and the wrangling over the next eu budget .
the same could not have been said for the last eu-us summit in june 2004 , when divisions over the iraq war were still fresh in leaders ' minds as were differences over us policy toward over iran and its nuclear program . but since that time , relations across the atlantic have improved considerably . " the backdrop of this summit is much more positive than the previous one , " gunnar wiegand , the european commission 's top official dealing with the us , said in an interview .
" we have had our occasional differences but now we work together much better .

he said calls for freer access to germany were utterly wrong . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein " we have not yet come to grips with the wave of immigration in the past decade , " he said .
" we are still struggling to integrate those immigrants already here , which requires a strong political effort and a willingness by immigrants to fully embrace this country . " influx from former ussr in the past 15 years , germany has seen a dramatic influx of foreigners mainly from the former soviet union where ethnic germans were allowed to emigrate after the collapse of communism there . in the early 1990s , almost 200,000 russians of german origin came here each year under laws giving them german citizenship automatically .
they were people who have often found it difficult to adapt to western life and culture . the conservatives also aim to limit immigration of people from other countries who come to germany under new immigration rules .
the new laws , which were recently adopted with the support of the conservatives , allow for increased immigration to offset the demographic imbalances created by an ageing german population and dwindling birth rates . but wolfgang bosbach , a senior christian democrat , says that the quality of immigrants will take precedence over quantity under a future conservative government . " some people claim we need even more immigration to be able to stabilize our social security systems , " he said .
" such arguments overlook the fact that we need people who contribute to the system and don ’ t prove to be a drain on it as is currently the case . " antiquated arguments the suggestions about curbing immigration have drawn much criticism , especially from germany ’ s green party , which has been a champion of a more liberal immigration policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth " arguments suggesting germany doesn ’ t need any more immigration and calling on german women to have more babies is absolutely antiquated , " said claudia roth , chairwoman of the green party .
" the conservatives have retrieved an old dusted hat from the cupboard of history which unfortunately fits their anti-immigration campaign platform . " however , the anti-immigration drive is only one of a series of controversial moves planned by germany ’ s conservatives after a likely takeover of central power in berlin . bolstered by an almost 20-point lead over the ruling spd in the opinion polls , they ’ ve become bolder in their campaign , planning also a substantial overhaul of the tax system , which is expected to include reductions in income taxes and social contributions in exchange for scrapping some subsidies and hiking the value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- . uwe hessler -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a german amnesty for illegal immigrants ?
an initiative in germany wants to secure the basic rights of its around one million illegal immigrants .
but , the country still lags far behind other eu countries when it comes to dealing with the issue .
march 10 , 2005 government says immigrant wave receding in germany immigration into germany in the year 2003 , for the first time in many decades , dropped below 800,000 as the influx of foreigners throughout the 1990s has receded , according to government statistics released on monday .

after years of cool relations , this meeting comes as trans-atlantic ties are warming up . eu leaders , including the president of the european commission , jose manual barroso , and the president of the european council , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , will meet with george w. bush on monday to discuss a variety of issues , including economic growth and integration , the environment and energy issues . the trip to washington for the eu heads might well be a welcome diversion from all the problems they face in brussels , including the recent rejection by french and dutch voters of the eu constitution and the wrangling over the next eu budget .
the same could not have been said for the last eu-us summit in june 2004 , when divisions over the iraq war were still fresh in leaders ' minds as were differences over us policy toward over iran and its nuclear program . but since that time , relations across the atlantic have improved considerably . " the backdrop of this summit is much more positive than the previous one , " gunnar wiegand , the european commission 's top official dealing with the us , said in an interview .
" we have had our occasional differences but now we work together much better . " partners the motto of monday 's summit will be " working together as global partners " and will be attended by bush , barroso , juncker , eu trade commissioner peter mandelson , us secretary of state condoleezza rice and eu foreign policy chief javier solana , among others . there is a lot to talk about and much common ground , particularly on the economic level .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.06.2005 german media under fire from muslims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does the german media serve up stereotypes ?
the media in germany is often accused , not least by muslims in the country , of being one-sided and clichéd when it comes to reporting on them .
journalists deny it , saying discernment and responsibility are important . not only muslims living in germany , but also cultural experts routinely criticize the german media for reinforcing stereotypes and being too subjective in its reporting of muslim topics . a look at the german media certainly lends some credence to the allegations .
for instance , the newsmagazine focus ran a headline on its cover recently which referred to " unsettling guests . " the story was about muslims of turkish origin living in germany - people who , in reality , have been living in germany for decades and have long ceased being " guests . "
nonetheless , the word " unsettling " presented them collectively as a threat to german society . the facts , no matter how unpleasant however , representatives of the german media have defended themselves against the allegations , insisting that they ca n't be applied across the board to all publications .
jörg lau , a reporter at the respected intellectual weekly die zeit , also found focus ' choice of words " scandalous , " but he insisted that the media could n't just ignore real problems in the country . " it 's the media 's job to call things - which they see as wrong - by what they are , even when it 's viewed as unpleasant by others , " lau said .
" that also applies when people feel discriminated through it . " many muslims in germany feel discriminated against because news stories featuring muslims usually spark an avalanche of stories in the german media which anchor a negative image of their culture in the public consciousness .
the recent case of an alleged honor killing in berlin involving a young turkish woman was such an example . despite balanced reporting by individual journalists on topics such as honor killings or forced marriages , readers are often left with the impression that the entire muslim community is abusive toward women . provocative headlines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spiegel cover on conspiracy theories surrounding the 9-11 terror attacks .
the issue has taken on an added urgency in the aftermath of the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the us , as articles on muslims and islam appear more frequently in the media . jörg lau admitted that not every newspaper and radio or television channel was objective in its reporting , but underlined the importance of considering the source .
for instance , the headline " allah 's daughters without rights " - which ran on the cover of the esteemed newsmagazine spiegel to address the problems faced by turkish women in germany - was perfectly acceptable , said lau . that did n't keep many muslims in germany from being angered by it though . " i did n't find the headline wrong or misleading , after all , the story was about the rights of the affected women , " lau said .
" however the focus headline " unsettling guests " was demagogy - that should be criticized .
there , the german media should be careful and self-critical . " joachim kandel , an expert on islam at the friedrich ebert foundation said that baiting readers with provocative headlines or top stories was part of the german media culture and was n't just confined to islamic topics . " such sentences are provocative but other topics and other minorities are reported on with equally provocative leads , " kandel said . " but when you read the article in full then you conclude that it usually contains balanced arguments . " at the same time , kandel said that the media has to be allowed to air uncomfortable facts .
" we also have a problem with how muslims want to define their lifestyles based on the koran and the sunna -lrb- islamic practices -rrb- when it comes to human rights , democracy , pluralism .
those are serious questions that must be discussed . " responsible or not ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalist lau pointed out that the debate reflected changing realities in germany , adding that people here had ignored for too long the fact that migrants from muslim countries such as turkey would stay permanently in germany . " people are really unnerved , but not because the others are perhaps ' unsettling ' but because people are in a new situation , " lau said . " germany is a country of immigrants now . " kandel hinted at another development : the fact that , in part because of the muslim population , religion today plays a bigger role in germany than it did 10 years ago .
he said that it was good if the german media followed the development - even if they were criticized for it - because it was the only way they could enlighten readers . " i think most media consumers in germany are aware that there is a difference between the religion islam and radical islamism , " kandel said , adding that was a success for the german media . at the same time , kandel said that , compared to other european countries , germany had witnessed less of a backlash on its muslim community in the aftermath of sept .
11 .
" i trace that to the responsibility displayed by the german media , " he said . vedat acikgöz -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when freedom gets the death sentence the murder of a turkish woman and the applauding of the crime by some students have left berlin shaken and officials pushing for ethics class .

the media in germany is often accused , not least by muslims in the country , of being one-sided and clichéd when it comes to reporting on them .
journalists deny it , saying discernment and responsibility are important . not only muslims living in germany , but also cultural experts routinely criticize the german media for reinforcing stereotypes and being too subjective in its reporting of muslim topics . a look at the german media certainly lends some credence to the allegations .
for instance , the newsmagazine focus ran a headline on its cover recently which referred to " unsettling guests . " the story was about muslims of turkish origin living in germany - people who , in reality , have been living in germany for decades and have long ceased being " guests . "
nonetheless , the word " unsettling " presented them collectively as a threat to german society . the facts , no matter how unpleasant however , representatives of the german media have defended themselves against the allegations , insisting that they ca n't be applied across the board to all publications .
jörg lau , a reporter at the respected intellectual weekly die zeit , also found focus ' choice of words " scandalous , " but he insisted that the media could n't just ignore real problems in the country . " it 's the media 's job to call things - which they see as wrong - by what they are , even when it 's viewed as unpleasant by others , " lau said .
" that also applies when people feel discriminated through it . " many muslims in germany feel discriminated against because news stories featuring muslims usually spark an avalanche of stories in the german media which anchor a negative image of their culture in the public consciousness .
the recent case of an alleged honor killing in berlin involving a young turkish woman was such an example . despite balanced reporting by individual journalists on topics such as honor killings or forced marriages , readers are often left with the impression that the entire muslim community is abusive toward women . provocative headlines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spiegel cover on conspiracy theories surrounding the 9-11 terror attacks .
the issue has taken on an added urgency in the aftermath of the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the us , as articles on muslims and islam appear more frequently in the media . jörg lau admitted that not every newspaper and radio or television channel was objective in its reporting , but underlined the importance of considering the source .
for instance , the headline " allah 's daughters without rights " - which ran on the cover of the esteemed newsmagazine spiegel to address the problems faced by turkish women in germany - was perfectly acceptable , said lau . that did n't keep many muslims in germany from being angered by it though . " i did n't find the headline wrong or misleading , after all , the story was about the rights of the affected women , " lau said .
" however the focus headline " unsettling guests " was demagogy - that should be criticized .
there , the german media should be careful and self-critical . " joachim kandel , an expert on islam at the friedrich ebert foundation said that baiting readers with provocative headlines or top stories was part of the german media culture and was n't just confined to islamic topics . " such sentences are provocative but other topics and other minorities are reported on with equally provocative leads , " kandel said . " but when you read the article in full then you conclude that it usually contains balanced arguments . " at the same time , kandel said that the media has to be allowed to air uncomfortable facts .
" we also have a problem with how muslims want to define their lifestyles based on the koran and the sunna -lrb- islamic practices -rrb- when it comes to human rights , democracy , pluralism .
those are serious questions that must be discussed . " responsible or not ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalist lau pointed out that the debate reflected changing realities in germany , adding that people here had ignored for too long the fact that migrants from muslim countries such as turkey would stay permanently in germany . " people are really unnerved , but not because the others are perhaps ' unsettling ' but because people are in a new situation , " lau said . " germany is a country of immigrants now . " kandel hinted at another development : the fact that , in part because of the muslim population , religion today plays a bigger role in germany than it did 10 years ago .
he said that it was good if the german media followed the development - even if they were criticized for it - because it was the only way they could enlighten readers . " i think most media consumers in germany are aware that there is a difference between the religion islam and radical islamism , " kandel said , adding that was a success for the german media . at the same time , kandel said that , compared to other european countries , germany had witnessed less of a backlash on its muslim community in the aftermath of sept .

the oil concern relented , but the standoff changed greenpeace , shell and the north sea . in the spring of 1995 , the shell oil exploration company and greenpeace were in the midst of a standoff .
shell announced it would sink the brent spar oil platform in the north sea , and greenpeace activists occupied the platform for a full two weeks in protest .
the media and politicians were drawn to the issue .
helmut kohl , germany 's chancellor at the time , came out opposed to the company 's plan .
a widespread call to boycott shell gas stations in germany overrode party lines .
winning the standoff on june 20 , 1995 , shell said it would dispose of the brent spar on land .
but although it took place 10 years ago , the standoff is still fresh in the minds of many who were involved .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a shell worker in an offshore oil platform in the niger delta karsten smid of greenpeace germany remembers the joy he and his colleagues felt when they realized their protests had been successful .
he sees the campaign as a great victory for environmentalists , even if it was only the first battle won in the larger war .
" the real success came three years later , when the ospar conference -lrb- a meeting of the convention for the protection of the marine environment of the north-east atlantic -rrb- passed a general ban against sinking oil platforms .
no oil platforms have been sunk in the north sea since 1995 .
today it is clear that all obsolete platforms are disposed of on land .
so actually , the big success took place in 1998 , " smid said .
since then , a whole new business has sprung up specialized in recycling oil platforms , smid noted happily .
lessons learned however , greenpeace warns , the north sea remains at risk beyond sunken oil platforms .
simply by carrying out its normal production , the oil industry removes 14,000 tons of petroleum each year from this part of the atlantic .
at the same time as the environmental group celebrates a historic victory , the event led to a widespread questioning of greenpeace 's credibility .
shortly before shell gave in , greenpeace admitted it had estimated the amount of poisonous oil residues in the platform as being much too high .
and the group 's believability - its stock in trade - took a big hit with the public , schmid said .
this led to some changes for greenpeace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a norwegian petrolium drilling platform , " troll " " after that , we formed a research department , to test whether the information that we publicized was correct , " said smid .
" measurements have to be made by two independent laboratories , before the information is made public .
in that way , we very much improved our quality control . "
shell , too , learned some lessons from the brent spar debacle .
rainer winzenried , spokesman for shell in germany , said the company learned that sometimes thing that are legal are not necessarily acceptable to the public .
" since then , we have learned to bring new projects into the public sphere for discussion , so we can take public concerns into consideration during the planning phases .
we do this via so-called " shareholder forums , " said winzenried .
from the brent spar debate , the company also learned to take debates to an international level , even if its individual actions take place within one nation 's borders , winzenried said .
shell 's pr problems shortly after the brent spar debacle , shell faced another international debate : over the company 's actions in nigeria .
in november 1995 , the military regime that was then in power in the west african nation executed nine civil rights activists , including novelist ken saro-wiwa , who had denounced the environmental damage the oil industry had wrought on their homeland .
shell 's image took yet another knock .
today , winzenried said , shell has reduced the burning off of excess petrol that is part of the exploration process .
also , the company has changed its relationship to the people who live in oil-exploration regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil refinery on the niger delta " we no longer - to put it rudely - just give communities money in the hope they will stay quiet and leave us alone .
we work with non-governmental agencies to create put lasting development programs into effect . "
greenpeace and nigerian environmental and civil rights groups counter that even 10 years later , little has changed in the niger delta .
what shell hopes to sell as its new policy is above all cosmetic , greenpeace 's smid said .
next stop : russia ?
the company abuses nature not only in africa , but elsewhere as well , said smid .
greenpeace and shell 's latest battle is over an oil exploration project near sachalin island , off the russian coast in the northern pacific .
shell is endangering the feeding grounds of a rare species of grey whale , smid said .
for its part , shell points to its plans to carry out the project in cooperation with the world conservation union -lrb- iucn -rrb- in its defense . thomas mösch -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de energy firms seek new german sources the winter in germany has been cold and the demand for heating oil and gas has risen sharply .

now that push is coming to shove , the players will have to step up . inter milan 's star striker adriano was racing alone towards mexican keeper oswaldo sanchez and had the opportunity to put the selecao in the lead .
with only light pressure from behind and sanchez charging from the line , adriano looked for the lower right-hand corner and pushed it just outside the right post .
the shot was not exactly one for the schoolbooks .
at halftime , german television commentator and former national player günter netzer jumped all over one of the world 's best players .
" -lrb- germany 's -rrb- lukas podolski would not have missed that shot , " netzer said on german television .
and it was n't just pure jingoistic banter on his part .
just over two weeks ago podolski scored a similar goal against northern ireland - with a defender pulling on his arm and the goalkeeper much closer to him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to his supporters , lukas podolski is " prince poldi " lukas podolski , only 20 years old , has made his mark in a short time .
last june was his first appearance with the german squad but it was n't until his two-goal performance against thailand last december that he made his breakthrough .
since then , " prince poldi " has accumulated another three goals in five matches .
the fc cologne striker just bubbles over with enthusiasm for the game .
for many a young player , this excitement degenerates into arrogance and a failure to make the right decision at important points in a game .
podolski , however , acts like a seasoned veteran .
on saturday , he made the key pass that led to the foul against michael ballack in the tunisian penalty box , and in turn the go-ahead goal .
minutes later , he fed his close friend sebastian schweinsteiger the pass that put germany up 2-0 , all in his home stadium in cologne .
scoring goals naturally would have been more spectacular , but his assists put jürgen klinsmann 's side through to the semi-finals .
john aloisi top scorer after two matches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia 's john aloisi -lrb- back -rrb- has gone on a scoring rampage .
here , he launches a shot past german defender robert huth adriano and robinho from brazil .
or argentina 's juan roman riquleme .
also host country germany 's midfielder michael ballack .
these are some of the names that people had on their list as possible top scorers .
but socceroo john aloisi ?
who 's he , let alone at which club does he earn his keep ?
well , to answer the first question , aloisi has scored four goals against two the confedrations cup favorites , germany and argentina and leads the chase for the golden boot in the tournament .
for those who might make light of the fact that his 21 goals in 34 matches for the roos came against lightweights like the solomon islands or papua new guinea in the oceania confederation now have to eat their words .
the good performance could n't have come at a better time for the 29-year old striker .
that 's how the second question can be answered .
his contract with spanish side osasuna will expire at the end of the month and it wo n't be extended .
so , he 's looking for a new employer .
two premiereship sides have shown interest .
" i could picture myself playing in the bundesliga , " is what he told the sport magazine kicker .
another goal or two in the socceroos ' final match against tunisia would turn enough heads in germany to make that a possibility .
one out of three is bad mexico 's jared borgetti could have been the tragic figure on sunday night against brazil .
despite missing on two of three penalty attempts in the 30th minute , the final one saved by brazilian keeper dida , he shook off the failures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's jared borgetti , partially obscured at rear , was a head taller than the brazilians on his goal on sunday in the 59th minute , he headed in what would be the game winner for the " tri . "
in the process , mexico has turned into a nemesis for the five-time world champions brazil .
starting with the confed cup final in 1999 , which mexico won over the selecao 4-3 , mexico have beaten the brazilian five times , losing only once and drawing once .
this victory has put mexico in the semi-finals while tournament favorite brazil must at least achieve a tie against japan to secure the second group b semi-final spot . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no masterpiece from brazil 's soccer artists mexico provide the first big surprise in the confederations cup by knocking off world champs brazil , 1-0 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 20.06.2005 pleasant player surprises so far großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukas podolski -lrb- 20 -rrb- is one of germany 's rising stars each team in the confederations cup has only played twice , but experts and fans are already talking about which players have shined in the tournament .
now that push is coming to shove , the players will have to step up . inter milan 's star striker adriano was racing alone towards mexican keeper oswaldo sanchez and had the opportunity to put the selecao in the lead .
with only light pressure from behind and sanchez charging from the line , adriano looked for the lower right-hand corner and pushed it just outside the right post .
the shot was not exactly one for the schoolbooks .
at halftime , german television commentator and former national player günter netzer jumped all over one of the world 's best players .
" -lrb- germany 's -rrb- lukas podolski would not have missed that shot , " netzer said on german television .
and it was n't just pure jingoistic banter on his part .
just over two weeks ago podolski scored a similar goal against northern ireland - with a defender pulling on his arm and the goalkeeper much closer to him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to his supporters , lukas podolski is " prince poldi " lukas podolski , only 20 years old , has made his mark in a short time .
last june was his first appearance with the german squad but it was n't until his two-goal performance against thailand last december that he made his breakthrough .
since then , " prince poldi " has accumulated another three goals in five matches .
the fc cologne striker just bubbles over with enthusiasm for the game .
for many a young player , this excitement degenerates into arrogance and a failure to make the right decision at important points in a game .
podolski , however , acts like a seasoned veteran .
on saturday , he made the key pass that led to the foul against michael ballack in the tunisian penalty box , and in turn the go-ahead goal .
minutes later , he fed his close friend sebastian schweinsteiger the pass that put germany up 2-0 , all in his home stadium in cologne .
scoring goals naturally would have been more spectacular , but his assists put jürgen klinsmann 's side through to the semi-finals .
john aloisi top scorer after two matches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia 's john aloisi -lrb- back -rrb- has gone on a scoring rampage .
here , he launches a shot past german defender robert huth adriano and robinho from brazil .
or argentina 's juan roman riquleme .
also host country germany 's midfielder michael ballack .
these are some of the names that people had on their list as possible top scorers .
but socceroo john aloisi ?
who 's he , let alone at which club does he earn his keep ?
well , to answer the first question , aloisi has scored four goals against two the confedrations cup favorites , germany and argentina and leads the chase for the golden boot in the tournament .
for those who might make light of the fact that his 21 goals in 34 matches for the roos came against lightweights like the solomon islands or papua new guinea in the oceania confederation now have to eat their words .
the good performance could n't have come at a better time for the 29-year old striker .
that 's how the second question can be answered .
his contract with spanish side osasuna will expire at the end of the month and it wo n't be extended .
so , he 's looking for a new employer .
two premiereship sides have shown interest .
" i could picture myself playing in the bundesliga , " is what he told the sport magazine kicker .
another goal or two in the socceroos ' final match against tunisia would turn enough heads in germany to make that a possibility .
one out of three is bad mexico 's jared borgetti could have been the tragic figure on sunday night against brazil .
despite missing on two of three penalty attempts in the 30th minute , the final one saved by brazilian keeper dida , he shook off the failures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's jared borgetti , partially obscured at rear , was a head taller than the brazilians on his goal on sunday in the 59th minute , he headed in what would be the game winner for the " tri . "
in the process , mexico has turned into a nemesis for the five-time world champions brazil .
starting with the confed cup final in 1999 , which mexico won over the selecao 4-3 , mexico have beaten the brazilian five times , losing only once and drawing once .
this victory has put mexico in the semi-finals while tournament favorite brazil must at least achieve a tie against japan to secure the second group b semi-final spot . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no masterpiece from brazil 's soccer artists mexico provide the first big surprise in the confederations cup by knocking off world champs brazil , 1-0 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.06.2005 warmer ties to mark eu-us summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not exactly of one mind , but coming closer eu leaders travel to washington on monday for a one-day summit with the united states hosted by president george w. bush .
after years of cool relations , this meeting comes as trans-atlantic ties are warming up . eu leaders , including the president of the european commission , jose manual barroso , and the president of the european council , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , will meet with george w. bush on monday to discuss a variety of issues , including economic growth and integration , the environment and energy issues . the trip to washington for the eu heads might well be a welcome diversion from all the problems they face in brussels , including the recent rejection by french and dutch voters of the eu constitution and the wrangling over the next eu budget .
the same could not have been said for the last eu-us summit in june 2004 , when divisions over the iraq war were still fresh in leaders ' minds as were differences over us policy toward over iran and its nuclear program . but since that time , relations across the atlantic have improved considerably . " the backdrop of this summit is much more positive than the previous one , " gunnar wiegand , the european commission 's top official dealing with the us , said in an interview .
" we have had our occasional differences but now we work together much better . " partners the motto of monday 's summit will be " working together as global partners " and will be attended by bush , barroso , juncker , eu trade commissioner peter mandelson , us secretary of state condoleezza rice and eu foreign policy chief javier solana , among others . there is a lot to talk about and much common ground , particularly on the economic level .
the eu and the us share the largest trade and investment relationship in the world .
in 2003 , some $ 750 billion -lrb- 610 billion euros -rrb- in goods and services flowed across the big pond and foreign direct investment levels reached $ 1.75 trillion in the same year . topics of discussion will also include the promotion of democracy , un reform , development and humanitarian assistance and security issues , such as counterterrorism , and transport and border security . strong differences still there bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guantanamo bay naval base in guantanamo , cuba but monday 's meeting is n't likely to be purely a love fest .
there are still big differences of opinion in many areas , such as the kyoto treaty on climate change , the international criminal court , guantanamo bay -lrb- photo -rrb- and the eu 's decision to lift its arms embargo against china . the row over subsidies for plane manufactures airbus and boeing is also a sore subject .
although even here , there 's more talk of cooperation than conflict .

but the eu 's current crisis is bound to come up for discussion . rumor has it that us president george w. bush is feeling a bit of schadenfreude these days .
after all , " old europe , " which now faces one of its worst crises after eu budget talks failed last week , opposed his plans to go to war in iraq . officially , however , washington is eager to show its commitment and faith in the union on the other side of the atlantic .
preparing monday 's eu-us summit with her european colleagues , us secretary of state condoleezza rice did her best to pamper the sickly 25-nation bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice -lrb- left -rrb- with solana and asselborn during a meeting in luxembourg in february " europe and the european union is alive , " she said after a meeting with luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn , eu foreign policy chief javier solana and eu external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner .
asselborn currently holds the eu presidency . " we understand that europe is going through a difficult phase right now , " rice added .
" but we continue to hope for an outward-looking europe , not an inward-looking one . " some are gleeful despite rice 's statements , others in washington are gleefully watching europe 's agony from the sidelines .
they have not forgotten vocal opposition to the war in iraq , said michael o 'hanlon , a senior fellow in foreign policy studies at the brookings institution in the us capital . " if we look at europe 's deep division over the iraq war , it 's not clear to everyone in the us why a united and strong eu is really necessary , " he told german public broadcaster ndr . bush needs europe while that may be the thinking of the average american , the us leadership does need a united europe , o 'hanlon said .
bush needs the bloc 's help in rebuilding iraq , in pushing for peace in the middle east and in dealing with iran 's nuclear ambitions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush -lrb- left -rrb- with schröder and chirac in evian , france during the g8 summit in june 2003 despite recent trade disputes such as the airbus-boeing row and fights over steel and banana tariffs , the us and eu economies are also closely intertwined .
in short , bush can not afford a weak eu , o 'hanlon said . " he needs europe 's help , " the political scientist added .
" bush leads a country that has lost 1,700 soldiers in iraq , that has spent $ 200 billion -lrb- 163.6 billion euros -rrb- on a war without seeing results .

" the deputy governor has sent someone to the area this morning to secure the release of the hostages , and after having been received and welcomed to the government palace , they have been handed over to the management of their company , " said preye warowei , spokesman for the government of bayelsa state .
the four local and two german employees of bilfinger gas and oil services , were captured at sea on wednesday by ijaw youths complaining that the shell oil company had reneged on a memorandum promising to contribute to local economic development .
warowei said the hostages had " confirmed they have not been maltreated , " and that there was no violence . " they just talk about the psychological trauma they have experienced .
" they were released unconditionally , " he added .
" no ransom was paid . "
according to warowei , the kidnappers said the volatile niger delta region .
activists in the delta have carried out several such kidnappings , accusing the foreign oil companies of polluting the environment of the southern coastal states of nigeria and failing to put wealth back into region .
patterson ogon , head of the ijaw council for human rights , a non-government organization based in the niger delta , said the men were released after " people of good will " stepped in to mediate . dw-world.de politicians demand hostages pay up the 14 european hostages held for nearly six months in the sahara have arrived home , but it 's not just open arms greeting them .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.06.2005 are asylum seekers getting a fair shot ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum seekers fear it : the official german stamp meaning ' expelled ' fewer and fewer refugees are being granted asylum in germany .
human rights groups say this reflects unfair immigration practices rather than improved international conditions . if the official number of refugees in germany was an indication of the state of world conflict , earth would be a very peaceful place indeed .
while germany had 11,000 official asylum seekers in 1998 , in 2004 there were just 2000 .
but a glance at the newspapers shows this is not the case .
crises continue to rage in sudan and iraq ; closer to germany , the political persecution of kurds in turkey and the ongoing conflict in chechnya give hundreds of thousands of people a reason flee their homelands .
' extreme mistrust ' yet just 1.5 percent of the 35,000 people who applied for asylum in germany got it , according to the federal office for migration and refugees .
" there is extreme mistrust and tendency toward refusal on the part of immigration officials , " said bernd mesovic of pro asyl , a nonprofit human rights organization for refugees .
germany is shifting the responsibility for refugees onto other countries , and as a last resort , to the country of origin , his group says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum seeker in germany pro asyl , amnesty international , an association of german magistrates and other organizations have examined how refugees are questioned during their asylum application .
" in cases of doubt , the federal migration office decides against asylum seekers , " said wolfgang grenz , a refugee expert at amnesty international .
he gave the example of a kurdish woman who sought asylum on the basis of allegedly having been tortured in her homeland .
but the application can be denied on the grounds that the torture was n't described in detail .
" in that case , " said grenz , " the official breached his duty by not asking the person to give details . "
personal interview is key the personal interview is the heart of the asylum process .
after they have fled their countries , most applicants have no hard proof of their political oppression ; torturers do n't issue " official torture certificates . "
the decision therefore is usually a subjective one , made by the interviewer who questions the refugee .
is the kurdish woman 's story is true or invented ?
in many cases , it is a difficult call to make .
barbara stolterfoht of the paritätischer wohlfahrtsverband , a leading german social welfare support group , said that officials increasingly assume asylum applicants are not telling the truth and are merely abusing the system .
this assumption can even be subconscious , she said , but either way , it is deadly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people seeking asylum in frankfurt airport .
" the social climate has developed toward being anti-asylum , even though the asylum seekers are just exercising their constitutionally chartered rights , " she said .
according to pro asyl , asylum cases are often seen less as individual situations and are instead standardized to the extent possible .
the group said it frequently sees cases where officials ask questions in order to elicit answers that fit neatly into prearranged categories , rather than dealing with each individual .
" you can be happy when a report caries five or six sentences having to do with the person 's particular situation , " said pro asyl 's mesovic .
fair hearings ?
mesovic also said the person 's country of origin has enormous influence on the outcome of a hearing .
" if officials believe that people are n't tortured in a given country , then that often has more weight than the statement of the refugee who says he or she was tortured , " mesovic said .
the federal migration office denies that is the case .
" the hearings are fair and each applicant has the chance to make detailed statements , and to correct and amplify the statements , " said a spokesperson .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugees in darfur but pro asyl and amnesty say otherwise .
in their experience , the groups have said , applicants are n't informed of contradictions in their statements , and therefore forego their legal right to change their statements .
pro asyl compared notes taken during hearings that resulted in asylum denials and found that many people were turned down when contradictions in their stories made their reasons for seeking asylum less credible .
yet in the transcripts of the hearings , there was no mention of the contradictions .
political decisionmaking ?
thus the asylum seekers did n't know which part of the hearing was important in deciding their case .
pro asyl 's mesovic attributed the practice to a political move .
" the quota of asylum cases that are granted are steered politically , " he said .
" the federal migration office is doing nothing more or less than carrying out the concept of interior minister -lrb- otto -rrb- schily . "

at halftime , german television commentator and former national player günter netzer jumped all over one of the world 's best players .
" -lrb- germany 's -rrb- lukas podolski would not have missed that shot , " netzer said on german television .
and it was n't just pure jingoistic banter on his part .
just over two weeks ago podolski scored a similar goal against northern ireland - with a defender pulling on his arm and the goalkeeper much closer to him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to his supporters , lukas podolski is " prince poldi " lukas podolski , only 20 years old , has made his mark in a short time .
last june was his first appearance with the german squad but it was n't until his two-goal performance against thailand last december that he made his breakthrough .
since then , " prince poldi " has accumulated another three goals in five matches .
the fc cologne striker just bubbles over with enthusiasm for the game .
for many a young player , this excitement degenerates into arrogance and a failure to make the right decision at important points in a game .
podolski , however , acts like a seasoned veteran .
on saturday , he made the key pass that led to the foul against michael ballack in the tunisian penalty box , and in turn the go-ahead goal .
minutes later , he fed his close friend sebastian schweinsteiger the pass that put germany up 2-0 , all in his home stadium in cologne .
scoring goals naturally would have been more spectacular , but his assists put jürgen klinsmann 's side through to the semi-finals .
john aloisi top scorer after two matches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia 's john aloisi -lrb- back -rrb- has gone on a scoring rampage .
here , he launches a shot past german defender robert huth adriano and robinho from brazil .
or argentina 's juan roman riquleme .
also host country germany 's midfielder michael ballack .
these are some of the names that people had on their list as possible top scorers .
but socceroo john aloisi ?
who 's he , let alone at which club does he earn his keep ?
well , to answer the first question , aloisi has scored four goals against two the confedrations cup favorites , germany and argentina and leads the chase for the golden boot in the tournament .
for those who might make light of the fact that his 21 goals in 34 matches for the roos came against lightweights like the solomon islands or papua new guinea in the oceania confederation now have to eat their words .
the good performance could n't have come at a better time for the 29-year old striker .
that 's how the second question can be answered .
his contract with spanish side osasuna will expire at the end of the month and it wo n't be extended .
so , he 's looking for a new employer .
two premiereship sides have shown interest .
" i could picture myself playing in the bundesliga , " is what he told the sport magazine kicker .
another goal or two in the socceroos ' final match against tunisia would turn enough heads in germany to make that a possibility .
one out of three is bad mexico 's jared borgetti could have been the tragic figure on sunday night against brazil .
despite missing on two of three penalty attempts in the 30th minute , the final one saved by brazilian keeper dida , he shook off the failures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's jared borgetti , partially obscured at rear , was a head taller than the brazilians on his goal on sunday in the 59th minute , he headed in what would be the game winner for the " tri . "
in the process , mexico has turned into a nemesis for the five-time world champions brazil .
starting with the confed cup final in 1999 , which mexico won over the selecao 4-3 , mexico have beaten the brazilian five times , losing only once and drawing once .
this victory has put mexico in the semi-finals while tournament favorite brazil must at least achieve a tie against japan to secure the second group b semi-final spot . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no masterpiece from brazil 's soccer artists mexico provide the first big surprise in the confederations cup by knocking off world champs brazil , 1-0 .

after all , " old europe , " which now faces one of its worst crises after eu budget talks failed last week , opposed his plans to go to war in iraq . officially , however , washington is eager to show its commitment and faith in the union on the other side of the atlantic .
preparing monday 's eu-us summit with her european colleagues , us secretary of state condoleezza rice did her best to pamper the sickly 25-nation bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice -lrb- left -rrb- with solana and asselborn during a meeting in luxembourg in february " europe and the european union is alive , " she said after a meeting with luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn , eu foreign policy chief javier solana and eu external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner .
asselborn currently holds the eu presidency . " we understand that europe is going through a difficult phase right now , " rice added .
" but we continue to hope for an outward-looking europe , not an inward-looking one . " some are gleeful despite rice 's statements , others in washington are gleefully watching europe 's agony from the sidelines .
they have not forgotten vocal opposition to the war in iraq , said michael o 'hanlon , a senior fellow in foreign policy studies at the brookings institution in the us capital . " if we look at europe 's deep division over the iraq war , it 's not clear to everyone in the us why a united and strong eu is really necessary , " he told german public broadcaster ndr . bush needs europe while that may be the thinking of the average american , the us leadership does need a united europe , o 'hanlon said .
bush needs the bloc 's help in rebuilding iraq , in pushing for peace in the middle east and in dealing with iran 's nuclear ambitions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush -lrb- left -rrb- with schröder and chirac in evian , france during the g8 summit in june 2003 despite recent trade disputes such as the airbus-boeing row and fights over steel and banana tariffs , the us and eu economies are also closely intertwined .
in short , bush can not afford a weak eu , o 'hanlon said . " he needs europe 's help , " the political scientist added .
" bush leads a country that has lost 1,700 soldiers in iraq , that has spent $ 200 billion -lrb- 163.6 billion euros -rrb- on a war without seeing results .
bush is n't much better off than -lrb- french president -rrb- jacques chirac or -lrb- german chancellor -rrb- gerhard schröder .

at the same time as the environmental group celebrates a historic victory , the event led to a widespread questioning of greenpeace 's credibility .
shortly before shell gave in , greenpeace admitted it had estimated the amount of poisonous oil residues in the platform as being much too high .

the oil concern relented , but the standoff changed greenpeace , shell and the north sea . in the spring of 1995 , the shell oil exploration company and greenpeace were in the midst of a standoff .
shell announced it would sink the brent spar oil platform in the north sea , and greenpeace activists occupied the platform for a full two weeks in protest .
the media and politicians were drawn to the issue .
helmut kohl , germany 's chancellor at the time , came out opposed to the company 's plan .
a widespread call to boycott shell gas stations in germany overrode party lines .
winning the standoff on june 20 , 1995 , shell said it would dispose of the brent spar on land .
but although it took place 10 years ago , the standoff is still fresh in the minds of many who were involved .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a shell worker in an offshore oil platform in the niger delta karsten smid of greenpeace germany remembers the joy he and his colleagues felt when they realized their protests had been successful .
he sees the campaign as a great victory for environmentalists , even if it was only the first battle won in the larger war .
" the real success came three years later , when the ospar conference -lrb- a meeting of the convention for the protection of the marine environment of the north-east atlantic -rrb- passed a general ban against sinking oil platforms .
no oil platforms have been sunk in the north sea since 1995 .
today it is clear that all obsolete platforms are disposed of on land .
so actually , the big success took place in 1998 , " smid said .
since then , a whole new business has sprung up specialized in recycling oil platforms , smid noted happily .
lessons learned however , greenpeace warns , the north sea remains at risk beyond sunken oil platforms .
simply by carrying out its normal production , the oil industry removes 14,000 tons of petroleum each year from this part of the atlantic .
at the same time as the environmental group celebrates a historic victory , the event led to a widespread questioning of greenpeace 's credibility .
shortly before shell gave in , greenpeace admitted it had estimated the amount of poisonous oil residues in the platform as being much too high .
and the group 's believability - its stock in trade - took a big hit with the public , schmid said .
this led to some changes for greenpeace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a norwegian petrolium drilling platform , " troll " " after that , we formed a research department , to test whether the information that we publicized was correct , " said smid .
" measurements have to be made by two independent laboratories , before the information is made public .
in that way , we very much improved our quality control . "
shell , too , learned some lessons from the brent spar debacle .
rainer winzenried , spokesman for shell in germany , said the company learned that sometimes thing that are legal are not necessarily acceptable to the public .
" since then , we have learned to bring new projects into the public sphere for discussion , so we can take public concerns into consideration during the planning phases .
we do this via so-called " shareholder forums , " said winzenried .
from the brent spar debate , the company also learned to take debates to an international level , even if its individual actions take place within one nation 's borders , winzenried said .
shell 's pr problems shortly after the brent spar debacle , shell faced another international debate : over the company 's actions in nigeria .
in november 1995 , the military regime that was then in power in the west african nation executed nine civil rights activists , including novelist ken saro-wiwa , who had denounced the environmental damage the oil industry had wrought on their homeland .
shell 's image took yet another knock .
today , winzenried said , shell has reduced the burning off of excess petrol that is part of the exploration process .
also , the company has changed its relationship to the people who live in oil-exploration regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil refinery on the niger delta " we no longer - to put it rudely - just give communities money in the hope they will stay quiet and leave us alone .
we work with non-governmental agencies to create put lasting development programs into effect . "
greenpeace and nigerian environmental and civil rights groups counter that even 10 years later , little has changed in the niger delta .
what shell hopes to sell as its new policy is above all cosmetic , greenpeace 's smid said .
next stop : russia ?
the company abuses nature not only in africa , but elsewhere as well , said smid .

the four local and two german employees of bilfinger gas and oil services , were captured at sea on wednesday by ijaw youths complaining that the shell oil company had reneged on a memorandum promising to contribute to local economic development .
warowei said the hostages had " confirmed they have not been maltreated , " and that there was no violence . " they just talk about the psychological trauma they have experienced .
" they were released unconditionally , " he added .
" no ransom was paid . "
according to warowei , the kidnappers said the volatile niger delta region .
activists in the delta have carried out several such kidnappings , accusing the foreign oil companies of polluting the environment of the southern coastal states of nigeria and failing to put wealth back into region .
patterson ogon , head of the ijaw council for human rights , a non-government organization based in the niger delta , said the men were released after " people of good will " stepped in to mediate . dw-world.de politicians demand hostages pay up the 14 european hostages held for nearly six months in the sahara have arrived home , but it 's not just open arms greeting them .

he said calls for freer access to germany were utterly wrong . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein " we have not yet come to grips with the wave of immigration in the past decade , " he said .

are they really the same species ?
maybe not , since men and women differ on just about everything except the need to breathe .
a new survey has found out their musical preferences during sex are positively antipodean . the survey , carried out for the german editions of glamour and gq magazines , discovered that the two sexes diverge when it comes to the soundtrack of their lovemaking .
the sonorous strings of mozart during the act and then a little champagne after the deed is done is what 30 percent of women asked would prefer . men , on the other hand , like the sonic landscape around sex to be a little harder .
just under a third , or 31 percent , said they 'd rather hear a little rap music coming out of the loudspeakers to accompany all the moaning and groaning .
after things have calmed down a little , they reported , they could dispense with the bubbly , preferring the classic post-coital cigarette instead . but a sizeable number , 11 percent of both men and women , said they 'd rather chill out during sex , listening to some bob marley and smoking a joint afterwards . men and women did come together over dishonesty about unfaithfulness .
men especially indicated that affairs were to be kept secret .
asked if they would " definitely confess to misconduct " in this area , not one said ' yes ' .
women were n't much more truthful .
only two percent said they would definitely fess up . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de scoring in the soccer love shack next year 's soccer world cup will be a boon to a host of german businesses , not least , the sex trade .

" eurex and ose have signed a memorandum of understanding , in which the two exchanges agreed to explore means of cooperation in order to extend the global reach of both exchanges , " deutsche börse said in a statement .
" under the terms of the memorandum , eurex and ose have agreed to share information with a view to furthering the distribution of financial derivatives in asia and europe . "
the two partners already had a long-standing relationship .
" the memorandum will be an important step towards bringing european and asian market participants closer together and help eurex to extend its reach into the fast growing asian market , " said eurex chairman rudolf ferscha .
ose president and chief executive officer michio yoneda said : " i hope this will present a good picture of the future of our industry with enlarged product lines , increased number of participants and improved accessibility between europe and asia . "
eurex , which is a joint venture between deutsche börse and the zurich stock exchange , generates most of its revenues in europe .

now that push is coming to shove , the players will have to step up . inter milan 's star striker adriano was racing alone towards mexican keeper oswaldo sanchez and had the opportunity to put the selecao in the lead .
with only light pressure from behind and sanchez charging from the line , adriano looked for the lower right-hand corner and pushed it just outside the right post .
the shot was not exactly one for the schoolbooks .
at halftime , german television commentator and former national player günter netzer jumped all over one of the world 's best players .
" -lrb- germany 's -rrb- lukas podolski would not have missed that shot , " netzer said on german television .
and it was n't just pure jingoistic banter on his part .
just over two weeks ago podolski scored a similar goal against northern ireland - with a defender pulling on his arm and the goalkeeper much closer to him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to his supporters , lukas podolski is " prince poldi " lukas podolski , only 20 years old , has made his mark in a short time .
last june was his first appearance with the german squad but it was n't until his two-goal performance against thailand last december that he made his breakthrough .
since then , " prince poldi " has accumulated another three goals in five matches .
the fc cologne striker just bubbles over with enthusiasm for the game .
for many a young player , this excitement degenerates into arrogance and a failure to make the right decision at important points in a game .
podolski , however , acts like a seasoned veteran .
on saturday , he made the key pass that led to the foul against michael ballack in the tunisian penalty box , and in turn the go-ahead goal .
minutes later , he fed his close friend sebastian schweinsteiger the pass that put germany up 2-0 , all in his home stadium in cologne .
scoring goals naturally would have been more spectacular , but his assists put jürgen klinsmann 's side through to the semi-finals .
john aloisi top scorer after two matches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia 's john aloisi -lrb- back -rrb- has gone on a scoring rampage .
here , he launches a shot past german defender robert huth adriano and robinho from brazil .
or argentina 's juan roman riquleme .

" dw-world.de bundesbank deaf to calls for ecb rate cut the current level of interest rates in the 12-country euro zone is no impediment to growth in the region , the bundesbank wrote in its may monthly report , implicitly rejecting recent calls for lower rates .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 20.06.2005 pleasant player surprises so far großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukas podolski -lrb- 20 -rrb- is one of germany 's rising stars each team in the confederations cup has only played twice , but experts and fans are already talking about which players have shined in the tournament .
now that push is coming to shove , the players will have to step up . inter milan 's star striker adriano was racing alone towards mexican keeper oswaldo sanchez and had the opportunity to put the selecao in the lead .
with only light pressure from behind and sanchez charging from the line , adriano looked for the lower right-hand corner and pushed it just outside the right post .
the shot was not exactly one for the schoolbooks .
at halftime , german television commentator and former national player günter netzer jumped all over one of the world 's best players .
" -lrb- germany 's -rrb- lukas podolski would not have missed that shot , " netzer said on german television .
and it was n't just pure jingoistic banter on his part .
just over two weeks ago podolski scored a similar goal against northern ireland - with a defender pulling on his arm and the goalkeeper much closer to him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to his supporters , lukas podolski is " prince poldi " lukas podolski , only 20 years old , has made his mark in a short time .
last june was his first appearance with the german squad but it was n't until his two-goal performance against thailand last december that he made his breakthrough .
since then , " prince poldi " has accumulated another three goals in five matches .
the fc cologne striker just bubbles over with enthusiasm for the game .
for many a young player , this excitement degenerates into arrogance and a failure to make the right decision at important points in a game .
podolski , however , acts like a seasoned veteran .
on saturday , he made the key pass that led to the foul against michael ballack in the tunisian penalty box , and in turn the go-ahead goal .
minutes later , he fed his close friend sebastian schweinsteiger the pass that put germany up 2-0 , all in his home stadium in cologne .
scoring goals naturally would have been more spectacular , but his assists put jürgen klinsmann 's side through to the semi-finals .
john aloisi top scorer after two matches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia 's john aloisi -lrb- back -rrb- has gone on a scoring rampage .
here , he launches a shot past german defender robert huth adriano and robinho from brazil .
or argentina 's juan roman riquleme .
also host country germany 's midfielder michael ballack .
these are some of the names that people had on their list as possible top scorers .
but socceroo john aloisi ?
who 's he , let alone at which club does he earn his keep ?
well , to answer the first question , aloisi has scored four goals against two the confedrations cup favorites , germany and argentina and leads the chase for the golden boot in the tournament .
for those who might make light of the fact that his 21 goals in 34 matches for the roos came against lightweights like the solomon islands or papua new guinea in the oceania confederation now have to eat their words .
the good performance could n't have come at a better time for the 29-year old striker .
that 's how the second question can be answered .
his contract with spanish side osasuna will expire at the end of the month and it wo n't be extended .
so , he 's looking for a new employer .
two premiereship sides have shown interest .
" i could picture myself playing in the bundesliga , " is what he told the sport magazine kicker .
another goal or two in the socceroos ' final match against tunisia would turn enough heads in germany to make that a possibility .
one out of three is bad mexico 's jared borgetti could have been the tragic figure on sunday night against brazil .
despite missing on two of three penalty attempts in the 30th minute , the final one saved by brazilian keeper dida , he shook off the failures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's jared borgetti , partially obscured at rear , was a head taller than the brazilians on his goal on sunday in the 59th minute , he headed in what would be the game winner for the " tri . "
in the process , mexico has turned into a nemesis for the five-time world champions brazil .
starting with the confed cup final in 1999 , which mexico won over the selecao 4-3 , mexico have beaten the brazilian five times , losing only once and drawing once .

now that push is coming to shove , the players will have to step up . inter milan 's star striker adriano was racing alone towards mexican keeper oswaldo sanchez and had the opportunity to put the selecao in the lead .
with only light pressure from behind and sanchez charging from the line , adriano looked for the lower right-hand corner and pushed it just outside the right post .
the shot was not exactly one for the schoolbooks .
at halftime , german television commentator and former national player günter netzer jumped all over one of the world 's best players .
" -lrb- germany 's -rrb- lukas podolski would not have missed that shot , " netzer said on german television .
and it was n't just pure jingoistic banter on his part .
just over two weeks ago podolski scored a similar goal against northern ireland - with a defender pulling on his arm and the goalkeeper much closer to him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to his supporters , lukas podolski is " prince poldi " lukas podolski , only 20 years old , has made his mark in a short time .
last june was his first appearance with the german squad but it was n't until his two-goal performance against thailand last december that he made his breakthrough .
since then , " prince poldi " has accumulated another three goals in five matches .
the fc cologne striker just bubbles over with enthusiasm for the game .
for many a young player , this excitement degenerates into arrogance and a failure to make the right decision at important points in a game .
podolski , however , acts like a seasoned veteran .
on saturday , he made the key pass that led to the foul against michael ballack in the tunisian penalty box , and in turn the go-ahead goal .
minutes later , he fed his close friend sebastian schweinsteiger the pass that put germany up 2-0 , all in his home stadium in cologne .
scoring goals naturally would have been more spectacular , but his assists put jürgen klinsmann 's side through to the semi-finals .
john aloisi top scorer after two matches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia 's john aloisi -lrb- back -rrb- has gone on a scoring rampage .
here , he launches a shot past german defender robert huth adriano and robinho from brazil .
or argentina 's juan roman riquleme .
also host country germany 's midfielder michael ballack .
these are some of the names that people had on their list as possible top scorers .
but socceroo john aloisi ?
who 's he , let alone at which club does he earn his keep ?
well , to answer the first question , aloisi has scored four goals against two the confedrations cup favorites , germany and argentina and leads the chase for the golden boot in the tournament .
for those who might make light of the fact that his 21 goals in 34 matches for the roos came against lightweights like the solomon islands or papua new guinea in the oceania confederation now have to eat their words .
the good performance could n't have come at a better time for the 29-year old striker .
that 's how the second question can be answered .
his contract with spanish side osasuna will expire at the end of the month and it wo n't be extended .
so , he 's looking for a new employer .
two premiereship sides have shown interest .
" i could picture myself playing in the bundesliga , " is what he told the sport magazine kicker .
another goal or two in the socceroos ' final match against tunisia would turn enough heads in germany to make that a possibility .
one out of three is bad mexico 's jared borgetti could have been the tragic figure on sunday night against brazil .
despite missing on two of three penalty attempts in the 30th minute , the final one saved by brazilian keeper dida , he shook off the failures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's jared borgetti , partially obscured at rear , was a head taller than the brazilians on his goal on sunday in the 59th minute , he headed in what would be the game winner for the " tri . "
in the process , mexico has turned into a nemesis for the five-time world champions brazil .
starting with the confed cup final in 1999 , which mexico won over the selecao 4-3 , mexico have beaten the brazilian five times , losing only once and drawing once .
this victory has put mexico in the semi-finals while tournament favorite brazil must at least achieve a tie against japan to secure the second group b semi-final spot . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no masterpiece from brazil 's soccer artists mexico provide the first big surprise in the confederations cup by knocking off world champs brazil , 1-0 .

but the eu 's current crisis is bound to come up for discussion . rumor has it that us president george w. bush is feeling a bit of schadenfreude these days .
after all , " old europe , " which now faces one of its worst crises after eu budget talks failed last week , opposed his plans to go to war in iraq . officially , however , washington is eager to show its commitment and faith in the union on the other side of the atlantic .
preparing monday 's eu-us summit with her european colleagues , us secretary of state condoleezza rice did her best to pamper the sickly 25-nation bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice -lrb- left -rrb- with solana and asselborn during a meeting in luxembourg in february " europe and the european union is alive , " she said after a meeting with luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn , eu foreign policy chief javier solana and eu external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner .
asselborn currently holds the eu presidency . " we understand that europe is going through a difficult phase right now , " rice added .
" but we continue to hope for an outward-looking europe , not an inward-looking one . " some are gleeful despite rice 's statements , others in washington are gleefully watching europe 's agony from the sidelines .
they have not forgotten vocal opposition to the war in iraq , said michael o 'hanlon , a senior fellow in foreign policy studies at the brookings institution in the us capital . " if we look at europe 's deep division over the iraq war , it 's not clear to everyone in the us why a united and strong eu is really necessary , " he told german public broadcaster ndr . bush needs europe while that may be the thinking of the average american , the us leadership does need a united europe , o 'hanlon said .
bush needs the bloc 's help in rebuilding iraq , in pushing for peace in the middle east and in dealing with iran 's nuclear ambitions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush -lrb- left -rrb- with schröder and chirac in evian , france during the g8 summit in june 2003 despite recent trade disputes such as the airbus-boeing row and fights over steel and banana tariffs , the us and eu economies are also closely intertwined .
in short , bush can not afford a weak eu , o 'hanlon said . " he needs europe 's help , " the political scientist added .
" bush leads a country that has lost 1,700 soldiers in iraq , that has spent $ 200 billion -lrb- 163.6 billion euros -rrb- on a war without seeing results .
bush is n't much better off than -lrb- french president -rrb- jacques chirac or -lrb- german chancellor -rrb- gerhard schröder .

but the eu 's current crisis is bound to come up for discussion . rumor has it that us president george w. bush is feeling a bit of schadenfreude these days .
after all , " old europe , " which now faces one of its worst crises after eu budget talks failed last week , opposed his plans to go to war in iraq . officially , however , washington is eager to show its commitment and faith in the union on the other side of the atlantic .
preparing monday 's eu-us summit with her european colleagues , us secretary of state condoleezza rice did her best to pamper the sickly 25-nation bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice -lrb- left -rrb- with solana and asselborn during a meeting in luxembourg in february " europe and the european union is alive , " she said after a meeting with luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn , eu foreign policy chief javier solana and eu external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner .
asselborn currently holds the eu presidency . " we understand that europe is going through a difficult phase right now , " rice added .
" but we continue to hope for an outward-looking europe , not an inward-looking one . " some are gleeful despite rice 's statements , others in washington are gleefully watching europe 's agony from the sidelines .
they have not forgotten vocal opposition to the war in iraq , said michael o 'hanlon , a senior fellow in foreign policy studies at the brookings institution in the us capital . " if we look at europe 's deep division over the iraq war , it 's not clear to everyone in the us why a united and strong eu is really necessary , " he told german public broadcaster ndr . bush needs europe while that may be the thinking of the average american , the us leadership does need a united europe , o 'hanlon said .
bush needs the bloc 's help in rebuilding iraq , in pushing for peace in the middle east and in dealing with iran 's nuclear ambitions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush -lrb- left -rrb- with schröder and chirac in evian , france during the g8 summit in june 2003 despite recent trade disputes such as the airbus-boeing row and fights over steel and banana tariffs , the us and eu economies are also closely intertwined .
in short , bush can not afford a weak eu , o 'hanlon said . " he needs europe 's help , " the political scientist added .
" bush leads a country that has lost 1,700 soldiers in iraq , that has spent $ 200 billion -lrb- 163.6 billion euros -rrb- on a war without seeing results .
bush is n't much better off than -lrb- french president -rrb- jacques chirac or -lrb- german chancellor -rrb- gerhard schröder .

now that push is coming to shove , the players will have to step up . inter milan 's star striker adriano was racing alone towards mexican keeper oswaldo sanchez and had the opportunity to put the selecao in the lead .
with only light pressure from behind and sanchez charging from the line , adriano looked for the lower right-hand corner and pushed it just outside the right post .
the shot was not exactly one for the schoolbooks .
at halftime , german television commentator and former national player günter netzer jumped all over one of the world 's best players .
" -lrb- germany 's -rrb- lukas podolski would not have missed that shot , " netzer said on german television .
and it was n't just pure jingoistic banter on his part .
just over two weeks ago podolski scored a similar goal against northern ireland - with a defender pulling on his arm and the goalkeeper much closer to him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to his supporters , lukas podolski is " prince poldi " lukas podolski , only 20 years old , has made his mark in a short time .
last june was his first appearance with the german squad but it was n't until his two-goal performance against thailand last december that he made his breakthrough .
since then , " prince poldi " has accumulated another three goals in five matches .
the fc cologne striker just bubbles over with enthusiasm for the game .
for many a young player , this excitement degenerates into arrogance and a failure to make the right decision at important points in a game .
podolski , however , acts like a seasoned veteran .
on saturday , he made the key pass that led to the foul against michael ballack in the tunisian penalty box , and in turn the go-ahead goal .
minutes later , he fed his close friend sebastian schweinsteiger the pass that put germany up 2-0 , all in his home stadium in cologne .
scoring goals naturally would have been more spectacular , but his assists put jürgen klinsmann 's side through to the semi-finals .
john aloisi top scorer after two matches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia 's john aloisi -lrb- back -rrb- has gone on a scoring rampage .
here , he launches a shot past german defender robert huth adriano and robinho from brazil .
or argentina 's juan roman riquleme .
also host country germany 's midfielder michael ballack .
these are some of the names that people had on their list as possible top scorers .
but socceroo john aloisi ?
who 's he , let alone at which club does he earn his keep ?
well , to answer the first question , aloisi has scored four goals against two the confedrations cup favorites , germany and argentina and leads the chase for the golden boot in the tournament .
for those who might make light of the fact that his 21 goals in 34 matches for the roos came against lightweights like the solomon islands or papua new guinea in the oceania confederation now have to eat their words .
the good performance could n't have come at a better time for the 29-year old striker .
that 's how the second question can be answered .
his contract with spanish side osasuna will expire at the end of the month and it wo n't be extended .
so , he 's looking for a new employer .
two premiereship sides have shown interest .
" i could picture myself playing in the bundesliga , " is what he told the sport magazine kicker .
another goal or two in the socceroos ' final match against tunisia would turn enough heads in germany to make that a possibility .
one out of three is bad mexico 's jared borgetti could have been the tragic figure on sunday night against brazil .
despite missing on two of three penalty attempts in the 30th minute , the final one saved by brazilian keeper dida , he shook off the failures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's jared borgetti , partially obscured at rear , was a head taller than the brazilians on his goal on sunday in the 59th minute , he headed in what would be the game winner for the " tri . "
in the process , mexico has turned into a nemesis for the five-time world champions brazil .
starting with the confed cup final in 1999 , which mexico won over the selecao 4-3 , mexico have beaten the brazilian five times , losing only once and drawing once .
this victory has put mexico in the semi-finals while tournament favorite brazil must at least achieve a tie against japan to secure the second group b semi-final spot . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no masterpiece from brazil 's soccer artists mexico provide the first big surprise in the confederations cup by knocking off world champs brazil , 1-0 .

the oil concern relented , but the standoff changed greenpeace , shell and the north sea . in the spring of 1995 , the shell oil exploration company and greenpeace were in the midst of a standoff .
shell announced it would sink the brent spar oil platform in the north sea , and greenpeace activists occupied the platform for a full two weeks in protest .
the media and politicians were drawn to the issue .
helmut kohl , germany 's chancellor at the time , came out opposed to the company 's plan .
a widespread call to boycott shell gas stations in germany overrode party lines .
winning the standoff on june 20 , 1995 , shell said it would dispose of the brent spar on land .
but although it took place 10 years ago , the standoff is still fresh in the minds of many who were involved .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a shell worker in an offshore oil platform in the niger delta karsten smid of greenpeace germany remembers the joy he and his colleagues felt when they realized their protests had been successful .
he sees the campaign as a great victory for environmentalists , even if it was only the first battle won in the larger war .
" the real success came three years later , when the ospar conference -lrb- a meeting of the convention for the protection of the marine environment of the north-east atlantic -rrb- passed a general ban against sinking oil platforms .
no oil platforms have been sunk in the north sea since 1995 .
today it is clear that all obsolete platforms are disposed of on land .
so actually , the big success took place in 1998 , " smid said .
since then , a whole new business has sprung up specialized in recycling oil platforms , smid noted happily .
lessons learned however , greenpeace warns , the north sea remains at risk beyond sunken oil platforms .
simply by carrying out its normal production , the oil industry removes 14,000 tons of petroleum each year from this part of the atlantic .
at the same time as the environmental group celebrates a historic victory , the event led to a widespread questioning of greenpeace 's credibility .
shortly before shell gave in , greenpeace admitted it had estimated the amount of poisonous oil residues in the platform as being much too high .
and the group 's believability - its stock in trade - took a big hit with the public , schmid said .
this led to some changes for greenpeace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a norwegian petrolium drilling platform , " troll " " after that , we formed a research department , to test whether the information that we publicized was correct , " said smid .
" measurements have to be made by two independent laboratories , before the information is made public .
in that way , we very much improved our quality control . "
shell , too , learned some lessons from the brent spar debacle .
rainer winzenried , spokesman for shell in germany , said the company learned that sometimes thing that are legal are not necessarily acceptable to the public .

now that push is coming to shove , the players will have to step up . inter milan 's star striker adriano was racing alone towards mexican keeper oswaldo sanchez and had the opportunity to put the selecao in the lead .
with only light pressure from behind and sanchez charging from the line , adriano looked for the lower right-hand corner and pushed it just outside the right post .
the shot was not exactly one for the schoolbooks .
at halftime , german television commentator and former national player günter netzer jumped all over one of the world 's best players .
" -lrb- germany 's -rrb- lukas podolski would not have missed that shot , " netzer said on german television .
and it was n't just pure jingoistic banter on his part .
just over two weeks ago podolski scored a similar goal against northern ireland - with a defender pulling on his arm and the goalkeeper much closer to him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to his supporters , lukas podolski is " prince poldi " lukas podolski , only 20 years old , has made his mark in a short time .
last june was his first appearance with the german squad but it was n't until his two-goal performance against thailand last december that he made his breakthrough .
since then , " prince poldi " has accumulated another three goals in five matches .
the fc cologne striker just bubbles over with enthusiasm for the game .
for many a young player , this excitement degenerates into arrogance and a failure to make the right decision at important points in a game .
podolski , however , acts like a seasoned veteran .
on saturday , he made the key pass that led to the foul against michael ballack in the tunisian penalty box , and in turn the go-ahead goal .
minutes later , he fed his close friend sebastian schweinsteiger the pass that put germany up 2-0 , all in his home stadium in cologne .
scoring goals naturally would have been more spectacular , but his assists put jürgen klinsmann 's side through to the semi-finals .
john aloisi top scorer after two matches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia 's john aloisi -lrb- back -rrb- has gone on a scoring rampage .
here , he launches a shot past german defender robert huth adriano and robinho from brazil .
or argentina 's juan roman riquleme .
also host country germany 's midfielder michael ballack .
these are some of the names that people had on their list as possible top scorers .
but socceroo john aloisi ?
who 's he , let alone at which club does he earn his keep ?
well , to answer the first question , aloisi has scored four goals against two the confedrations cup favorites , germany and argentina and leads the chase for the golden boot in the tournament .
for those who might make light of the fact that his 21 goals in 34 matches for the roos came against lightweights like the solomon islands or papua new guinea in the oceania confederation now have to eat their words .
the good performance could n't have come at a better time for the 29-year old striker .
that 's how the second question can be answered .
his contract with spanish side osasuna will expire at the end of the month and it wo n't be extended .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's jared borgetti , partially obscured at rear , was a head taller than the brazilians on his goal on sunday in the 59th minute , he headed in what would be the game winner for the " tri . "
in the process , mexico has turned into a nemesis for the five-time world champions brazil .
starting with the confed cup final in 1999 , which mexico won over the selecao 4-3 , mexico have beaten the brazilian five times , losing only once and drawing once .
this victory has put mexico in the semi-finals while tournament favorite brazil must at least achieve a tie against japan to secure the second group b semi-final spot . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no masterpiece from brazil 's soccer artists mexico provide the first big surprise in the confederations cup by knocking off world champs brazil , 1-0 .

since september 2000 six turks and a greek have been murdered with the same handgun , a czech-made 7.65 mm ceska pistol , in nuremberg and munich in the south of the country , in hamburg in the north and rostock in the northeast .
in each case the victims were shot in the head .
they were a florist , two fruit and vegetable sellers , two turkish snack-bar staff , a locksmith and a tailor .
the cyclists were seen on june 9 in nuremberg shortly before the killing of the owner of a turkish snack bar .
they were aged between 20 and 30 , looked " very much like each other , " had short hair and were between 1.85 meters and 1.95 meters -lrb- six feet to six and a half feet -rrb- tall , police said .
the last killing took place in munich when the greek owner of a locksmith 's shop was gunned down .
witnesses saw a man with a dark-colored backpack , police said .
" that 's why the news from nuremberg so interests us , " a spokesman said .
munich police published an artist 's impression of a man aged about 30 and offered a reward of 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 30,000 -rrb- for information leading to the solution of the crimes .
in 1995 the owner of a small business in bad salzungen in eastern germany was killed with the same weapon , according to a nuremberg newspaper .

after years of cool relations , this meeting comes as trans-atlantic ties are warming up . eu leaders , including the president of the european commission , jose manual barroso , and the president of the european council , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , will meet with george w. bush on monday to discuss a variety of issues , including economic growth and integration , the environment and energy issues . the trip to washington for the eu heads might well be a welcome diversion from all the problems they face in brussels , including the recent rejection by french and dutch voters of the eu constitution and the wrangling over the next eu budget .
the same could not have been said for the last eu-us summit in june 2004 , when divisions over the iraq war were still fresh in leaders ' minds as were differences over us policy toward over iran and its nuclear program . but since that time , relations across the atlantic have improved considerably . " the backdrop of this summit is much more positive than the previous one , " gunnar wiegand , the european commission 's top official dealing with the us , said in an interview .
" we have had our occasional differences but now we work together much better . " partners the motto of monday 's summit will be " working together as global partners " and will be attended by bush , barroso , juncker , eu trade commissioner peter mandelson , us secretary of state condoleezza rice and eu foreign policy chief javier solana , among others . there is a lot to talk about and much common ground , particularly on the economic level .
the eu and the us share the largest trade and investment relationship in the world .
in 2003 , some $ 750 billion -lrb- 610 billion euros -rrb- in goods and services flowed across the big pond and foreign direct investment levels reached $ 1.75 trillion in the same year . topics of discussion will also include the promotion of democracy , un reform , development and humanitarian assistance and security issues , such as counterterrorism , and transport and border security . strong differences still there bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guantanamo bay naval base in guantanamo , cuba but monday 's meeting is n't likely to be purely a love fest .
there are still big differences of opinion in many areas , such as the kyoto treaty on climate change , the international criminal court , guantanamo bay -lrb- photo -rrb- and the eu 's decision to lift its arms embargo against china . the row over subsidies for plane manufactures airbus and boeing is also a sore subject .
although even here , there 's more talk of cooperation than conflict .
both sides announced on friday that thay will hold new talks in a bid to end the subsidies battle . " talks will continue .
my doors are open , " us trade representative rob portman said after a meeting with his eu counterpart , peter mandelson . but stephanie henning , a fellow at the brussels office of the german marshall fund of the united states , admitted that while eu-us relations have improved the bush administration has not undergone a 180-degree turn regarding europe . " bush may have learned some lessons from iraq , but ultimately he will continue to make decisions according to america 's best interests , " she told upi . however , she added that both sides needed a successful summit after bush 's charm offensive in europe during a visit to brussels in february and europe 's recent turmoil over the constitution . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us , eu on collision course over china two senior members of the united states congress warned the european union this week that the lifting of the 15-year arms embargo on china could result in a halt of us sales in military technology to the eu .

after years of cool relations , this meeting comes as trans-atlantic ties are warming up . eu leaders , including the president of the european commission , jose manual barroso , and the president of the european council , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , will meet with george w. bush on monday to discuss a variety of issues , including economic growth and integration , the environment and energy issues . the trip to washington for the eu heads might well be a welcome diversion from all the problems they face in brussels , including the recent rejection by french and dutch voters of the eu constitution and the wrangling over the next eu budget .
the same could not have been said for the last eu-us summit in june 2004 , when divisions over the iraq war were still fresh in leaders ' minds as were differences over us policy toward over iran and its nuclear program . but since that time , relations across the atlantic have improved considerably . " the backdrop of this summit is much more positive than the previous one , " gunnar wiegand , the european commission 's top official dealing with the us , said in an interview .
" we have had our occasional differences but now we work together much better . " partners the motto of monday 's summit will be " working together as global partners " and will be attended by bush , barroso , juncker , eu trade commissioner peter mandelson , us secretary of state condoleezza rice and eu foreign policy chief javier solana , among others . there is a lot to talk about and much common ground , particularly on the economic level .

human rights groups say this reflects unfair immigration practices rather than improved international conditions . if the official number of refugees in germany was an indication of the state of world conflict , earth would be a very peaceful place indeed .
while germany had 11,000 official asylum seekers in 1998 , in 2004 there were just 2000 .
but a glance at the newspapers shows this is not the case .
crises continue to rage in sudan and iraq ; closer to germany , the political persecution of kurds in turkey and the ongoing conflict in chechnya give hundreds of thousands of people a reason flee their homelands .
' extreme mistrust ' yet just 1.5 percent of the 35,000 people who applied for asylum in germany got it , according to the federal office for migration and refugees .
" there is extreme mistrust and tendency toward refusal on the part of immigration officials , " said bernd mesovic of pro asyl , a nonprofit human rights organization for refugees .
germany is shifting the responsibility for refugees onto other countries , and as a last resort , to the country of origin , his group says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum seeker in germany pro asyl , amnesty international , an association of german magistrates and other organizations have examined how refugees are questioned during their asylum application .
" in cases of doubt , the federal migration office decides against asylum seekers , " said wolfgang grenz , a refugee expert at amnesty international .
he gave the example of a kurdish woman who sought asylum on the basis of allegedly having been tortured in her homeland .
but the application can be denied on the grounds that the torture was n't described in detail .
" in that case , " said grenz , " the official breached his duty by not asking the person to give details . "
personal interview is key the personal interview is the heart of the asylum process .
after they have fled their countries , most applicants have no hard proof of their political oppression ; torturers do n't issue " official torture certificates . "
the decision therefore is usually a subjective one , made by the interviewer who questions the refugee .
is the kurdish woman 's story is true or invented ?
in many cases , it is a difficult call to make .
barbara stolterfoht of the paritätischer wohlfahrtsverband , a leading german social welfare support group , said that officials increasingly assume asylum applicants are not telling the truth and are merely abusing the system .
this assumption can even be subconscious , she said , but either way , it is deadly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people seeking asylum in frankfurt airport .
" the social climate has developed toward being anti-asylum , even though the asylum seekers are just exercising their constitutionally chartered rights , " she said .
according to pro asyl , asylum cases are often seen less as individual situations and are instead standardized to the extent possible .
the group said it frequently sees cases where officials ask questions in order to elicit answers that fit neatly into prearranged categories , rather than dealing with each individual .
" you can be happy when a report caries five or six sentences having to do with the person 's particular situation , " said pro asyl 's mesovic .
fair hearings ?
mesovic also said the person 's country of origin has enormous influence on the outcome of a hearing .
" if officials believe that people are n't tortured in a given country , then that often has more weight than the statement of the refugee who says he or she was tortured , " mesovic said .
the federal migration office denies that is the case .
" the hearings are fair and each applicant has the chance to make detailed statements , and to correct and amplify the statements , " said a spokesperson .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugees in darfur but pro asyl and amnesty say otherwise .
in their experience , the groups have said , applicants are n't informed of contradictions in their statements , and therefore forego their legal right to change their statements .
pro asyl compared notes taken during hearings that resulted in asylum denials and found that many people were turned down when contradictions in their stories made their reasons for seeking asylum less credible .
yet in the transcripts of the hearings , there was no mention of the contradictions .
political decisionmaking ?
thus the asylum seekers did n't know which part of the hearing was important in deciding their case .
pro asyl 's mesovic attributed the practice to a political move .
" the quota of asylum cases that are granted are steered politically , " he said .
" the federal migration office is doing nothing more or less than carrying out the concept of interior minister -lrb- otto -rrb- schily . "
for his part , schily has said he hopes to move the asylum process at least in part to refugee camps in north africa . manfred götzke -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu approves refugee camp pilot schemes after debating proposals put forward by germany 's otto schily , the european commission has agreed to set up pilot schemes in five north african countries to cope with the influx of refugees heading to europe .

barbara stolterfoht of the paritätischer wohlfahrtsverband , a leading german social welfare support group , said that officials increasingly assume asylum applicants are not telling the truth and are merely abusing the system .
this assumption can even be subconscious , she said , but either way , it is deadly .

" the social climate has developed toward being anti-asylum , even though the asylum seekers are just exercising their constitutionally chartered rights , " she said .
according to pro asyl , asylum cases are often seen less as individual situations and are instead standardized to the extent possible .
the group said it frequently sees cases where officials ask questions in order to elicit answers that fit neatly into prearranged categories , rather than dealing with each individual .
" you can be happy when a report caries five or six sentences having to do with the person 's particular situation , " said pro asyl 's mesovic .
fair hearings ?
mesovic also said the person 's country of origin has enormous influence on the outcome of a hearing .
" if officials believe that people are n't tortured in a given country , then that often has more weight than the statement of the refugee who says he or she was tortured , " mesovic said .
the federal migration office denies that is the case .
" the hearings are fair and each applicant has the chance to make detailed statements , and to correct and amplify the statements , " said a spokesperson .

in their experience , the groups have said , applicants are n't informed of contradictions in their statements , and therefore forego their legal right to change their statements .
pro asyl compared notes taken during hearings that resulted in asylum denials and found that many people were turned down when contradictions in their stories made their reasons for seeking asylum less credible .
yet in the transcripts of the hearings , there was no mention of the contradictions .
political decisionmaking ?
thus the asylum seekers did n't know which part of the hearing was important in deciding their case .
pro asyl 's mesovic attributed the practice to a political move .
" the quota of asylum cases that are granted are steered politically , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.06.2005 are asylum seekers getting a fair shot ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum seekers fear it : the official german stamp meaning ' expelled ' fewer and fewer refugees are being granted asylum in germany .
human rights groups say this reflects unfair immigration practices rather than improved international conditions . if the official number of refugees in germany was an indication of the state of world conflict , earth would be a very peaceful place indeed .
while germany had 11,000 official asylum seekers in 1998 , in 2004 there were just 2000 .
but a glance at the newspapers shows this is not the case .
crises continue to rage in sudan and iraq ; closer to germany , the political persecution of kurds in turkey and the ongoing conflict in chechnya give hundreds of thousands of people a reason flee their homelands .
' extreme mistrust ' yet just 1.5 percent of the 35,000 people who applied for asylum in germany got it , according to the federal office for migration and refugees .
" there is extreme mistrust and tendency toward refusal on the part of immigration officials , " said bernd mesovic of pro asyl , a nonprofit human rights organization for refugees .
germany is shifting the responsibility for refugees onto other countries , and as a last resort , to the country of origin , his group says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum seeker in germany pro asyl , amnesty international , an association of german magistrates and other organizations have examined how refugees are questioned during their asylum application .
" in cases of doubt , the federal migration office decides against asylum seekers , " said wolfgang grenz , a refugee expert at amnesty international .
he gave the example of a kurdish woman who sought asylum on the basis of allegedly having been tortured in her homeland .
but the application can be denied on the grounds that the torture was n't described in detail .
" in that case , " said grenz , " the official breached his duty by not asking the person to give details . "
personal interview is key the personal interview is the heart of the asylum process .
after they have fled their countries , most applicants have no hard proof of their political oppression ; torturers do n't issue " official torture certificates . "
the decision therefore is usually a subjective one , made by the interviewer who questions the refugee .
is the kurdish woman 's story is true or invented ?
in many cases , it is a difficult call to make .
barbara stolterfoht of the paritätischer wohlfahrtsverband , a leading german social welfare support group , said that officials increasingly assume asylum applicants are not telling the truth and are merely abusing the system .
this assumption can even be subconscious , she said , but either way , it is deadly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people seeking asylum in frankfurt airport .
" the social climate has developed toward being anti-asylum , even though the asylum seekers are just exercising their constitutionally chartered rights , " she said .
according to pro asyl , asylum cases are often seen less as individual situations and are instead standardized to the extent possible .
the group said it frequently sees cases where officials ask questions in order to elicit answers that fit neatly into prearranged categories , rather than dealing with each individual .
" you can be happy when a report caries five or six sentences having to do with the person 's particular situation , " said pro asyl 's mesovic .
fair hearings ?
mesovic also said the person 's country of origin has enormous influence on the outcome of a hearing .
" if officials believe that people are n't tortured in a given country , then that often has more weight than the statement of the refugee who says he or she was tortured , " mesovic said .
the federal migration office denies that is the case .
" the hearings are fair and each applicant has the chance to make detailed statements , and to correct and amplify the statements , " said a spokesperson .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugees in darfur but pro asyl and amnesty say otherwise .
in their experience , the groups have said , applicants are n't informed of contradictions in their statements , and therefore forego their legal right to change their statements .
pro asyl compared notes taken during hearings that resulted in asylum denials and found that many people were turned down when contradictions in their stories made their reasons for seeking asylum less credible .
yet in the transcripts of the hearings , there was no mention of the contradictions .

the oil concern relented , but the standoff changed greenpeace , shell and the north sea . in the spring of 1995 , the shell oil exploration company and greenpeace were in the midst of a standoff .
shell announced it would sink the brent spar oil platform in the north sea , and greenpeace activists occupied the platform for a full two weeks in protest .
the media and politicians were drawn to the issue .
helmut kohl , germany 's chancellor at the time , came out opposed to the company 's plan .
a widespread call to boycott shell gas stations in germany overrode party lines .
winning the standoff on june 20 , 1995 , shell said it would dispose of the brent spar on land .
but although it took place 10 years ago , the standoff is still fresh in the minds of many who were involved .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a shell worker in an offshore oil platform in the niger delta karsten smid of greenpeace germany remembers the joy he and his colleagues felt when they realized their protests had been successful .
he sees the campaign as a great victory for environmentalists , even if it was only the first battle won in the larger war .
" the real success came three years later , when the ospar conference -lrb- a meeting of the convention for the protection of the marine environment of the north-east atlantic -rrb- passed a general ban against sinking oil platforms .
no oil platforms have been sunk in the north sea since 1995 .
today it is clear that all obsolete platforms are disposed of on land .
so actually , the big success took place in 1998 , " smid said .
since then , a whole new business has sprung up specialized in recycling oil platforms , smid noted happily .
lessons learned however , greenpeace warns , the north sea remains at risk beyond sunken oil platforms .
simply by carrying out its normal production , the oil industry removes 14,000 tons of petroleum each year from this part of the atlantic .
at the same time as the environmental group celebrates a historic victory , the event led to a widespread questioning of greenpeace 's credibility .
shortly before shell gave in , greenpeace admitted it had estimated the amount of poisonous oil residues in the platform as being much too high .
and the group 's believability - its stock in trade - took a big hit with the public , schmid said .
this led to some changes for greenpeace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a norwegian petrolium drilling platform , " troll " " after that , we formed a research department , to test whether the information that we publicized was correct , " said smid .
" measurements have to be made by two independent laboratories , before the information is made public .
in that way , we very much improved our quality control . "
shell , too , learned some lessons from the brent spar debacle .
rainer winzenried , spokesman for shell in germany , said the company learned that sometimes thing that are legal are not necessarily acceptable to the public .
" since then , we have learned to bring new projects into the public sphere for discussion , so we can take public concerns into consideration during the planning phases .
we do this via so-called " shareholder forums , " said winzenried .
from the brent spar debate , the company also learned to take debates to an international level , even if its individual actions take place within one nation 's borders , winzenried said .
shell 's pr problems shortly after the brent spar debacle , shell faced another international debate : over the company 's actions in nigeria .
in november 1995 , the military regime that was then in power in the west african nation executed nine civil rights activists , including novelist ken saro-wiwa , who had denounced the environmental damage the oil industry had wrought on their homeland .
shell 's image took yet another knock .
today , winzenried said , shell has reduced the burning off of excess petrol that is part of the exploration process .
also , the company has changed its relationship to the people who live in oil-exploration regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil refinery on the niger delta " we no longer - to put it rudely - just give communities money in the hope they will stay quiet and leave us alone .
we work with non-governmental agencies to create put lasting development programs into effect . "
greenpeace and nigerian environmental and civil rights groups counter that even 10 years later , little has changed in the niger delta .
what shell hopes to sell as its new policy is above all cosmetic , greenpeace 's smid said .
next stop : russia ?
the company abuses nature not only in africa , but elsewhere as well , said smid .
greenpeace and shell 's latest battle is over an oil exploration project near sachalin island , off the russian coast in the northern pacific .
shell is endangering the feeding grounds of a rare species of grey whale , smid said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.06.2005 german media under fire from muslims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does the german media serve up stereotypes ?
the media in germany is often accused , not least by muslims in the country , of being one-sided and clichéd when it comes to reporting on them .
journalists deny it , saying discernment and responsibility are important . not only muslims living in germany , but also cultural experts routinely criticize the german media for reinforcing stereotypes and being too subjective in its reporting of muslim topics . a look at the german media certainly lends some credence to the allegations .
for instance , the newsmagazine focus ran a headline on its cover recently which referred to " unsettling guests . " the story was about muslims of turkish origin living in germany - people who , in reality , have been living in germany for decades and have long ceased being " guests . "
nonetheless , the word " unsettling " presented them collectively as a threat to german society . the facts , no matter how unpleasant however , representatives of the german media have defended themselves against the allegations , insisting that they ca n't be applied across the board to all publications .
jörg lau , a reporter at the respected intellectual weekly die zeit , also found focus ' choice of words " scandalous , " but he insisted that the media could n't just ignore real problems in the country . " it 's the media 's job to call things - which they see as wrong - by what they are , even when it 's viewed as unpleasant by others , " lau said .
" that also applies when people feel discriminated through it . " many muslims in germany feel discriminated against because news stories featuring muslims usually spark an avalanche of stories in the german media which anchor a negative image of their culture in the public consciousness .
the recent case of an alleged honor killing in berlin involving a young turkish woman was such an example . despite balanced reporting by individual journalists on topics such as honor killings or forced marriages , readers are often left with the impression that the entire muslim community is abusive toward women . provocative headlines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spiegel cover on conspiracy theories surrounding the 9-11 terror attacks .
the issue has taken on an added urgency in the aftermath of the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the us , as articles on muslims and islam appear more frequently in the media . jörg lau admitted that not every newspaper and radio or television channel was objective in its reporting , but underlined the importance of considering the source .
for instance , the headline " allah 's daughters without rights " - which ran on the cover of the esteemed newsmagazine spiegel to address the problems faced by turkish women in germany - was perfectly acceptable , said lau . that did n't keep many muslims in germany from being angered by it though . " i did n't find the headline wrong or misleading , after all , the story was about the rights of the affected women , " lau said .
" however the focus headline " unsettling guests " was demagogy - that should be criticized .
there , the german media should be careful and self-critical . " joachim kandel , an expert on islam at the friedrich ebert foundation said that baiting readers with provocative headlines or top stories was part of the german media culture and was n't just confined to islamic topics . " such sentences are provocative but other topics and other minorities are reported on with equally provocative leads , " kandel said . " but when you read the article in full then you conclude that it usually contains balanced arguments . " at the same time , kandel said that the media has to be allowed to air uncomfortable facts .
" we also have a problem with how muslims want to define their lifestyles based on the koran and the sunna -lrb- islamic practices -rrb- when it comes to human rights , democracy , pluralism .
those are serious questions that must be discussed . " responsible or not ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalist lau pointed out that the debate reflected changing realities in germany , adding that people here had ignored for too long the fact that migrants from muslim countries such as turkey would stay permanently in germany . " people are really unnerved , but not because the others are perhaps ' unsettling ' but because people are in a new situation , " lau said . " germany is a country of immigrants now . " kandel hinted at another development : the fact that , in part because of the muslim population , religion today plays a bigger role in germany than it did 10 years ago .
he said that it was good if the german media followed the development - even if they were criticized for it - because it was the only way they could enlighten readers . " i think most media consumers in germany are aware that there is a difference between the religion islam and radical islamism , " kandel said , adding that was a success for the german media . at the same time , kandel said that , compared to other european countries , germany had witnessed less of a backlash on its muslim community in the aftermath of sept .

the energy route map includes policies for wales on energy supply and sets out dates for energy policy objectives to be met .
it will be launched for consultation on monday by economic development minister andrew davies .
but environmental groups have called for more action on global warming .
the assembly government said its route map balances the need to keep wales ' economy competitive while maintaining high environmental standards .
one of the policies the document is expected to contain is the provision of new planning guidance for onshore windfarms .
however , no mention is likely to be made over nuclear power .
environmental groups such as the world wildlife fund have criticised politicians , including first minister rhodri morgan , for being complacent about global warming .
ahead of the launch , mr davies said : " we are already playing a significant role in pursuing clean energy and renewable energy generation in wales .
" however , we have the capacity and the duty to do more .
" we need to facilitate many more clean energy projects -lrb- while -rrb- continuing to raise the profile of energy efficiency .
" the pursuit of a clean and high-efficiency energy policy through renewable energies , cleaner fossil fuel technologies and increased focus on energy efficiency offer significant economic development and environmental opportunities for wales . "
mr davies will launch the route map at baglan bay power station near port talbot , a £ 300m plant claimed to be among the most technologically-advanced and efficient when it opened in 2003 .

forard -lrb- not his real name -rrb- , a detainee at colnbrook removal centre near heathrow airport , describes what life is like inside a removal centre while he waits to be returned home against his wishes .
forard , speaking by phone from a landing at colnbrook , says he fled zimbabwe after he was singled out for attacks by members of the youth wing of president robert mugabe 's ruling zanupf party .
he has been refused asylum but has not yet been removed .
there are people here who are mad , they were normal people when they came in but now it 's like their brains have been disturbed forard hear the interview in full he claims he carries the evidence of torture on his body , although he wanted to remain anonymous out of fear of damaging his case .
colnbrook is the newest centre and is close to heathrow to make removals easier .
but forard says he has been there for most of this year after initially being held in dungavel in lanarkshire .
" i came here in february and have been here ever since , " he said amid the din of a noisy corridor where other people were waiting for phone calls . "
" the structure of this building is just like a jail .
inside the rooms there are toilets with no doors .
the ceiling is dark blue , close to black and they lock us up at 10pm and they open in the morning at 7.30 , sometimes 7.45 . "
" there is no way you can get out of the room .
it feels that there is no air coming in , there is artificial ventilation but it feels like it is blocked most of the time . "
" it gets very hot sometimes and i have to fan myself with a newspaper at night and there is no way you can open windows . "
forard described the view from his room as one of razor wire and solid fences .
he said there was " nothing much to see , you look from the room to the fence , the way i had seen the inside of a jail on television , this is what i see here . "
" in dungavel the toilets are outside the rooms and you can get out of the room and go to television rooms and you come out and you can play games . "
" your rooms are not locked at night .
here , when they lock , you are locked in and there is nothing else you can do . "
' hangings ' asked what he would say to those who support the detention policy , forard said it was not as good as people thought .
he said : " people in here are cutting their wrists and they are burning themselves with boiling water .
there are people in -lsb- detention centres -rsb- who are hanging themselves but nothing is said about this on the outside . "

scream forard 's words were cut short by a loud scream which sounded like it had come from down the hallway .
it was one of the men forard said was now mentally unstable .

forard said he sought asylum with no intention of staying in the uk - he simply followed the same path as other family members who had spent a lot of money organising a secretive and hopefully temporary escape from zimbabwe .
he says he has every intention of going home once president mugabe is gone - but until then he does not feel safe .

" the other people who told me about britain told me the weather is very unfriendly and you should not expect people to have any time for each other , not like in africa when people greet each other as they pass . "
immigration minister tony mcnulty has disputed some of the complaints about asylum detention .
" i accept the broad pont that we do need to be very sensitive to anyone we detain throuhgout the asylum process , " he said .
" but i do n't accept the point that it 's flawed to have detention as part of an asylum system in the first place .
it 's not the case that people are languishing in the system -lsb- as amnesty have claimed -rsb- . "
for his part , forard is still fighting his case and says ultimately he would rather stay in colnbrook than go home because whatever his conditions in the uk , having no liberty is better than no life at all .

forard -lrb- not his real name -rrb- , a detainee at colnbrook removal centre near heathrow airport , describes what life is like inside a removal centre while he waits to be returned home against his wishes .
forard , speaking by phone from a landing at colnbrook , says he fled zimbabwe after he was singled out for attacks by members of the youth wing of president robert mugabe 's ruling zanupf party .
he has been refused asylum but has not yet been removed .
there are people here who are mad , they were normal people when they came in but now it 's like their brains have been disturbed forard hear the interview in full he claims he carries the evidence of torture on his body , although he wanted to remain anonymous out of fear of damaging his case .
colnbrook is the newest centre and is close to heathrow to make removals easier .
but forard says he has been there for most of this year after initially being held in dungavel in lanarkshire .
" i came here in february and have been here ever since , " he said amid the din of a noisy corridor where other people were waiting for phone calls . "
" the structure of this building is just like a jail .
inside the rooms there are toilets with no doors .
the ceiling is dark blue , close to black and they lock us up at 10pm and they open in the morning at 7.30 , sometimes 7.45 . "
" there is no way you can get out of the room .
it feels that there is no air coming in , there is artificial ventilation but it feels like it is blocked most of the time . "
" it gets very hot sometimes and i have to fan myself with a newspaper at night and there is no way you can open windows . "
forard described the view from his room as one of razor wire and solid fences .
he said there was " nothing much to see , you look from the room to the fence , the way i had seen the inside of a jail on television , this is what i see here . "
" in dungavel the toilets are outside the rooms and you can get out of the room and go to television rooms and you come out and you can play games . "
" your rooms are not locked at night .
here , when they lock , you are locked in and there is nothing else you can do . "
' hangings ' asked what he would say to those who support the detention policy , forard said it was not as good as people thought .
he said : " people in here are cutting their wrists and they are burning themselves with boiling water .
there are people in -lsb- detention centres -rsb- who are hanging themselves but nothing is said about this on the outside . "
" i have seen these things several times .
there are people here who are mad , they were normal people when they came in but now it 's like their brains have been disturbed . "
" they walk in circles all day , there is this other guy who is like a zombie who does n't talk and walks like a tree , with little movement . "
" i have seen this guy for three months in here and a few minutes ago he upset another man and wanted to hit him and one day he will get himself killed . "
scream forard 's words were cut short by a loud scream which sounded like it had come from down the hallway .
it was one of the men forard said was now mentally unstable .
a few minutes later , as he resumed his story , the same man loudly banged a door .
" this is the frustration that i have been talking about .
sometimes -lsb- the man -rsb- talks , sometimes he will go and just scream like this , sometimes he will go and slash his hands - he has scars all over his hands . "
forard said he sought asylum with no intention of staying in the uk - he simply followed the same path as other family members who had spent a lot of money organising a secretive and hopefully temporary escape from zimbabwe .
he says he has every intention of going home once president mugabe is gone - but until then he does not feel safe .
" i do n't think this is an easy country .
the process of coming here is not easy at all , raising money to take flights from africa , false passports and so on . "
" i was warned before by other people that the asylum system in britain is very difficult .
my other choice was a country which i did n't have a clue about .
but my cousin had made it here and said they would wait for me at the airport ; you have to understand that was the reason why . "
" the other people who told me about britain told me the weather is very unfriendly and you should not expect people to have any time for each other , not like in africa when people greet each other as they pass . "
immigration minister tony mcnulty has disputed some of the complaints about asylum detention .
" i accept the broad pont that we do need to be very sensitive to anyone we detain throuhgout the asylum process , " he said .
" but i do n't accept the point that it 's flawed to have detention as part of an asylum system in the first place .
it 's not the case that people are languishing in the system -lsb- as amnesty have claimed -rsb- . "
for his part , forard is still fighting his case and says ultimately he would rather stay in colnbrook than go home because whatever his conditions in the uk , having no liberty is better than no life at all .
" i will try to resist -lsb- removal -rsb- .
there is no safety in zimbabwe for me . "

forard -lrb- not his real name -rrb- , a detainee at colnbrook removal centre near heathrow airport , describes what life is like inside a removal centre while he waits to be returned home against his wishes .
forard , speaking by phone from a landing at colnbrook , says he fled zimbabwe after he was singled out for attacks by members of the youth wing of president robert mugabe 's ruling zanupf party .
he has been refused asylum but has not yet been removed . "
there are people here who are mad , they were normal people when they came in but now it 's like their brains have been disturbed " forard he claims he carries the evidence of torture on his body , although he wanted to remain anonymous out of fear of damaging his case .
colnbrook is the newest centre and is close to heathrow to make removals easier .
but forard says he has been there for most of this year after initially being held in dungavel in lanarkshire .
" i came here in february and have been here ever since , " he said amid the din of a noisy corridor where other people were waiting for phone calls . "
" the structure of this building is just like a jail .
inside the rooms there are toilets with no doors .
the ceiling is dark blue , close to black and they lock us up at 10pm and they open in the morning at 7.30 , sometimes 7.45 . "
" there is no way you can get out of the room .
it feels that there is no air coming in , there is artificial ventilation but it feels like it is blocked most of the time . "
" it gets very hot sometimes and i have to fan myself with a newspaper at night and there is no way you can open windows . "
forard described the view from his room as one of razor wire and solid fences .
he said there was " nothing much to see , you look from the room to the fence , the way i had seen the inside of a jail on television , this is what i see here . "
" in dungavel the toilets are outside the rooms and you can get out of the room and go to television rooms and you come out and you can play games . "
" your rooms are not locked at night .
here , when they lock , you are locked in and there is nothing else you can do . "
' hangings ' asked what he would say to those who support the detention policy , forard said it was not as good as people thought .
he said : " people in here are cutting their wrists and they are burning themselves with boiling water .
there are people in -lsb- detention centres -rsb- who are hanging themselves but nothing is said about this on the outside . "
" i have seen these things several times .
there are people here who are mad , they were normal people when they came in but now it 's like their brains have been disturbed . "
" they walk in circles all day , there is this other guy who is like a zombie who does n't talk and walks like a tree , with little movement . "
" i have seen this guy for three months in here and a few minutes ago he upset another man and wanted to hit him and one day he will get himself killed . "
scream forard 's words were cut short by a loud scream which sounded like it had come from down the hallway .
it was one of the men forard said was now mentally unstable .
a few minutes later , as he resumed his story , the same man loudly banged a door .
" this is the frustration that i have been talking about .
sometimes -lsb- the man -rsb- talks , sometimes he will go and just scream like this , sometimes he will go and slash his hands - he has scars all over his hands . "

the prince will also come face to face with their rivals , the new zealand all blacks , it has been announced .
william , who is 23 on tuesday , will fly to new zealand next week for 10 days .
" as a huge rugby fan , i can not think of a better place to watch what will hopefully be a hard-fought and exciting test series , " he said .
" but i am also very much looking forward to meeting people outside of rugby and enjoying some of the breathtaking scenery for which new zealand is so justly renowned . "
solo engagements the prince , who will arrive in wellington on 30 june , will take part in training sessions with the lions and watch the second and third tests against the all blacks .
he will then fly to auckland to meet the new zealand team .
he will also carry out his first solo engagements , representing the queen , by attending ceremonies in wellington and auckland to mark the end of world war ii .
praising new zealand 's " courageous " world war ii soldiers , he said : " it will be a privilege and honour to meet some world war ii veterans , whose bravery our generation must never forget . "
prince william will also visit a primary school in arrowtown near queenstown and open a water polo competition near auckland .
two days of the trip will be spent privately , said clarence house .
he will stay on a farm and visit a " marae " - a sacred maori tribal home .
visitors who enter a marae are greeted with a welcoming ritual , a pressing of noses and symbolic exchange of breath known as the hongi .
william , who recently gained a 2:1 in his geography degree at st andrews university , was invited to support the british and irish lions by coach sir clive woodward , clarence house said .

trade minister mark vaile said a merger could not be ruled out as the global aviation industry was consolidating .
under current law foreign investors can own only 49 % of qantas , but this cap is being re-examined as part of a review of aviation policy .
qantas believes that foreign investment would help it to raise extra capital .
the australian airline has faced increased rivalry in its domestic market in recent years and it revealed early this year that it could transfer up 7,000 jobs abroad in order to save costs .
commercial challenge john howard 's government has so far resisted calls for the ownership threshold on qantas to be lifted .
however , mr vaile told the australian newspaper that australia 's national airline was facing major commercial challenges and that a merger with singapore airlines was a possibility .
we are very supportive of a regime in which more consolidation can occur peter gregg , qantas chief executive " my view is if -lrb- a merger -rrb- could occur then the government should not rule that out , " he said .
" quite frankly , that is the direction that international aviation is moving in . "
qantas welcomed mr vaile 's comments , the first public indication that the government 's attitude to the ownership of the national carrier may be changing .
" we are very supportive of a regime in which more consolidation can occur , " qantas chief executive peter gregg told the australian .
" it 's happening in europe , it 's happening in australia . "
trans-pacific row singapore airlines is currently in dispute with qantas and the australian government about access to the lucrative trans-pacific route .
flights between australia and the united states are shared between qantas and united airlines and the australian government last week rejected calls for singapore airlines to be given access to the market .
singapore airlines responded cautiously to mr vaile 's comments , arguing that its priority was to see more competition on the trans-pacific route .
" both companies are publicly listed companies and the matter would , therefore , be extremely complex , " said spokesman stephen forshaw .
" given the current rules governing international civil aviation and competition , industry consolidation wo n't happen any time soon . "
