" we are hoping to reconvene tomorrow -lrb- wednesday -rrb- afternoon , but it all very much depends on the iranians " . those hopes , however , received a blow when it was revealed by the head of iran 's nuclear energy agency that the seals that the un nuclear watchdog had placed on iran 's isfahan uranium conversion plant would be removed on wednesday .
iaea inspectors finished installing their surveillance cameras in the plant on tuesday . " the rest of seals will be removed today and the activities will resume , " said gholamreza aghazadeh was quoted as saying on state television .
breaking the seals is the next crucial stage at the plant after iran resumed suspended uranium conversion activities on monday , sparking warnings of an international crisis .
conversion turns uranium ore or yellowcake into a feed gas for enriching uranium , which can be the fuel for reactors or the explosive core of atom bombs .
bush remains " deeply suspicious " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meanwhile , speaking in crawford , texas , after the first day of the iaea talks , us president george w. bush warned iran that the threat of un sanctions over its nuclear activities remained , and made clear he was " deeply suspicious " of tehran 's stated intention to resume talks with a trio of european union states .
" we 'll have to watch very carefully , " bush told reporters . " they have , in the past , said they would adhere to international norms and then were caught enriching uranium .
and that 's dangerous . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director general of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- mohamed elbaradei according to diplomatic sources , the iaea board is unlikely to refer iran to the un security council because of its resumption of uranium conversion but will instead urge tehran to suspend work .
the meeting could last several days .
resolutions on the 35-nation board are normally adopted unanimously . in france , foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said : " it is still possible to negotiate " with iran .
" we are still holding out our hand , " he told journalists . iaea unlikely to recommend sanctions however , diplomats noted warnings that cracking down on iran could isolate the country and said the iaea board was backing away from referring it to the un security council , which could impose sanctions . malaysian ambassador rajmah hussein , speaking for the non-aligned movement , called on the europeans and iran " to continue with their dialogue " and said verification issues " should be resolved solely within the framework of the iaea . " but russia , which is building iran 's first nuclear power reactor and is to supply it with nuclear fuel , came out against iran , calling on it to halt fuel production work " without delay " . new president talks of " insult " at new deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranians have protested iaea inspections in the past in tehran on tuesday iran 's new president mahmood ahmadinejad described as " an insult " an eu offer to iran of trade and other incentives in return for guarantees it was not making nuclear weapons , but said he was still ready to carry on talks . and in vienna , iranian negotiator cyrus nasseri said iran was prepared to continue talks with the eu as long as there were no preconditions and the talks were in " good faith . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's bushehr nuclear power plant .
iran and russia signed a nuclear fuel agreement in february for iran to get its first reactor up and running .

come next week , the german city of cologne will be bursting at the seams as it plays host to some 800,000 pilgrims in town for world youth day .
local businesses are rubbing their hands in anticipation . tipped to be one of the largest religious gatherings ever in germany , world youth day is n't only inspiring spirituality in the city 's residents . the event is also spawning a decidedly commercial side , as regional companies try to cash in on the one-off economic opportunity by extending their opening hours .
but uwe klein , head of cologne ’ s retail association says the excitement is misplaced . " the people coming here are not going to have a lot of money .
the main object is to provide the visitors and guests with the basic essentials , which means food and drink , and of course souvenirs , " klein said . and much of the food will be provided by world youth day limited itself , which sets a good portion of its 100 million euros -lrb- $ 123 million -rrb- budget aside for catering . untypical tourists the economic development council in bonn suggests that a typical tourist will spend between 60 and 100 euros a day , but experts say that will not be the case with world youth day visitors .
matthias johnen , manager of the regional hoteliers association , says visitors at previous such events could be divided up in to three categories . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world youth day volunteers " we can safely assume from past experience that roughly one third of visitors will be coming to pray , another third will be here to sightsee and a final third will be here to shop , " johnen said . retailers and caterers have been preparing for this event for months and have a list of 25,000 benevolent volunteers ready to lend a hand when the queues get too long .
many restaurants have even promised to keep their prices down , and will be offering " pilgrim specials " at affordable prices . in search of the fat cash where local businesses are hoping to make their money is through the 6,000 journalists who are also expected to descend on the city for the event , and the day-trippers who are likely to roll up with rather fatter wallets than the pilgrims .
but nina schmedding , spokeswoman for world youth day , is reluctant to divide visitors into consumer types , and says that spending habits will vary from one event to another . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a time to prey or a time to shop ?
" there 's been no study on the behavior of the pilgrims .
i think a lot is going to depend on the weather , " she said . the general consensus , however , is that there should n't be too much emphasis on the economic side of the event , but that it should serve to raise the profile of the region .

berlin 's urban rejuvenation over the past few years may have put it back on the map with international tourists , but the facelift is n't finished , for there 's a rather dirty river running through the city center . the river spree travels almost four hundred kilometers through industrial wastelands , forests and fertile fields before reaching the german capital .
and as city rivers go , this one has an elegant , tame feel to it .
but the look is deceptive , for within its slender curves , the spree plays host to a barrage of bacteria .
the problem is not the result of unethical industrialists pumping factory waste into the water , since for the most part industry on the banks of the spree dried up many years ago .
the pollution actually arises through the continued use of an old-fashioned , inadequate sewage system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the murky waters of the spree are not enticing in much of the city " combination " drains , which are over a century old , are used to transport both rain water and household waste . they have not grown as quickly as the city , and simply do n't have the capacity to contain the sudden , violent downpours which fall over berlin up to 30 times each year .
the rainfall mixes with the city sewage and it all spills into the spree . it 's a rather disgusting problem that most people would prefer not to think about , except those who have taken it upon themselves to change it . " we have to set an example " for the past four years , ralf steeg , an engineer for landscape architecture and environmental planning , has been working on a way of improving not only the quality of the water in the spree , but consequently the quality of life for those who live on or near its banks . bildunterschrift : an example of a floating pontoon " spree 2011 " his solution , called " spree 2011 " is quite simple .
he plans to erect large overflow tanks in the form of floating pontoons at various points along a four-kilometer stretch of the spree , thus preventing human waste from overflowing into the river and giving the water a chance to regain its natural balance .
" germany is an important industrial nation , and we should be showing the world that we care about our environment .
and apart from that , i want to see berlin and the berliners thriving , i want them to have the chance to jump into a river to cool off , " steeg said . berlin , the water paradise some argue that berlin already has plenty of opportunities for a quick dip after work .
and when compared to cities such as london and paris , that may be true .
but for steeg , the argument is not watertight . bildunterschrift : " spree 2011 " futuristic bathing platform " the discussion about the necessity of being able to swim in the city center was concluded back in the 80s when it was decided that people should have the chance to relax on their doorsteps .
at the moment , you have to travel at least 30 minutes from the city center just to be able to swim , " steeg said .
traditionally , the spree was a bathers ' paradise .
back in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , the river was dotted with bathing facilities , and until 1925 , when they were all closed , berliners made good use of what they had .
steeg 's plans would return the river back beyond its former glory to give it a " water quality it has never had before " .
not about swimming stephan natz of the berlin water authority says the issue is not about " creating swimming facilities , but about improving the quality of the water , thus providing for the future of the city . "
he argues that although steeg 's project is a good idea , the cost could be disproportionate to the effect . bildunterschrift : the pontoons could be used as campsites or open air cinemas that said , the city water authorities have agreed to partially finance a 180,000 euro -lrb- $ 222,000 -rrb- viability study which , if successful , could take the project to the next phase , including the construction of a pilot prototype .
this is where the project ceases to just be a solution to an environmental problem , but a practical , aesthetically pleasing addition to the changing face of a european capital .
steeg , who was named engineer of the year this week , foresees the floating pontoons being used as cafés , restaurants , campsites , bathing houses or even open-air cinema , all of which would generate income for the city . time is of the essence the innovative idea is in step with many other initiatives which have sprung up on the banks of the river in an attempt to give it the same kind of pulse enjoyed by other european cities .
but dr. dietrich jahn , who runs the planning department of the berlin senate , says that although there is currently no necessity to prettify the river , it is a long-term goal worth hanging on to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spree to be ?
" there are industrial ruins up and down the banks of the spree , and we need to fill them .
a berlin beach life could be a very special thing , and although the financial crisis in berlin means it would be hard to finance the project at the moment , we should n't lose sight of it , " he said .
but steeg is keen to get started , and if " spree 2011 " is to live up to its name , there 's not much time for deliberation . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in berlin , a river remade berlin 's river spree was long slighted by the city 's inhabitants , who saw it as little more than a murky cradle of industry .

the rainfall mixes with the city sewage and it all spills into the spree . it 's a rather disgusting problem that most people would prefer not to think about , except those who have taken it upon themselves to change it . " we have to set an example " for the past four years , ralf steeg , an engineer for landscape architecture and environmental planning , has been working on a way of improving not only the quality of the water in the spree , but consequently the quality of life for those who live on or near its banks . bildunterschrift : an example of a floating pontoon " spree 2011 " his solution , called " spree 2011 " is quite simple .
he plans to erect large overflow tanks in the form of floating pontoons at various points along a four-kilometer stretch of the spree , thus preventing human waste from overflowing into the river and giving the water a chance to regain its natural balance .
" germany is an important industrial nation , and we should be showing the world that we care about our environment .
and apart from that , i want to see berlin and the berliners thriving , i want them to have the chance to jump into a river to cool off , " steeg said . berlin , the water paradise some argue that berlin already has plenty of opportunities for a quick dip after work .
and when compared to cities such as london and paris , that may be true .
but for steeg , the argument is not watertight . bildunterschrift : " spree 2011 " futuristic bathing platform " the discussion about the necessity of being able to swim in the city center was concluded back in the 80s when it was decided that people should have the chance to relax on their doorsteps .
at the moment , you have to travel at least 30 minutes from the city center just to be able to swim , " steeg said .
traditionally , the spree was a bathers ' paradise .
back in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , the river was dotted with bathing facilities , and until 1925 , when they were all closed , berliners made good use of what they had .
steeg 's plans would return the river back beyond its former glory to give it a " water quality it has never had before " .
not about swimming stephan natz of the berlin water authority says the issue is not about " creating swimming facilities , but about improving the quality of the water , thus providing for the future of the city . "
he argues that although steeg 's project is a good idea , the cost could be disproportionate to the effect . bildunterschrift : the pontoons could be used as campsites or open air cinemas that said , the city water authorities have agreed to partially finance a 180,000 euro -lrb- $ 222,000 -rrb- viability study which , if successful , could take the project to the next phase , including the construction of a pilot prototype .
this is where the project ceases to just be a solution to an environmental problem , but a practical , aesthetically pleasing addition to the changing face of a european capital .
steeg , who was named engineer of the year this week , foresees the floating pontoons being used as cafés , restaurants , campsites , bathing houses or even open-air cinema , all of which would generate income for the city . time is of the essence the innovative idea is in step with many other initiatives which have sprung up on the banks of the river in an attempt to give it the same kind of pulse enjoyed by other european cities .
but dr. dietrich jahn , who runs the planning department of the berlin senate , says that although there is currently no necessity to prettify the river , it is a long-term goal worth hanging on to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spree to be ?
" there are industrial ruins up and down the banks of the spree , and we need to fill them .
a berlin beach life could be a very special thing , and although the financial crisis in berlin means it would be hard to finance the project at the moment , we should n't lose sight of it , " he said .
but steeg is keen to get started , and if " spree 2011 " is to live up to its name , there 's not much time for deliberation . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in berlin , a river remade berlin 's river spree was long slighted by the city 's inhabitants , who saw it as little more than a murky cradle of industry .

but iran has removed the seals at a key atomic plant , signalling that talks are over . the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- gave the final go-ahead for the removal of seals which it put on the uranium conversion facility on the outskirts of isfahan when iran suspended sensitive nuclear activities last november .
their removal , which means the facility can return to full capacity , raises the stakes in a standoff with the international community .
iran sparked grave international concern when it ended the nine-month suspension of uranium conversion on monday , but it was n't until the metal seals on key machinery were cut that the program really resumed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iaea inspectors sets surveillance equipment " we have started , " said iran 's atomic energy agency vice-president mohammad saidi .
" it is happening under the supervision of the agency . "
throughout the current escalation of tensions iran has been at pains to emphasize that it is resuming conversion activities in concert with the iaea , whose inspectors have installed surveillance equipment to monitor the process .
mindful of playing by international rules , iran waited for the agency to finish installing surveillance equipment before breaking the seals .
the iaea " told us in a letter that there was no obstacle and that -lrb- the agency -rrb- authorizes us to remove the seals , which will be returned to them afterwards , " said saidi .
pressure mounts for iran to backtrack the move comes as the european union tries to win approval at an emergency iaea meeting in vienna for a draft resolution calling on iran to reverse its decision to continue with the nuclear fuel work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea emergency meeting on iran 's latest nuclear activities indicating the difficulties of forging an agreement , a formal iaea meeting planned for wednesday was cancelled because diplomats remained locked in closed-door talks on the eu resolution .
" we are at a difficult stage of the process and the german government is very concerned about this development , " german government spokesman bela anda said . he expressed his hope that iran would still come to its senses and resume talks with britain , germany and france .
iran says no turning back iran had suspended uranium conversion and enrichment as a goodwill gesture during nine months of talks with the european union aimed at staving off un security council intervention .
the prospect of the talks succeeding has been dealt a severe blow by iran 's resumption . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has yet to appoint a new government but one of the candidates for the post of foreign minister , parliamentary foreign affairs committee head aleaddine boroujerdi , made clear there was no going back on the move .
he said the best guarantee that iran 's nuclear program is peaceful was the " infallible watching of the iaea cameras , " adding his hope that " the europeans will also accept this reality . "
he said the regime has still not made any decision on restarting iran 's uranium enrichment plant in the city of natanz .
enrichment remains suspended but officials emphasize this is only temporary .
conversion turns uranium ore , or yellowcake , into a feed gas for making enriched uranium , which can be the fuel for reactors or the explosive core of atomic bombs . dw staff / afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany warns iran over nuclear program germany warned on monday that iran 's threat to defy the west and resume uranium enrichment activities which could be used to make nuclear weapons would torpedo talks between the european union and tehran .

" we are hoping to reconvene tomorrow -lrb- wednesday -rrb- afternoon , but it all very much depends on the iranians " . those hopes , however , received a blow when it was revealed by the head of iran 's nuclear energy agency that the seals that the un nuclear watchdog had placed on iran 's isfahan uranium conversion plant would be removed on wednesday .
iaea inspectors finished installing their surveillance cameras in the plant on tuesday . " the rest of seals will be removed today and the activities will resume , " said gholamreza aghazadeh was quoted as saying on state television .
breaking the seals is the next crucial stage at the plant after iran resumed suspended uranium conversion activities on monday , sparking warnings of an international crisis .
conversion turns uranium ore or yellowcake into a feed gas for enriching uranium , which can be the fuel for reactors or the explosive core of atom bombs .
bush remains " deeply suspicious " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meanwhile , speaking in crawford , texas , after the first day of the iaea talks , us president george w. bush warned iran that the threat of un sanctions over its nuclear activities remained , and made clear he was " deeply suspicious " of tehran 's stated intention to resume talks with a trio of european union states .
" we 'll have to watch very carefully , " bush told reporters . " they have , in the past , said they would adhere to international norms and then were caught enriching uranium .
and that 's dangerous . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director general of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- mohamed elbaradei according to diplomatic sources , the iaea board is unlikely to refer iran to the un security council because of its resumption of uranium conversion but will instead urge tehran to suspend work .
the meeting could last several days .
resolutions on the 35-nation board are normally adopted unanimously . in france , foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said : " it is still possible to negotiate " with iran .
" we are still holding out our hand , " he told journalists . iaea unlikely to recommend sanctions however , diplomats noted warnings that cracking down on iran could isolate the country and said the iaea board was backing away from referring it to the un security council , which could impose sanctions . malaysian ambassador rajmah hussein , speaking for the non-aligned movement , called on the europeans and iran " to continue with their dialogue " and said verification issues " should be resolved solely within the framework of the iaea . " but russia , which is building iran 's first nuclear power reactor and is to supply it with nuclear fuel , came out against iran , calling on it to halt fuel production work " without delay " . new president talks of " insult " at new deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranians have protested iaea inspections in the past in tehran on tuesday iran 's new president mahmood ahmadinejad described as " an insult " an eu offer to iran of trade and other incentives in return for guarantees it was not making nuclear weapons , but said he was still ready to carry on talks . and in vienna , iranian negotiator cyrus nasseri said iran was prepared to continue talks with the eu as long as there were no preconditions and the talks were in " good faith . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's bushehr nuclear power plant .
iran and russia signed a nuclear fuel agreement in february for iran to get its first reactor up and running .
nasseri said iran was frustrated the eu was still not acknowledging what iran considers its right under the non proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- to make nuclear fuel as part of a peaceful atomic program . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran resumes enrichment activity iranian technicians have taken the first steps to resume enrichment activity at its isfahan facility .

but iran has removed the seals at a key atomic plant , signalling that talks are over . the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- gave the final go-ahead for the removal of seals which it put on the uranium conversion facility on the outskirts of isfahan when iran suspended sensitive nuclear activities last november .
their removal , which means the facility can return to full capacity , raises the stakes in a standoff with the international community .
iran sparked grave international concern when it ended the nine-month suspension of uranium conversion on monday , but it was n't until the metal seals on key machinery were cut that the program really resumed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iaea inspectors sets surveillance equipment " we have started , " said iran 's atomic energy agency vice-president mohammad saidi .
" it is happening under the supervision of the agency . "
throughout the current escalation of tensions iran has been at pains to emphasize that it is resuming conversion activities in concert with the iaea , whose inspectors have installed surveillance equipment to monitor the process .
mindful of playing by international rules , iran waited for the agency to finish installing surveillance equipment before breaking the seals .
the iaea " told us in a letter that there was no obstacle and that -lrb- the agency -rrb- authorizes us to remove the seals , which will be returned to them afterwards , " said saidi .
pressure mounts for iran to backtrack the move comes as the european union tries to win approval at an emergency iaea meeting in vienna for a draft resolution calling on iran to reverse its decision to continue with the nuclear fuel work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea emergency meeting on iran 's latest nuclear activities indicating the difficulties of forging an agreement , a formal iaea meeting planned for wednesday was cancelled because diplomats remained locked in closed-door talks on the eu resolution .
" we are at a difficult stage of the process and the german government is very concerned about this development , " german government spokesman bela anda said . he expressed his hope that iran would still come to its senses and resume talks with britain , germany and france .
iran says no turning back iran had suspended uranium conversion and enrichment as a goodwill gesture during nine months of talks with the european union aimed at staving off un security council intervention .
the prospect of the talks succeeding has been dealt a severe blow by iran 's resumption . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has yet to appoint a new government but one of the candidates for the post of foreign minister , parliamentary foreign affairs committee head aleaddine boroujerdi , made clear there was no going back on the move .
he said the best guarantee that iran 's nuclear program is peaceful was the " infallible watching of the iaea cameras , " adding his hope that " the europeans will also accept this reality . "
he said the regime has still not made any decision on restarting iran 's uranium enrichment plant in the city of natanz .
enrichment remains suspended but officials emphasize this is only temporary .

could this be a return to the bad old days ? " could the sun be setting on germany 's bright new dawn ? " that was the question being posed in the sports pages of the german press on wednesday .
after initial signs suggesting that national team coach jürgen klinsmann was going to revolutionize an ailing and aging germany by blooding exciting but untried youngsters at international level , a creeping anxiety began to spread when klinsmann announced that young guns lukas podolski and bastian schweinsteiger would not be traveling with his latest squad .
the germany contingent who will head to the netherlands for a high profile friendly against the dutch in rotterdam on august 17 will be without the two youngsters who lit up germany 's confederations cup campaign in june .
they offered hope to a nation with huge expectations ahead of the world cup to be played on home soil next summer .
klinsmann has completely omitted 20-year-old fc cologne striker " poldi " and his bayern munich buddy " schweini " , 21 , from the traveling party and has padded the squad with experience in the form of seasoned warriors didi hamann , christian wörns and oliver neuville .
klinsmann has also opted for an established face up front with the not-exactly-decrepit miroslav klose , 28 .
he is returning to the attacking line for the first time since the 1-0 win over slovenia in march in the absence of another of klinsi 's colts , the suspended mike hanke .

no return to the past , a glance to the future but for all those fearing the return to the creaky old days , the reason for the omission of those central to germany 's youth revolution is not cold feet but achy ones .
not a man to abandon his reforms so easily , klinsmann is still looking to the future by resting his young stars with a view to keeping them as fresh as possible for the world cup to come .

meanwhile , hildebrand is likely to get a good run in the team to make his case for the number one jersey in the next six games , according to klinsmann .
hardly a team pushing the age barrier despite the absence of podolski , schweinsteiger , hanke and hildebrand in the team expected to face the netherlands , the german team is hardly one full of pensioners .

but iran has removed the seals at a key atomic plant , signalling that talks are over . the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- gave the final go-ahead for the removal of seals which it put on the uranium conversion facility on the outskirts of isfahan when iran suspended sensitive nuclear activities last november .
their removal , which means the facility can return to full capacity , raises the stakes in a standoff with the international community .
iran sparked grave international concern when it ended the nine-month suspension of uranium conversion on monday , but it was n't until the metal seals on key machinery were cut that the program really resumed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iaea inspectors sets surveillance equipment " we have started , " said iran 's atomic energy agency vice-president mohammad saidi .
" it is happening under the supervision of the agency . "
throughout the current escalation of tensions iran has been at pains to emphasize that it is resuming conversion activities in concert with the iaea , whose inspectors have installed surveillance equipment to monitor the process .
mindful of playing by international rules , iran waited for the agency to finish installing surveillance equipment before breaking the seals .
the iaea " told us in a letter that there was no obstacle and that -lrb- the agency -rrb- authorizes us to remove the seals , which will be returned to them afterwards , " said saidi .
pressure mounts for iran to backtrack the move comes as the european union tries to win approval at an emergency iaea meeting in vienna for a draft resolution calling on iran to reverse its decision to continue with the nuclear fuel work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea emergency meeting on iran 's latest nuclear activities indicating the difficulties of forging an agreement , a formal iaea meeting planned for wednesday was cancelled because diplomats remained locked in closed-door talks on the eu resolution .

he said the best guarantee that iran 's nuclear program is peaceful was the " infallible watching of the iaea cameras , " adding his hope that " the europeans will also accept this reality . "
he said the regime has still not made any decision on restarting iran 's uranium enrichment plant in the city of natanz .

could this be a return to the bad old days ? " could the sun be setting on germany 's bright new dawn ? " that was the question being posed in the sports pages of the german press on wednesday .
after initial signs suggesting that national team coach jürgen klinsmann was going to revolutionize an ailing and aging germany by blooding exciting but untried youngsters at international level , a creeping anxiety began to spread when klinsmann announced that young guns lukas podolski and bastian schweinsteiger would not be traveling with his latest squad .
the germany contingent who will head to the netherlands for a high profile friendly against the dutch in rotterdam on august 17 will be without the two youngsters who lit up germany 's confederations cup campaign in june .
they offered hope to a nation with huge expectations ahead of the world cup to be played on home soil next summer .
klinsmann has completely omitted 20-year-old fc cologne striker " poldi " and his bayern munich buddy " schweini " , 21 , from the traveling party and has padded the squad with experience in the form of seasoned warriors didi hamann , christian wörns and oliver neuville .
klinsmann has also opted for an established face up front with the not-exactly-decrepit miroslav klose , 28 .
he is returning to the attacking line for the first time since the 1-0 win over slovenia in march in the absence of another of klinsi 's colts , the suspended mike hanke .

but iran has removed the seals at a key atomic plant , signalling that talks are over . the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- gave the final go-ahead for the removal of seals which it put on the uranium conversion facility on the outskirts of isfahan when iran suspended sensitive nuclear activities last november .
their removal , which means the facility can return to full capacity , raises the stakes in a standoff with the international community .
iran sparked grave international concern when it ended the nine-month suspension of uranium conversion on monday , but it was n't until the metal seals on key machinery were cut that the program really resumed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iaea inspectors sets surveillance equipment " we have started , " said iran 's atomic energy agency vice-president mohammad saidi .
" it is happening under the supervision of the agency . "
throughout the current escalation of tensions iran has been at pains to emphasize that it is resuming conversion activities in concert with the iaea , whose inspectors have installed surveillance equipment to monitor the process .
mindful of playing by international rules , iran waited for the agency to finish installing surveillance equipment before breaking the seals .
the iaea " told us in a letter that there was no obstacle and that -lrb- the agency -rrb- authorizes us to remove the seals , which will be returned to them afterwards , " said saidi .
pressure mounts for iran to backtrack the move comes as the european union tries to win approval at an emergency iaea meeting in vienna for a draft resolution calling on iran to reverse its decision to continue with the nuclear fuel work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea emergency meeting on iran 's latest nuclear activities indicating the difficulties of forging an agreement , a formal iaea meeting planned for wednesday was cancelled because diplomats remained locked in closed-door talks on the eu resolution .
" we are at a difficult stage of the process and the german government is very concerned about this development , " german government spokesman bela anda said . he expressed his hope that iran would still come to its senses and resume talks with britain , germany and france .
iran says no turning back iran had suspended uranium conversion and enrichment as a goodwill gesture during nine months of talks with the european union aimed at staving off un security council intervention .
the prospect of the talks succeeding has been dealt a severe blow by iran 's resumption . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has yet to appoint a new government but one of the candidates for the post of foreign minister , parliamentary foreign affairs committee head aleaddine boroujerdi , made clear there was no going back on the move .
he said the best guarantee that iran 's nuclear program is peaceful was the " infallible watching of the iaea cameras , " adding his hope that " the europeans will also accept this reality . "
he said the regime has still not made any decision on restarting iran 's uranium enrichment plant in the city of natanz .
enrichment remains suspended but officials emphasize this is only temporary .
conversion turns uranium ore , or yellowcake , into a feed gas for making enriched uranium , which can be the fuel for reactors or the explosive core of atomic bombs . dw staff / afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany warns iran over nuclear program germany warned on monday that iran 's threat to defy the west and resume uranium enrichment activities which could be used to make nuclear weapons would torpedo talks between the european union and tehran .

but that has begun to change and action is being called for amid suggestions that german workers are partly to blame . the unemployment rate in austria has been rising since november , and has now reached the 6 percent mark .
exports are declining and the economy is stagnating .
it 's a sticky situation for the governing parties so close to upcoming regional elections , hence austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel 's hastily scheduled jobs conference this week .
it was the fourth this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian chancellor wolfgang schuessel the conference resulted in agreement on a program to boost regional investments , thus putting at least some of the more than 200,000 unemployed back to work . austrian labor and economy minister martin bartenstein believes the main reason for rising unemployment is weak economic growth , and says its crucial to increase investments in individual austrian regions , without affecting the current budget . " the package we agreed on has nothing to do with the budget .
first of all , we want to get something going to boost growth and jobs , and we also want to take advantage of the possibilities available through current financing by the european union until 2006 , " he said . more jobs yet more jobless the program would cost 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.48 billion -rrb- , with state and the federal government contributing in equal measure , and eu loans making up the rest , and would hopefully create some 20,000 jobs for austrians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german job-seekers head for the austrian alps even as things stand , austria has a pretty good rate of job creation at about one percent growth .
that 's between 30,000 and 35,000 new positions opened up each year .
but even so , the number of unemployed is on the rise . according to austrian media , germans are partially responsible for this predicament , with many unemployed germans who can not find work at home heading south of the border to earn their crust in austria .
some 45,000 germans are currently employed there , many of them in the tourism industry . andrea mühlberger -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans head south in search of jobs as euroskeptics across the continent smugly salute france and holland for crushing the eu constitution ratification process , a migratory trend among german workers validates the benefits of cross border labor markets .

explore cologne and beyond germany as a whole has a rich historical and cultural history but if one had to visit an area that contains all the diverse aspects of the country - the music , the art , the architecture and sights of historical importance - there would be few better places to head to than the western regions .
from the former industrial heartland of the ruhr valley , down the rhine to the home of the düsseldorf fashionistas and onto the roman city of cologne , vistors can enjoy a real cross-section of what germany has to offer .
further afield , there are other delights such as the border city of aachen - the gateway to belgium and the netherlands - and the wine region of the mosel .
a trip around the west of germany offers much in the way of ancient and modern culture .
here dw-world offers a glimpse at the highlights of the western regions . dw-world.de düsseldorf : stop , shop and stroll düsseldorf has come a long way since its days as a fishing town on the rhine some 700 years ago .
today , its inhabitants pass their free time strutting around in designer clothes - and eating the best sushi in europe .
a picturesque pedal down the rhine you might not be winning the yellow jersey just yet , but cycling can still be a rewarding experience .
a tour by the rhine offers many delights - all taking a fraction of the energy needed to win the tour de france .
the ruhr valley : touring germany 's industrial past call it the unromantic road .

for a city that has undergone many changes in its history , it is an apt slogan .
koblenz : good for getting over jet lag recovering from a long-haul flight can take some time .
koblenz 's handful of sites nearly fill the day but still leave time for a nap before dinner .

but that has begun to change and action is being called for amid suggestions that german workers are partly to blame . the unemployment rate in austria has been rising since november , and has now reached the 6 percent mark .
exports are declining and the economy is stagnating .
it 's a sticky situation for the governing parties so close to upcoming regional elections , hence austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel 's hastily scheduled jobs conference this week .
it was the fourth this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian chancellor wolfgang schuessel the conference resulted in agreement on a program to boost regional investments , thus putting at least some of the more than 200,000 unemployed back to work . austrian labor and economy minister martin bartenstein believes the main reason for rising unemployment is weak economic growth , and says its crucial to increase investments in individual austrian regions , without affecting the current budget . " the package we agreed on has nothing to do with the budget .
first of all , we want to get something going to boost growth and jobs , and we also want to take advantage of the possibilities available through current financing by the european union until 2006 , " he said . more jobs yet more jobless the program would cost 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.48 billion -rrb- , with state and the federal government contributing in equal measure , and eu loans making up the rest , and would hopefully create some 20,000 jobs for austrians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german job-seekers head for the austrian alps even as things stand , austria has a pretty good rate of job creation at about one percent growth .
that 's between 30,000 and 35,000 new positions opened up each year .
but even so , the number of unemployed is on the rise . according to austrian media , germans are partially responsible for this predicament , with many unemployed germans who can not find work at home heading south of the border to earn their crust in austria .
some 45,000 germans are currently employed there , many of them in the tourism industry . andrea mühlberger -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans head south in search of jobs as euroskeptics across the continent smugly salute france and holland for crushing the eu constitution ratification process , a migratory trend among german workers validates the benefits of cross border labor markets .

berlin 's urban rejuvenation over the past few years may have put it back on the map with international tourists , but the facelift is n't finished , for there 's a rather dirty river running through the city center . the river spree travels almost four hundred kilometers through industrial wastelands , forests and fertile fields before reaching the german capital .
and as city rivers go , this one has an elegant , tame feel to it .
but the look is deceptive , for within its slender curves , the spree plays host to a barrage of bacteria .
the problem is not the result of unethical industrialists pumping factory waste into the water , since for the most part industry on the banks of the spree dried up many years ago .
the pollution actually arises through the continued use of an old-fashioned , inadequate sewage system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the murky waters of the spree are not enticing in much of the city " combination " drains , which are over a century old , are used to transport both rain water and household waste . they have not grown as quickly as the city , and simply do n't have the capacity to contain the sudden , violent downpours which fall over berlin up to 30 times each year .
the rainfall mixes with the city sewage and it all spills into the spree . it 's a rather disgusting problem that most people would prefer not to think about , except those who have taken it upon themselves to change it . " we have to set an example " for the past four years , ralf steeg , an engineer for landscape architecture and environmental planning , has been working on a way of improving not only the quality of the water in the spree , but consequently the quality of life for those who live on or near its banks . bildunterschrift : an example of a floating pontoon " spree 2011 " his solution , called " spree 2011 " is quite simple .
he plans to erect large overflow tanks in the form of floating pontoons at various points along a four-kilometer stretch of the spree , thus preventing human waste from overflowing into the river and giving the water a chance to regain its natural balance .
" germany is an important industrial nation , and we should be showing the world that we care about our environment .
and apart from that , i want to see berlin and the berliners thriving , i want them to have the chance to jump into a river to cool off , " steeg said . berlin , the water paradise some argue that berlin already has plenty of opportunities for a quick dip after work .
and when compared to cities such as london and paris , that may be true .
but for steeg , the argument is not watertight . bildunterschrift : " spree 2011 " futuristic bathing platform " the discussion about the necessity of being able to swim in the city center was concluded back in the 80s when it was decided that people should have the chance to relax on their doorsteps .
at the moment , you have to travel at least 30 minutes from the city center just to be able to swim , " steeg said .
traditionally , the spree was a bathers ' paradise .
back in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , the river was dotted with bathing facilities , and until 1925 , when they were all closed , berliners made good use of what they had .
steeg 's plans would return the river back beyond its former glory to give it a " water quality it has never had before " .
not about swimming stephan natz of the berlin water authority says the issue is not about " creating swimming facilities , but about improving the quality of the water , thus providing for the future of the city . "
he argues that although steeg 's project is a good idea , the cost could be disproportionate to the effect . bildunterschrift : the pontoons could be used as campsites or open air cinemas that said , the city water authorities have agreed to partially finance a 180,000 euro -lrb- $ 222,000 -rrb- viability study which , if successful , could take the project to the next phase , including the construction of a pilot prototype .
this is where the project ceases to just be a solution to an environmental problem , but a practical , aesthetically pleasing addition to the changing face of a european capital .
steeg , who was named engineer of the year this week , foresees the floating pontoons being used as cafés , restaurants , campsites , bathing houses or even open-air cinema , all of which would generate income for the city . time is of the essence the innovative idea is in step with many other initiatives which have sprung up on the banks of the river in an attempt to give it the same kind of pulse enjoyed by other european cities .
but dr. dietrich jahn , who runs the planning department of the berlin senate , says that although there is currently no necessity to prettify the river , it is a long-term goal worth hanging on to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spree to be ?
" there are industrial ruins up and down the banks of the spree , and we need to fill them .
a berlin beach life could be a very special thing , and although the financial crisis in berlin means it would be hard to finance the project at the moment , we should n't lose sight of it , " he said .
but steeg is keen to get started , and if " spree 2011 " is to live up to its name , there 's not much time for deliberation . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in berlin , a river remade berlin 's river spree was long slighted by the city 's inhabitants , who saw it as little more than a murky cradle of industry .

but that has begun to change and action is being called for amid suggestions that german workers are partly to blame . the unemployment rate in austria has been rising since november , and has now reached the 6 percent mark .
exports are declining and the economy is stagnating .
it 's a sticky situation for the governing parties so close to upcoming regional elections , hence austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel 's hastily scheduled jobs conference this week .
it was the fourth this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian chancellor wolfgang schuessel the conference resulted in agreement on a program to boost regional investments , thus putting at least some of the more than 200,000 unemployed back to work . austrian labor and economy minister martin bartenstein believes the main reason for rising unemployment is weak economic growth , and says its crucial to increase investments in individual austrian regions , without affecting the current budget . " the package we agreed on has nothing to do with the budget .
first of all , we want to get something going to boost growth and jobs , and we also want to take advantage of the possibilities available through current financing by the european union until 2006 , " he said . more jobs yet more jobless the program would cost 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.48 billion -rrb- , with state and the federal government contributing in equal measure , and eu loans making up the rest , and would hopefully create some 20,000 jobs for austrians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german job-seekers head for the austrian alps even as things stand , austria has a pretty good rate of job creation at about one percent growth .
that 's between 30,000 and 35,000 new positions opened up each year .
but even so , the number of unemployed is on the rise . according to austrian media , germans are partially responsible for this predicament , with many unemployed germans who can not find work at home heading south of the border to earn their crust in austria .
some 45,000 germans are currently employed there , many of them in the tourism industry . andrea mühlberger -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans head south in search of jobs as euroskeptics across the continent smugly salute france and holland for crushing the eu constitution ratification process , a migratory trend among german workers validates the benefits of cross border labor markets .

meanwhile , gerhard schröder is cutting a confident figure on the campaign trail . germany 's conservative leadership came together in berlin on plan their remaining election strategy .
shifts in voter sentiment and a growing realization that millions of germans will wait until the last minute to decide who to vote for has added pressure on a faltering campaign that , until recently , looked like a cakewalk for christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- chief angela merkel . despite recent polls which put the cdu and its bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- about 14 points clear of chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats , the cdu / csu ticket is looking a less attractive option to many , mainly due to a number of high profile gaffes over the past few weeks . merkel was subjected to the first real criticism of the campaign for confusing " gross " and " net " wages in a television interview last week and then had to publicly rebuke one of her party members for insensitive remarks alluding to poor social and moral standards in the east of germany in the wake of the " dead babies " case that came to light soon after . new approach and campaign team bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservative leader angela merkel and bavarian governor edmund stoiber display their party 's platform during a news conference in berlin on monday , july 11 , 2005 focussing on their program for the expected september elections .
in a bid to get the cdu / csu show back on the road , merkel , csu chief edmund stoiber and cdu state premiers christian wulff and roland koch will convene in the capital to reassess the campaign strategy and formulate damage limitation plans as the run-in to the election heads for its final month . the meeting is also likely to include discussions on who should be part of merkel 's " competence team " for the last push towards polling day .
according to a report in die welt , at least two csu politicians are likely to be named in the new campaign team ; bavarian minister of the interior günther beckstein and vice-chairperson of the union faction in the bundestag , gerda hasselfeldt . after the meeting , merkel is to begin her campaign tour with the first of an estimated 40 rallies , beginning on wednesday afternoon in essen and cologne in the recently captured former-spd strong hold state of north-rhine westphalia . angie on tour bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservative party officials revealed that merkel 's election campaign will end on september 16 - two days before polling day - in the berlin tempodrom .
highlights of her tour are expected to be the cdu party congress in dortmund on august 28 and the csu equivalent on september 2-3 .
the following day , merkel takes on schröder in the only televised debate of the campaign . schröder himself will have a better idea by then how much the fallout from the recent mistakes and pitfalls experienced by his opponent will have helped his own campaign . the chancellor has apparently smelled blood and appeared invigorated for the upcoming fight in a recent television interview on bayerisches fernsehen .
" i think of everything except quitting , " he told interviewer sigmund gottlieb .
" i intensely believe that i can continue to lead the country further in its course . " schröder places trust in the voters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when questioned about the election chances of his spd-green party coalition , schröder confidently put his trust in the german people to recognize his efforts in pushing for painful reforms : " in the end , the people will go to the polling booths and consider who has shown the most courage . " the chancellor dismissed the increasingly popular discussion of a grand coalition of the cdu and spd .
" we should talk not about coalitions but work on making the spd the strongest party , " schröder said . he was equally dismissive of the new left party , the combination of the pds , the former east german communist party and former spd leftist rebels .
" this is just the pds fortified by those people who have fled from irresponsibility , " he said .
" we should not trust those who would disable germany 's foreign policy and would demand too much on the domestic front . " spd goes on the offensive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's combative style reflects the spd 's campaign plans which would include spending 32 million euros on its 40-day tour of germany in a bid to make the most of recent gains on the cdu . spd campaign manager kajo wasserhoevel announced on tuesday that the social democrats would attempt to capitalize on the recent cdu blunders which he said had given the spd a " tailwind " . " we 're going to turn the spotlight on merkel , " he said , showing journalists at a press conference in berlin new posters mocking merkel 's tax increase plans and raising doubts about her abilities . wasserhoevel added that he expected the trend of voters being turned off by the cdu 's candidate for chancellor to continue as the public take their first close look at merkel in the light of the recent adverse publicity . he also said that a growing trend for germans to decide at the last minute was filling the spd with confidence .
" the number of voters who do n't make their decision until the last 14 days is getting larger and larger , " he said .

berlin 's urban rejuvenation over the past few years may have put it back on the map with international tourists , but the facelift is n't finished , for there 's a rather dirty river running through the city center . the river spree travels almost four hundred kilometers through industrial wastelands , forests and fertile fields before reaching the german capital .
and as city rivers go , this one has an elegant , tame feel to it .
but the look is deceptive , for within its slender curves , the spree plays host to a barrage of bacteria .
the problem is not the result of unethical industrialists pumping factory waste into the water , since for the most part industry on the banks of the spree dried up many years ago .
the pollution actually arises through the continued use of an old-fashioned , inadequate sewage system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the murky waters of the spree are not enticing in much of the city " combination " drains , which are over a century old , are used to transport both rain water and household waste . they have not grown as quickly as the city , and simply do n't have the capacity to contain the sudden , violent downpours which fall over berlin up to 30 times each year .
the rainfall mixes with the city sewage and it all spills into the spree . it 's a rather disgusting problem that most people would prefer not to think about , except those who have taken it upon themselves to change it . " we have to set an example " for the past four years , ralf steeg , an engineer for landscape architecture and environmental planning , has been working on a way of improving not only the quality of the water in the spree , but consequently the quality of life for those who live on or near its banks . bildunterschrift : an example of a floating pontoon " spree 2011 " his solution , called " spree 2011 " is quite simple .
he plans to erect large overflow tanks in the form of floating pontoons at various points along a four-kilometer stretch of the spree , thus preventing human waste from overflowing into the river and giving the water a chance to regain its natural balance .
" germany is an important industrial nation , and we should be showing the world that we care about our environment .
and apart from that , i want to see berlin and the berliners thriving , i want them to have the chance to jump into a river to cool off , " steeg said . berlin , the water paradise some argue that berlin already has plenty of opportunities for a quick dip after work .
and when compared to cities such as london and paris , that may be true .
but for steeg , the argument is not watertight . bildunterschrift : " spree 2011 " futuristic bathing platform " the discussion about the necessity of being able to swim in the city center was concluded back in the 80s when it was decided that people should have the chance to relax on their doorsteps .
at the moment , you have to travel at least 30 minutes from the city center just to be able to swim , " steeg said .
traditionally , the spree was a bathers ' paradise .
back in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , the river was dotted with bathing facilities , and until 1925 , when they were all closed , berliners made good use of what they had .
steeg 's plans would return the river back beyond its former glory to give it a " water quality it has never had before " .
not about swimming stephan natz of the berlin water authority says the issue is not about " creating swimming facilities , but about improving the quality of the water , thus providing for the future of the city . "
he argues that although steeg 's project is a good idea , the cost could be disproportionate to the effect . bildunterschrift : the pontoons could be used as campsites or open air cinemas that said , the city water authorities have agreed to partially finance a 180,000 euro -lrb- $ 222,000 -rrb- viability study which , if successful , could take the project to the next phase , including the construction of a pilot prototype .
this is where the project ceases to just be a solution to an environmental problem , but a practical , aesthetically pleasing addition to the changing face of a european capital .
steeg , who was named engineer of the year this week , foresees the floating pontoons being used as cafés , restaurants , campsites , bathing houses or even open-air cinema , all of which would generate income for the city . time is of the essence the innovative idea is in step with many other initiatives which have sprung up on the banks of the river in an attempt to give it the same kind of pulse enjoyed by other european cities .
but dr. dietrich jahn , who runs the planning department of the berlin senate , says that although there is currently no necessity to prettify the river , it is a long-term goal worth hanging on to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spree to be ?
" there are industrial ruins up and down the banks of the spree , and we need to fill them .
a berlin beach life could be a very special thing , and although the financial crisis in berlin means it would be hard to finance the project at the moment , we should n't lose sight of it , " he said .
but steeg is keen to get started , and if " spree 2011 " is to live up to its name , there 's not much time for deliberation . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in berlin , a river remade berlin 's river spree was long slighted by the city 's inhabitants , who saw it as little more than a murky cradle of industry .

come next week , the german city of cologne will be bursting at the seams as it plays host to some 800,000 pilgrims in town for world youth day .
local businesses are rubbing their hands in anticipation . tipped to be one of the largest religious gatherings ever in germany , world youth day is n't only inspiring spirituality in the city 's residents . the event is also spawning a decidedly commercial side , as regional companies try to cash in on the one-off economic opportunity by extending their opening hours .
but uwe klein , head of cologne ’ s retail association says the excitement is misplaced . " the people coming here are not going to have a lot of money .
the main object is to provide the visitors and guests with the basic essentials , which means food and drink , and of course souvenirs , " klein said . and much of the food will be provided by world youth day limited itself , which sets a good portion of its 100 million euros -lrb- $ 123 million -rrb- budget aside for catering . untypical tourists the economic development council in bonn suggests that a typical tourist will spend between 60 and 100 euros a day , but experts say that will not be the case with world youth day visitors .
matthias johnen , manager of the regional hoteliers association , says visitors at previous such events could be divided up in to three categories . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world youth day volunteers " we can safely assume from past experience that roughly one third of visitors will be coming to pray , another third will be here to sightsee and a final third will be here to shop , " johnen said . retailers and caterers have been preparing for this event for months and have a list of 25,000 benevolent volunteers ready to lend a hand when the queues get too long .
many restaurants have even promised to keep their prices down , and will be offering " pilgrim specials " at affordable prices . in search of the fat cash where local businesses are hoping to make their money is through the 6,000 journalists who are also expected to descend on the city for the event , and the day-trippers who are likely to roll up with rather fatter wallets than the pilgrims .
but nina schmedding , spokeswoman for world youth day , is reluctant to divide visitors into consumer types , and says that spending habits will vary from one event to another . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a time to prey or a time to shop ?
" there 's been no study on the behavior of the pilgrims .
i think a lot is going to depend on the weather , " she said . the general consensus , however , is that there should n't be too much emphasis on the economic side of the event , but that it should serve to raise the profile of the region .
after all , today ’ s pilgrims are potentially tomorrow 's tourists . max borowski -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tight security for pope 's youth gathering hundreds of thousands of young people are expected to flock to cologne in august to celebrate world youth day .

come next week , the german city of cologne will be bursting at the seams as it plays host to some 800,000 pilgrims in town for world youth day .
local businesses are rubbing their hands in anticipation . tipped to be one of the largest religious gatherings ever in germany , world youth day is n't only inspiring spirituality in the city 's residents . the event is also spawning a decidedly commercial side , as regional companies try to cash in on the one-off economic opportunity by extending their opening hours .
but uwe klein , head of cologne ’ s retail association says the excitement is misplaced . " the people coming here are not going to have a lot of money .
the main object is to provide the visitors and guests with the basic essentials , which means food and drink , and of course souvenirs , " klein said . and much of the food will be provided by world youth day limited itself , which sets a good portion of its 100 million euros -lrb- $ 123 million -rrb- budget aside for catering . untypical tourists the economic development council in bonn suggests that a typical tourist will spend between 60 and 100 euros a day , but experts say that will not be the case with world youth day visitors .
matthias johnen , manager of the regional hoteliers association , says visitors at previous such events could be divided up in to three categories . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world youth day volunteers " we can safely assume from past experience that roughly one third of visitors will be coming to pray , another third will be here to sightsee and a final third will be here to shop , " johnen said . retailers and caterers have been preparing for this event for months and have a list of 25,000 benevolent volunteers ready to lend a hand when the queues get too long .
many restaurants have even promised to keep their prices down , and will be offering " pilgrim specials " at affordable prices . in search of the fat cash where local businesses are hoping to make their money is through the 6,000 journalists who are also expected to descend on the city for the event , and the day-trippers who are likely to roll up with rather fatter wallets than the pilgrims .
but nina schmedding , spokeswoman for world youth day , is reluctant to divide visitors into consumer types , and says that spending habits will vary from one event to another . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a time to prey or a time to shop ?
" there 's been no study on the behavior of the pilgrims .
i think a lot is going to depend on the weather , " she said . the general consensus , however , is that there should n't be too much emphasis on the economic side of the event , but that it should serve to raise the profile of the region .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.08.2005 iran cuts seals on nuclear plant großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has fully resumed work at a uraniam conversion plant the german government has called on tehran to halt plans to resume uranium conversion , but to return to the negotiating table .
but iran has removed the seals at a key atomic plant , signalling that talks are over . the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- gave the final go-ahead for the removal of seals which it put on the uranium conversion facility on the outskirts of isfahan when iran suspended sensitive nuclear activities last november .
their removal , which means the facility can return to full capacity , raises the stakes in a standoff with the international community .
iran sparked grave international concern when it ended the nine-month suspension of uranium conversion on monday , but it was n't until the metal seals on key machinery were cut that the program really resumed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iaea inspectors sets surveillance equipment " we have started , " said iran 's atomic energy agency vice-president mohammad saidi .
" it is happening under the supervision of the agency . "
throughout the current escalation of tensions iran has been at pains to emphasize that it is resuming conversion activities in concert with the iaea , whose inspectors have installed surveillance equipment to monitor the process .
mindful of playing by international rules , iran waited for the agency to finish installing surveillance equipment before breaking the seals .
the iaea " told us in a letter that there was no obstacle and that -lrb- the agency -rrb- authorizes us to remove the seals , which will be returned to them afterwards , " said saidi .
pressure mounts for iran to backtrack the move comes as the european union tries to win approval at an emergency iaea meeting in vienna for a draft resolution calling on iran to reverse its decision to continue with the nuclear fuel work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea emergency meeting on iran 's latest nuclear activities indicating the difficulties of forging an agreement , a formal iaea meeting planned for wednesday was cancelled because diplomats remained locked in closed-door talks on the eu resolution .
" we are at a difficult stage of the process and the german government is very concerned about this development , " german government spokesman bela anda said . he expressed his hope that iran would still come to its senses and resume talks with britain , germany and france .
iran says no turning back iran had suspended uranium conversion and enrichment as a goodwill gesture during nine months of talks with the european union aimed at staving off un security council intervention .
the prospect of the talks succeeding has been dealt a severe blow by iran 's resumption . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has yet to appoint a new government but one of the candidates for the post of foreign minister , parliamentary foreign affairs committee head aleaddine boroujerdi , made clear there was no going back on the move .
he said the best guarantee that iran 's nuclear program is peaceful was the " infallible watching of the iaea cameras , " adding his hope that " the europeans will also accept this reality . "
he said the regime has still not made any decision on restarting iran 's uranium enrichment plant in the city of natanz .
enrichment remains suspended but officials emphasize this is only temporary .

" we are hoping to reconvene tomorrow -lrb- wednesday -rrb- afternoon , but it all very much depends on the iranians " . those hopes , however , received a blow when it was revealed by the head of iran 's nuclear energy agency that the seals that the un nuclear watchdog had placed on iran 's isfahan uranium conversion plant would be removed on wednesday .

" we are hoping to reconvene tomorrow -lrb- wednesday -rrb- afternoon , but it all very much depends on the iranians " . those hopes , however , received a blow when it was revealed by the head of iran 's nuclear energy agency that the seals that the un nuclear watchdog had placed on iran 's isfahan uranium conversion plant would be removed on wednesday .
iaea inspectors finished installing their surveillance cameras in the plant on tuesday . " the rest of seals will be removed today and the activities will resume , " said gholamreza aghazadeh was quoted as saying on state television .
breaking the seals is the next crucial stage at the plant after iran resumed suspended uranium conversion activities on monday , sparking warnings of an international crisis .
conversion turns uranium ore or yellowcake into a feed gas for enriching uranium , which can be the fuel for reactors or the explosive core of atom bombs .
bush remains " deeply suspicious " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meanwhile , speaking in crawford , texas , after the first day of the iaea talks , us president george w. bush warned iran that the threat of un sanctions over its nuclear activities remained , and made clear he was " deeply suspicious " of tehran 's stated intention to resume talks with a trio of european union states .
" we 'll have to watch very carefully , " bush told reporters . " they have , in the past , said they would adhere to international norms and then were caught enriching uranium .
and that 's dangerous . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director general of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- mohamed elbaradei according to diplomatic sources , the iaea board is unlikely to refer iran to the un security council because of its resumption of uranium conversion but will instead urge tehran to suspend work .
the meeting could last several days .
resolutions on the 35-nation board are normally adopted unanimously . in france , foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said : " it is still possible to negotiate " with iran .
" we are still holding out our hand , " he told journalists . iaea unlikely to recommend sanctions however , diplomats noted warnings that cracking down on iran could isolate the country and said the iaea board was backing away from referring it to the un security council , which could impose sanctions . malaysian ambassador rajmah hussein , speaking for the non-aligned movement , called on the europeans and iran " to continue with their dialogue " and said verification issues " should be resolved solely within the framework of the iaea . " but russia , which is building iran 's first nuclear power reactor and is to supply it with nuclear fuel , came out against iran , calling on it to halt fuel production work " without delay " . new president talks of " insult " at new deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranians have protested iaea inspections in the past in tehran on tuesday iran 's new president mahmood ahmadinejad described as " an insult " an eu offer to iran of trade and other incentives in return for guarantees it was not making nuclear weapons , but said he was still ready to carry on talks . and in vienna , iranian negotiator cyrus nasseri said iran was prepared to continue talks with the eu as long as there were no preconditions and the talks were in " good faith . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's bushehr nuclear power plant .
iran and russia signed a nuclear fuel agreement in february for iran to get its first reactor up and running .
nasseri said iran was frustrated the eu was still not acknowledging what iran considers its right under the non proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- to make nuclear fuel as part of a peaceful atomic program . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran resumes enrichment activity iranian technicians have taken the first steps to resume enrichment activity at its isfahan facility .
the german government has appealed to the mullahs in tehran to consider carefully the eu 's proposals .
eu says strike on iran a mistake a military strike against iran ’ s nuclear facilities would be a “ mistake , ” the european union ’ s foreign policy chief javier solana said and stressed the importance of continuing eu efforts at diplomatic engagement .
-lrb- feb .
6 , 2005 -rrb- iran 's top nuclear official strikes defiant note iran 's hassan rowhani saturday warned the us and europe of an oil crisis if tehran is sent before the un security council over its nuclear program , rejecting outright their demands to halt uranium enrichment .

explore cologne and beyond germany as a whole has a rich historical and cultural history but if one had to visit an area that contains all the diverse aspects of the country - the music , the art , the architecture and sights of historical importance - there would be few better places to head to than the western regions .
from the former industrial heartland of the ruhr valley , down the rhine to the home of the düsseldorf fashionistas and onto the roman city of cologne , vistors can enjoy a real cross-section of what germany has to offer .
further afield , there are other delights such as the border city of aachen - the gateway to belgium and the netherlands - and the wine region of the mosel .
a trip around the west of germany offers much in the way of ancient and modern culture .

today , its inhabitants pass their free time strutting around in designer clothes - and eating the best sushi in europe .
a picturesque pedal down the rhine you might not be winning the yellow jersey just yet , but cycling can still be a rewarding experience .
a tour by the rhine offers many delights - all taking a fraction of the energy needed to win the tour de france .
the ruhr valley : touring germany 's industrial past call it the unromantic road .

today , it is a mecca of history and culture .
essen : a changing industrial landscape essen 's moto for the european cultural capital bid is “ change through culture – culture through change ” .
for a city that has undergone many changes in its history , it is an apt slogan .
koblenz : good for getting over jet lag recovering from a long-haul flight can take some time .
koblenz 's handful of sites nearly fill the day but still leave time for a nap before dinner .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 10.08.2005 un watchdog continues iran deliberations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's cyrus nasseri talked of dialogue with the european union the un atomic agency continued emergency talks on iran 's nuclear ambitions on wednesday , after us president george w. bush expressed skepticism at signs tehran was ready to resume talks with european powers . on the first day of its meeting in vienna on tuesday , the watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- was unable to agree on a response to the islamic republic 's resumption on monday of sensitive nuclear activities . an iaea spokeswoman said the body planned to resume full talks on wednesday .
" we are hoping to reconvene tomorrow -lrb- wednesday -rrb- afternoon , but it all very much depends on the iranians " . those hopes , however , received a blow when it was revealed by the head of iran 's nuclear energy agency that the seals that the un nuclear watchdog had placed on iran 's isfahan uranium conversion plant would be removed on wednesday .
iaea inspectors finished installing their surveillance cameras in the plant on tuesday . " the rest of seals will be removed today and the activities will resume , " said gholamreza aghazadeh was quoted as saying on state television .
breaking the seals is the next crucial stage at the plant after iran resumed suspended uranium conversion activities on monday , sparking warnings of an international crisis .
conversion turns uranium ore or yellowcake into a feed gas for enriching uranium , which can be the fuel for reactors or the explosive core of atom bombs .
bush remains " deeply suspicious " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meanwhile , speaking in crawford , texas , after the first day of the iaea talks , us president george w. bush warned iran that the threat of un sanctions over its nuclear activities remained , and made clear he was " deeply suspicious " of tehran 's stated intention to resume talks with a trio of european union states .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.08.2005 sprucing up the spree großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future face of the river spree ?
berlin 's urban rejuvenation over the past few years may have put it back on the map with international tourists , but the facelift is n't finished , for there 's a rather dirty river running through the city center . the river spree travels almost four hundred kilometers through industrial wastelands , forests and fertile fields before reaching the german capital .
and as city rivers go , this one has an elegant , tame feel to it .
but the look is deceptive , for within its slender curves , the spree plays host to a barrage of bacteria .
the problem is not the result of unethical industrialists pumping factory waste into the water , since for the most part industry on the banks of the spree dried up many years ago .
the pollution actually arises through the continued use of an old-fashioned , inadequate sewage system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the murky waters of the spree are not enticing in much of the city " combination " drains , which are over a century old , are used to transport both rain water and household waste . they have not grown as quickly as the city , and simply do n't have the capacity to contain the sudden , violent downpours which fall over berlin up to 30 times each year .
the rainfall mixes with the city sewage and it all spills into the spree . it 's a rather disgusting problem that most people would prefer not to think about , except those who have taken it upon themselves to change it . " we have to set an example " for the past four years , ralf steeg , an engineer for landscape architecture and environmental planning , has been working on a way of improving not only the quality of the water in the spree , but consequently the quality of life for those who live on or near its banks . bildunterschrift : an example of a floating pontoon " spree 2011 " his solution , called " spree 2011 " is quite simple .

berlin 's urban rejuvenation over the past few years may have put it back on the map with international tourists , but the facelift is n't finished , for there 's a rather dirty river running through the city center . the river spree travels almost four hundred kilometers through industrial wastelands , forests and fertile fields before reaching the german capital .
and as city rivers go , this one has an elegant , tame feel to it .
but the look is deceptive , for within its slender curves , the spree plays host to a barrage of bacteria .
the problem is not the result of unethical industrialists pumping factory waste into the water , since for the most part industry on the banks of the spree dried up many years ago .
the pollution actually arises through the continued use of an old-fashioned , inadequate sewage system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the murky waters of the spree are not enticing in much of the city " combination " drains , which are over a century old , are used to transport both rain water and household waste . they have not grown as quickly as the city , and simply do n't have the capacity to contain the sudden , violent downpours which fall over berlin up to 30 times each year .
the rainfall mixes with the city sewage and it all spills into the spree . it 's a rather disgusting problem that most people would prefer not to think about , except those who have taken it upon themselves to change it . " we have to set an example " for the past four years , ralf steeg , an engineer for landscape architecture and environmental planning , has been working on a way of improving not only the quality of the water in the spree , but consequently the quality of life for those who live on or near its banks . bildunterschrift : an example of a floating pontoon " spree 2011 " his solution , called " spree 2011 " is quite simple .
he plans to erect large overflow tanks in the form of floating pontoons at various points along a four-kilometer stretch of the spree , thus preventing human waste from overflowing into the river and giving the water a chance to regain its natural balance .
" germany is an important industrial nation , and we should be showing the world that we care about our environment .

explore cologne and beyond germany as a whole has a rich historical and cultural history but if one had to visit an area that contains all the diverse aspects of the country - the music , the art , the architecture and sights of historical importance - there would be few better places to head to than the western regions .
from the former industrial heartland of the ruhr valley , down the rhine to the home of the düsseldorf fashionistas and onto the roman city of cologne , vistors can enjoy a real cross-section of what germany has to offer .
further afield , there are other delights such as the border city of aachen - the gateway to belgium and the netherlands - and the wine region of the mosel .
a trip around the west of germany offers much in the way of ancient and modern culture .
here dw-world offers a glimpse at the highlights of the western regions . dw-world.de düsseldorf : stop , shop and stroll düsseldorf has come a long way since its days as a fishing town on the rhine some 700 years ago .
today , its inhabitants pass their free time strutting around in designer clothes - and eating the best sushi in europe .
a picturesque pedal down the rhine you might not be winning the yellow jersey just yet , but cycling can still be a rewarding experience .
a tour by the rhine offers many delights - all taking a fraction of the energy needed to win the tour de france .
the ruhr valley : touring germany 's industrial past call it the unromantic road .
germany 's route of industrial heritage traverses the ruhr valley , once the coal-dust covered center of european heavy industry .
today , it is a mecca of history and culture .
essen : a changing industrial landscape essen 's moto for the european cultural capital bid is “ change through culture – culture through change ” .
for a city that has undergone many changes in its history , it is an apt slogan .
koblenz : good for getting over jet lag recovering from a long-haul flight can take some time .
koblenz 's handful of sites nearly fill the day but still leave time for a nap before dinner .

" we are hoping to reconvene tomorrow -lrb- wednesday -rrb- afternoon , but it all very much depends on the iranians " . those hopes , however , received a blow when it was revealed by the head of iran 's nuclear energy agency that the seals that the un nuclear watchdog had placed on iran 's isfahan uranium conversion plant would be removed on wednesday .
iaea inspectors finished installing their surveillance cameras in the plant on tuesday . " the rest of seals will be removed today and the activities will resume , " said gholamreza aghazadeh was quoted as saying on state television .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.08.2005 gm maize fight goes to court großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us seed firms want to grow in germany american biotech firms want to use legal action to force germany to approve their genetically modified maize for cultivation . the america seed companies monsanto and pioneer are trying to get provisional approval to cultivate their pest-resistant maize , mon 810 , in germany , according to german consumer protection authorities .
but alexander müller of the consumer protection office says he does n't believe that mon 810 can be legally approved as seed .
" it is not allowed under european law , " he told the german public broadcaster ard .
for the past seven years , mon 810 has been approved in the eu only as feed and as food .
cultivation of the crop was explicitly excluded .
but the eu commission , in contrast , says that mon 810 , also as seed , is legal and must be allowed to be used in germany , a commission spokeswoman told ard .
the maize has been included in the collective eu catalogue of allowable imports since 2004 , authorizing its use .
" it must be allowed to be imported into germany , " a spokeswoman for the european commission said .
spanish use contentious maize last year , the eu commission approved 17 types of maize in the mon 810 line after spain experienced no problems with its cultivation .
but according to müller , that approval might need to be examined by european court of justice , müller said .
" if our legal interpretation is correct , the spanish will have to see if their approval was legitimate . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many still oppose genetic tinkering the environmental watchdog group greenpeace is one of the groups opposed to the cultivation of mon 810 , saying that the crop can harm butterflies .
greece , austria , poland and hungary have not given the go-ahead for the cultivation of mon 810 .

" we are hoping to reconvene tomorrow -lrb- wednesday -rrb- afternoon , but it all very much depends on the iranians " . those hopes , however , received a blow when it was revealed by the head of iran 's nuclear energy agency that the seals that the un nuclear watchdog had placed on iran 's isfahan uranium conversion plant would be removed on wednesday .
iaea inspectors finished installing their surveillance cameras in the plant on tuesday . " the rest of seals will be removed today and the activities will resume , " said gholamreza aghazadeh was quoted as saying on state television .
breaking the seals is the next crucial stage at the plant after iran resumed suspended uranium conversion activities on monday , sparking warnings of an international crisis .
conversion turns uranium ore or yellowcake into a feed gas for enriching uranium , which can be the fuel for reactors or the explosive core of atom bombs .
bush remains " deeply suspicious " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meanwhile , speaking in crawford , texas , after the first day of the iaea talks , us president george w. bush warned iran that the threat of un sanctions over its nuclear activities remained , and made clear he was " deeply suspicious " of tehran 's stated intention to resume talks with a trio of european union states .
" we 'll have to watch very carefully , " bush told reporters . " they have , in the past , said they would adhere to international norms and then were caught enriching uranium .
and that 's dangerous . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director general of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- mohamed elbaradei according to diplomatic sources , the iaea board is unlikely to refer iran to the un security council because of its resumption of uranium conversion but will instead urge tehran to suspend work .
the meeting could last several days .
resolutions on the 35-nation board are normally adopted unanimously . in france , foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said : " it is still possible to negotiate " with iran .
" we are still holding out our hand , " he told journalists . iaea unlikely to recommend sanctions however , diplomats noted warnings that cracking down on iran could isolate the country and said the iaea board was backing away from referring it to the un security council , which could impose sanctions . malaysian ambassador rajmah hussein , speaking for the non-aligned movement , called on the europeans and iran " to continue with their dialogue " and said verification issues " should be resolved solely within the framework of the iaea . " but russia , which is building iran 's first nuclear power reactor and is to supply it with nuclear fuel , came out against iran , calling on it to halt fuel production work " without delay " . new president talks of " insult " at new deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranians have protested iaea inspections in the past in tehran on tuesday iran 's new president mahmood ahmadinejad described as " an insult " an eu offer to iran of trade and other incentives in return for guarantees it was not making nuclear weapons , but said he was still ready to carry on talks . and in vienna , iranian negotiator cyrus nasseri said iran was prepared to continue talks with the eu as long as there were no preconditions and the talks were in " good faith . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's bushehr nuclear power plant .
iran and russia signed a nuclear fuel agreement in february for iran to get its first reactor up and running .
nasseri said iran was frustrated the eu was still not acknowledging what iran considers its right under the non proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- to make nuclear fuel as part of a peaceful atomic program . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran resumes enrichment activity iranian technicians have taken the first steps to resume enrichment activity at its isfahan facility .
the german government has appealed to the mullahs in tehran to consider carefully the eu 's proposals .

could this be a return to the bad old days ? " could the sun be setting on germany 's bright new dawn ? " that was the question being posed in the sports pages of the german press on wednesday .
after initial signs suggesting that national team coach jürgen klinsmann was going to revolutionize an ailing and aging germany by blooding exciting but untried youngsters at international level , a creeping anxiety began to spread when klinsmann announced that young guns lukas podolski and bastian schweinsteiger would not be traveling with his latest squad .
the germany contingent who will head to the netherlands for a high profile friendly against the dutch in rotterdam on august 17 will be without the two youngsters who lit up germany 's confederations cup campaign in june .
they offered hope to a nation with huge expectations ahead of the world cup to be played on home soil next summer .
klinsmann has completely omitted 20-year-old fc cologne striker " poldi " and his bayern munich buddy " schweini " , 21 , from the traveling party and has padded the squad with experience in the form of seasoned warriors didi hamann , christian wörns and oliver neuville .
klinsmann has also opted for an established face up front with the not-exactly-decrepit miroslav klose , 28 .
he is returning to the attacking line for the first time since the 1-0 win over slovenia in march in the absence of another of klinsi 's colts , the suspended mike hanke .

arsenal 's jens lehmann will be between the sticks against the dutch with oli kahn rested on the bench .
no return to the past , a glance to the future but for all those fearing the return to the creaky old days , the reason for the omission of those central to germany 's youth revolution is not cold feet but achy ones .
not a man to abandon his reforms so easily , klinsmann is still looking to the future by resting his young stars with a view to keeping them as fresh as possible for the world cup to come .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bastian schweinsteiger after consulting bayern boss felix magath , klinsmann decided it would be best to allow schweinsteiger 's tender achilles problem to heal properly by leaving the midfielder at home .
podolski , who has barely had any rest since helping his team win promotion at the end of the last bundesliga season , gets a well-earned breather with a view to returning to international duty on september 3 in the friendly fixture with slovakia in bratislava .
meanwhile , hildebrand is likely to get a good run in the team to make his case for the number one jersey in the next six games , according to klinsmann .
hardly a team pushing the age barrier despite the absence of podolski , schweinsteiger , hanke and hildebrand in the team expected to face the netherlands , the german team is hardly one full of pensioners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian wörns apart from 34-year old wörns -lrb- photo -rrb- , the defenders in the germany squad are : arne friedrich , andreas hinkel , thomas hitzlsperger , robert huth and per mertesacker - all young players in their early twenties who have usurped the old guard since klinsmann took over .
youth dominates all areas of the squad the midfield players are no old men either .
tim borowski and sebastian deisler are both 25 , while fabian ernst is 26 .
captain michael ballack is a relative oldie at 28 , as is 29-year-old thorsten frings .
bernd schneider and didi hamann , both 31 , look positively ancient in comparison .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver neuville the 32-year-old neuville -lrb- photo -rrb- is included in the attacking options alongside gerald asamoah , 27 , and 23-year-old kevin kuranyi .
whichever way cynical observers may look at it , the germany squad preparing to face holland is far from being too long in the tooth .
leaving the babies of the team behind for one match should be no reason to lament the passing of a new beginning . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de attacking mentality stays , klinsmann says germany have not had a reputation for playing attacking football over the years but jürgen klinsmann seems intent on winning the 2006 world cup by outscoring opponents .
-lrb- june 30 , 2005 -rrb- germany face world cup with optimism after crashing out of euro 2004 , germany were just glad to have qualified for the 2006 world cup as hosts but now there is a genuine belief that they can lift the trophy .

" we are hoping to reconvene tomorrow -lrb- wednesday -rrb- afternoon , but it all very much depends on the iranians " . those hopes , however , received a blow when it was revealed by the head of iran 's nuclear energy agency that the seals that the un nuclear watchdog had placed on iran 's isfahan uranium conversion plant would be removed on wednesday .
iaea inspectors finished installing their surveillance cameras in the plant on tuesday . " the rest of seals will be removed today and the activities will resume , " said gholamreza aghazadeh was quoted as saying on state television .
breaking the seals is the next crucial stage at the plant after iran resumed suspended uranium conversion activities on monday , sparking warnings of an international crisis .
conversion turns uranium ore or yellowcake into a feed gas for enriching uranium , which can be the fuel for reactors or the explosive core of atom bombs .
bush remains " deeply suspicious " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meanwhile , speaking in crawford , texas , after the first day of the iaea talks , us president george w. bush warned iran that the threat of un sanctions over its nuclear activities remained , and made clear he was " deeply suspicious " of tehran 's stated intention to resume talks with a trio of european union states .
" we 'll have to watch very carefully , " bush told reporters . " they have , in the past , said they would adhere to international norms and then were caught enriching uranium .
and that 's dangerous . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director general of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- mohamed elbaradei according to diplomatic sources , the iaea board is unlikely to refer iran to the un security council because of its resumption of uranium conversion but will instead urge tehran to suspend work .
the meeting could last several days .
resolutions on the 35-nation board are normally adopted unanimously . in france , foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said : " it is still possible to negotiate " with iran .
" we are still holding out our hand , " he told journalists . iaea unlikely to recommend sanctions however , diplomats noted warnings that cracking down on iran could isolate the country and said the iaea board was backing away from referring it to the un security council , which could impose sanctions . malaysian ambassador rajmah hussein , speaking for the non-aligned movement , called on the europeans and iran " to continue with their dialogue " and said verification issues " should be resolved solely within the framework of the iaea . " but russia , which is building iran 's first nuclear power reactor and is to supply it with nuclear fuel , came out against iran , calling on it to halt fuel production work " without delay " . new president talks of " insult " at new deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranians have protested iaea inspections in the past in tehran on tuesday iran 's new president mahmood ahmadinejad described as " an insult " an eu offer to iran of trade and other incentives in return for guarantees it was not making nuclear weapons , but said he was still ready to carry on talks . and in vienna , iranian negotiator cyrus nasseri said iran was prepared to continue talks with the eu as long as there were no preconditions and the talks were in " good faith . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's bushehr nuclear power plant .
iran and russia signed a nuclear fuel agreement in february for iran to get its first reactor up and running .
nasseri said iran was frustrated the eu was still not acknowledging what iran considers its right under the non proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- to make nuclear fuel as part of a peaceful atomic program . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran resumes enrichment activity iranian technicians have taken the first steps to resume enrichment activity at its isfahan facility .
the german government has appealed to the mullahs in tehran to consider carefully the eu 's proposals .
eu says strike on iran a mistake a military strike against iran ’ s nuclear facilities would be a “ mistake , ” the european union ’ s foreign policy chief javier solana said and stressed the importance of continuing eu efforts at diplomatic engagement .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 10.08.2005 old war horses return as young colts rest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukas podolski hugs fellow absentee bastian schweinsteiger waves of anxiety rippled through germany 's soccer community on wednesday when coach jürgen klinsmann announced that his two youngest stars would not be in his latest squad .
could this be a return to the bad old days ? " could the sun be setting on germany 's bright new dawn ? " that was the question being posed in the sports pages of the german press on wednesday .
after initial signs suggesting that national team coach jürgen klinsmann was going to revolutionize an ailing and aging germany by blooding exciting but untried youngsters at international level , a creeping anxiety began to spread when klinsmann announced that young guns lukas podolski and bastian schweinsteiger would not be traveling with his latest squad .
the germany contingent who will head to the netherlands for a high profile friendly against the dutch in rotterdam on august 17 will be without the two youngsters who lit up germany 's confederations cup campaign in june .
they offered hope to a nation with huge expectations ahead of the world cup to be played on home soil next summer .
klinsmann has completely omitted 20-year-old fc cologne striker " poldi " and his bayern munich buddy " schweini " , 21 , from the traveling party and has padded the squad with experience in the form of seasoned warriors didi hamann , christian wörns and oliver neuville .
klinsmann has also opted for an established face up front with the not-exactly-decrepit miroslav klose , 28 .
he is returning to the attacking line for the first time since the 1-0 win over slovenia in march in the absence of another of klinsi 's colts , the suspended mike hanke .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : timo hildebrand and number three stopper timo hildebrand returns to third in the pecking order after the 26-year old stuttgart keeper 's outing as first choice in the 2-2 draw with argentina in the confed cup .
arsenal 's jens lehmann will be between the sticks against the dutch with oli kahn rested on the bench .
no return to the past , a glance to the future but for all those fearing the return to the creaky old days , the reason for the omission of those central to germany 's youth revolution is not cold feet but achy ones .
not a man to abandon his reforms so easily , klinsmann is still looking to the future by resting his young stars with a view to keeping them as fresh as possible for the world cup to come .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bastian schweinsteiger after consulting bayern boss felix magath , klinsmann decided it would be best to allow schweinsteiger 's tender achilles problem to heal properly by leaving the midfielder at home .
podolski , who has barely had any rest since helping his team win promotion at the end of the last bundesliga season , gets a well-earned breather with a view to returning to international duty on september 3 in the friendly fixture with slovakia in bratislava .
meanwhile , hildebrand is likely to get a good run in the team to make his case for the number one jersey in the next six games , according to klinsmann .
hardly a team pushing the age barrier despite the absence of podolski , schweinsteiger , hanke and hildebrand in the team expected to face the netherlands , the german team is hardly one full of pensioners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian wörns apart from 34-year old wörns -lrb- photo -rrb- , the defenders in the germany squad are : arne friedrich , andreas hinkel , thomas hitzlsperger , robert huth and per mertesacker - all young players in their early twenties who have usurped the old guard since klinsmann took over .
youth dominates all areas of the squad the midfield players are no old men either .
tim borowski and sebastian deisler are both 25 , while fabian ernst is 26 .
captain michael ballack is a relative oldie at 28 , as is 29-year-old thorsten frings .
bernd schneider and didi hamann , both 31 , look positively ancient in comparison .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver neuville the 32-year-old neuville -lrb- photo -rrb- is included in the attacking options alongside gerald asamoah , 27 , and 23-year-old kevin kuranyi .
whichever way cynical observers may look at it , the germany squad preparing to face holland is far from being too long in the tooth .
leaving the babies of the team behind for one match should be no reason to lament the passing of a new beginning . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de attacking mentality stays , klinsmann says germany have not had a reputation for playing attacking football over the years but jürgen klinsmann seems intent on winning the 2006 world cup by outscoring opponents .
-lrb- june 30 , 2005 -rrb- germany face world cup with optimism after crashing out of euro 2004 , germany were just glad to have qualified for the 2006 world cup as hosts but now there is a genuine belief that they can lift the trophy .
-lrb- july 7 , 2005 -rrb- klinsi looks to blend experience with youth jürgen klinsmann 's german revolution may look to the recent past to plot success in the future as the national coach named some familiar faces in a provisional squad for germany 's next fixture in slovenia .

but iran has removed the seals at a key atomic plant , signalling that talks are over . the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- gave the final go-ahead for the removal of seals which it put on the uranium conversion facility on the outskirts of isfahan when iran suspended sensitive nuclear activities last november .
their removal , which means the facility can return to full capacity , raises the stakes in a standoff with the international community .
iran sparked grave international concern when it ended the nine-month suspension of uranium conversion on monday , but it was n't until the metal seals on key machinery were cut that the program really resumed .

throughout the current escalation of tensions iran has been at pains to emphasize that it is resuming conversion activities in concert with the iaea , whose inspectors have installed surveillance equipment to monitor the process .
mindful of playing by international rules , iran waited for the agency to finish installing surveillance equipment before breaking the seals .
the iaea " told us in a letter that there was no obstacle and that -lrb- the agency -rrb- authorizes us to remove the seals , which will be returned to them afterwards , " said saidi .

mindful of playing by international rules , iran waited for the agency to finish installing surveillance equipment before breaking the seals .
the iaea " told us in a letter that there was no obstacle and that -lrb- the agency -rrb- authorizes us to remove the seals , which will be returned to them afterwards , " said saidi .
pressure mounts for iran to backtrack the move comes as the european union tries to win approval at an emergency iaea meeting in vienna for a draft resolution calling on iran to reverse its decision to continue with the nuclear fuel work .

" we are at a difficult stage of the process and the german government is very concerned about this development , " german government spokesman bela anda said . he expressed his hope that iran would still come to its senses and resume talks with britain , germany and france .
iran says no turning back iran had suspended uranium conversion and enrichment as a goodwill gesture during nine months of talks with the european union aimed at staving off un security council intervention .
the prospect of the talks succeeding has been dealt a severe blow by iran 's resumption . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has yet to appoint a new government but one of the candidates for the post of foreign minister , parliamentary foreign affairs committee head aleaddine boroujerdi , made clear there was no going back on the move .
he said the best guarantee that iran 's nuclear program is peaceful was the " infallible watching of the iaea cameras , " adding his hope that " the europeans will also accept this reality . "
he said the regime has still not made any decision on restarting iran 's uranium enrichment plant in the city of natanz .
enrichment remains suspended but officials emphasize this is only temporary .
conversion turns uranium ore , or yellowcake , into a feed gas for making enriched uranium , which can be the fuel for reactors or the explosive core of atomic bombs . dw staff / afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany warns iran over nuclear program germany warned on monday that iran 's threat to defy the west and resume uranium enrichment activities which could be used to make nuclear weapons would torpedo talks between the european union and tehran .

but alexander müller of the consumer protection office says he does n't believe that mon 810 can be legally approved as seed .
" it is not allowed under european law , " he told the german public broadcaster ard .
for the past seven years , mon 810 has been approved in the eu only as feed and as food .
cultivation of the crop was explicitly excluded .
but the eu commission , in contrast , says that mon 810 , also as seed , is legal and must be allowed to be used in germany , a commission spokeswoman told ard .
the maize has been included in the collective eu catalogue of allowable imports since 2004 , authorizing its use .
" it must be allowed to be imported into germany , " a spokeswoman for the european commission said .
spanish use contentious maize last year , the eu commission approved 17 types of maize in the mon 810 line after spain experienced no problems with its cultivation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 10.08.2005 old war horses return as young colts rest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukas podolski hugs fellow absentee bastian schweinsteiger waves of anxiety rippled through germany 's soccer community on wednesday when coach jürgen klinsmann announced that his two youngest stars would not be in his latest squad .
could this be a return to the bad old days ? " could the sun be setting on germany 's bright new dawn ? " that was the question being posed in the sports pages of the german press on wednesday .
after initial signs suggesting that national team coach jürgen klinsmann was going to revolutionize an ailing and aging germany by blooding exciting but untried youngsters at international level , a creeping anxiety began to spread when klinsmann announced that young guns lukas podolski and bastian schweinsteiger would not be traveling with his latest squad .
the germany contingent who will head to the netherlands for a high profile friendly against the dutch in rotterdam on august 17 will be without the two youngsters who lit up germany 's confederations cup campaign in june .
they offered hope to a nation with huge expectations ahead of the world cup to be played on home soil next summer .
klinsmann has completely omitted 20-year-old fc cologne striker " poldi " and his bayern munich buddy " schweini " , 21 , from the traveling party and has padded the squad with experience in the form of seasoned warriors didi hamann , christian wörns and oliver neuville .
klinsmann has also opted for an established face up front with the not-exactly-decrepit miroslav klose , 28 .
he is returning to the attacking line for the first time since the 1-0 win over slovenia in march in the absence of another of klinsi 's colts , the suspended mike hanke .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : timo hildebrand and number three stopper timo hildebrand returns to third in the pecking order after the 26-year old stuttgart keeper 's outing as first choice in the 2-2 draw with argentina in the confed cup .
arsenal 's jens lehmann will be between the sticks against the dutch with oli kahn rested on the bench .
no return to the past , a glance to the future but for all those fearing the return to the creaky old days , the reason for the omission of those central to germany 's youth revolution is not cold feet but achy ones .
not a man to abandon his reforms so easily , klinsmann is still looking to the future by resting his young stars with a view to keeping them as fresh as possible for the world cup to come .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bastian schweinsteiger after consulting bayern boss felix magath , klinsmann decided it would be best to allow schweinsteiger 's tender achilles problem to heal properly by leaving the midfielder at home .
podolski , who has barely had any rest since helping his team win promotion at the end of the last bundesliga season , gets a well-earned breather with a view to returning to international duty on september 3 in the friendly fixture with slovakia in bratislava .
meanwhile , hildebrand is likely to get a good run in the team to make his case for the number one jersey in the next six games , according to klinsmann .
hardly a team pushing the age barrier despite the absence of podolski , schweinsteiger , hanke and hildebrand in the team expected to face the netherlands , the german team is hardly one full of pensioners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian wörns apart from 34-year old wörns -lrb- photo -rrb- , the defenders in the germany squad are : arne friedrich , andreas hinkel , thomas hitzlsperger , robert huth and per mertesacker - all young players in their early twenties who have usurped the old guard since klinsmann took over .
youth dominates all areas of the squad the midfield players are no old men either .
tim borowski and sebastian deisler are both 25 , while fabian ernst is 26 .
captain michael ballack is a relative oldie at 28 , as is 29-year-old thorsten frings .
bernd schneider and didi hamann , both 31 , look positively ancient in comparison .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver neuville the 32-year-old neuville -lrb- photo -rrb- is included in the attacking options alongside gerald asamoah , 27 , and 23-year-old kevin kuranyi .
whichever way cynical observers may look at it , the germany squad preparing to face holland is far from being too long in the tooth .
leaving the babies of the team behind for one match should be no reason to lament the passing of a new beginning . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de attacking mentality stays , klinsmann says germany have not had a reputation for playing attacking football over the years but jürgen klinsmann seems intent on winning the 2006 world cup by outscoring opponents .
-lrb- june 30 , 2005 -rrb- germany face world cup with optimism after crashing out of euro 2004 , germany were just glad to have qualified for the 2006 world cup as hosts but now there is a genuine belief that they can lift the trophy .
-lrb- july 7 , 2005 -rrb- klinsi looks to blend experience with youth jürgen klinsmann 's german revolution may look to the recent past to plot success in the future as the national coach named some familiar faces in a provisional squad for germany 's next fixture in slovenia .

but iran has removed the seals at a key atomic plant , signalling that talks are over . the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- gave the final go-ahead for the removal of seals which it put on the uranium conversion facility on the outskirts of isfahan when iran suspended sensitive nuclear activities last november .
their removal , which means the facility can return to full capacity , raises the stakes in a standoff with the international community .
iran sparked grave international concern when it ended the nine-month suspension of uranium conversion on monday , but it was n't until the metal seals on key machinery were cut that the program really resumed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iaea inspectors sets surveillance equipment " we have started , " said iran 's atomic energy agency vice-president mohammad saidi .
" it is happening under the supervision of the agency . "
throughout the current escalation of tensions iran has been at pains to emphasize that it is resuming conversion activities in concert with the iaea , whose inspectors have installed surveillance equipment to monitor the process .
mindful of playing by international rules , iran waited for the agency to finish installing surveillance equipment before breaking the seals .
the iaea " told us in a letter that there was no obstacle and that -lrb- the agency -rrb- authorizes us to remove the seals , which will be returned to them afterwards , " said saidi .
pressure mounts for iran to backtrack the move comes as the european union tries to win approval at an emergency iaea meeting in vienna for a draft resolution calling on iran to reverse its decision to continue with the nuclear fuel work .

could this be a return to the bad old days ? " could the sun be setting on germany 's bright new dawn ? " that was the question being posed in the sports pages of the german press on wednesday .
after initial signs suggesting that national team coach jürgen klinsmann was going to revolutionize an ailing and aging germany by blooding exciting but untried youngsters at international level , a creeping anxiety began to spread when klinsmann announced that young guns lukas podolski and bastian schweinsteiger would not be traveling with his latest squad .

meanwhile , gerhard schröder is cutting a confident figure on the campaign trail . germany 's conservative leadership came together in berlin on plan their remaining election strategy .
shifts in voter sentiment and a growing realization that millions of germans will wait until the last minute to decide who to vote for has added pressure on a faltering campaign that , until recently , looked like a cakewalk for christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- chief angela merkel . despite recent polls which put the cdu and its bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- about 14 points clear of chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats , the cdu / csu ticket is looking a less attractive option to many , mainly due to a number of high profile gaffes over the past few weeks . merkel was subjected to the first real criticism of the campaign for confusing " gross " and " net " wages in a television interview last week and then had to publicly rebuke one of her party members for insensitive remarks alluding to poor social and moral standards in the east of germany in the wake of the " dead babies " case that came to light soon after . new approach and campaign team bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservative leader angela merkel and bavarian governor edmund stoiber display their party 's platform during a news conference in berlin on monday , july 11 , 2005 focussing on their program for the expected september elections .
in a bid to get the cdu / csu show back on the road , merkel , csu chief edmund stoiber and cdu state premiers christian wulff and roland koch will convene in the capital to reassess the campaign strategy and formulate damage limitation plans as the run-in to the election heads for its final month . the meeting is also likely to include discussions on who should be part of merkel 's " competence team " for the last push towards polling day .
according to a report in die welt , at least two csu politicians are likely to be named in the new campaign team ; bavarian minister of the interior günther beckstein and vice-chairperson of the union faction in the bundestag , gerda hasselfeldt . after the meeting , merkel is to begin her campaign tour with the first of an estimated 40 rallies , beginning on wednesday afternoon in essen and cologne in the recently captured former-spd strong hold state of north-rhine westphalia . angie on tour bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservative party officials revealed that merkel 's election campaign will end on september 16 - two days before polling day - in the berlin tempodrom .
highlights of her tour are expected to be the cdu party congress in dortmund on august 28 and the csu equivalent on september 2-3 .
the following day , merkel takes on schröder in the only televised debate of the campaign . schröder himself will have a better idea by then how much the fallout from the recent mistakes and pitfalls experienced by his opponent will have helped his own campaign . the chancellor has apparently smelled blood and appeared invigorated for the upcoming fight in a recent television interview on bayerisches fernsehen .
" i think of everything except quitting , " he told interviewer sigmund gottlieb .
" i intensely believe that i can continue to lead the country further in its course . " schröder places trust in the voters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when questioned about the election chances of his spd-green party coalition , schröder confidently put his trust in the german people to recognize his efforts in pushing for painful reforms : " in the end , the people will go to the polling booths and consider who has shown the most courage . " the chancellor dismissed the increasingly popular discussion of a grand coalition of the cdu and spd .
" we should talk not about coalitions but work on making the spd the strongest party , " schröder said . he was equally dismissive of the new left party , the combination of the pds , the former east german communist party and former spd leftist rebels .
" this is just the pds fortified by those people who have fled from irresponsibility , " he said .
" we should not trust those who would disable germany 's foreign policy and would demand too much on the domestic front . " spd goes on the offensive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's combative style reflects the spd 's campaign plans which would include spending 32 million euros on its 40-day tour of germany in a bid to make the most of recent gains on the cdu . spd campaign manager kajo wasserhoevel announced on tuesday that the social democrats would attempt to capitalize on the recent cdu blunders which he said had given the spd a " tailwind " . " we 're going to turn the spotlight on merkel , " he said , showing journalists at a press conference in berlin new posters mocking merkel 's tax increase plans and raising doubts about her abilities . wasserhoevel added that he expected the trend of voters being turned off by the cdu 's candidate for chancellor to continue as the public take their first close look at merkel in the light of the recent adverse publicity . he also said that a growing trend for germans to decide at the last minute was filling the spd with confidence .
" the number of voters who do n't make their decision until the last 14 days is getting larger and larger , " he said .
" there 's an enormous potential there and we 've got to have the stamina to court them right up until election day .

meanwhile , gerhard schröder is cutting a confident figure on the campaign trail . germany 's conservative leadership came together in berlin on plan their remaining election strategy .
shifts in voter sentiment and a growing realization that millions of germans will wait until the last minute to decide who to vote for has added pressure on a faltering campaign that , until recently , looked like a cakewalk for christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- chief angela merkel . despite recent polls which put the cdu and its bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- about 14 points clear of chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats , the cdu / csu ticket is looking a less attractive option to many , mainly due to a number of high profile gaffes over the past few weeks . merkel was subjected to the first real criticism of the campaign for confusing " gross " and " net " wages in a television interview last week and then had to publicly rebuke one of her party members for insensitive remarks alluding to poor social and moral standards in the east of germany in the wake of the " dead babies " case that came to light soon after . new approach and campaign team bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservative leader angela merkel and bavarian governor edmund stoiber display their party 's platform during a news conference in berlin on monday , july 11 , 2005 focussing on their program for the expected september elections .
in a bid to get the cdu / csu show back on the road , merkel , csu chief edmund stoiber and cdu state premiers christian wulff and roland koch will convene in the capital to reassess the campaign strategy and formulate damage limitation plans as the run-in to the election heads for its final month . the meeting is also likely to include discussions on who should be part of merkel 's " competence team " for the last push towards polling day .
according to a report in die welt , at least two csu politicians are likely to be named in the new campaign team ; bavarian minister of the interior günther beckstein and vice-chairperson of the union faction in the bundestag , gerda hasselfeldt . after the meeting , merkel is to begin her campaign tour with the first of an estimated 40 rallies , beginning on wednesday afternoon in essen and cologne in the recently captured former-spd strong hold state of north-rhine westphalia . angie on tour bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservative party officials revealed that merkel 's election campaign will end on september 16 - two days before polling day - in the berlin tempodrom .
highlights of her tour are expected to be the cdu party congress in dortmund on august 28 and the csu equivalent on september 2-3 .
the following day , merkel takes on schröder in the only televised debate of the campaign . schröder himself will have a better idea by then how much the fallout from the recent mistakes and pitfalls experienced by his opponent will have helped his own campaign . the chancellor has apparently smelled blood and appeared invigorated for the upcoming fight in a recent television interview on bayerisches fernsehen .
" i think of everything except quitting , " he told interviewer sigmund gottlieb .
" i intensely believe that i can continue to lead the country further in its course . " schröder places trust in the voters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when questioned about the election chances of his spd-green party coalition , schröder confidently put his trust in the german people to recognize his efforts in pushing for painful reforms : " in the end , the people will go to the polling booths and consider who has shown the most courage . " the chancellor dismissed the increasingly popular discussion of a grand coalition of the cdu and spd .
" we should talk not about coalitions but work on making the spd the strongest party , " schröder said . he was equally dismissive of the new left party , the combination of the pds , the former east german communist party and former spd leftist rebels .
" this is just the pds fortified by those people who have fled from irresponsibility , " he said .
" we should not trust those who would disable germany 's foreign policy and would demand too much on the domestic front . " spd goes on the offensive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's combative style reflects the spd 's campaign plans which would include spending 32 million euros on its 40-day tour of germany in a bid to make the most of recent gains on the cdu . spd campaign manager kajo wasserhoevel announced on tuesday that the social democrats would attempt to capitalize on the recent cdu blunders which he said had given the spd a " tailwind " . " we 're going to turn the spotlight on merkel , " he said , showing journalists at a press conference in berlin new posters mocking merkel 's tax increase plans and raising doubts about her abilities . wasserhoevel added that he expected the trend of voters being turned off by the cdu 's candidate for chancellor to continue as the public take their first close look at merkel in the light of the recent adverse publicity . he also said that a growing trend for germans to decide at the last minute was filling the spd with confidence .
" the number of voters who do n't make their decision until the last 14 days is getting larger and larger , " he said .
" there 's an enormous potential there and we 've got to have the stamina to court them right up until election day .

but that has begun to change and action is being called for amid suggestions that german workers are partly to blame . the unemployment rate in austria has been rising since november , and has now reached the 6 percent mark .
exports are declining and the economy is stagnating .
it 's a sticky situation for the governing parties so close to upcoming regional elections , hence austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel 's hastily scheduled jobs conference this week .
it was the fourth this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian chancellor wolfgang schuessel the conference resulted in agreement on a program to boost regional investments , thus putting at least some of the more than 200,000 unemployed back to work . austrian labor and economy minister martin bartenstein believes the main reason for rising unemployment is weak economic growth , and says its crucial to increase investments in individual austrian regions , without affecting the current budget . " the package we agreed on has nothing to do with the budget .
first of all , we want to get something going to boost growth and jobs , and we also want to take advantage of the possibilities available through current financing by the european union until 2006 , " he said . more jobs yet more jobless the program would cost 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.48 billion -rrb- , with state and the federal government contributing in equal measure , and eu loans making up the rest , and would hopefully create some 20,000 jobs for austrians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german job-seekers head for the austrian alps even as things stand , austria has a pretty good rate of job creation at about one percent growth .

local businesses are rubbing their hands in anticipation . tipped to be one of the largest religious gatherings ever in germany , world youth day is n't only inspiring spirituality in the city 's residents . the event is also spawning a decidedly commercial side , as regional companies try to cash in on the one-off economic opportunity by extending their opening hours .

come next week , the german city of cologne will be bursting at the seams as it plays host to some 800,000 pilgrims in town for world youth day .
local businesses are rubbing their hands in anticipation . tipped to be one of the largest religious gatherings ever in germany , world youth day is n't only inspiring spirituality in the city 's residents . the event is also spawning a decidedly commercial side , as regional companies try to cash in on the one-off economic opportunity by extending their opening hours .
but uwe klein , head of cologne ’ s retail association says the excitement is misplaced . " the people coming here are not going to have a lot of money .
the main object is to provide the visitors and guests with the basic essentials , which means food and drink , and of course souvenirs , " klein said . and much of the food will be provided by world youth day limited itself , which sets a good portion of its 100 million euros -lrb- $ 123 million -rrb- budget aside for catering . untypical tourists the economic development council in bonn suggests that a typical tourist will spend between 60 and 100 euros a day , but experts say that will not be the case with world youth day visitors .
matthias johnen , manager of the regional hoteliers association , says visitors at previous such events could be divided up in to three categories . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world youth day volunteers " we can safely assume from past experience that roughly one third of visitors will be coming to pray , another third will be here to sightsee and a final third will be here to shop , " johnen said . retailers and caterers have been preparing for this event for months and have a list of 25,000 benevolent volunteers ready to lend a hand when the queues get too long .
many restaurants have even promised to keep their prices down , and will be offering " pilgrim specials " at affordable prices . in search of the fat cash where local businesses are hoping to make their money is through the 6,000 journalists who are also expected to descend on the city for the event , and the day-trippers who are likely to roll up with rather fatter wallets than the pilgrims .

berlin 's urban rejuvenation over the past few years may have put it back on the map with international tourists , but the facelift is n't finished , for there 's a rather dirty river running through the city center . the river spree travels almost four hundred kilometers through industrial wastelands , forests and fertile fields before reaching the german capital .
and as city rivers go , this one has an elegant , tame feel to it .
but the look is deceptive , for within its slender curves , the spree plays host to a barrage of bacteria .
the problem is not the result of unethical industrialists pumping factory waste into the water , since for the most part industry on the banks of the spree dried up many years ago .

the rainfall mixes with the city sewage and it all spills into the spree . it 's a rather disgusting problem that most people would prefer not to think about , except those who have taken it upon themselves to change it . " we have to set an example " for the past four years , ralf steeg , an engineer for landscape architecture and environmental planning , has been working on a way of improving not only the quality of the water in the spree , but consequently the quality of life for those who live on or near its banks . bildunterschrift : an example of a floating pontoon " spree 2011 " his solution , called " spree 2011 " is quite simple .
he plans to erect large overflow tanks in the form of floating pontoons at various points along a four-kilometer stretch of the spree , thus preventing human waste from overflowing into the river and giving the water a chance to regain its natural balance .
" germany is an important industrial nation , and we should be showing the world that we care about our environment .
and apart from that , i want to see berlin and the berliners thriving , i want them to have the chance to jump into a river to cool off , " steeg said . berlin , the water paradise some argue that berlin already has plenty of opportunities for a quick dip after work .

at the moment , you have to travel at least 30 minutes from the city center just to be able to swim , " steeg said .
traditionally , the spree was a bathers ' paradise .
back in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , the river was dotted with bathing facilities , and until 1925 , when they were all closed , berliners made good use of what they had .

this is where the project ceases to just be a solution to an environmental problem , but a practical , aesthetically pleasing addition to the changing face of a european capital .

berlin 's urban rejuvenation over the past few years may have put it back on the map with international tourists , but the facelift is n't finished , for there 's a rather dirty river running through the city center . the river spree travels almost four hundred kilometers through industrial wastelands , forests and fertile fields before reaching the german capital .
and as city rivers go , this one has an elegant , tame feel to it .
but the look is deceptive , for within its slender curves , the spree plays host to a barrage of bacteria .
the problem is not the result of unethical industrialists pumping factory waste into the water , since for the most part industry on the banks of the spree dried up many years ago .
the pollution actually arises through the continued use of an old-fashioned , inadequate sewage system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the murky waters of the spree are not enticing in much of the city " combination " drains , which are over a century old , are used to transport both rain water and household waste . they have not grown as quickly as the city , and simply do n't have the capacity to contain the sudden , violent downpours which fall over berlin up to 30 times each year .
the rainfall mixes with the city sewage and it all spills into the spree . it 's a rather disgusting problem that most people would prefer not to think about , except those who have taken it upon themselves to change it . " we have to set an example " for the past four years , ralf steeg , an engineer for landscape architecture and environmental planning , has been working on a way of improving not only the quality of the water in the spree , but consequently the quality of life for those who live on or near its banks . bildunterschrift : an example of a floating pontoon " spree 2011 " his solution , called " spree 2011 " is quite simple .
he plans to erect large overflow tanks in the form of floating pontoons at various points along a four-kilometer stretch of the spree , thus preventing human waste from overflowing into the river and giving the water a chance to regain its natural balance .
" germany is an important industrial nation , and we should be showing the world that we care about our environment .
and apart from that , i want to see berlin and the berliners thriving , i want them to have the chance to jump into a river to cool off , " steeg said . berlin , the water paradise some argue that berlin already has plenty of opportunities for a quick dip after work .
and when compared to cities such as london and paris , that may be true .
but for steeg , the argument is not watertight . bildunterschrift : " spree 2011 " futuristic bathing platform " the discussion about the necessity of being able to swim in the city center was concluded back in the 80s when it was decided that people should have the chance to relax on their doorsteps .

but alexander müller of the consumer protection office says he does n't believe that mon 810 can be legally approved as seed .
" it is not allowed under european law , " he told the german public broadcaster ard .
for the past seven years , mon 810 has been approved in the eu only as feed and as food .
cultivation of the crop was explicitly excluded .
but the eu commission , in contrast , says that mon 810 , also as seed , is legal and must be allowed to be used in germany , a commission spokeswoman told ard .
the maize has been included in the collective eu catalogue of allowable imports since 2004 , authorizing its use .
" it must be allowed to be imported into germany , " a spokeswoman for the european commission said .
spanish use contentious maize last year , the eu commission approved 17 types of maize in the mon 810 line after spain experienced no problems with its cultivation .
but according to müller , that approval might need to be examined by european court of justice , müller said .
" if our legal interpretation is correct , the spanish will have to see if their approval was legitimate . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many still oppose genetic tinkering the environmental watchdog group greenpeace is one of the groups opposed to the cultivation of mon 810 , saying that the crop can harm butterflies .
greece , austria , poland and hungary have not given the go-ahead for the cultivation of mon 810 .

" there 's not much research done on the risks of gm plants on the environment or on human health , " ulrike brendel , a greenpeace spokesperson for the gm issue , told dw-world .
germany approved the growing of genetically modified crops in germany last year under a controversial law that imposes strict penalties for possible violations of food-safety regulations .

but alexander müller of the consumer protection office says he does n't believe that mon 810 can be legally approved as seed .
" it is not allowed under european law , " he told the german public broadcaster ard .
for the past seven years , mon 810 has been approved in the eu only as feed and as food .
cultivation of the crop was explicitly excluded .
but the eu commission , in contrast , says that mon 810 , also as seed , is legal and must be allowed to be used in germany , a commission spokeswoman told ard .
the maize has been included in the collective eu catalogue of allowable imports since 2004 , authorizing its use .
" it must be allowed to be imported into germany , " a spokeswoman for the european commission said .
spanish use contentious maize last year , the eu commission approved 17 types of maize in the mon 810 line after spain experienced no problems with its cultivation .
but according to müller , that approval might need to be examined by european court of justice , müller said .
" if our legal interpretation is correct , the spanish will have to see if their approval was legitimate . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many still oppose genetic tinkering the environmental watchdog group greenpeace is one of the groups opposed to the cultivation of mon 810 , saying that the crop can harm butterflies .
greece , austria , poland and hungary have not given the go-ahead for the cultivation of mon 810 .
still , german regulators have been testing the line for several years .
regardless of the legal fight , the crop is already being cultivated in germany on a trial basis .
eu still wary on a global scale , the use of genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- crops is increasing , with the world ’ s overall area of approved gm crops now at well over 80 million hectares -lrb- 8 billion acres -rrb- .
so far , maize , soybeans , rapeseed and cotton account for the bulk of biotech crops on the market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the corn is being tested in germany but most eu member countries , including germany , have remained extremely wary of biotech crop technologies .
concerns include giving multinational corporations control of basic food products through gene patents , the possibility of spreading allergens through genetic manipulations and the spread of resistance to antibiotics used in genetic engineering - concerns that are shared by non-governmental organizations such as greenpeace .
" there 's not much research done on the risks of gm plants on the environment or on human health , " ulrike brendel , a greenpeace spokesperson for the gm issue , told dw-world .
germany approved the growing of genetically modified crops in germany last year under a controversial law that imposes strict penalties for possible violations of food-safety regulations .
the law also requires the labeling of foodstuffs produced with genetically modified organisms and allows conventional farmers to file for damages if other growers contaminating their fields with gm seeds . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gm corn protesters send message the issue of genetically-modified corn strikes a nerve with many europeans .

but iran has removed the seals at a key atomic plant , signalling that talks are over . the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- gave the final go-ahead for the removal of seals which it put on the uranium conversion facility on the outskirts of isfahan when iran suspended sensitive nuclear activities last november .
their removal , which means the facility can return to full capacity , raises the stakes in a standoff with the international community .
iran sparked grave international concern when it ended the nine-month suspension of uranium conversion on monday , but it was n't until the metal seals on key machinery were cut that the program really resumed .

" it is happening under the supervision of the agency . "
throughout the current escalation of tensions iran has been at pains to emphasize that it is resuming conversion activities in concert with the iaea , whose inspectors have installed surveillance equipment to monitor the process .
mindful of playing by international rules , iran waited for the agency to finish installing surveillance equipment before breaking the seals .
the iaea " told us in a letter that there was no obstacle and that -lrb- the agency -rrb- authorizes us to remove the seals , which will be returned to them afterwards , " said saidi .
pressure mounts for iran to backtrack the move comes as the european union tries to win approval at an emergency iaea meeting in vienna for a draft resolution calling on iran to reverse its decision to continue with the nuclear fuel work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea emergency meeting on iran 's latest nuclear activities indicating the difficulties of forging an agreement , a formal iaea meeting planned for wednesday was cancelled because diplomats remained locked in closed-door talks on the eu resolution .
" we are at a difficult stage of the process and the german government is very concerned about this development , " german government spokesman bela anda said . he expressed his hope that iran would still come to its senses and resume talks with britain , germany and france .
iran says no turning back iran had suspended uranium conversion and enrichment as a goodwill gesture during nine months of talks with the european union aimed at staving off un security council intervention .
the prospect of the talks succeeding has been dealt a severe blow by iran 's resumption . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has yet to appoint a new government but one of the candidates for the post of foreign minister , parliamentary foreign affairs committee head aleaddine boroujerdi , made clear there was no going back on the move .
he said the best guarantee that iran 's nuclear program is peaceful was the " infallible watching of the iaea cameras , " adding his hope that " the europeans will also accept this reality . "
he said the regime has still not made any decision on restarting iran 's uranium enrichment plant in the city of natanz .
enrichment remains suspended but officials emphasize this is only temporary .
conversion turns uranium ore , or yellowcake , into a feed gas for making enriched uranium , which can be the fuel for reactors or the explosive core of atomic bombs . dw staff / afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany warns iran over nuclear program germany warned on monday that iran 's threat to defy the west and resume uranium enrichment activities which could be used to make nuclear weapons would torpedo talks between the european union and tehran .

meanwhile , gerhard schröder is cutting a confident figure on the campaign trail . germany 's conservative leadership came together in berlin on plan their remaining election strategy .
shifts in voter sentiment and a growing realization that millions of germans will wait until the last minute to decide who to vote for has added pressure on a faltering campaign that , until recently , looked like a cakewalk for christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- chief angela merkel . despite recent polls which put the cdu and its bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- about 14 points clear of chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats , the cdu / csu ticket is looking a less attractive option to many , mainly due to a number of high profile gaffes over the past few weeks . merkel was subjected to the first real criticism of the campaign for confusing " gross " and " net " wages in a television interview last week and then had to publicly rebuke one of her party members for insensitive remarks alluding to poor social and moral standards in the east of germany in the wake of the " dead babies " case that came to light soon after . new approach and campaign team bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservative leader angela merkel and bavarian governor edmund stoiber display their party 's platform during a news conference in berlin on monday , july 11 , 2005 focussing on their program for the expected september elections .
in a bid to get the cdu / csu show back on the road , merkel , csu chief edmund stoiber and cdu state premiers christian wulff and roland koch will convene in the capital to reassess the campaign strategy and formulate damage limitation plans as the run-in to the election heads for its final month . the meeting is also likely to include discussions on who should be part of merkel 's " competence team " for the last push towards polling day .
according to a report in die welt , at least two csu politicians are likely to be named in the new campaign team ; bavarian minister of the interior günther beckstein and vice-chairperson of the union faction in the bundestag , gerda hasselfeldt . after the meeting , merkel is to begin her campaign tour with the first of an estimated 40 rallies , beginning on wednesday afternoon in essen and cologne in the recently captured former-spd strong hold state of north-rhine westphalia . angie on tour bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservative party officials revealed that merkel 's election campaign will end on september 16 - two days before polling day - in the berlin tempodrom .
highlights of her tour are expected to be the cdu party congress in dortmund on august 28 and the csu equivalent on september 2-3 .
the following day , merkel takes on schröder in the only televised debate of the campaign . schröder himself will have a better idea by then how much the fallout from the recent mistakes and pitfalls experienced by his opponent will have helped his own campaign . the chancellor has apparently smelled blood and appeared invigorated for the upcoming fight in a recent television interview on bayerisches fernsehen .

meanwhile , gerhard schröder is cutting a confident figure on the campaign trail . germany 's conservative leadership came together in berlin on plan their remaining election strategy .
shifts in voter sentiment and a growing realization that millions of germans will wait until the last minute to decide who to vote for has added pressure on a faltering campaign that , until recently , looked like a cakewalk for christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- chief angela merkel . despite recent polls which put the cdu and its bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- about 14 points clear of chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats , the cdu / csu ticket is looking a less attractive option to many , mainly due to a number of high profile gaffes over the past few weeks . merkel was subjected to the first real criticism of the campaign for confusing " gross " and " net " wages in a television interview last week and then had to publicly rebuke one of her party members for insensitive remarks alluding to poor social and moral standards in the east of germany in the wake of the " dead babies " case that came to light soon after . new approach and campaign team bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservative leader angela merkel and bavarian governor edmund stoiber display their party 's platform during a news conference in berlin on monday , july 11 , 2005 focussing on their program for the expected september elections .
in a bid to get the cdu / csu show back on the road , merkel , csu chief edmund stoiber and cdu state premiers christian wulff and roland koch will convene in the capital to reassess the campaign strategy and formulate damage limitation plans as the run-in to the election heads for its final month . the meeting is also likely to include discussions on who should be part of merkel 's " competence team " for the last push towards polling day .
according to a report in die welt , at least two csu politicians are likely to be named in the new campaign team ; bavarian minister of the interior günther beckstein and vice-chairperson of the union faction in the bundestag , gerda hasselfeldt . after the meeting , merkel is to begin her campaign tour with the first of an estimated 40 rallies , beginning on wednesday afternoon in essen and cologne in the recently captured former-spd strong hold state of north-rhine westphalia . angie on tour bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservative party officials revealed that merkel 's election campaign will end on september 16 - two days before polling day - in the berlin tempodrom .
highlights of her tour are expected to be the cdu party congress in dortmund on august 28 and the csu equivalent on september 2-3 .
the following day , merkel takes on schröder in the only televised debate of the campaign . schröder himself will have a better idea by then how much the fallout from the recent mistakes and pitfalls experienced by his opponent will have helped his own campaign . the chancellor has apparently smelled blood and appeared invigorated for the upcoming fight in a recent television interview on bayerisches fernsehen .
" i think of everything except quitting , " he told interviewer sigmund gottlieb .
" i intensely believe that i can continue to lead the country further in its course . " schröder places trust in the voters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when questioned about the election chances of his spd-green party coalition , schröder confidently put his trust in the german people to recognize his efforts in pushing for painful reforms : " in the end , the people will go to the polling booths and consider who has shown the most courage .

berlin 's urban rejuvenation over the past few years may have put it back on the map with international tourists , but the facelift is n't finished , for there 's a rather dirty river running through the city center . the river spree travels almost four hundred kilometers through industrial wastelands , forests and fertile fields before reaching the german capital .
and as city rivers go , this one has an elegant , tame feel to it .
but the look is deceptive , for within its slender curves , the spree plays host to a barrage of bacteria .
the problem is not the result of unethical industrialists pumping factory waste into the water , since for the most part industry on the banks of the spree dried up many years ago .
the pollution actually arises through the continued use of an old-fashioned , inadequate sewage system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the murky waters of the spree are not enticing in much of the city " combination " drains , which are over a century old , are used to transport both rain water and household waste . they have not grown as quickly as the city , and simply do n't have the capacity to contain the sudden , violent downpours which fall over berlin up to 30 times each year .
the rainfall mixes with the city sewage and it all spills into the spree . it 's a rather disgusting problem that most people would prefer not to think about , except those who have taken it upon themselves to change it . " we have to set an example " for the past four years , ralf steeg , an engineer for landscape architecture and environmental planning , has been working on a way of improving not only the quality of the water in the spree , but consequently the quality of life for those who live on or near its banks . bildunterschrift : an example of a floating pontoon " spree 2011 " his solution , called " spree 2011 " is quite simple .
he plans to erect large overflow tanks in the form of floating pontoons at various points along a four-kilometer stretch of the spree , thus preventing human waste from overflowing into the river and giving the water a chance to regain its natural balance .
" germany is an important industrial nation , and we should be showing the world that we care about our environment .
and apart from that , i want to see berlin and the berliners thriving , i want them to have the chance to jump into a river to cool off , " steeg said . berlin , the water paradise some argue that berlin already has plenty of opportunities for a quick dip after work .

traditionally , the spree was a bathers ' paradise .
back in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , the river was dotted with bathing facilities , and until 1925 , when they were all closed , berliners made good use of what they had .

not about swimming stephan natz of the berlin water authority says the issue is not about " creating swimming facilities , but about improving the quality of the water , thus providing for the future of the city . "
he argues that although steeg 's project is a good idea , the cost could be disproportionate to the effect . bildunterschrift : the pontoons could be used as campsites or open air cinemas that said , the city water authorities have agreed to partially finance a 180,000 euro -lrb- $ 222,000 -rrb- viability study which , if successful , could take the project to the next phase , including the construction of a pilot prototype .
this is where the project ceases to just be a solution to an environmental problem , but a practical , aesthetically pleasing addition to the changing face of a european capital .
steeg , who was named engineer of the year this week , foresees the floating pontoons being used as cafés , restaurants , campsites , bathing houses or even open-air cinema , all of which would generate income for the city . time is of the essence the innovative idea is in step with many other initiatives which have sprung up on the banks of the river in an attempt to give it the same kind of pulse enjoyed by other european cities .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 10.08.2005 un watchdog continues iran deliberations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's cyrus nasseri talked of dialogue with the european union the un atomic agency continued emergency talks on iran 's nuclear ambitions on wednesday , after us president george w. bush expressed skepticism at signs tehran was ready to resume talks with european powers . on the first day of its meeting in vienna on tuesday , the watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- was unable to agree on a response to the islamic republic 's resumption on monday of sensitive nuclear activities . an iaea spokeswoman said the body planned to resume full talks on wednesday .
" we are hoping to reconvene tomorrow -lrb- wednesday -rrb- afternoon , but it all very much depends on the iranians " . those hopes , however , received a blow when it was revealed by the head of iran 's nuclear energy agency that the seals that the un nuclear watchdog had placed on iran 's isfahan uranium conversion plant would be removed on wednesday .
iaea inspectors finished installing their surveillance cameras in the plant on tuesday . " the rest of seals will be removed today and the activities will resume , " said gholamreza aghazadeh was quoted as saying on state television .
breaking the seals is the next crucial stage at the plant after iran resumed suspended uranium conversion activities on monday , sparking warnings of an international crisis .
conversion turns uranium ore or yellowcake into a feed gas for enriching uranium , which can be the fuel for reactors or the explosive core of atom bombs .
bush remains " deeply suspicious " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meanwhile , speaking in crawford , texas , after the first day of the iaea talks , us president george w. bush warned iran that the threat of un sanctions over its nuclear activities remained , and made clear he was " deeply suspicious " of tehran 's stated intention to resume talks with a trio of european union states .
" we 'll have to watch very carefully , " bush told reporters . " they have , in the past , said they would adhere to international norms and then were caught enriching uranium .
and that 's dangerous . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director general of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- mohamed elbaradei according to diplomatic sources , the iaea board is unlikely to refer iran to the un security council because of its resumption of uranium conversion but will instead urge tehran to suspend work .
the meeting could last several days .
resolutions on the 35-nation board are normally adopted unanimously . in france , foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said : " it is still possible to negotiate " with iran .
" we are still holding out our hand , " he told journalists . iaea unlikely to recommend sanctions however , diplomats noted warnings that cracking down on iran could isolate the country and said the iaea board was backing away from referring it to the un security council , which could impose sanctions . malaysian ambassador rajmah hussein , speaking for the non-aligned movement , called on the europeans and iran " to continue with their dialogue " and said verification issues " should be resolved solely within the framework of the iaea . " but russia , which is building iran 's first nuclear power reactor and is to supply it with nuclear fuel , came out against iran , calling on it to halt fuel production work " without delay " . new president talks of " insult " at new deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranians have protested iaea inspections in the past in tehran on tuesday iran 's new president mahmood ahmadinejad described as " an insult " an eu offer to iran of trade and other incentives in return for guarantees it was not making nuclear weapons , but said he was still ready to carry on talks . and in vienna , iranian negotiator cyrus nasseri said iran was prepared to continue talks with the eu as long as there were no preconditions and the talks were in " good faith . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's bushehr nuclear power plant .
iran and russia signed a nuclear fuel agreement in february for iran to get its first reactor up and running .
nasseri said iran was frustrated the eu was still not acknowledging what iran considers its right under the non proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- to make nuclear fuel as part of a peaceful atomic program . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran resumes enrichment activity iranian technicians have taken the first steps to resume enrichment activity at its isfahan facility .
the german government has appealed to the mullahs in tehran to consider carefully the eu 's proposals .

" we are hoping to reconvene tomorrow -lrb- wednesday -rrb- afternoon , but it all very much depends on the iranians " . those hopes , however , received a blow when it was revealed by the head of iran 's nuclear energy agency that the seals that the un nuclear watchdog had placed on iran 's isfahan uranium conversion plant would be removed on wednesday .
iaea inspectors finished installing their surveillance cameras in the plant on tuesday . " the rest of seals will be removed today and the activities will resume , " said gholamreza aghazadeh was quoted as saying on state television .
breaking the seals is the next crucial stage at the plant after iran resumed suspended uranium conversion activities on monday , sparking warnings of an international crisis .

explore cologne and beyond germany as a whole has a rich historical and cultural history but if one had to visit an area that contains all the diverse aspects of the country - the music , the art , the architecture and sights of historical importance - there would be few better places to head to than the western regions .
from the former industrial heartland of the ruhr valley , down the rhine to the home of the düsseldorf fashionistas and onto the roman city of cologne , vistors can enjoy a real cross-section of what germany has to offer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.08.2005 iran cuts seals on nuclear plant großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has fully resumed work at a uraniam conversion plant the german government has called on tehran to halt plans to resume uranium conversion , but to return to the negotiating table .
but iran has removed the seals at a key atomic plant , signalling that talks are over . the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- gave the final go-ahead for the removal of seals which it put on the uranium conversion facility on the outskirts of isfahan when iran suspended sensitive nuclear activities last november .
their removal , which means the facility can return to full capacity , raises the stakes in a standoff with the international community .
iran sparked grave international concern when it ended the nine-month suspension of uranium conversion on monday , but it was n't until the metal seals on key machinery were cut that the program really resumed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iaea inspectors sets surveillance equipment " we have started , " said iran 's atomic energy agency vice-president mohammad saidi .
" it is happening under the supervision of the agency . "
throughout the current escalation of tensions iran has been at pains to emphasize that it is resuming conversion activities in concert with the iaea , whose inspectors have installed surveillance equipment to monitor the process .
mindful of playing by international rules , iran waited for the agency to finish installing surveillance equipment before breaking the seals .
the iaea " told us in a letter that there was no obstacle and that -lrb- the agency -rrb- authorizes us to remove the seals , which will be returned to them afterwards , " said saidi .
pressure mounts for iran to backtrack the move comes as the european union tries to win approval at an emergency iaea meeting in vienna for a draft resolution calling on iran to reverse its decision to continue with the nuclear fuel work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea emergency meeting on iran 's latest nuclear activities indicating the difficulties of forging an agreement , a formal iaea meeting planned for wednesday was cancelled because diplomats remained locked in closed-door talks on the eu resolution .
" we are at a difficult stage of the process and the german government is very concerned about this development , " german government spokesman bela anda said . he expressed his hope that iran would still come to its senses and resume talks with britain , germany and france .
iran says no turning back iran had suspended uranium conversion and enrichment as a goodwill gesture during nine months of talks with the european union aimed at staving off un security council intervention .
the prospect of the talks succeeding has been dealt a severe blow by iran 's resumption . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has yet to appoint a new government but one of the candidates for the post of foreign minister , parliamentary foreign affairs committee head aleaddine boroujerdi , made clear there was no going back on the move .
he said the best guarantee that iran 's nuclear program is peaceful was the " infallible watching of the iaea cameras , " adding his hope that " the europeans will also accept this reality . "
he said the regime has still not made any decision on restarting iran 's uranium enrichment plant in the city of natanz .
enrichment remains suspended but officials emphasize this is only temporary .
conversion turns uranium ore , or yellowcake , into a feed gas for making enriched uranium , which can be the fuel for reactors or the explosive core of atomic bombs . dw staff / afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany warns iran over nuclear program germany warned on monday that iran 's threat to defy the west and resume uranium enrichment activities which could be used to make nuclear weapons would torpedo talks between the european union and tehran .

but iran has removed the seals at a key atomic plant , signalling that talks are over . the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- gave the final go-ahead for the removal of seals which it put on the uranium conversion facility on the outskirts of isfahan when iran suspended sensitive nuclear activities last november .
their removal , which means the facility can return to full capacity , raises the stakes in a standoff with the international community .
iran sparked grave international concern when it ended the nine-month suspension of uranium conversion on monday , but it was n't until the metal seals on key machinery were cut that the program really resumed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iaea inspectors sets surveillance equipment " we have started , " said iran 's atomic energy agency vice-president mohammad saidi .
" it is happening under the supervision of the agency . "
throughout the current escalation of tensions iran has been at pains to emphasize that it is resuming conversion activities in concert with the iaea , whose inspectors have installed surveillance equipment to monitor the process .
mindful of playing by international rules , iran waited for the agency to finish installing surveillance equipment before breaking the seals .
the iaea " told us in a letter that there was no obstacle and that -lrb- the agency -rrb- authorizes us to remove the seals , which will be returned to them afterwards , " said saidi .
pressure mounts for iran to backtrack the move comes as the european union tries to win approval at an emergency iaea meeting in vienna for a draft resolution calling on iran to reverse its decision to continue with the nuclear fuel work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea emergency meeting on iran 's latest nuclear activities indicating the difficulties of forging an agreement , a formal iaea meeting planned for wednesday was cancelled because diplomats remained locked in closed-door talks on the eu resolution .
" we are at a difficult stage of the process and the german government is very concerned about this development , " german government spokesman bela anda said . he expressed his hope that iran would still come to its senses and resume talks with britain , germany and france .
iran says no turning back iran had suspended uranium conversion and enrichment as a goodwill gesture during nine months of talks with the european union aimed at staving off un security council intervention .

he said the best guarantee that iran 's nuclear program is peaceful was the " infallible watching of the iaea cameras , " adding his hope that " the europeans will also accept this reality . "
he said the regime has still not made any decision on restarting iran 's uranium enrichment plant in the city of natanz .
enrichment remains suspended but officials emphasize this is only temporary .

but that has begun to change and action is being called for amid suggestions that german workers are partly to blame . the unemployment rate in austria has been rising since november , and has now reached the 6 percent mark .
exports are declining and the economy is stagnating .
it 's a sticky situation for the governing parties so close to upcoming regional elections , hence austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel 's hastily scheduled jobs conference this week .
it was the fourth this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian chancellor wolfgang schuessel the conference resulted in agreement on a program to boost regional investments , thus putting at least some of the more than 200,000 unemployed back to work . austrian labor and economy minister martin bartenstein believes the main reason for rising unemployment is weak economic growth , and says its crucial to increase investments in individual austrian regions , without affecting the current budget . " the package we agreed on has nothing to do with the budget .
first of all , we want to get something going to boost growth and jobs , and we also want to take advantage of the possibilities available through current financing by the european union until 2006 , " he said . more jobs yet more jobless the program would cost 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.48 billion -rrb- , with state and the federal government contributing in equal measure , and eu loans making up the rest , and would hopefully create some 20,000 jobs for austrians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german job-seekers head for the austrian alps even as things stand , austria has a pretty good rate of job creation at about one percent growth .
that 's between 30,000 and 35,000 new positions opened up each year .
but even so , the number of unemployed is on the rise . according to austrian media , germans are partially responsible for this predicament , with many unemployed germans who can not find work at home heading south of the border to earn their crust in austria .

come next week , the german city of cologne will be bursting at the seams as it plays host to some 800,000 pilgrims in town for world youth day .
local businesses are rubbing their hands in anticipation . tipped to be one of the largest religious gatherings ever in germany , world youth day is n't only inspiring spirituality in the city 's residents . the event is also spawning a decidedly commercial side , as regional companies try to cash in on the one-off economic opportunity by extending their opening hours .

many restaurants have even promised to keep their prices down , and will be offering " pilgrim specials " at affordable prices . in search of the fat cash where local businesses are hoping to make their money is through the 6,000 journalists who are also expected to descend on the city for the event , and the day-trippers who are likely to roll up with rather fatter wallets than the pilgrims .

come next week , the german city of cologne will be bursting at the seams as it plays host to some 800,000 pilgrims in town for world youth day .
local businesses are rubbing their hands in anticipation . tipped to be one of the largest religious gatherings ever in germany , world youth day is n't only inspiring spirituality in the city 's residents . the event is also spawning a decidedly commercial side , as regional companies try to cash in on the one-off economic opportunity by extending their opening hours .
but uwe klein , head of cologne ’ s retail association says the excitement is misplaced . " the people coming here are not going to have a lot of money .
the main object is to provide the visitors and guests with the basic essentials , which means food and drink , and of course souvenirs , " klein said . and much of the food will be provided by world youth day limited itself , which sets a good portion of its 100 million euros -lrb- $ 123 million -rrb- budget aside for catering . untypical tourists the economic development council in bonn suggests that a typical tourist will spend between 60 and 100 euros a day , but experts say that will not be the case with world youth day visitors .
matthias johnen , manager of the regional hoteliers association , says visitors at previous such events could be divided up in to three categories . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world youth day volunteers " we can safely assume from past experience that roughly one third of visitors will be coming to pray , another third will be here to sightsee and a final third will be here to shop , " johnen said . retailers and caterers have been preparing for this event for months and have a list of 25,000 benevolent volunteers ready to lend a hand when the queues get too long .
many restaurants have even promised to keep their prices down , and will be offering " pilgrim specials " at affordable prices . in search of the fat cash where local businesses are hoping to make their money is through the 6,000 journalists who are also expected to descend on the city for the event , and the day-trippers who are likely to roll up with rather fatter wallets than the pilgrims .
but nina schmedding , spokeswoman for world youth day , is reluctant to divide visitors into consumer types , and says that spending habits will vary from one event to another . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a time to prey or a time to shop ?
" there 's been no study on the behavior of the pilgrims .
i think a lot is going to depend on the weather , " she said . the general consensus , however , is that there should n't be too much emphasis on the economic side of the event , but that it should serve to raise the profile of the region .

but iran has removed the seals at a key atomic plant , signalling that talks are over . the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- gave the final go-ahead for the removal of seals which it put on the uranium conversion facility on the outskirts of isfahan when iran suspended sensitive nuclear activities last november .
their removal , which means the facility can return to full capacity , raises the stakes in a standoff with the international community .
iran sparked grave international concern when it ended the nine-month suspension of uranium conversion on monday , but it was n't until the metal seals on key machinery were cut that the program really resumed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iaea inspectors sets surveillance equipment " we have started , " said iran 's atomic energy agency vice-president mohammad saidi .
" it is happening under the supervision of the agency . "
throughout the current escalation of tensions iran has been at pains to emphasize that it is resuming conversion activities in concert with the iaea , whose inspectors have installed surveillance equipment to monitor the process .
mindful of playing by international rules , iran waited for the agency to finish installing surveillance equipment before breaking the seals .
the iaea " told us in a letter that there was no obstacle and that -lrb- the agency -rrb- authorizes us to remove the seals , which will be returned to them afterwards , " said saidi .
pressure mounts for iran to backtrack the move comes as the european union tries to win approval at an emergency iaea meeting in vienna for a draft resolution calling on iran to reverse its decision to continue with the nuclear fuel work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea emergency meeting on iran 's latest nuclear activities indicating the difficulties of forging an agreement , a formal iaea meeting planned for wednesday was cancelled because diplomats remained locked in closed-door talks on the eu resolution .
" we are at a difficult stage of the process and the german government is very concerned about this development , " german government spokesman bela anda said . he expressed his hope that iran would still come to its senses and resume talks with britain , germany and france .
iran says no turning back iran had suspended uranium conversion and enrichment as a goodwill gesture during nine months of talks with the european union aimed at staving off un security council intervention .
the prospect of the talks succeeding has been dealt a severe blow by iran 's resumption . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has yet to appoint a new government but one of the candidates for the post of foreign minister , parliamentary foreign affairs committee head aleaddine boroujerdi , made clear there was no going back on the move .
he said the best guarantee that iran 's nuclear program is peaceful was the " infallible watching of the iaea cameras , " adding his hope that " the europeans will also accept this reality . "
he said the regime has still not made any decision on restarting iran 's uranium enrichment plant in the city of natanz .
enrichment remains suspended but officials emphasize this is only temporary .
conversion turns uranium ore , or yellowcake , into a feed gas for making enriched uranium , which can be the fuel for reactors or the explosive core of atomic bombs . dw staff / afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany warns iran over nuclear program germany warned on monday that iran 's threat to defy the west and resume uranium enrichment activities which could be used to make nuclear weapons would torpedo talks between the european union and tehran .

meanwhile , hildebrand is likely to get a good run in the team to make his case for the number one jersey in the next six games , according to klinsmann .
hardly a team pushing the age barrier despite the absence of podolski , schweinsteiger , hanke and hildebrand in the team expected to face the netherlands , the german team is hardly one full of pensioners .

youth dominates all areas of the squad the midfield players are no old men either .
tim borowski and sebastian deisler are both 25 , while fabian ernst is 26 .
captain michael ballack is a relative oldie at 28 , as is 29-year-old thorsten frings .
bernd schneider and didi hamann , both 31 , look positively ancient in comparison .

whichever way cynical observers may look at it , the germany squad preparing to face holland is far from being too long in the tooth .
leaving the babies of the team behind for one match should be no reason to lament the passing of a new beginning . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de attacking mentality stays , klinsmann says germany have not had a reputation for playing attacking football over the years but jürgen klinsmann seems intent on winning the 2006 world cup by outscoring opponents .
-lrb- june 30 , 2005 -rrb- germany face world cup with optimism after crashing out of euro 2004 , germany were just glad to have qualified for the 2006 world cup as hosts but now there is a genuine belief that they can lift the trophy .

but alexander müller of the consumer protection office says he does n't believe that mon 810 can be legally approved as seed .
" it is not allowed under european law , " he told the german public broadcaster ard .
for the past seven years , mon 810 has been approved in the eu only as feed and as food .
cultivation of the crop was explicitly excluded .
but the eu commission , in contrast , says that mon 810 , also as seed , is legal and must be allowed to be used in germany , a commission spokeswoman told ard .
the maize has been included in the collective eu catalogue of allowable imports since 2004 , authorizing its use .
" it must be allowed to be imported into germany , " a spokeswoman for the european commission said .
spanish use contentious maize last year , the eu commission approved 17 types of maize in the mon 810 line after spain experienced no problems with its cultivation .
but according to müller , that approval might need to be examined by european court of justice , müller said .
" if our legal interpretation is correct , the spanish will have to see if their approval was legitimate . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the corn is being tested in germany but most eu member countries , including germany , have remained extremely wary of biotech crop technologies .
concerns include giving multinational corporations control of basic food products through gene patents , the possibility of spreading allergens through genetic manipulations and the spread of resistance to antibiotics used in genetic engineering - concerns that are shared by non-governmental organizations such as greenpeace .
" there 's not much research done on the risks of gm plants on the environment or on human health , " ulrike brendel , a greenpeace spokesperson for the gm issue , told dw-world .
germany approved the growing of genetically modified crops in germany last year under a controversial law that imposes strict penalties for possible violations of food-safety regulations .

but that has begun to change and action is being called for amid suggestions that german workers are partly to blame . the unemployment rate in austria has been rising since november , and has now reached the 6 percent mark .
exports are declining and the economy is stagnating .
it 's a sticky situation for the governing parties so close to upcoming regional elections , hence austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel 's hastily scheduled jobs conference this week .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian chancellor wolfgang schuessel the conference resulted in agreement on a program to boost regional investments , thus putting at least some of the more than 200,000 unemployed back to work . austrian labor and economy minister martin bartenstein believes the main reason for rising unemployment is weak economic growth , and says its crucial to increase investments in individual austrian regions , without affecting the current budget . " the package we agreed on has nothing to do with the budget .
first of all , we want to get something going to boost growth and jobs , and we also want to take advantage of the possibilities available through current financing by the european union until 2006 , " he said . more jobs yet more jobless the program would cost 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.48 billion -rrb- , with state and the federal government contributing in equal measure , and eu loans making up the rest , and would hopefully create some 20,000 jobs for austrians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german job-seekers head for the austrian alps even as things stand , austria has a pretty good rate of job creation at about one percent growth .

but even so , the number of unemployed is on the rise . according to austrian media , germans are partially responsible for this predicament , with many unemployed germans who can not find work at home heading south of the border to earn their crust in austria .
some 45,000 germans are currently employed there , many of them in the tourism industry . andrea mühlberger -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans head south in search of jobs as euroskeptics across the continent smugly salute france and holland for crushing the eu constitution ratification process , a migratory trend among german workers validates the benefits of cross border labor markets .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.08.2005 iran cuts seals on nuclear plant großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has fully resumed work at a uraniam conversion plant the german government has called on tehran to halt plans to resume uranium conversion , but to return to the negotiating table .
but iran has removed the seals at a key atomic plant , signalling that talks are over . the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- gave the final go-ahead for the removal of seals which it put on the uranium conversion facility on the outskirts of isfahan when iran suspended sensitive nuclear activities last november .
their removal , which means the facility can return to full capacity , raises the stakes in a standoff with the international community .
iran sparked grave international concern when it ended the nine-month suspension of uranium conversion on monday , but it was n't until the metal seals on key machinery were cut that the program really resumed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iaea inspectors sets surveillance equipment " we have started , " said iran 's atomic energy agency vice-president mohammad saidi .
" it is happening under the supervision of the agency . "
throughout the current escalation of tensions iran has been at pains to emphasize that it is resuming conversion activities in concert with the iaea , whose inspectors have installed surveillance equipment to monitor the process .
mindful of playing by international rules , iran waited for the agency to finish installing surveillance equipment before breaking the seals .
the iaea " told us in a letter that there was no obstacle and that -lrb- the agency -rrb- authorizes us to remove the seals , which will be returned to them afterwards , " said saidi .
pressure mounts for iran to backtrack the move comes as the european union tries to win approval at an emergency iaea meeting in vienna for a draft resolution calling on iran to reverse its decision to continue with the nuclear fuel work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea emergency meeting on iran 's latest nuclear activities indicating the difficulties of forging an agreement , a formal iaea meeting planned for wednesday was cancelled because diplomats remained locked in closed-door talks on the eu resolution .

but iran has removed the seals at a key atomic plant , signalling that talks are over . the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- gave the final go-ahead for the removal of seals which it put on the uranium conversion facility on the outskirts of isfahan when iran suspended sensitive nuclear activities last november .
their removal , which means the facility can return to full capacity , raises the stakes in a standoff with the international community .

the iaea " told us in a letter that there was no obstacle and that -lrb- the agency -rrb- authorizes us to remove the seals , which will be returned to them afterwards , " said saidi .

could this be a return to the bad old days ? " could the sun be setting on germany 's bright new dawn ? " that was the question being posed in the sports pages of the german press on wednesday .
after initial signs suggesting that national team coach jürgen klinsmann was going to revolutionize an ailing and aging germany by blooding exciting but untried youngsters at international level , a creeping anxiety began to spread when klinsmann announced that young guns lukas podolski and bastian schweinsteiger would not be traveling with his latest squad .
the germany contingent who will head to the netherlands for a high profile friendly against the dutch in rotterdam on august 17 will be without the two youngsters who lit up germany 's confederations cup campaign in june .
they offered hope to a nation with huge expectations ahead of the world cup to be played on home soil next summer .
klinsmann has completely omitted 20-year-old fc cologne striker " poldi " and his bayern munich buddy " schweini " , 21 , from the traveling party and has padded the squad with experience in the form of seasoned warriors didi hamann , christian wörns and oliver neuville .
klinsmann has also opted for an established face up front with the not-exactly-decrepit miroslav klose , 28 .
he is returning to the attacking line for the first time since the 1-0 win over slovenia in march in the absence of another of klinsi 's colts , the suspended mike hanke .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : timo hildebrand and number three stopper timo hildebrand returns to third in the pecking order after the 26-year old stuttgart keeper 's outing as first choice in the 2-2 draw with argentina in the confed cup .
arsenal 's jens lehmann will be between the sticks against the dutch with oli kahn rested on the bench .
no return to the past , a glance to the future but for all those fearing the return to the creaky old days , the reason for the omission of those central to germany 's youth revolution is not cold feet but achy ones .
not a man to abandon his reforms so easily , klinsmann is still looking to the future by resting his young stars with a view to keeping them as fresh as possible for the world cup to come .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bastian schweinsteiger after consulting bayern boss felix magath , klinsmann decided it would be best to allow schweinsteiger 's tender achilles problem to heal properly by leaving the midfielder at home .
podolski , who has barely had any rest since helping his team win promotion at the end of the last bundesliga season , gets a well-earned breather with a view to returning to international duty on september 3 in the friendly fixture with slovakia in bratislava .
meanwhile , hildebrand is likely to get a good run in the team to make his case for the number one jersey in the next six games , according to klinsmann .
hardly a team pushing the age barrier despite the absence of podolski , schweinsteiger , hanke and hildebrand in the team expected to face the netherlands , the german team is hardly one full of pensioners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian wörns apart from 34-year old wörns -lrb- photo -rrb- , the defenders in the germany squad are : arne friedrich , andreas hinkel , thomas hitzlsperger , robert huth and per mertesacker - all young players in their early twenties who have usurped the old guard since klinsmann took over .
youth dominates all areas of the squad the midfield players are no old men either .
tim borowski and sebastian deisler are both 25 , while fabian ernst is 26 .
captain michael ballack is a relative oldie at 28 , as is 29-year-old thorsten frings .
bernd schneider and didi hamann , both 31 , look positively ancient in comparison .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver neuville the 32-year-old neuville -lrb- photo -rrb- is included in the attacking options alongside gerald asamoah , 27 , and 23-year-old kevin kuranyi .
whichever way cynical observers may look at it , the germany squad preparing to face holland is far from being too long in the tooth .
leaving the babies of the team behind for one match should be no reason to lament the passing of a new beginning . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de attacking mentality stays , klinsmann says germany have not had a reputation for playing attacking football over the years but jürgen klinsmann seems intent on winning the 2006 world cup by outscoring opponents .

could this be a return to the bad old days ? " could the sun be setting on germany 's bright new dawn ? " that was the question being posed in the sports pages of the german press on wednesday .
after initial signs suggesting that national team coach jürgen klinsmann was going to revolutionize an ailing and aging germany by blooding exciting but untried youngsters at international level , a creeping anxiety began to spread when klinsmann announced that young guns lukas podolski and bastian schweinsteiger would not be traveling with his latest squad .
the germany contingent who will head to the netherlands for a high profile friendly against the dutch in rotterdam on august 17 will be without the two youngsters who lit up germany 's confederations cup campaign in june .
they offered hope to a nation with huge expectations ahead of the world cup to be played on home soil next summer .
klinsmann has completely omitted 20-year-old fc cologne striker " poldi " and his bayern munich buddy " schweini " , 21 , from the traveling party and has padded the squad with experience in the form of seasoned warriors didi hamann , christian wörns and oliver neuville .
klinsmann has also opted for an established face up front with the not-exactly-decrepit miroslav klose , 28 .
he is returning to the attacking line for the first time since the 1-0 win over slovenia in march in the absence of another of klinsi 's colts , the suspended mike hanke .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.08.2005 gm maize fight goes to court großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us seed firms want to grow in germany american biotech firms want to use legal action to force germany to approve their genetically modified maize for cultivation . the america seed companies monsanto and pioneer are trying to get provisional approval to cultivate their pest-resistant maize , mon 810 , in germany , according to german consumer protection authorities .
but alexander müller of the consumer protection office says he does n't believe that mon 810 can be legally approved as seed .
" it is not allowed under european law , " he told the german public broadcaster ard .
for the past seven years , mon 810 has been approved in the eu only as feed and as food .
cultivation of the crop was explicitly excluded .
but the eu commission , in contrast , says that mon 810 , also as seed , is legal and must be allowed to be used in germany , a commission spokeswoman told ard .
the maize has been included in the collective eu catalogue of allowable imports since 2004 , authorizing its use .
" it must be allowed to be imported into germany , " a spokeswoman for the european commission said .
spanish use contentious maize last year , the eu commission approved 17 types of maize in the mon 810 line after spain experienced no problems with its cultivation .
but according to müller , that approval might need to be examined by european court of justice , müller said .
" if our legal interpretation is correct , the spanish will have to see if their approval was legitimate . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many still oppose genetic tinkering the environmental watchdog group greenpeace is one of the groups opposed to the cultivation of mon 810 , saying that the crop can harm butterflies .
greece , austria , poland and hungary have not given the go-ahead for the cultivation of mon 810 .

come next week , the german city of cologne will be bursting at the seams as it plays host to some 800,000 pilgrims in town for world youth day .
local businesses are rubbing their hands in anticipation . tipped to be one of the largest religious gatherings ever in germany , world youth day is n't only inspiring spirituality in the city 's residents . the event is also spawning a decidedly commercial side , as regional companies try to cash in on the one-off economic opportunity by extending their opening hours .
but uwe klein , head of cologne ’ s retail association says the excitement is misplaced . " the people coming here are not going to have a lot of money .
the main object is to provide the visitors and guests with the basic essentials , which means food and drink , and of course souvenirs , " klein said . and much of the food will be provided by world youth day limited itself , which sets a good portion of its 100 million euros -lrb- $ 123 million -rrb- budget aside for catering . untypical tourists the economic development council in bonn suggests that a typical tourist will spend between 60 and 100 euros a day , but experts say that will not be the case with world youth day visitors .
matthias johnen , manager of the regional hoteliers association , says visitors at previous such events could be divided up in to three categories . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world youth day volunteers " we can safely assume from past experience that roughly one third of visitors will be coming to pray , another third will be here to sightsee and a final third will be here to shop , " johnen said . retailers and caterers have been preparing for this event for months and have a list of 25,000 benevolent volunteers ready to lend a hand when the queues get too long .
many restaurants have even promised to keep their prices down , and will be offering " pilgrim specials " at affordable prices . in search of the fat cash where local businesses are hoping to make their money is through the 6,000 journalists who are also expected to descend on the city for the event , and the day-trippers who are likely to roll up with rather fatter wallets than the pilgrims .
but nina schmedding , spokeswoman for world youth day , is reluctant to divide visitors into consumer types , and says that spending habits will vary from one event to another . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a time to prey or a time to shop ?
" there 's been no study on the behavior of the pilgrims .
i think a lot is going to depend on the weather , " she said . the general consensus , however , is that there should n't be too much emphasis on the economic side of the event , but that it should serve to raise the profile of the region .

but that has begun to change and action is being called for amid suggestions that german workers are partly to blame . the unemployment rate in austria has been rising since november , and has now reached the 6 percent mark .
exports are declining and the economy is stagnating .
it 's a sticky situation for the governing parties so close to upcoming regional elections , hence austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel 's hastily scheduled jobs conference this week .
it was the fourth this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian chancellor wolfgang schuessel the conference resulted in agreement on a program to boost regional investments , thus putting at least some of the more than 200,000 unemployed back to work . austrian labor and economy minister martin bartenstein believes the main reason for rising unemployment is weak economic growth , and says its crucial to increase investments in individual austrian regions , without affecting the current budget . " the package we agreed on has nothing to do with the budget .
first of all , we want to get something going to boost growth and jobs , and we also want to take advantage of the possibilities available through current financing by the european union until 2006 , " he said . more jobs yet more jobless the program would cost 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.48 billion -rrb- , with state and the federal government contributing in equal measure , and eu loans making up the rest , and would hopefully create some 20,000 jobs for austrians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german job-seekers head for the austrian alps even as things stand , austria has a pretty good rate of job creation at about one percent growth .
that 's between 30,000 and 35,000 new positions opened up each year .
but even so , the number of unemployed is on the rise . according to austrian media , germans are partially responsible for this predicament , with many unemployed germans who can not find work at home heading south of the border to earn their crust in austria .
some 45,000 germans are currently employed there , many of them in the tourism industry . andrea mühlberger -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans head south in search of jobs as euroskeptics across the continent smugly salute france and holland for crushing the eu constitution ratification process , a migratory trend among german workers validates the benefits of cross border labor markets .

the main object is to provide the visitors and guests with the basic essentials , which means food and drink , and of course souvenirs , " klein said . and much of the food will be provided by world youth day limited itself , which sets a good portion of its 100 million euros -lrb- $ 123 million -rrb- budget aside for catering . untypical tourists the economic development council in bonn suggests that a typical tourist will spend between 60 and 100 euros a day , but experts say that will not be the case with world youth day visitors .
matthias johnen , manager of the regional hoteliers association , says visitors at previous such events could be divided up in to three categories . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world youth day volunteers " we can safely assume from past experience that roughly one third of visitors will be coming to pray , another third will be here to sightsee and a final third will be here to shop , " johnen said . retailers and caterers have been preparing for this event for months and have a list of 25,000 benevolent volunteers ready to lend a hand when the queues get too long .
many restaurants have even promised to keep their prices down , and will be offering " pilgrim specials " at affordable prices . in search of the fat cash where local businesses are hoping to make their money is through the 6,000 journalists who are also expected to descend on the city for the event , and the day-trippers who are likely to roll up with rather fatter wallets than the pilgrims .
but nina schmedding , spokeswoman for world youth day , is reluctant to divide visitors into consumer types , and says that spending habits will vary from one event to another . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a time to prey or a time to shop ?
" there 's been no study on the behavior of the pilgrims .
i think a lot is going to depend on the weather , " she said . the general consensus , however , is that there should n't be too much emphasis on the economic side of the event , but that it should serve to raise the profile of the region .

meanwhile , gerhard schröder is cutting a confident figure on the campaign trail . germany 's conservative leadership came together in berlin on plan their remaining election strategy .
shifts in voter sentiment and a growing realization that millions of germans will wait until the last minute to decide who to vote for has added pressure on a faltering campaign that , until recently , looked like a cakewalk for christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- chief angela merkel . despite recent polls which put the cdu and its bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- about 14 points clear of chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats , the cdu / csu ticket is looking a less attractive option to many , mainly due to a number of high profile gaffes over the past few weeks . merkel was subjected to the first real criticism of the campaign for confusing " gross " and " net " wages in a television interview last week and then had to publicly rebuke one of her party members for insensitive remarks alluding to poor social and moral standards in the east of germany in the wake of the " dead babies " case that came to light soon after . new approach and campaign team bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservative leader angela merkel and bavarian governor edmund stoiber display their party 's platform during a news conference in berlin on monday , july 11 , 2005 focussing on their program for the expected september elections .
in a bid to get the cdu / csu show back on the road , merkel , csu chief edmund stoiber and cdu state premiers christian wulff and roland koch will convene in the capital to reassess the campaign strategy and formulate damage limitation plans as the run-in to the election heads for its final month . the meeting is also likely to include discussions on who should be part of merkel 's " competence team " for the last push towards polling day .
according to a report in die welt , at least two csu politicians are likely to be named in the new campaign team ; bavarian minister of the interior günther beckstein and vice-chairperson of the union faction in the bundestag , gerda hasselfeldt . after the meeting , merkel is to begin her campaign tour with the first of an estimated 40 rallies , beginning on wednesday afternoon in essen and cologne in the recently captured former-spd strong hold state of north-rhine westphalia . angie on tour bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservative party officials revealed that merkel 's election campaign will end on september 16 - two days before polling day - in the berlin tempodrom .
highlights of her tour are expected to be the cdu party congress in dortmund on august 28 and the csu equivalent on september 2-3 .
the following day , merkel takes on schröder in the only televised debate of the campaign . schröder himself will have a better idea by then how much the fallout from the recent mistakes and pitfalls experienced by his opponent will have helped his own campaign . the chancellor has apparently smelled blood and appeared invigorated for the upcoming fight in a recent television interview on bayerisches fernsehen .
" i think of everything except quitting , " he told interviewer sigmund gottlieb .
" i intensely believe that i can continue to lead the country further in its course . " schröder places trust in the voters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when questioned about the election chances of his spd-green party coalition , schröder confidently put his trust in the german people to recognize his efforts in pushing for painful reforms : " in the end , the people will go to the polling booths and consider who has shown the most courage . " the chancellor dismissed the increasingly popular discussion of a grand coalition of the cdu and spd .
" we should talk not about coalitions but work on making the spd the strongest party , " schröder said . he was equally dismissive of the new left party , the combination of the pds , the former east german communist party and former spd leftist rebels .
" this is just the pds fortified by those people who have fled from irresponsibility , " he said .
" we should not trust those who would disable germany 's foreign policy and would demand too much on the domestic front . " spd goes on the offensive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's combative style reflects the spd 's campaign plans which would include spending 32 million euros on its 40-day tour of germany in a bid to make the most of recent gains on the cdu . spd campaign manager kajo wasserhoevel announced on tuesday that the social democrats would attempt to capitalize on the recent cdu blunders which he said had given the spd a " tailwind " . " we 're going to turn the spotlight on merkel , " he said , showing journalists at a press conference in berlin new posters mocking merkel 's tax increase plans and raising doubts about her abilities . wasserhoevel added that he expected the trend of voters being turned off by the cdu 's candidate for chancellor to continue as the public take their first close look at merkel in the light of the recent adverse publicity . he also said that a growing trend for germans to decide at the last minute was filling the spd with confidence .
" the number of voters who do n't make their decision until the last 14 days is getting larger and larger , " he said .
" there 's an enormous potential there and we 've got to have the stamina to court them right up until election day .

meanwhile , gerhard schröder is cutting a confident figure on the campaign trail . germany 's conservative leadership came together in berlin on plan their remaining election strategy .
shifts in voter sentiment and a growing realization that millions of germans will wait until the last minute to decide who to vote for has added pressure on a faltering campaign that , until recently , looked like a cakewalk for christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- chief angela merkel . despite recent polls which put the cdu and its bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- about 14 points clear of chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats , the cdu / csu ticket is looking a less attractive option to many , mainly due to a number of high profile gaffes over the past few weeks . merkel was subjected to the first real criticism of the campaign for confusing " gross " and " net " wages in a television interview last week and then had to publicly rebuke one of her party members for insensitive remarks alluding to poor social and moral standards in the east of germany in the wake of the " dead babies " case that came to light soon after . new approach and campaign team bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservative leader angela merkel and bavarian governor edmund stoiber display their party 's platform during a news conference in berlin on monday , july 11 , 2005 focussing on their program for the expected september elections .
in a bid to get the cdu / csu show back on the road , merkel , csu chief edmund stoiber and cdu state premiers christian wulff and roland koch will convene in the capital to reassess the campaign strategy and formulate damage limitation plans as the run-in to the election heads for its final month . the meeting is also likely to include discussions on who should be part of merkel 's " competence team " for the last push towards polling day .
according to a report in die welt , at least two csu politicians are likely to be named in the new campaign team ; bavarian minister of the interior günther beckstein and vice-chairperson of the union faction in the bundestag , gerda hasselfeldt . after the meeting , merkel is to begin her campaign tour with the first of an estimated 40 rallies , beginning on wednesday afternoon in essen and cologne in the recently captured former-spd strong hold state of north-rhine westphalia . angie on tour bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservative party officials revealed that merkel 's election campaign will end on september 16 - two days before polling day - in the berlin tempodrom .
highlights of her tour are expected to be the cdu party congress in dortmund on august 28 and the csu equivalent on september 2-3 .
the following day , merkel takes on schröder in the only televised debate of the campaign . schröder himself will have a better idea by then how much the fallout from the recent mistakes and pitfalls experienced by his opponent will have helped his own campaign . the chancellor has apparently smelled blood and appeared invigorated for the upcoming fight in a recent television interview on bayerisches fernsehen .
" i think of everything except quitting , " he told interviewer sigmund gottlieb .
" i intensely believe that i can continue to lead the country further in its course . " schröder places trust in the voters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when questioned about the election chances of his spd-green party coalition , schröder confidently put his trust in the german people to recognize his efforts in pushing for painful reforms : " in the end , the people will go to the polling booths and consider who has shown the most courage . " the chancellor dismissed the increasingly popular discussion of a grand coalition of the cdu and spd .
" we should talk not about coalitions but work on making the spd the strongest party , " schröder said . he was equally dismissive of the new left party , the combination of the pds , the former east german communist party and former spd leftist rebels .
" this is just the pds fortified by those people who have fled from irresponsibility , " he said .
" we should not trust those who would disable germany 's foreign policy and would demand too much on the domestic front . " spd goes on the offensive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's combative style reflects the spd 's campaign plans which would include spending 32 million euros on its 40-day tour of germany in a bid to make the most of recent gains on the cdu . spd campaign manager kajo wasserhoevel announced on tuesday that the social democrats would attempt to capitalize on the recent cdu blunders which he said had given the spd a " tailwind " . " we 're going to turn the spotlight on merkel , " he said , showing journalists at a press conference in berlin new posters mocking merkel 's tax increase plans and raising doubts about her abilities . wasserhoevel added that he expected the trend of voters being turned off by the cdu 's candidate for chancellor to continue as the public take their first close look at merkel in the light of the recent adverse publicity . he also said that a growing trend for germans to decide at the last minute was filling the spd with confidence .
" the number of voters who do n't make their decision until the last 14 days is getting larger and larger , " he said .
" there 's an enormous potential there and we 've got to have the stamina to court them right up until election day .

berlin 's urban rejuvenation over the past few years may have put it back on the map with international tourists , but the facelift is n't finished , for there 's a rather dirty river running through the city center . the river spree travels almost four hundred kilometers through industrial wastelands , forests and fertile fields before reaching the german capital .
and as city rivers go , this one has an elegant , tame feel to it .
but the look is deceptive , for within its slender curves , the spree plays host to a barrage of bacteria .
the problem is not the result of unethical industrialists pumping factory waste into the water , since for the most part industry on the banks of the spree dried up many years ago .
the pollution actually arises through the continued use of an old-fashioned , inadequate sewage system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the murky waters of the spree are not enticing in much of the city " combination " drains , which are over a century old , are used to transport both rain water and household waste . they have not grown as quickly as the city , and simply do n't have the capacity to contain the sudden , violent downpours which fall over berlin up to 30 times each year .
the rainfall mixes with the city sewage and it all spills into the spree . it 's a rather disgusting problem that most people would prefer not to think about , except those who have taken it upon themselves to change it . " we have to set an example " for the past four years , ralf steeg , an engineer for landscape architecture and environmental planning , has been working on a way of improving not only the quality of the water in the spree , but consequently the quality of life for those who live on or near its banks . bildunterschrift : an example of a floating pontoon " spree 2011 " his solution , called " spree 2011 " is quite simple .
he plans to erect large overflow tanks in the form of floating pontoons at various points along a four-kilometer stretch of the spree , thus preventing human waste from overflowing into the river and giving the water a chance to regain its natural balance .
" germany is an important industrial nation , and we should be showing the world that we care about our environment .
and apart from that , i want to see berlin and the berliners thriving , i want them to have the chance to jump into a river to cool off , " steeg said . berlin , the water paradise some argue that berlin already has plenty of opportunities for a quick dip after work .
and when compared to cities such as london and paris , that may be true .
but for steeg , the argument is not watertight . bildunterschrift : " spree 2011 " futuristic bathing platform " the discussion about the necessity of being able to swim in the city center was concluded back in the 80s when it was decided that people should have the chance to relax on their doorsteps .
at the moment , you have to travel at least 30 minutes from the city center just to be able to swim , " steeg said .
traditionally , the spree was a bathers ' paradise .
back in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , the river was dotted with bathing facilities , and until 1925 , when they were all closed , berliners made good use of what they had .
steeg 's plans would return the river back beyond its former glory to give it a " water quality it has never had before " .
not about swimming stephan natz of the berlin water authority says the issue is not about " creating swimming facilities , but about improving the quality of the water , thus providing for the future of the city . "
he argues that although steeg 's project is a good idea , the cost could be disproportionate to the effect . bildunterschrift : the pontoons could be used as campsites or open air cinemas that said , the city water authorities have agreed to partially finance a 180,000 euro -lrb- $ 222,000 -rrb- viability study which , if successful , could take the project to the next phase , including the construction of a pilot prototype .
this is where the project ceases to just be a solution to an environmental problem , but a practical , aesthetically pleasing addition to the changing face of a european capital .
steeg , who was named engineer of the year this week , foresees the floating pontoons being used as cafés , restaurants , campsites , bathing houses or even open-air cinema , all of which would generate income for the city . time is of the essence the innovative idea is in step with many other initiatives which have sprung up on the banks of the river in an attempt to give it the same kind of pulse enjoyed by other european cities .
but dr. dietrich jahn , who runs the planning department of the berlin senate , says that although there is currently no necessity to prettify the river , it is a long-term goal worth hanging on to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spree to be ?
" there are industrial ruins up and down the banks of the spree , and we need to fill them .
a berlin beach life could be a very special thing , and although the financial crisis in berlin means it would be hard to finance the project at the moment , we should n't lose sight of it , " he said .
but steeg is keen to get started , and if " spree 2011 " is to live up to its name , there 's not much time for deliberation . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in berlin , a river remade berlin 's river spree was long slighted by the city 's inhabitants , who saw it as little more than a murky cradle of industry .

could this be a return to the bad old days ? " could the sun be setting on germany 's bright new dawn ? " that was the question being posed in the sports pages of the german press on wednesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 10.08.2005 old war horses return as young colts rest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukas podolski hugs fellow absentee bastian schweinsteiger waves of anxiety rippled through germany 's soccer community on wednesday when coach jürgen klinsmann announced that his two youngest stars would not be in his latest squad .
could this be a return to the bad old days ? " could the sun be setting on germany 's bright new dawn ? " that was the question being posed in the sports pages of the german press on wednesday .
after initial signs suggesting that national team coach jürgen klinsmann was going to revolutionize an ailing and aging germany by blooding exciting but untried youngsters at international level , a creeping anxiety began to spread when klinsmann announced that young guns lukas podolski and bastian schweinsteiger would not be traveling with his latest squad .
the germany contingent who will head to the netherlands for a high profile friendly against the dutch in rotterdam on august 17 will be without the two youngsters who lit up germany 's confederations cup campaign in june .
they offered hope to a nation with huge expectations ahead of the world cup to be played on home soil next summer .
klinsmann has completely omitted 20-year-old fc cologne striker " poldi " and his bayern munich buddy " schweini " , 21 , from the traveling party and has padded the squad with experience in the form of seasoned warriors didi hamann , christian wörns and oliver neuville .
klinsmann has also opted for an established face up front with the not-exactly-decrepit miroslav klose , 28 .
he is returning to the attacking line for the first time since the 1-0 win over slovenia in march in the absence of another of klinsi 's colts , the suspended mike hanke .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : timo hildebrand and number three stopper timo hildebrand returns to third in the pecking order after the 26-year old stuttgart keeper 's outing as first choice in the 2-2 draw with argentina in the confed cup .
arsenal 's jens lehmann will be between the sticks against the dutch with oli kahn rested on the bench .
no return to the past , a glance to the future but for all those fearing the return to the creaky old days , the reason for the omission of those central to germany 's youth revolution is not cold feet but achy ones .
not a man to abandon his reforms so easily , klinsmann is still looking to the future by resting his young stars with a view to keeping them as fresh as possible for the world cup to come .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bastian schweinsteiger after consulting bayern boss felix magath , klinsmann decided it would be best to allow schweinsteiger 's tender achilles problem to heal properly by leaving the midfielder at home .
podolski , who has barely had any rest since helping his team win promotion at the end of the last bundesliga season , gets a well-earned breather with a view to returning to international duty on september 3 in the friendly fixture with slovakia in bratislava .
meanwhile , hildebrand is likely to get a good run in the team to make his case for the number one jersey in the next six games , according to klinsmann .
hardly a team pushing the age barrier despite the absence of podolski , schweinsteiger , hanke and hildebrand in the team expected to face the netherlands , the german team is hardly one full of pensioners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian wörns apart from 34-year old wörns -lrb- photo -rrb- , the defenders in the germany squad are : arne friedrich , andreas hinkel , thomas hitzlsperger , robert huth and per mertesacker - all young players in their early twenties who have usurped the old guard since klinsmann took over .
youth dominates all areas of the squad the midfield players are no old men either .
tim borowski and sebastian deisler are both 25 , while fabian ernst is 26 .
captain michael ballack is a relative oldie at 28 , as is 29-year-old thorsten frings .
bernd schneider and didi hamann , both 31 , look positively ancient in comparison .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver neuville the 32-year-old neuville -lrb- photo -rrb- is included in the attacking options alongside gerald asamoah , 27 , and 23-year-old kevin kuranyi .
whichever way cynical observers may look at it , the germany squad preparing to face holland is far from being too long in the tooth .
leaving the babies of the team behind for one match should be no reason to lament the passing of a new beginning . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de attacking mentality stays , klinsmann says germany have not had a reputation for playing attacking football over the years but jürgen klinsmann seems intent on winning the 2006 world cup by outscoring opponents .

meanwhile , gerhard schröder is cutting a confident figure on the campaign trail . germany 's conservative leadership came together in berlin on plan their remaining election strategy .
shifts in voter sentiment and a growing realization that millions of germans will wait until the last minute to decide who to vote for has added pressure on a faltering campaign that , until recently , looked like a cakewalk for christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- chief angela merkel . despite recent polls which put the cdu and its bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- about 14 points clear of chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats , the cdu / csu ticket is looking a less attractive option to many , mainly due to a number of high profile gaffes over the past few weeks . merkel was subjected to the first real criticism of the campaign for confusing " gross " and " net " wages in a television interview last week and then had to publicly rebuke one of her party members for insensitive remarks alluding to poor social and moral standards in the east of germany in the wake of the " dead babies " case that came to light soon after . new approach and campaign team bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservative leader angela merkel and bavarian governor edmund stoiber display their party 's platform during a news conference in berlin on monday , july 11 , 2005 focussing on their program for the expected september elections .
in a bid to get the cdu / csu show back on the road , merkel , csu chief edmund stoiber and cdu state premiers christian wulff and roland koch will convene in the capital to reassess the campaign strategy and formulate damage limitation plans as the run-in to the election heads for its final month . the meeting is also likely to include discussions on who should be part of merkel 's " competence team " for the last push towards polling day .
according to a report in die welt , at least two csu politicians are likely to be named in the new campaign team ; bavarian minister of the interior günther beckstein and vice-chairperson of the union faction in the bundestag , gerda hasselfeldt . after the meeting , merkel is to begin her campaign tour with the first of an estimated 40 rallies , beginning on wednesday afternoon in essen and cologne in the recently captured former-spd strong hold state of north-rhine westphalia . angie on tour bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservative party officials revealed that merkel 's election campaign will end on september 16 - two days before polling day - in the berlin tempodrom .
highlights of her tour are expected to be the cdu party congress in dortmund on august 28 and the csu equivalent on september 2-3 .
the following day , merkel takes on schröder in the only televised debate of the campaign . schröder himself will have a better idea by then how much the fallout from the recent mistakes and pitfalls experienced by his opponent will have helped his own campaign . the chancellor has apparently smelled blood and appeared invigorated for the upcoming fight in a recent television interview on bayerisches fernsehen .
" i think of everything except quitting , " he told interviewer sigmund gottlieb .
" i intensely believe that i can continue to lead the country further in its course . " schröder places trust in the voters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when questioned about the election chances of his spd-green party coalition , schröder confidently put his trust in the german people to recognize his efforts in pushing for painful reforms : " in the end , the people will go to the polling booths and consider who has shown the most courage . " the chancellor dismissed the increasingly popular discussion of a grand coalition of the cdu and spd .
" we should talk not about coalitions but work on making the spd the strongest party , " schröder said . he was equally dismissive of the new left party , the combination of the pds , the former east german communist party and former spd leftist rebels .
" this is just the pds fortified by those people who have fled from irresponsibility , " he said .
" we should not trust those who would disable germany 's foreign policy and would demand too much on the domestic front . " spd goes on the offensive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's combative style reflects the spd 's campaign plans which would include spending 32 million euros on its 40-day tour of germany in a bid to make the most of recent gains on the cdu . spd campaign manager kajo wasserhoevel announced on tuesday that the social democrats would attempt to capitalize on the recent cdu blunders which he said had given the spd a " tailwind " . " we 're going to turn the spotlight on merkel , " he said , showing journalists at a press conference in berlin new posters mocking merkel 's tax increase plans and raising doubts about her abilities . wasserhoevel added that he expected the trend of voters being turned off by the cdu 's candidate for chancellor to continue as the public take their first close look at merkel in the light of the recent adverse publicity . he also said that a growing trend for germans to decide at the last minute was filling the spd with confidence .
" the number of voters who do n't make their decision until the last 14 days is getting larger and larger , " he said .

but that has begun to change and action is being called for amid suggestions that german workers are partly to blame . the unemployment rate in austria has been rising since november , and has now reached the 6 percent mark .
exports are declining and the economy is stagnating .
it 's a sticky situation for the governing parties so close to upcoming regional elections , hence austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel 's hastily scheduled jobs conference this week .
it was the fourth this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian chancellor wolfgang schuessel the conference resulted in agreement on a program to boost regional investments , thus putting at least some of the more than 200,000 unemployed back to work . austrian labor and economy minister martin bartenstein believes the main reason for rising unemployment is weak economic growth , and says its crucial to increase investments in individual austrian regions , without affecting the current budget . " the package we agreed on has nothing to do with the budget .
first of all , we want to get something going to boost growth and jobs , and we also want to take advantage of the possibilities available through current financing by the european union until 2006 , " he said . more jobs yet more jobless the program would cost 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.48 billion -rrb- , with state and the federal government contributing in equal measure , and eu loans making up the rest , and would hopefully create some 20,000 jobs for austrians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german job-seekers head for the austrian alps even as things stand , austria has a pretty good rate of job creation at about one percent growth .
that 's between 30,000 and 35,000 new positions opened up each year .
but even so , the number of unemployed is on the rise . according to austrian media , germans are partially responsible for this predicament , with many unemployed germans who can not find work at home heading south of the border to earn their crust in austria .
some 45,000 germans are currently employed there , many of them in the tourism industry . andrea mühlberger -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans head south in search of jobs as euroskeptics across the continent smugly salute france and holland for crushing the eu constitution ratification process , a migratory trend among german workers validates the benefits of cross border labor markets .
-lrb- june 9 , 2005 -rrb- austria fears flood of german students the european court of justice ruled thursday that austrian universities may not restrict students from other eu countries from studying in austria .
vienna fears an invasion of foreign students , especially from germany .
-lrb- july 8 , 2005 -rrb- the german fear of unemployment angst over the hovering specter of unemployment reached an all-time high last january as the number of unemployed climbed to over five million .
germany 's neighbors have similar problems , but the fear seems less severe .

berlin 's urban rejuvenation over the past few years may have put it back on the map with international tourists , but the facelift is n't finished , for there 's a rather dirty river running through the city center . the river spree travels almost four hundred kilometers through industrial wastelands , forests and fertile fields before reaching the german capital .
and as city rivers go , this one has an elegant , tame feel to it .
but the look is deceptive , for within its slender curves , the spree plays host to a barrage of bacteria .
the problem is not the result of unethical industrialists pumping factory waste into the water , since for the most part industry on the banks of the spree dried up many years ago .

the rainfall mixes with the city sewage and it all spills into the spree . it 's a rather disgusting problem that most people would prefer not to think about , except those who have taken it upon themselves to change it . " we have to set an example " for the past four years , ralf steeg , an engineer for landscape architecture and environmental planning , has been working on a way of improving not only the quality of the water in the spree , but consequently the quality of life for those who live on or near its banks . bildunterschrift : an example of a floating pontoon " spree 2011 " his solution , called " spree 2011 " is quite simple .
he plans to erect large overflow tanks in the form of floating pontoons at various points along a four-kilometer stretch of the spree , thus preventing human waste from overflowing into the river and giving the water a chance to regain its natural balance .
" germany is an important industrial nation , and we should be showing the world that we care about our environment .

traditionally , the spree was a bathers ' paradise .
back in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , the river was dotted with bathing facilities , and until 1925 , when they were all closed , berliners made good use of what they had .

" we are hoping to reconvene tomorrow -lrb- wednesday -rrb- afternoon , but it all very much depends on the iranians " . those hopes , however , received a blow when it was revealed by the head of iran 's nuclear energy agency that the seals that the un nuclear watchdog had placed on iran 's isfahan uranium conversion plant would be removed on wednesday .
iaea inspectors finished installing their surveillance cameras in the plant on tuesday . " the rest of seals will be removed today and the activities will resume , " said gholamreza aghazadeh was quoted as saying on state television .
breaking the seals is the next crucial stage at the plant after iran resumed suspended uranium conversion activities on monday , sparking warnings of an international crisis .
conversion turns uranium ore or yellowcake into a feed gas for enriching uranium , which can be the fuel for reactors or the explosive core of atom bombs .
bush remains " deeply suspicious " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meanwhile , speaking in crawford , texas , after the first day of the iaea talks , us president george w. bush warned iran that the threat of un sanctions over its nuclear activities remained , and made clear he was " deeply suspicious " of tehran 's stated intention to resume talks with a trio of european union states .

" but russia , which is building iran 's first nuclear power reactor and is to supply it with nuclear fuel , came out against iran , calling on it to halt fuel production work " without delay " . new president talks of " insult " at new deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranians have protested iaea inspections in the past in tehran on tuesday iran 's new president mahmood ahmadinejad described as " an insult " an eu offer to iran of trade and other incentives in return for guarantees it was not making nuclear weapons , but said he was still ready to carry on talks . and in vienna , iranian negotiator cyrus nasseri said iran was prepared to continue talks with the eu as long as there were no preconditions and the talks were in " good faith .

" we are hoping to reconvene tomorrow -lrb- wednesday -rrb- afternoon , but it all very much depends on the iranians " . those hopes , however , received a blow when it was revealed by the head of iran 's nuclear energy agency that the seals that the un nuclear watchdog had placed on iran 's isfahan uranium conversion plant would be removed on wednesday .
iaea inspectors finished installing their surveillance cameras in the plant on tuesday . " the rest of seals will be removed today and the activities will resume , " said gholamreza aghazadeh was quoted as saying on state television .
breaking the seals is the next crucial stage at the plant after iran resumed suspended uranium conversion activities on monday , sparking warnings of an international crisis .
conversion turns uranium ore or yellowcake into a feed gas for enriching uranium , which can be the fuel for reactors or the explosive core of atom bombs .
bush remains " deeply suspicious " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meanwhile , speaking in crawford , texas , after the first day of the iaea talks , us president george w. bush warned iran that the threat of un sanctions over its nuclear activities remained , and made clear he was " deeply suspicious " of tehran 's stated intention to resume talks with a trio of european union states .
" we 'll have to watch very carefully , " bush told reporters . " they have , in the past , said they would adhere to international norms and then were caught enriching uranium .

the meeting could last several days .
resolutions on the 35-nation board are normally adopted unanimously . in france , foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said : " it is still possible to negotiate " with iran .
" we are still holding out our hand , " he told journalists . iaea unlikely to recommend sanctions however , diplomats noted warnings that cracking down on iran could isolate the country and said the iaea board was backing away from referring it to the un security council , which could impose sanctions . malaysian ambassador rajmah hussein , speaking for the non-aligned movement , called on the europeans and iran " to continue with their dialogue " and said verification issues " should be resolved solely within the framework of the iaea . " but russia , which is building iran 's first nuclear power reactor and is to supply it with nuclear fuel , came out against iran , calling on it to halt fuel production work " without delay " . new president talks of " insult " at new deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranians have protested iaea inspections in the past in tehran on tuesday iran 's new president mahmood ahmadinejad described as " an insult " an eu offer to iran of trade and other incentives in return for guarantees it was not making nuclear weapons , but said he was still ready to carry on talks . and in vienna , iranian negotiator cyrus nasseri said iran was prepared to continue talks with the eu as long as there were no preconditions and the talks were in " good faith . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's bushehr nuclear power plant .
iran and russia signed a nuclear fuel agreement in february for iran to get its first reactor up and running .

berlin 's urban rejuvenation over the past few years may have put it back on the map with international tourists , but the facelift is n't finished , for there 's a rather dirty river running through the city center . the river spree travels almost four hundred kilometers through industrial wastelands , forests and fertile fields before reaching the german capital .
and as city rivers go , this one has an elegant , tame feel to it .
but the look is deceptive , for within its slender curves , the spree plays host to a barrage of bacteria .
the problem is not the result of unethical industrialists pumping factory waste into the water , since for the most part industry on the banks of the spree dried up many years ago .
the pollution actually arises through the continued use of an old-fashioned , inadequate sewage system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the murky waters of the spree are not enticing in much of the city " combination " drains , which are over a century old , are used to transport both rain water and household waste . they have not grown as quickly as the city , and simply do n't have the capacity to contain the sudden , violent downpours which fall over berlin up to 30 times each year .
the rainfall mixes with the city sewage and it all spills into the spree . it 's a rather disgusting problem that most people would prefer not to think about , except those who have taken it upon themselves to change it . " we have to set an example " for the past four years , ralf steeg , an engineer for landscape architecture and environmental planning , has been working on a way of improving not only the quality of the water in the spree , but consequently the quality of life for those who live on or near its banks . bildunterschrift : an example of a floating pontoon " spree 2011 " his solution , called " spree 2011 " is quite simple .
he plans to erect large overflow tanks in the form of floating pontoons at various points along a four-kilometer stretch of the spree , thus preventing human waste from overflowing into the river and giving the water a chance to regain its natural balance .
" germany is an important industrial nation , and we should be showing the world that we care about our environment .
and apart from that , i want to see berlin and the berliners thriving , i want them to have the chance to jump into a river to cool off , " steeg said . berlin , the water paradise some argue that berlin already has plenty of opportunities for a quick dip after work .
and when compared to cities such as london and paris , that may be true .

at the moment , you have to travel at least 30 minutes from the city center just to be able to swim , " steeg said .
traditionally , the spree was a bathers ' paradise .
back in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , the river was dotted with bathing facilities , and until 1925 , when they were all closed , berliners made good use of what they had .
steeg 's plans would return the river back beyond its former glory to give it a " water quality it has never had before " .
not about swimming stephan natz of the berlin water authority says the issue is not about " creating swimming facilities , but about improving the quality of the water , thus providing for the future of the city . "
he argues that although steeg 's project is a good idea , the cost could be disproportionate to the effect . bildunterschrift : the pontoons could be used as campsites or open air cinemas that said , the city water authorities have agreed to partially finance a 180,000 euro -lrb- $ 222,000 -rrb- viability study which , if successful , could take the project to the next phase , including the construction of a pilot prototype .
this is where the project ceases to just be a solution to an environmental problem , but a practical , aesthetically pleasing addition to the changing face of a european capital .
steeg , who was named engineer of the year this week , foresees the floating pontoons being used as cafés , restaurants , campsites , bathing houses or even open-air cinema , all of which would generate income for the city . time is of the essence the innovative idea is in step with many other initiatives which have sprung up on the banks of the river in an attempt to give it the same kind of pulse enjoyed by other european cities .

but iran has removed the seals at a key atomic plant , signalling that talks are over . the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- gave the final go-ahead for the removal of seals which it put on the uranium conversion facility on the outskirts of isfahan when iran suspended sensitive nuclear activities last november .
their removal , which means the facility can return to full capacity , raises the stakes in a standoff with the international community .
iran sparked grave international concern when it ended the nine-month suspension of uranium conversion on monday , but it was n't until the metal seals on key machinery were cut that the program really resumed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iaea inspectors sets surveillance equipment " we have started , " said iran 's atomic energy agency vice-president mohammad saidi .
" it is happening under the supervision of the agency . "
throughout the current escalation of tensions iran has been at pains to emphasize that it is resuming conversion activities in concert with the iaea , whose inspectors have installed surveillance equipment to monitor the process .
mindful of playing by international rules , iran waited for the agency to finish installing surveillance equipment before breaking the seals .
the iaea " told us in a letter that there was no obstacle and that -lrb- the agency -rrb- authorizes us to remove the seals , which will be returned to them afterwards , " said saidi .
pressure mounts for iran to backtrack the move comes as the european union tries to win approval at an emergency iaea meeting in vienna for a draft resolution calling on iran to reverse its decision to continue with the nuclear fuel work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea emergency meeting on iran 's latest nuclear activities indicating the difficulties of forging an agreement , a formal iaea meeting planned for wednesday was cancelled because diplomats remained locked in closed-door talks on the eu resolution .
" we are at a difficult stage of the process and the german government is very concerned about this development , " german government spokesman bela anda said . he expressed his hope that iran would still come to its senses and resume talks with britain , germany and france .
iran says no turning back iran had suspended uranium conversion and enrichment as a goodwill gesture during nine months of talks with the european union aimed at staving off un security council intervention .
the prospect of the talks succeeding has been dealt a severe blow by iran 's resumption . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has yet to appoint a new government but one of the candidates for the post of foreign minister , parliamentary foreign affairs committee head aleaddine boroujerdi , made clear there was no going back on the move .
he said the best guarantee that iran 's nuclear program is peaceful was the " infallible watching of the iaea cameras , " adding his hope that " the europeans will also accept this reality . "
he said the regime has still not made any decision on restarting iran 's uranium enrichment plant in the city of natanz .
enrichment remains suspended but officials emphasize this is only temporary .
conversion turns uranium ore , or yellowcake , into a feed gas for making enriched uranium , which can be the fuel for reactors or the explosive core of atomic bombs . dw staff / afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany warns iran over nuclear program germany warned on monday that iran 's threat to defy the west and resume uranium enrichment activities which could be used to make nuclear weapons would torpedo talks between the european union and tehran .

come next week , the german city of cologne will be bursting at the seams as it plays host to some 800,000 pilgrims in town for world youth day .
local businesses are rubbing their hands in anticipation . tipped to be one of the largest religious gatherings ever in germany , world youth day is n't only inspiring spirituality in the city 's residents . the event is also spawning a decidedly commercial side , as regional companies try to cash in on the one-off economic opportunity by extending their opening hours .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.08.2005 iran cuts seals on nuclear plant großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has fully resumed work at a uraniam conversion plant the german government has called on tehran to halt plans to resume uranium conversion , but to return to the negotiating table .
but iran has removed the seals at a key atomic plant , signalling that talks are over . the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- gave the final go-ahead for the removal of seals which it put on the uranium conversion facility on the outskirts of isfahan when iran suspended sensitive nuclear activities last november .
their removal , which means the facility can return to full capacity , raises the stakes in a standoff with the international community .
iran sparked grave international concern when it ended the nine-month suspension of uranium conversion on monday , but it was n't until the metal seals on key machinery were cut that the program really resumed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iaea inspectors sets surveillance equipment " we have started , " said iran 's atomic energy agency vice-president mohammad saidi .
" it is happening under the supervision of the agency . "
throughout the current escalation of tensions iran has been at pains to emphasize that it is resuming conversion activities in concert with the iaea , whose inspectors have installed surveillance equipment to monitor the process .
mindful of playing by international rules , iran waited for the agency to finish installing surveillance equipment before breaking the seals .
the iaea " told us in a letter that there was no obstacle and that -lrb- the agency -rrb- authorizes us to remove the seals , which will be returned to them afterwards , " said saidi .
pressure mounts for iran to backtrack the move comes as the european union tries to win approval at an emergency iaea meeting in vienna for a draft resolution calling on iran to reverse its decision to continue with the nuclear fuel work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea emergency meeting on iran 's latest nuclear activities indicating the difficulties of forging an agreement , a formal iaea meeting planned for wednesday was cancelled because diplomats remained locked in closed-door talks on the eu resolution .
" we are at a difficult stage of the process and the german government is very concerned about this development , " german government spokesman bela anda said . he expressed his hope that iran would still come to its senses and resume talks with britain , germany and france .
iran says no turning back iran had suspended uranium conversion and enrichment as a goodwill gesture during nine months of talks with the european union aimed at staving off un security council intervention .
the prospect of the talks succeeding has been dealt a severe blow by iran 's resumption . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has yet to appoint a new government but one of the candidates for the post of foreign minister , parliamentary foreign affairs committee head aleaddine boroujerdi , made clear there was no going back on the move .
he said the best guarantee that iran 's nuclear program is peaceful was the " infallible watching of the iaea cameras , " adding his hope that " the europeans will also accept this reality . "

but iran has removed the seals at a key atomic plant , signalling that talks are over . the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- gave the final go-ahead for the removal of seals which it put on the uranium conversion facility on the outskirts of isfahan when iran suspended sensitive nuclear activities last november .
their removal , which means the facility can return to full capacity , raises the stakes in a standoff with the international community .
iran sparked grave international concern when it ended the nine-month suspension of uranium conversion on monday , but it was n't until the metal seals on key machinery were cut that the program really resumed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iaea inspectors sets surveillance equipment " we have started , " said iran 's atomic energy agency vice-president mohammad saidi .

throughout the current escalation of tensions iran has been at pains to emphasize that it is resuming conversion activities in concert with the iaea , whose inspectors have installed surveillance equipment to monitor the process .
mindful of playing by international rules , iran waited for the agency to finish installing surveillance equipment before breaking the seals .
the iaea " told us in a letter that there was no obstacle and that -lrb- the agency -rrb- authorizes us to remove the seals , which will be returned to them afterwards , " said saidi .
pressure mounts for iran to backtrack the move comes as the european union tries to win approval at an emergency iaea meeting in vienna for a draft resolution calling on iran to reverse its decision to continue with the nuclear fuel work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea emergency meeting on iran 's latest nuclear activities indicating the difficulties of forging an agreement , a formal iaea meeting planned for wednesday was cancelled because diplomats remained locked in closed-door talks on the eu resolution .

could this be a return to the bad old days ? " could the sun be setting on germany 's bright new dawn ? " that was the question being posed in the sports pages of the german press on wednesday .
after initial signs suggesting that national team coach jürgen klinsmann was going to revolutionize an ailing and aging germany by blooding exciting but untried youngsters at international level , a creeping anxiety began to spread when klinsmann announced that young guns lukas podolski and bastian schweinsteiger would not be traveling with his latest squad .
the germany contingent who will head to the netherlands for a high profile friendly against the dutch in rotterdam on august 17 will be without the two youngsters who lit up germany 's confederations cup campaign in june .
they offered hope to a nation with huge expectations ahead of the world cup to be played on home soil next summer .
klinsmann has completely omitted 20-year-old fc cologne striker " poldi " and his bayern munich buddy " schweini " , 21 , from the traveling party and has padded the squad with experience in the form of seasoned warriors didi hamann , christian wörns and oliver neuville .
klinsmann has also opted for an established face up front with the not-exactly-decrepit miroslav klose , 28 .

no return to the past , a glance to the future but for all those fearing the return to the creaky old days , the reason for the omission of those central to germany 's youth revolution is not cold feet but achy ones .

meanwhile , hildebrand is likely to get a good run in the team to make his case for the number one jersey in the next six games , according to klinsmann .

but alexander müller of the consumer protection office says he does n't believe that mon 810 can be legally approved as seed .
" it is not allowed under european law , " he told the german public broadcaster ard .
for the past seven years , mon 810 has been approved in the eu only as feed and as food .
cultivation of the crop was explicitly excluded .
but the eu commission , in contrast , says that mon 810 , also as seed , is legal and must be allowed to be used in germany , a commission spokeswoman told ard .
the maize has been included in the collective eu catalogue of allowable imports since 2004 , authorizing its use .
" it must be allowed to be imported into germany , " a spokeswoman for the european commission said .
spanish use contentious maize last year , the eu commission approved 17 types of maize in the mon 810 line after spain experienced no problems with its cultivation .
but according to müller , that approval might need to be examined by european court of justice , müller said .
" if our legal interpretation is correct , the spanish will have to see if their approval was legitimate . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many still oppose genetic tinkering the environmental watchdog group greenpeace is one of the groups opposed to the cultivation of mon 810 , saying that the crop can harm butterflies .
greece , austria , poland and hungary have not given the go-ahead for the cultivation of mon 810 .
still , german regulators have been testing the line for several years .
regardless of the legal fight , the crop is already being cultivated in germany on a trial basis .
eu still wary on a global scale , the use of genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- crops is increasing , with the world ’ s overall area of approved gm crops now at well over 80 million hectares -lrb- 8 billion acres -rrb- .
so far , maize , soybeans , rapeseed and cotton account for the bulk of biotech crops on the market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the corn is being tested in germany but most eu member countries , including germany , have remained extremely wary of biotech crop technologies .
concerns include giving multinational corporations control of basic food products through gene patents , the possibility of spreading allergens through genetic manipulations and the spread of resistance to antibiotics used in genetic engineering - concerns that are shared by non-governmental organizations such as greenpeace .
" there 's not much research done on the risks of gm plants on the environment or on human health , " ulrike brendel , a greenpeace spokesperson for the gm issue , told dw-world .
germany approved the growing of genetically modified crops in germany last year under a controversial law that imposes strict penalties for possible violations of food-safety regulations .
the law also requires the labeling of foodstuffs produced with genetically modified organisms and allows conventional farmers to file for damages if other growers contaminating their fields with gm seeds . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gm corn protesters send message the issue of genetically-modified corn strikes a nerve with many europeans .

" we 're going to turn the spotlight on merkel , " he said , showing journalists at a press conference in berlin new posters mocking merkel 's tax increase plans and raising doubts about her abilities . wasserhoevel added that he expected the trend of voters being turned off by the cdu 's candidate for chancellor to continue as the public take their first close look at merkel in the light of the recent adverse publicity . he also said that a growing trend for germans to decide at the last minute was filling the spd with confidence .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 10.08.2005 old war horses return as young colts rest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukas podolski hugs fellow absentee bastian schweinsteiger waves of anxiety rippled through germany 's soccer community on wednesday when coach jürgen klinsmann announced that his two youngest stars would not be in his latest squad .
could this be a return to the bad old days ? " could the sun be setting on germany 's bright new dawn ? " that was the question being posed in the sports pages of the german press on wednesday .
after initial signs suggesting that national team coach jürgen klinsmann was going to revolutionize an ailing and aging germany by blooding exciting but untried youngsters at international level , a creeping anxiety began to spread when klinsmann announced that young guns lukas podolski and bastian schweinsteiger would not be traveling with his latest squad .
the germany contingent who will head to the netherlands for a high profile friendly against the dutch in rotterdam on august 17 will be without the two youngsters who lit up germany 's confederations cup campaign in june .
they offered hope to a nation with huge expectations ahead of the world cup to be played on home soil next summer .
klinsmann has completely omitted 20-year-old fc cologne striker " poldi " and his bayern munich buddy " schweini " , 21 , from the traveling party and has padded the squad with experience in the form of seasoned warriors didi hamann , christian wörns and oliver neuville .
klinsmann has also opted for an established face up front with the not-exactly-decrepit miroslav klose , 28 .
he is returning to the attacking line for the first time since the 1-0 win over slovenia in march in the absence of another of klinsi 's colts , the suspended mike hanke .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : timo hildebrand and number three stopper timo hildebrand returns to third in the pecking order after the 26-year old stuttgart keeper 's outing as first choice in the 2-2 draw with argentina in the confed cup .
arsenal 's jens lehmann will be between the sticks against the dutch with oli kahn rested on the bench .
no return to the past , a glance to the future but for all those fearing the return to the creaky old days , the reason for the omission of those central to germany 's youth revolution is not cold feet but achy ones .
not a man to abandon his reforms so easily , klinsmann is still looking to the future by resting his young stars with a view to keeping them as fresh as possible for the world cup to come .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bastian schweinsteiger after consulting bayern boss felix magath , klinsmann decided it would be best to allow schweinsteiger 's tender achilles problem to heal properly by leaving the midfielder at home .
podolski , who has barely had any rest since helping his team win promotion at the end of the last bundesliga season , gets a well-earned breather with a view to returning to international duty on september 3 in the friendly fixture with slovakia in bratislava .
meanwhile , hildebrand is likely to get a good run in the team to make his case for the number one jersey in the next six games , according to klinsmann .
hardly a team pushing the age barrier despite the absence of podolski , schweinsteiger , hanke and hildebrand in the team expected to face the netherlands , the german team is hardly one full of pensioners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian wörns apart from 34-year old wörns -lrb- photo -rrb- , the defenders in the germany squad are : arne friedrich , andreas hinkel , thomas hitzlsperger , robert huth and per mertesacker - all young players in their early twenties who have usurped the old guard since klinsmann took over .
youth dominates all areas of the squad the midfield players are no old men either .
tim borowski and sebastian deisler are both 25 , while fabian ernst is 26 .
captain michael ballack is a relative oldie at 28 , as is 29-year-old thorsten frings .
bernd schneider and didi hamann , both 31 , look positively ancient in comparison .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver neuville the 32-year-old neuville -lrb- photo -rrb- is included in the attacking options alongside gerald asamoah , 27 , and 23-year-old kevin kuranyi .
whichever way cynical observers may look at it , the germany squad preparing to face holland is far from being too long in the tooth .
leaving the babies of the team behind for one match should be no reason to lament the passing of a new beginning . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de attacking mentality stays , klinsmann says germany have not had a reputation for playing attacking football over the years but jürgen klinsmann seems intent on winning the 2006 world cup by outscoring opponents .

could this be a return to the bad old days ? " could the sun be setting on germany 's bright new dawn ? " that was the question being posed in the sports pages of the german press on wednesday .
after initial signs suggesting that national team coach jürgen klinsmann was going to revolutionize an ailing and aging germany by blooding exciting but untried youngsters at international level , a creeping anxiety began to spread when klinsmann announced that young guns lukas podolski and bastian schweinsteiger would not be traveling with his latest squad .

klinsmann has also opted for an established face up front with the not-exactly-decrepit miroslav klose , 28 .

but iran has removed the seals at a key atomic plant , signalling that talks are over . the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- gave the final go-ahead for the removal of seals which it put on the uranium conversion facility on the outskirts of isfahan when iran suspended sensitive nuclear activities last november .
their removal , which means the facility can return to full capacity , raises the stakes in a standoff with the international community .
iran sparked grave international concern when it ended the nine-month suspension of uranium conversion on monday , but it was n't until the metal seals on key machinery were cut that the program really resumed .

the iaea " told us in a letter that there was no obstacle and that -lrb- the agency -rrb- authorizes us to remove the seals , which will be returned to them afterwards , " said saidi .

could this be a return to the bad old days ? " could the sun be setting on germany 's bright new dawn ? " that was the question being posed in the sports pages of the german press on wednesday .
after initial signs suggesting that national team coach jürgen klinsmann was going to revolutionize an ailing and aging germany by blooding exciting but untried youngsters at international level , a creeping anxiety began to spread when klinsmann announced that young guns lukas podolski and bastian schweinsteiger would not be traveling with his latest squad .
the germany contingent who will head to the netherlands for a high profile friendly against the dutch in rotterdam on august 17 will be without the two youngsters who lit up germany 's confederations cup campaign in june .
they offered hope to a nation with huge expectations ahead of the world cup to be played on home soil next summer .
klinsmann has completely omitted 20-year-old fc cologne striker " poldi " and his bayern munich buddy " schweini " , 21 , from the traveling party and has padded the squad with experience in the form of seasoned warriors didi hamann , christian wörns and oliver neuville .
klinsmann has also opted for an established face up front with the not-exactly-decrepit miroslav klose , 28 .
he is returning to the attacking line for the first time since the 1-0 win over slovenia in march in the absence of another of klinsi 's colts , the suspended mike hanke .

arsenal 's jens lehmann will be between the sticks against the dutch with oli kahn rested on the bench .
no return to the past , a glance to the future but for all those fearing the return to the creaky old days , the reason for the omission of those central to germany 's youth revolution is not cold feet but achy ones .

meanwhile , gerhard schröder is cutting a confident figure on the campaign trail . germany 's conservative leadership came together in berlin on plan their remaining election strategy .
shifts in voter sentiment and a growing realization that millions of germans will wait until the last minute to decide who to vote for has added pressure on a faltering campaign that , until recently , looked like a cakewalk for christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- chief angela merkel . despite recent polls which put the cdu and its bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- about 14 points clear of chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats , the cdu / csu ticket is looking a less attractive option to many , mainly due to a number of high profile gaffes over the past few weeks . merkel was subjected to the first real criticism of the campaign for confusing " gross " and " net " wages in a television interview last week and then had to publicly rebuke one of her party members for insensitive remarks alluding to poor social and moral standards in the east of germany in the wake of the " dead babies " case that came to light soon after . new approach and campaign team bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservative leader angela merkel and bavarian governor edmund stoiber display their party 's platform during a news conference in berlin on monday , july 11 , 2005 focussing on their program for the expected september elections .
in a bid to get the cdu / csu show back on the road , merkel , csu chief edmund stoiber and cdu state premiers christian wulff and roland koch will convene in the capital to reassess the campaign strategy and formulate damage limitation plans as the run-in to the election heads for its final month . the meeting is also likely to include discussions on who should be part of merkel 's " competence team " for the last push towards polling day .
according to a report in die welt , at least two csu politicians are likely to be named in the new campaign team ; bavarian minister of the interior günther beckstein and vice-chairperson of the union faction in the bundestag , gerda hasselfeldt . after the meeting , merkel is to begin her campaign tour with the first of an estimated 40 rallies , beginning on wednesday afternoon in essen and cologne in the recently captured former-spd strong hold state of north-rhine westphalia . angie on tour bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservative party officials revealed that merkel 's election campaign will end on september 16 - two days before polling day - in the berlin tempodrom .
highlights of her tour are expected to be the cdu party congress in dortmund on august 28 and the csu equivalent on september 2-3 .
the following day , merkel takes on schröder in the only televised debate of the campaign . schröder himself will have a better idea by then how much the fallout from the recent mistakes and pitfalls experienced by his opponent will have helped his own campaign . the chancellor has apparently smelled blood and appeared invigorated for the upcoming fight in a recent television interview on bayerisches fernsehen .

but alexander müller of the consumer protection office says he does n't believe that mon 810 can be legally approved as seed .
" it is not allowed under european law , " he told the german public broadcaster ard .
for the past seven years , mon 810 has been approved in the eu only as feed and as food .
cultivation of the crop was explicitly excluded .
but the eu commission , in contrast , says that mon 810 , also as seed , is legal and must be allowed to be used in germany , a commission spokeswoman told ard .
the maize has been included in the collective eu catalogue of allowable imports since 2004 , authorizing its use .
" it must be allowed to be imported into germany , " a spokeswoman for the european commission said .
spanish use contentious maize last year , the eu commission approved 17 types of maize in the mon 810 line after spain experienced no problems with its cultivation .
but according to müller , that approval might need to be examined by european court of justice , müller said .
" if our legal interpretation is correct , the spanish will have to see if their approval was legitimate . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many still oppose genetic tinkering the environmental watchdog group greenpeace is one of the groups opposed to the cultivation of mon 810 , saying that the crop can harm butterflies .
greece , austria , poland and hungary have not given the go-ahead for the cultivation of mon 810 .
still , german regulators have been testing the line for several years .
regardless of the legal fight , the crop is already being cultivated in germany on a trial basis .
eu still wary on a global scale , the use of genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- crops is increasing , with the world ’ s overall area of approved gm crops now at well over 80 million hectares -lrb- 8 billion acres -rrb- .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the corn is being tested in germany but most eu member countries , including germany , have remained extremely wary of biotech crop technologies .
concerns include giving multinational corporations control of basic food products through gene patents , the possibility of spreading allergens through genetic manipulations and the spread of resistance to antibiotics used in genetic engineering - concerns that are shared by non-governmental organizations such as greenpeace .
" there 's not much research done on the risks of gm plants on the environment or on human health , " ulrike brendel , a greenpeace spokesperson for the gm issue , told dw-world .
germany approved the growing of genetically modified crops in germany last year under a controversial law that imposes strict penalties for possible violations of food-safety regulations .

but alexander müller of the consumer protection office says he does n't believe that mon 810 can be legally approved as seed .
" it is not allowed under european law , " he told the german public broadcaster ard .
for the past seven years , mon 810 has been approved in the eu only as feed and as food .
cultivation of the crop was explicitly excluded .
but the eu commission , in contrast , says that mon 810 , also as seed , is legal and must be allowed to be used in germany , a commission spokeswoman told ard .
the maize has been included in the collective eu catalogue of allowable imports since 2004 , authorizing its use .
" it must be allowed to be imported into germany , " a spokeswoman for the european commission said .
spanish use contentious maize last year , the eu commission approved 17 types of maize in the mon 810 line after spain experienced no problems with its cultivation .
but according to müller , that approval might need to be examined by european court of justice , müller said .
" if our legal interpretation is correct , the spanish will have to see if their approval was legitimate . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many still oppose genetic tinkering the environmental watchdog group greenpeace is one of the groups opposed to the cultivation of mon 810 , saying that the crop can harm butterflies .
greece , austria , poland and hungary have not given the go-ahead for the cultivation of mon 810 .
still , german regulators have been testing the line for several years .
regardless of the legal fight , the crop is already being cultivated in germany on a trial basis .
eu still wary on a global scale , the use of genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- crops is increasing , with the world ’ s overall area of approved gm crops now at well over 80 million hectares -lrb- 8 billion acres -rrb- .
so far , maize , soybeans , rapeseed and cotton account for the bulk of biotech crops on the market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the corn is being tested in germany but most eu member countries , including germany , have remained extremely wary of biotech crop technologies .
concerns include giving multinational corporations control of basic food products through gene patents , the possibility of spreading allergens through genetic manipulations and the spread of resistance to antibiotics used in genetic engineering - concerns that are shared by non-governmental organizations such as greenpeace .
" there 's not much research done on the risks of gm plants on the environment or on human health , " ulrike brendel , a greenpeace spokesperson for the gm issue , told dw-world .
germany approved the growing of genetically modified crops in germany last year under a controversial law that imposes strict penalties for possible violations of food-safety regulations .
the law also requires the labeling of foodstuffs produced with genetically modified organisms and allows conventional farmers to file for damages if other growers contaminating their fields with gm seeds . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gm corn protesters send message the issue of genetically-modified corn strikes a nerve with many europeans .

but alexander müller of the consumer protection office says he does n't believe that mon 810 can be legally approved as seed .
" it is not allowed under european law , " he told the german public broadcaster ard .
for the past seven years , mon 810 has been approved in the eu only as feed and as food .
cultivation of the crop was explicitly excluded .
but the eu commission , in contrast , says that mon 810 , also as seed , is legal and must be allowed to be used in germany , a commission spokeswoman told ard .
the maize has been included in the collective eu catalogue of allowable imports since 2004 , authorizing its use .
" it must be allowed to be imported into germany , " a spokeswoman for the european commission said .
spanish use contentious maize last year , the eu commission approved 17 types of maize in the mon 810 line after spain experienced no problems with its cultivation .
but according to müller , that approval might need to be examined by european court of justice , müller said .

" there 's not much research done on the risks of gm plants on the environment or on human health , " ulrike brendel , a greenpeace spokesperson for the gm issue , told dw-world .

but alexander müller of the consumer protection office says he does n't believe that mon 810 can be legally approved as seed .
" it is not allowed under european law , " he told the german public broadcaster ard .
for the past seven years , mon 810 has been approved in the eu only as feed and as food .
cultivation of the crop was explicitly excluded .
but the eu commission , in contrast , says that mon 810 , also as seed , is legal and must be allowed to be used in germany , a commission spokeswoman told ard .
the maize has been included in the collective eu catalogue of allowable imports since 2004 , authorizing its use .
" it must be allowed to be imported into germany , " a spokeswoman for the european commission said .
spanish use contentious maize last year , the eu commission approved 17 types of maize in the mon 810 line after spain experienced no problems with its cultivation .
but according to müller , that approval might need to be examined by european court of justice , müller said .
" if our legal interpretation is correct , the spanish will have to see if their approval was legitimate . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many still oppose genetic tinkering the environmental watchdog group greenpeace is one of the groups opposed to the cultivation of mon 810 , saying that the crop can harm butterflies .
greece , austria , poland and hungary have not given the go-ahead for the cultivation of mon 810 .
still , german regulators have been testing the line for several years .
regardless of the legal fight , the crop is already being cultivated in germany on a trial basis .
eu still wary on a global scale , the use of genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- crops is increasing , with the world ’ s overall area of approved gm crops now at well over 80 million hectares -lrb- 8 billion acres -rrb- .
so far , maize , soybeans , rapeseed and cotton account for the bulk of biotech crops on the market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the corn is being tested in germany but most eu member countries , including germany , have remained extremely wary of biotech crop technologies .
concerns include giving multinational corporations control of basic food products through gene patents , the possibility of spreading allergens through genetic manipulations and the spread of resistance to antibiotics used in genetic engineering - concerns that are shared by non-governmental organizations such as greenpeace .
" there 's not much research done on the risks of gm plants on the environment or on human health , " ulrike brendel , a greenpeace spokesperson for the gm issue , told dw-world .
germany approved the growing of genetically modified crops in germany last year under a controversial law that imposes strict penalties for possible violations of food-safety regulations .

he pretends his car has broken down and asks nearby residents for the use of their phone , and a little privacy , please . in the sleepy southwestern german town of bad urach , a phone sex fiend is on the loose .
he 's not accosting local women or anything , but he 's run up the telephone bills of at least four residents who just thought they were helping out a fellow citizen in need .
the man 's scam is bold , if nothing else .
at the homes of local residents , he claims his car has broken down and needs to call a mechanic .

berlin 's urban rejuvenation over the past few years may have put it back on the map with international tourists , but the facelift is n't finished , for there 's a rather dirty river running through the city center . the river spree travels almost four hundred kilometers through industrial wastelands , forests and fertile fields before reaching the german capital .
and as city rivers go , this one has an elegant , tame feel to it .
but the look is deceptive , for within its slender curves , the spree plays host to a barrage of bacteria .
the problem is not the result of unethical industrialists pumping factory waste into the water , since for the most part industry on the banks of the spree dried up many years ago .
the pollution actually arises through the continued use of an old-fashioned , inadequate sewage system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the murky waters of the spree are not enticing in much of the city " combination " drains , which are over a century old , are used to transport both rain water and household waste . they have not grown as quickly as the city , and simply do n't have the capacity to contain the sudden , violent downpours which fall over berlin up to 30 times each year .
the rainfall mixes with the city sewage and it all spills into the spree . it 's a rather disgusting problem that most people would prefer not to think about , except those who have taken it upon themselves to change it . " we have to set an example " for the past four years , ralf steeg , an engineer for landscape architecture and environmental planning , has been working on a way of improving not only the quality of the water in the spree , but consequently the quality of life for those who live on or near its banks . bildunterschrift : an example of a floating pontoon " spree 2011 " his solution , called " spree 2011 " is quite simple .
he plans to erect large overflow tanks in the form of floating pontoons at various points along a four-kilometer stretch of the spree , thus preventing human waste from overflowing into the river and giving the water a chance to regain its natural balance .
" germany is an important industrial nation , and we should be showing the world that we care about our environment .
and apart from that , i want to see berlin and the berliners thriving , i want them to have the chance to jump into a river to cool off , " steeg said . berlin , the water paradise some argue that berlin already has plenty of opportunities for a quick dip after work .

traditionally , the spree was a bathers ' paradise .
back in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , the river was dotted with bathing facilities , and until 1925 , when they were all closed , berliners made good use of what they had .
steeg 's plans would return the river back beyond its former glory to give it a " water quality it has never had before " .
not about swimming stephan natz of the berlin water authority says the issue is not about " creating swimming facilities , but about improving the quality of the water , thus providing for the future of the city . "

this is where the project ceases to just be a solution to an environmental problem , but a practical , aesthetically pleasing addition to the changing face of a european capital .
steeg , who was named engineer of the year this week , foresees the floating pontoons being used as cafés , restaurants , campsites , bathing houses or even open-air cinema , all of which would generate income for the city . time is of the essence the innovative idea is in step with many other initiatives which have sprung up on the banks of the river in an attempt to give it the same kind of pulse enjoyed by other european cities .

berlin 's urban rejuvenation over the past few years may have put it back on the map with international tourists , but the facelift is n't finished , for there 's a rather dirty river running through the city center . the river spree travels almost four hundred kilometers through industrial wastelands , forests and fertile fields before reaching the german capital .

" we have to set an example " for the past four years , ralf steeg , an engineer for landscape architecture and environmental planning , has been working on a way of improving not only the quality of the water in the spree , but consequently the quality of life for those who live on or near its banks . bildunterschrift : an example of a floating pontoon " spree 2011 " his solution , called " spree 2011 " is quite simple .

more people are challenging tickets for illegal parking and driving in bus lanes , according to alg figures .
of the 58,128 appeals , 59 % were won by the driver , although this represents less than 1 % of total fines .

boroughs do n't carry out parking enforcement to antagonise people mike cartwright , alg last week which ? magazine reported that the most number of successful appeals against parking fines were made in the north london borough of islington .

many drivers complain tickets are just a method of raising revenue , not enforcing laws .
three traffic wardens a day on average are assaulted in london .
the alg 's mike cartwright said : " boroughs do n't carry out parking enforcement to antagonise people - parking regulations need to be enforced or they would be worthless .
" however boroughs have listened to the views of motorists and have tried to balance out their concerns with the need to carry out enforcement . "
" illegally parking causes hazards for all road users including pedestrians , and congestion on our already busy roads . "
although fewer parking fines were issued , more drivers are apparently taking their chances elsewhere - an extra 78,000 motorists were caught in bus lanes in the year up to 31 march 2005 .

the royal society for the protection of birds -lrb- rspb -rrb- says the norfolk population is down from 19 to 11 males .
the year 's count for the country shows a drop in numbers to 46 compared with 55 last year , with suffolk recording the highest number at 20 .
a bittern rescue plan began in the mid nineties after a dramatic decline in their numbers to just 11 in 1997 .
lowland marshes the bittern 's fortunes in some counties continued to improve with dorset recording its first booming bittern in recent years , while cambridgeshire doubled its population from two to four .
there was disappointment for researchers in wales , kent and somerset , where last year 's survey had recorded one , three and one booming bittern respectively but this year none were found .
dr ken smith of the rspb said : " in spite of this small setback the recovery of the breeding populations is a conservation success . "
the bittern , best known for its booming call , was once numerous in the fens , but is now only found in a handful of areas .
it is dependent upon large tracts of wet reedbed to find sufficient food , principally fish and amphibians .

as the man who draws the show 's official comic strip , the switch to david tennant sent collins back to the drawing board .
the cardiff-based artist is currently preparing images of the new timelord .
it is the latest challenge for the man who has drawn everything from superman and star trek to harry potter .
as you might have guessed , collins is a massive sci-fi fan , and he admitted he was shocked at eccleston 's decision to leave the tardis after just one series .
he has nearly finished his last story involving christopher eccleston " i had just got to the stage when i can draw christopher eccleston quite comfortably , " he said .
" but i have no problems , he has made a decision that was interesting for the show .
" it is a fresh new broom - david tennant has a great face , and i have to get it right as he is a big fan and is going to read it . "
collins is currently waiting on his tennant drawings to be approved , but said it helped that he has already started working on assistant billie piper , who plays the doctor 's assistant rose .
" billie piper is fine - it took me a little while until i was happy , but one day you just understand how their face comes together , " he said .
david tennant took over the tardis at the end of the last series " you are working with likenesses , and you have to be fairly accurate - it has to be -lsb- enough like the characters -rsb- to be recognisable , but different so they can work in a comic .
" if you do a comic strip , you are the director , the lighting man and all the actors - you have to make it work . "
the monthly comic strips are mostly written by the same team who write the tv show , overseen by russell t davies , who collins says is " very hands-on " .
" they take place with the same characters and you are supposed to believe they fit in certain gaps of the show , " he said .
collins , who works with fellow artist david roach on the strip for the doctor who magazine , said it was important to get everything right , or risk complaints from aficionados .
" doctor who fans are very particular , they treasure the show , " he said .
mike collins sends work across the world from his cardiff studio as a fan himself , collins said he enjoyed doctor who , but admitted his favourite character to draw has been judge dredd .
he always loved drawing as a child growing up in the midlands , but before making a career of it , he had to overcome resistance from his parents who urged him to get " a real job " .
" i always doodled and did caricatures of teachers i did n't get on with .
in the end , i thought this is what i wanted to do . "
he said he was one of a cluster of comic strip artists working in south wales using the internet to send their work all over the world .
but even though some people might think being a freelance artist is the best job in the world , his family has still needed some convincing .
" my daughters never thought anything i do is cool , but finally i did some harry potter trading cards - they liked them . "

the asphalt industry alliance -lrb- aia -rrb- said the problem of potholes is so bad it will take 12 years to correct .
in june , wales ' 22 local authorities called for more than £ 20m in extra funding for road improvements .
a spokesman for the welsh assembly government said an £ 8bn transport plan had been announced last december .
sixteen welsh councils took part in the aia study of the pressures on highway engineers ' maintenance budgets .
the survey found non-principal roads in rural areas are suffering the most , with councils planning to resurface them only every 75 years .
the recommended time is every 20 years .
the backlog of repairs in wales would take more than 12 years unclassified roads face a wait of 86 years before they see a new surface coating , according to the study .
the report also said the poor quality of some country roads is a risk to both road users and the welsh rural economy .
a previous study by the aia found wales received a sixth of the highways maintenance budget per road length compared to london and half of that spent road by local authorities in england .
highways departments in local authorities across wales were working on an annual budget equivalent to just £ 1 per metre of road compared with £ 6 per metre per year in london and £ 2 in the rest of england , it found .
aia chairman jim crick said : " there appears to be an insidious attitude that rural roads and their condition matter less than roads in build-up areas .
" larger and heavier lorries are using them more regularly to deliver to farms and collect farm produce .
they are used , quite literally , to get the goods to market and they need to be fit for purpose and safe . "
in june a report to the welsh local government association -lrb- wlga -rrb- said that much of the extra money that local authorities had received had been spent on day-to-day services .
a spokesman for the wlga said : " as with all capital projects , capital is in short supply .
it does seem as if rural roads are being neglected . "
a spokesman for the welsh assembly government said an £ 8bn transport plan had been announced last december with 40 % of that likely to be spent on roads .
