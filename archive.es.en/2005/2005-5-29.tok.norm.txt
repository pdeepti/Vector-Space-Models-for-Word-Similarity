dw-world spoke with him about next year 's world cup as well as about his team 's success and german soccer 's image abroad . dw : year one of the klinsmann era is almost behind us .
from nine games the national team has played with you at the helm , they 've only lost one , to south korea .
how would you take stock of the team 's performance thus far ? jürgen klinsmann : i think our record is a very , very positive one , above all , because we have grown together as a team , and not just as a new coaching staff .
we complement each other very well .
we 've brought people on board who have brought enormous talents with them .
for example , i 'm thinking of areas like overall fitness , and the fact that we have been able to bring over coaches for that from the us .
there 's also our sports psychologist , who we have integrated into the team ... … and the red jerseys ? … the jerseys , they look really good , but they are n't going to be scoring any goals for us .
i think that the way the team has performed in the last ten months , with style and pizzazz , and all the enthusiasm they 've shown in every game , it 's simply fantastic .
it is incredibly fun to work with this team .
there 's a lot of potential there , and that gives us the confidence to say during the world cup here at home : we want to play for the title ! before the world cup , the confederations cup is taking place , from june 15 - 29 .
eight teams are playing for the trophy , among them germany and top teams such as brazil and argentina .
who do you think will win ? naturally , i hope we do !
and logically , if one says one wants to win the world cup title here in germany , then for the confederations cup , which is often called a test , miniature world cup , we have the same goal . so for you , the confederations cup is a real test run ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann it is a test run for us .
every single game will give us more information about the team 's performance standard .
there is also a bit of ambition involved .
when a team participates in a contest like this , you not only measure yourself against very good teams from around the world , you also want to beat countries like argentina or brazil .
even if the season was a very long one for the players , that provides enough incentive for all of us to really get out there and give it our all . and if the plan does n't work out like you want with the world cup ?
do you feel under pressure ? yes , but that 's normal in soccer .
if you carry the responsibility and things do n't go well , you get into hot water .
that would surely be the case if we do n't perform well , but if i were to think along those lines , i would n't be the right man for this job .
i have taken on this position with a lot of optimism .
if it does n't go as planned , then the avalanche is going to come , like it or not .
but that would happen with anyone . if it came down to playing a beautiful game or winning , which would you choose ? both !
both are important .
of course , we want to play an attractive game of soccer .
i think we 've shown in the last ten months that we have laid a good foundation for that , that we have a team that can play up front , fast and aggressively .
it 's a style of playing that will bear fruit for us .
we have also pursued a new philosophy in which the players identify themselves with their role in the national team .
it 's important that a certain self-image is anchored in the minds of our players that when it comes to the national team , they give it all they 've got ! can germany itself benefit from this kind of positive attitude you 're describing ?
what would a world cup victory mean for germany ?
how important is a good performance by the german team ? i think the team demonstrated how that can help already this year in the european cup .
whether it was in the game here in berlin against brazil , where the fans showed incredible enthusiasm , or the game in iran in front of 120,000 spectators , where the team was able to bring the iranian population over to its side . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann kicking the ball around at the opening of the street soccer festival in berlin we want to build on this positive attitude and we want our players to be aware of the fact that in a way , they act as ambassadors for germany , since we will be observed very closely by the entire world during the upcoming world cup .
everything is going to be reported about , whether it 's about the national team , the cities , or the people who live in germany .
we want to put forward a fantastic image and show people that germany has developed in an incredibly positive way , naturally also after reunification . you yourself live abroad .
how would you describe the image of german soccer outside of this country ? i think that in general , there 's a great respect for german soccer abroad , something which of course has been stamped by our three world championship titles and three european championship titles .
people know that when it comes to tournaments , the german team is always able to concentrate on the essentials .
we know that our opponents have a lot of respect for us .
as far as our domestic teams go , the situation this year has n't been all that positive , since they fell out of the running for the european cup relatively early .
we lost a little bit of our standing there , but we can win that back very quickly . how much has been lost due to the referee scandal ? the referee affair has certainly cost us in the eyes of the world , since most people could n't imagine that such a thing could happen in germany .
we stand for other kinds of values , such as straightforwardness , honesty and a serious business mentality .
the scandal hurt us , no doubt about it , but on the other hand , people abroad have been very impressed with the way the german football federation handled the affair and how consistent they have been in their actions , such as finding those who are guilty and making them pay the consequences . the interview was conducted by guido baumhauer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de referee scandal rears its ugly head in april , german soccer officials quietly put the referee scandal involving robert hoyzer to rest .
but manipulation accusations have risen again , this time involving another ref .

czech president vaclav klaus opposes the eu constitution , and hardly a day goes by in which he does n't remind his countrymen and women of the fact . vaclav klaus , 63 , an economist , prides himself on his title of professor .
one may also refer to him as mr. president , since he has held the position for over two years .
but what he does n't like is being called a euroskeptic . " some people are constantly using labels : euro-optimists , euro-pessimists or euroskeptics , " klaus told deutsche welle . " please do not do this .
those of us who are concerned with the future of europe and what is happening on this continent , we reject being labeled as euroskeptics , because we are actually optimists .
we are making a maximum effort to ensure that things turn out well for this continent and for all of us . " the royal we ? vaclav klaus likes saying " we " instead of " i , " though who he means is not always entirely clear .
but what is clear is that he likes speaking for the czech people . after all , other european countries seem to repeatedly equate the views of the czech republic as a whole with the personal opinion of vaclav klaus , although polls show that 51 percent of czech people are in favor of the eu constitution . for his part , the conservative has never made a secret of his fundamental rejection of the eu constitution .
he opposes the political integration of europe and has a different view of europe , more like the european community of the 1960s and 70s . as far as klaus is concerned , the eu charter is undemocratic and part of a socialist , anti-liberal mechanism that reduces the sovereignty of individual states , particularly of smaller countries .
but all this , klaus insists , is merely his own opinion .
as president of the czech republic he is required to remain neutral . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech president 's office is located in prague castle , overlooking the city vaclav klaus 's critics call him vain and arrogant , and they also accuse him of overstepping the boundaries of his position as president .
the czech president is meant to be little more than a figurehead .
nevertheless , klaus has been trying to do everything in his power to influence the public and convince voters to oppose the eu constitution .
" i do n't like it , " said a 34-year-old woman from prague .
" i do n't think that the president will be able to influence us .
we all have our own view of the issue .
when he says that we will lose our sovereignty , it 's just a joke .
the president has always had strange things to say . " unlikely partners indeed , klaus is backed in his opposition to the eu charter by conservative civic democratic party -lrb- ods -rrb- , which he led for 11 years .
on the other side of the political spectrum , the country 's communists also reject the eu constitution . both parties are influential in the czech republic : the ods is the czech party with the highest approval rating - 30 percent - and the communists follow in second place .
though public cooperation between the two parties is unthinkable , both want the czechs to reject the eu constitution , whether in a national referendum or a " no " vote in parliament . " i predict a glowing future if the constitution does not get ratified , " klaus said .

" i do n't think that the president will be able to influence us .
we all have our own view of the issue .
when he says that we will lose our sovereignty , it 's just a joke .
the president has always had strange things to say . " unlikely partners indeed , klaus is backed in his opposition to the eu charter by conservative civic democratic party -lrb- ods -rrb- , which he led for 11 years .
on the other side of the political spectrum , the country 's communists also reject the eu constitution . both parties are influential in the czech republic : the ods is the czech party with the highest approval rating - 30 percent - and the communists follow in second place .
though public cooperation between the two parties is unthinkable , both want the czechs to reject the eu constitution , whether in a national referendum or a " no " vote in parliament . " i predict a glowing future if the constitution does not get ratified , " klaus said .

projections released immediately after polls closed show between 54.5 and 55.6 percent voted against the document . it was not much of a surprise , since surveys for several weeks have shown the " no " camp to be in the lead .
despite an urgent , last-minute appeal from president jacques chirac , a majority of french voters were not convinced that the proposed constitution , which was designed to simplify decision making after the eu 's enlargement last year , was in their best interests . the sharp defeat for the charter , which has been dreaded by eu leaders , could weaken france , one of the central pillars of the european union .
supporters have said a defeat could stall european integration and unsettle some financial markets . " the decision of france inevitably creates a difficult context for defending our interests in europe , " chirac said in an address broadcast on national television . bildunterschrift : but cheers went up from supporters of the " no " campaign when the exit polls results were announced just after voting ended at 2200 central european time .
those who rejected the treaty included communists , various left-wing groups , dissident socialists and far-right parties . with the french rejection , the eu constitution in its current form has been dealt a potentially fatal blow and the future path of the european bloc is unclear .
the charter needed the ratification of all 25 eu states to go into effect .
france was the tenth country to decide about the document .
previously , nine eu member states had given their approval . the question now is whether the ratification process will continue in the remaining eu states that have not yet voted .
french foreign minister michel barnier said the vote was a " real disappointment , " but added that other eu countries should go ahead with their own votes regardless . setback for president the results are a blow to french president jacques chirac , who had campaigned hard for the charter 's passage , including broadcasting a last-minute appeal on french television just days before sunday 's vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vote was seen by many to be as much about the popularity of chirac and his government as about the future course of the eu .
the bitter debate divided france and became a debate on france 's overall malaise and fears that low-wage new member countries in eastern europe could be dangerous to france 's economic health . french far-right leader jean-marie le pen and eurosceptic philippe de villiers urged chirac to step down on sunday .
previously , chirac had said he would not quit after the vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac leaves the polling station after casting his vote in sarran , southwestern france sunday may 29 , 2005 in a referendum on the eu constitution .
however , after the results came in , chirac said he would make a decision on the future of his center-right government " in the coming days " after french voters overwhelmingly rejected the eu constitution .
it 's largely expected he will dismiss unpopular prime minister jean-pierre raffarin . not dead yet the head of the european socialist party poul nyrup rasmussen lamented sunday france 's rejection of the eu constitution , saying it was a " sad day " for europe but insisting that the charter was not dead . " this is a sad , sad day for france and a sad day for europe too , " he said in a statement after exit polls indicated that some 55 percent of french voters rejected the constitution . " but rumors of the constitution 's demise have been greatly exaggerated , " he added .
" we must not read the ' non ' in france as a ' non ' to europe .
this is not the last word on the european constitution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and he added : " the french people wished to reject a tired and unpopular government that has failed to represent the concerns of ordinary people in france . " the dutch are scheduled to vote on the charter on wednesday .
dutch ministers urged their citizens to ignore the result in france . what now ? if the constitution does not survive , the eu will continue to operate under its current rules , which were laid out in the treaty of nice .
but the system is seen as largely unworkable with a union of 25 countries , since voting could soon become paralyzed . opponents want the eu to redraft a proposed constitution and improve it , putting in safeguards against labor from new member states dragging on wages and adding protections for europe 's social market economy . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dossier : france and the eu 's future dw-world looks back at france and its fraught relationship with the proposed eu constitution .

-lrb- may 29 , 2005 -rrb- franco-german ties after a french " non " if french voters do indeed reject the draft eu constitution in sunday 's referendum , the european union will likely be catapulted into a crisis and franco-german relations may suffer serious damage .

projections released immediately after polls closed show between 54.5 and 55.6 percent voted against the document . it was not much of a surprise , since surveys for several weeks have shown the " no " camp to be in the lead .
despite an urgent , last-minute appeal from president jacques chirac , a majority of french voters were not convinced that the proposed constitution , which was designed to simplify decision making after the eu 's enlargement last year , was in their best interests . the sharp defeat for the charter , which has been dreaded by eu leaders , could weaken france , one of the central pillars of the european union .
supporters have said a defeat could stall european integration and unsettle some financial markets . " the decision of france inevitably creates a difficult context for defending our interests in europe , " chirac said in an address broadcast on national television . bildunterschrift : but cheers went up from supporters of the " no " campaign when the exit polls results were announced just after voting ended at 2200 central european time .
those who rejected the treaty included communists , various left-wing groups , dissident socialists and far-right parties . with the french rejection , the eu constitution in its current form has been dealt a potentially fatal blow and the future path of the european bloc is unclear .
the charter needed the ratification of all 25 eu states to go into effect .
france was the tenth country to decide about the document .
previously , nine eu member states had given their approval . the question now is whether the ratification process will continue in the remaining eu states that have not yet voted .
french foreign minister michel barnier said the vote was a " real disappointment , " but added that other eu countries should go ahead with their own votes regardless . setback for president the results are a blow to french president jacques chirac , who had campaigned hard for the charter 's passage , including broadcasting a last-minute appeal on french television just days before sunday 's vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vote was seen by many to be as much about the popularity of chirac and his government as about the future course of the eu .
the bitter debate divided france and became a debate on france 's overall malaise and fears that low-wage new member countries in eastern europe could be dangerous to france 's economic health . french far-right leader jean-marie le pen and eurosceptic philippe de villiers urged chirac to step down on sunday .

however , after the results came in , chirac said he would make a decision on the future of his center-right government " in the coming days " after french voters overwhelmingly rejected the eu constitution .
it 's largely expected he will dismiss unpopular prime minister jean-pierre raffarin . not dead yet the head of the european socialist party poul nyrup rasmussen lamented sunday france 's rejection of the eu constitution , saying it was a " sad day " for europe but insisting that the charter was not dead . " this is a sad , sad day for france and a sad day for europe too , " he said in a statement after exit polls indicated that some 55 percent of french voters rejected the constitution . " but rumors of the constitution 's demise have been greatly exaggerated , " he added .

dutch ministers urged their citizens to ignore the result in france . what now ? if the constitution does not survive , the eu will continue to operate under its current rules , which were laid out in the treaty of nice .
but the system is seen as largely unworkable with a union of 25 countries , since voting could soon become paralyzed . opponents want the eu to redraft a proposed constitution and improve it , putting in safeguards against labor from new member states dragging on wages and adding protections for europe 's social market economy . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dossier : france and the eu 's future dw-world looks back at france and its fraught relationship with the proposed eu constitution .

" thailand is a beautiful destination and it has excellent health care services and the prices are - compared to germany - very , very affordable , " she said .

in many parts of south east asia , medicine provides good financial opportunities .
investments in modern technology and luxury institutions are paying off , said bangkok hospital 's marketing manager ralf krewer .
almost all of the 500 doctors working at south east asia 's largest private hospital group are thai . " in the past , the majority of thai doctors went to the us , germany , australia or japan to practice and further their academic education , " he said .
" but the heavy investment on the thai side led to many of those top doctors coming back . " thai doctors tough competition thai doctors are tough competition for their german colleagues who are beginning to feel the pinch .
german doctors and dentists are highly sceptical about growing overseas health tourism .
they question the monitoring of medical standards .
they ask whether sophisticated treatments actually delivered , whether quality materials are used in complicated dental surgery and so on . also , doctors overseas are not able to deal with long-term patient preparation before operations and prophylactic care , specialists argue .
botched surgery is hard to rectify .
and who will be responsible for the often sensitive rehabilitation process , they wonder . the mutual trust between a patient and a doctor plays a vital role in the recovery process , german doctors say .
health tourism , they argue , can not provide that atmosphere of trust . petra reichelt dismisses such criticism and says that her hospital has a consistent focus on the quality of service provided and patient satisfaction .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 29.05.2005 interview : klinsmann cool under pressure großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann in conversation with dw-world head guido baumhauer jürgen klinsmann took the reigns of germany 's national soccer team almost a year ago .
dw-world spoke with him about next year 's world cup as well as about his team 's success and german soccer 's image abroad . dw : year one of the klinsmann era is almost behind us .
from nine games the national team has played with you at the helm , they 've only lost one , to south korea .
how would you take stock of the team 's performance thus far ? jürgen klinsmann : i think our record is a very , very positive one , above all , because we have grown together as a team , and not just as a new coaching staff .
we complement each other very well .
we 've brought people on board who have brought enormous talents with them .
for example , i 'm thinking of areas like overall fitness , and the fact that we have been able to bring over coaches for that from the us .
there 's also our sports psychologist , who we have integrated into the team ... … and the red jerseys ? … the jerseys , they look really good , but they are n't going to be scoring any goals for us .
i think that the way the team has performed in the last ten months , with style and pizzazz , and all the enthusiasm they 've shown in every game , it 's simply fantastic .
it is incredibly fun to work with this team .
there 's a lot of potential there , and that gives us the confidence to say during the world cup here at home : we want to play for the title ! before the world cup , the confederations cup is taking place , from june 15 - 29 .
eight teams are playing for the trophy , among them germany and top teams such as brazil and argentina .
who do you think will win ? naturally , i hope we do !
and logically , if one says one wants to win the world cup title here in germany , then for the confederations cup , which is often called a test , miniature world cup , we have the same goal . so for you , the confederations cup is a real test run ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann it is a test run for us .
every single game will give us more information about the team 's performance standard .
there is also a bit of ambition involved .
when a team participates in a contest like this , you not only measure yourself against very good teams from around the world , you also want to beat countries like argentina or brazil .
even if the season was a very long one for the players , that provides enough incentive for all of us to really get out there and give it our all . and if the plan does n't work out like you want with the world cup ?
do you feel under pressure ? yes , but that 's normal in soccer .
if you carry the responsibility and things do n't go well , you get into hot water .
that would surely be the case if we do n't perform well , but if i were to think along those lines , i would n't be the right man for this job .
i have taken on this position with a lot of optimism .
if it does n't go as planned , then the avalanche is going to come , like it or not .
but that would happen with anyone . if it came down to playing a beautiful game or winning , which would you choose ? both !
both are important .
of course , we want to play an attractive game of soccer .
i think we 've shown in the last ten months that we have laid a good foundation for that , that we have a team that can play up front , fast and aggressively .
it 's a style of playing that will bear fruit for us .
we have also pursued a new philosophy in which the players identify themselves with their role in the national team .
it 's important that a certain self-image is anchored in the minds of our players that when it comes to the national team , they give it all they 've got ! can germany itself benefit from this kind of positive attitude you 're describing ?
what would a world cup victory mean for germany ?
how important is a good performance by the german team ? i think the team demonstrated how that can help already this year in the european cup .
whether it was in the game here in berlin against brazil , where the fans showed incredible enthusiasm , or the game in iran in front of 120,000 spectators , where the team was able to bring the iranian population over to its side . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann kicking the ball around at the opening of the street soccer festival in berlin we want to build on this positive attitude and we want our players to be aware of the fact that in a way , they act as ambassadors for germany , since we will be observed very closely by the entire world during the upcoming world cup .
everything is going to be reported about , whether it 's about the national team , the cities , or the people who live in germany .
we want to put forward a fantastic image and show people that germany has developed in an incredibly positive way , naturally also after reunification . you yourself live abroad .
how would you describe the image of german soccer outside of this country ? i think that in general , there 's a great respect for german soccer abroad , something which of course has been stamped by our three world championship titles and three european championship titles .
people know that when it comes to tournaments , the german team is always able to concentrate on the essentials .
we know that our opponents have a lot of respect for us .
as far as our domestic teams go , the situation this year has n't been all that positive , since they fell out of the running for the european cup relatively early .
we lost a little bit of our standing there , but we can win that back very quickly . how much has been lost due to the referee scandal ? the referee affair has certainly cost us in the eyes of the world , since most people could n't imagine that such a thing could happen in germany .
we stand for other kinds of values , such as straightforwardness , honesty and a serious business mentality .
the scandal hurt us , no doubt about it , but on the other hand , people abroad have been very impressed with the way the german football federation handled the affair and how consistent they have been in their actions , such as finding those who are guilty and making them pay the consequences . the interview was conducted by guido baumhauer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de referee scandal rears its ugly head in april , german soccer officials quietly put the referee scandal involving robert hoyzer to rest .
but manipulation accusations have risen again , this time involving another ref .

projections released immediately after polls closed show between 54.5 and 55.6 percent voted against the document . it was not much of a surprise , since surveys for several weeks have shown the " no " camp to be in the lead .
despite an urgent , last-minute appeal from president jacques chirac , a majority of french voters were not convinced that the proposed constitution , which was designed to simplify decision making after the eu 's enlargement last year , was in their best interests . the sharp defeat for the charter , which has been dreaded by eu leaders , could weaken france , one of the central pillars of the european union .
supporters have said a defeat could stall european integration and unsettle some financial markets . " the decision of france inevitably creates a difficult context for defending our interests in europe , " chirac said in an address broadcast on national television . bildunterschrift : but cheers went up from supporters of the " no " campaign when the exit polls results were announced just after voting ended at 2200 central european time .
those who rejected the treaty included communists , various left-wing groups , dissident socialists and far-right parties . with the french rejection , the eu constitution in its current form has been dealt a potentially fatal blow and the future path of the european bloc is unclear .
the charter needed the ratification of all 25 eu states to go into effect .
france was the tenth country to decide about the document .
previously , nine eu member states had given their approval . the question now is whether the ratification process will continue in the remaining eu states that have not yet voted .
french foreign minister michel barnier said the vote was a " real disappointment , " but added that other eu countries should go ahead with their own votes regardless . setback for president the results are a blow to french president jacques chirac , who had campaigned hard for the charter 's passage , including broadcasting a last-minute appeal on french television just days before sunday 's vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vote was seen by many to be as much about the popularity of chirac and his government as about the future course of the eu .
the bitter debate divided france and became a debate on france 's overall malaise and fears that low-wage new member countries in eastern europe could be dangerous to france 's economic health . french far-right leader jean-marie le pen and eurosceptic philippe de villiers urged chirac to step down on sunday .

it 's largely expected he will dismiss unpopular prime minister jean-pierre raffarin . not dead yet the head of the european socialist party poul nyrup rasmussen lamented sunday france 's rejection of the eu constitution , saying it was a " sad day " for europe but insisting that the charter was not dead . " this is a sad , sad day for france and a sad day for europe too , " he said in a statement after exit polls indicated that some 55 percent of french voters rejected the constitution . " but rumors of the constitution 's demise have been greatly exaggerated , " he added .
" we must not read the ' non ' in france as a ' non ' to europe .

the facilities are great , the technology is highly advanced . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as good as in the us or germany , hospital officials say indeed , medical care , technology and hygiene largely are on a level with us hospitals .
while ordinary patients share double or triple rooms in german hospitals , south east asian private institutions offer only luxury single rooms .
in many parts of south east asia , medicine provides good financial opportunities .
investments in modern technology and luxury institutions are paying off , said bangkok hospital 's marketing manager ralf krewer .
almost all of the 500 doctors working at south east asia 's largest private hospital group are thai . " in the past , the majority of thai doctors went to the us , germany , australia or japan to practice and further their academic education , " he said .
" but the heavy investment on the thai side led to many of those top doctors coming back . " thai doctors tough competition thai doctors are tough competition for their german colleagues who are beginning to feel the pinch .
german doctors and dentists are highly sceptical about growing overseas health tourism .
they question the monitoring of medical standards .
they ask whether sophisticated treatments actually delivered , whether quality materials are used in complicated dental surgery and so on . also , doctors overseas are not able to deal with long-term patient preparation before operations and prophylactic care , specialists argue .
botched surgery is hard to rectify .
and who will be responsible for the often sensitive rehabilitation process , they wonder . the mutual trust between a patient and a doctor plays a vital role in the recovery process , german doctors say .
health tourism , they argue , can not provide that atmosphere of trust . petra reichelt dismisses such criticism and says that her hospital has a consistent focus on the quality of service provided and patient satisfaction . " i think a lot of people were very surprised to learn how advanced and how great a standard we offer , " she said . peter zimmermann -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tourism after the flood thailand , sri lanka and the maldives are among the most popular holiday destinations for germans .

czech president vaclav klaus opposes the eu constitution , and hardly a day goes by in which he does n't remind his countrymen and women of the fact . vaclav klaus , 63 , an economist , prides himself on his title of professor .
one may also refer to him as mr. president , since he has held the position for over two years .
but what he does n't like is being called a euroskeptic . " some people are constantly using labels : euro-optimists , euro-pessimists or euroskeptics , " klaus told deutsche welle . " please do not do this .
those of us who are concerned with the future of europe and what is happening on this continent , we reject being labeled as euroskeptics , because we are actually optimists .
we are making a maximum effort to ensure that things turn out well for this continent and for all of us . " the royal we ? vaclav klaus likes saying " we " instead of " i , " though who he means is not always entirely clear .
but what is clear is that he likes speaking for the czech people . after all , other european countries seem to repeatedly equate the views of the czech republic as a whole with the personal opinion of vaclav klaus , although polls show that 51 percent of czech people are in favor of the eu constitution . for his part , the conservative has never made a secret of his fundamental rejection of the eu constitution .
he opposes the political integration of europe and has a different view of europe , more like the european community of the 1960s and 70s . as far as klaus is concerned , the eu charter is undemocratic and part of a socialist , anti-liberal mechanism that reduces the sovereignty of individual states , particularly of smaller countries .
but all this , klaus insists , is merely his own opinion .
as president of the czech republic he is required to remain neutral . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech president 's office is located in prague castle , overlooking the city vaclav klaus 's critics call him vain and arrogant , and they also accuse him of overstepping the boundaries of his position as president .
the czech president is meant to be little more than a figurehead .
nevertheless , klaus has been trying to do everything in his power to influence the public and convince voters to oppose the eu constitution .
" i do n't like it , " said a 34-year-old woman from prague .
" i do n't think that the president will be able to influence us .
we all have our own view of the issue .
when he says that we will lose our sovereignty , it 's just a joke .
the president has always had strange things to say . " unlikely partners indeed , klaus is backed in his opposition to the eu charter by conservative civic democratic party -lrb- ods -rrb- , which he led for 11 years .
on the other side of the political spectrum , the country 's communists also reject the eu constitution . both parties are influential in the czech republic : the ods is the czech party with the highest approval rating - 30 percent - and the communists follow in second place .
though public cooperation between the two parties is unthinkable , both want the czechs to reject the eu constitution , whether in a national referendum or a " no " vote in parliament . " i predict a glowing future if the constitution does not get ratified , " klaus said .

dw-world spoke with him about next year 's world cup as well as about his team 's success and german soccer 's image abroad . dw : year one of the klinsmann era is almost behind us .
from nine games the national team has played with you at the helm , they 've only lost one , to south korea .
how would you take stock of the team 's performance thus far ? jürgen klinsmann : i think our record is a very , very positive one , above all , because we have grown together as a team , and not just as a new coaching staff .
we complement each other very well .
we 've brought people on board who have brought enormous talents with them .
for example , i 'm thinking of areas like overall fitness , and the fact that we have been able to bring over coaches for that from the us .
there 's also our sports psychologist , who we have integrated into the team ... … and the red jerseys ? … the jerseys , they look really good , but they are n't going to be scoring any goals for us .
i think that the way the team has performed in the last ten months , with style and pizzazz , and all the enthusiasm they 've shown in every game , it 's simply fantastic .
it is incredibly fun to work with this team .
there 's a lot of potential there , and that gives us the confidence to say during the world cup here at home : we want to play for the title ! before the world cup , the confederations cup is taking place , from june 15 - 29 .
eight teams are playing for the trophy , among them germany and top teams such as brazil and argentina .
who do you think will win ? naturally , i hope we do !
and logically , if one says one wants to win the world cup title here in germany , then for the confederations cup , which is often called a test , miniature world cup , we have the same goal . so for you , the confederations cup is a real test run ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann it is a test run for us .
every single game will give us more information about the team 's performance standard .
there is also a bit of ambition involved .
when a team participates in a contest like this , you not only measure yourself against very good teams from around the world , you also want to beat countries like argentina or brazil .
even if the season was a very long one for the players , that provides enough incentive for all of us to really get out there and give it our all . and if the plan does n't work out like you want with the world cup ?
do you feel under pressure ? yes , but that 's normal in soccer .
if you carry the responsibility and things do n't go well , you get into hot water .
that would surely be the case if we do n't perform well , but if i were to think along those lines , i would n't be the right man for this job .
i have taken on this position with a lot of optimism .
if it does n't go as planned , then the avalanche is going to come , like it or not .
but that would happen with anyone . if it came down to playing a beautiful game or winning , which would you choose ? both !
both are important .
of course , we want to play an attractive game of soccer .
i think we 've shown in the last ten months that we have laid a good foundation for that , that we have a team that can play up front , fast and aggressively .
it 's a style of playing that will bear fruit for us .
we have also pursued a new philosophy in which the players identify themselves with their role in the national team .
it 's important that a certain self-image is anchored in the minds of our players that when it comes to the national team , they give it all they 've got ! can germany itself benefit from this kind of positive attitude you 're describing ?
what would a world cup victory mean for germany ?
how important is a good performance by the german team ? i think the team demonstrated how that can help already this year in the european cup .
whether it was in the game here in berlin against brazil , where the fans showed incredible enthusiasm , or the game in iran in front of 120,000 spectators , where the team was able to bring the iranian population over to its side . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann kicking the ball around at the opening of the street soccer festival in berlin we want to build on this positive attitude and we want our players to be aware of the fact that in a way , they act as ambassadors for germany , since we will be observed very closely by the entire world during the upcoming world cup .
everything is going to be reported about , whether it 's about the national team , the cities , or the people who live in germany .
we want to put forward a fantastic image and show people that germany has developed in an incredibly positive way , naturally also after reunification . you yourself live abroad .
how would you describe the image of german soccer outside of this country ? i think that in general , there 's a great respect for german soccer abroad , something which of course has been stamped by our three world championship titles and three european championship titles .
people know that when it comes to tournaments , the german team is always able to concentrate on the essentials .
we know that our opponents have a lot of respect for us .
as far as our domestic teams go , the situation this year has n't been all that positive , since they fell out of the running for the european cup relatively early .

dw-world spoke with him about next year 's world cup as well as about his team 's success and german soccer 's image abroad . dw : year one of the klinsmann era is almost behind us .
from nine games the national team has played with you at the helm , they 've only lost one , to south korea .
how would you take stock of the team 's performance thus far ? jürgen klinsmann : i think our record is a very , very positive one , above all , because we have grown together as a team , and not just as a new coaching staff .
we complement each other very well .
we 've brought people on board who have brought enormous talents with them .
for example , i 'm thinking of areas like overall fitness , and the fact that we have been able to bring over coaches for that from the us .
there 's also our sports psychologist , who we have integrated into the team ... … and the red jerseys ? … the jerseys , they look really good , but they are n't going to be scoring any goals for us .
i think that the way the team has performed in the last ten months , with style and pizzazz , and all the enthusiasm they 've shown in every game , it 's simply fantastic .
it is incredibly fun to work with this team .
there 's a lot of potential there , and that gives us the confidence to say during the world cup here at home : we want to play for the title ! before the world cup , the confederations cup is taking place , from june 15 - 29 .
eight teams are playing for the trophy , among them germany and top teams such as brazil and argentina .
who do you think will win ? naturally , i hope we do !
and logically , if one says one wants to win the world cup title here in germany , then for the confederations cup , which is often called a test , miniature world cup , we have the same goal . so for you , the confederations cup is a real test run ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann it is a test run for us .
every single game will give us more information about the team 's performance standard .
there is also a bit of ambition involved .
when a team participates in a contest like this , you not only measure yourself against very good teams from around the world , you also want to beat countries like argentina or brazil .
even if the season was a very long one for the players , that provides enough incentive for all of us to really get out there and give it our all . and if the plan does n't work out like you want with the world cup ?
do you feel under pressure ? yes , but that 's normal in soccer .
if you carry the responsibility and things do n't go well , you get into hot water .
that would surely be the case if we do n't perform well , but if i were to think along those lines , i would n't be the right man for this job .
i have taken on this position with a lot of optimism .
if it does n't go as planned , then the avalanche is going to come , like it or not .
but that would happen with anyone . if it came down to playing a beautiful game or winning , which would you choose ? both !
both are important .
of course , we want to play an attractive game of soccer .
i think we 've shown in the last ten months that we have laid a good foundation for that , that we have a team that can play up front , fast and aggressively .
it 's a style of playing that will bear fruit for us .
we have also pursued a new philosophy in which the players identify themselves with their role in the national team .
it 's important that a certain self-image is anchored in the minds of our players that when it comes to the national team , they give it all they 've got ! can germany itself benefit from this kind of positive attitude you 're describing ?
what would a world cup victory mean for germany ?
how important is a good performance by the german team ? i think the team demonstrated how that can help already this year in the european cup .
whether it was in the game here in berlin against brazil , where the fans showed incredible enthusiasm , or the game in iran in front of 120,000 spectators , where the team was able to bring the iranian population over to its side . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann kicking the ball around at the opening of the street soccer festival in berlin we want to build on this positive attitude and we want our players to be aware of the fact that in a way , they act as ambassadors for germany , since we will be observed very closely by the entire world during the upcoming world cup .
everything is going to be reported about , whether it 's about the national team , the cities , or the people who live in germany .
we want to put forward a fantastic image and show people that germany has developed in an incredibly positive way , naturally also after reunification . you yourself live abroad .
how would you describe the image of german soccer outside of this country ? i think that in general , there 's a great respect for german soccer abroad , something which of course has been stamped by our three world championship titles and three european championship titles .
people know that when it comes to tournaments , the german team is always able to concentrate on the essentials .
we know that our opponents have a lot of respect for us .
as far as our domestic teams go , the situation this year has n't been all that positive , since they fell out of the running for the european cup relatively early .
we lost a little bit of our standing there , but we can win that back very quickly . how much has been lost due to the referee scandal ? the referee affair has certainly cost us in the eyes of the world , since most people could n't imagine that such a thing could happen in germany .
we stand for other kinds of values , such as straightforwardness , honesty and a serious business mentality .

there 's a lot of potential there , and that gives us the confidence to say during the world cup here at home : we want to play for the title ! before the world cup , the confederations cup is taking place , from june 15 - 29 .
eight teams are playing for the trophy , among them germany and top teams such as brazil and argentina .
who do you think will win ? naturally , i hope we do !
and logically , if one says one wants to win the world cup title here in germany , then for the confederations cup , which is often called a test , miniature world cup , we have the same goal . so for you , the confederations cup is a real test run ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann it is a test run for us .
every single game will give us more information about the team 's performance standard .
there is also a bit of ambition involved .
when a team participates in a contest like this , you not only measure yourself against very good teams from around the world , you also want to beat countries like argentina or brazil .
even if the season was a very long one for the players , that provides enough incentive for all of us to really get out there and give it our all . and if the plan does n't work out like you want with the world cup ?
do you feel under pressure ? yes , but that 's normal in soccer .
if you carry the responsibility and things do n't go well , you get into hot water .
that would surely be the case if we do n't perform well , but if i were to think along those lines , i would n't be the right man for this job .
i have taken on this position with a lot of optimism .
if it does n't go as planned , then the avalanche is going to come , like it or not .
but that would happen with anyone . if it came down to playing a beautiful game or winning , which would you choose ? both !
both are important .
of course , we want to play an attractive game of soccer .
i think we 've shown in the last ten months that we have laid a good foundation for that , that we have a team that can play up front , fast and aggressively .
it 's a style of playing that will bear fruit for us .
we have also pursued a new philosophy in which the players identify themselves with their role in the national team .
it 's important that a certain self-image is anchored in the minds of our players that when it comes to the national team , they give it all they 've got ! can germany itself benefit from this kind of positive attitude you 're describing ?
what would a world cup victory mean for germany ?
how important is a good performance by the german team ? i think the team demonstrated how that can help already this year in the european cup .
whether it was in the game here in berlin against brazil , where the fans showed incredible enthusiasm , or the game in iran in front of 120,000 spectators , where the team was able to bring the iranian population over to its side . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann kicking the ball around at the opening of the street soccer festival in berlin we want to build on this positive attitude and we want our players to be aware of the fact that in a way , they act as ambassadors for germany , since we will be observed very closely by the entire world during the upcoming world cup .
everything is going to be reported about , whether it 's about the national team , the cities , or the people who live in germany .
we want to put forward a fantastic image and show people that germany has developed in an incredibly positive way , naturally also after reunification . you yourself live abroad .
how would you describe the image of german soccer outside of this country ? i think that in general , there 's a great respect for german soccer abroad , something which of course has been stamped by our three world championship titles and three european championship titles .
people know that when it comes to tournaments , the german team is always able to concentrate on the essentials .
we know that our opponents have a lot of respect for us .
as far as our domestic teams go , the situation this year has n't been all that positive , since they fell out of the running for the european cup relatively early .
we lost a little bit of our standing there , but we can win that back very quickly . how much has been lost due to the referee scandal ? the referee affair has certainly cost us in the eyes of the world , since most people could n't imagine that such a thing could happen in germany .
we stand for other kinds of values , such as straightforwardness , honesty and a serious business mentality .
the scandal hurt us , no doubt about it , but on the other hand , people abroad have been very impressed with the way the german football federation handled the affair and how consistent they have been in their actions , such as finding those who are guilty and making them pay the consequences . the interview was conducted by guido baumhauer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de referee scandal rears its ugly head in april , german soccer officials quietly put the referee scandal involving robert hoyzer to rest .

dw-world spoke with him about next year 's world cup as well as about his team 's success and german soccer 's image abroad . dw : year one of the klinsmann era is almost behind us .
from nine games the national team has played with you at the helm , they 've only lost one , to south korea .
how would you take stock of the team 's performance thus far ? jürgen klinsmann : i think our record is a very , very positive one , above all , because we have grown together as a team , and not just as a new coaching staff .
we complement each other very well .
we 've brought people on board who have brought enormous talents with them .
for example , i 'm thinking of areas like overall fitness , and the fact that we have been able to bring over coaches for that from the us .
there 's also our sports psychologist , who we have integrated into the team ... … and the red jerseys ? … the jerseys , they look really good , but they are n't going to be scoring any goals for us .
i think that the way the team has performed in the last ten months , with style and pizzazz , and all the enthusiasm they 've shown in every game , it 's simply fantastic .
it is incredibly fun to work with this team .

projections released immediately after polls closed show between 54.5 and 55.6 percent voted against the document . it was not much of a surprise , since surveys for several weeks have shown the " no " camp to be in the lead .
despite an urgent , last-minute appeal from president jacques chirac , a majority of french voters were not convinced that the proposed constitution , which was designed to simplify decision making after the eu 's enlargement last year , was in their best interests . the sharp defeat for the charter , which has been dreaded by eu leaders , could weaken france , one of the central pillars of the european union .
supporters have said a defeat could stall european integration and unsettle some financial markets . " the decision of france inevitably creates a difficult context for defending our interests in europe , " chirac said in an address broadcast on national television . bildunterschrift : but cheers went up from supporters of the " no " campaign when the exit polls results were announced just after voting ended at 2200 central european time .
those who rejected the treaty included communists , various left-wing groups , dissident socialists and far-right parties . with the french rejection , the eu constitution in its current form has been dealt a potentially fatal blow and the future path of the european bloc is unclear .
the charter needed the ratification of all 25 eu states to go into effect .
france was the tenth country to decide about the document .
previously , nine eu member states had given their approval . the question now is whether the ratification process will continue in the remaining eu states that have not yet voted .
french foreign minister michel barnier said the vote was a " real disappointment , " but added that other eu countries should go ahead with their own votes regardless . setback for president the results are a blow to french president jacques chirac , who had campaigned hard for the charter 's passage , including broadcasting a last-minute appeal on french television just days before sunday 's vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vote was seen by many to be as much about the popularity of chirac and his government as about the future course of the eu .
the bitter debate divided france and became a debate on france 's overall malaise and fears that low-wage new member countries in eastern europe could be dangerous to france 's economic health . french far-right leader jean-marie le pen and eurosceptic philippe de villiers urged chirac to step down on sunday .

however , after the results came in , chirac said he would make a decision on the future of his center-right government " in the coming days " after french voters overwhelmingly rejected the eu constitution .
it 's largely expected he will dismiss unpopular prime minister jean-pierre raffarin . not dead yet the head of the european socialist party poul nyrup rasmussen lamented sunday france 's rejection of the eu constitution , saying it was a " sad day " for europe but insisting that the charter was not dead . " this is a sad , sad day for france and a sad day for europe too , " he said in a statement after exit polls indicated that some 55 percent of french voters rejected the constitution . " but rumors of the constitution 's demise have been greatly exaggerated , " he added .
" we must not read the ' non ' in france as a ' non ' to europe .
this is not the last word on the european constitution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and he added : " the french people wished to reject a tired and unpopular government that has failed to represent the concerns of ordinary people in france . " the dutch are scheduled to vote on the charter on wednesday .
dutch ministers urged their citizens to ignore the result in france . what now ? if the constitution does not survive , the eu will continue to operate under its current rules , which were laid out in the treaty of nice .
but the system is seen as largely unworkable with a union of 25 countries , since voting could soon become paralyzed . opponents want the eu to redraft a proposed constitution and improve it , putting in safeguards against labor from new member states dragging on wages and adding protections for europe 's social market economy . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dossier : france and the eu 's future dw-world looks back at france and its fraught relationship with the proposed eu constitution .

in her work , it is not unusual for her to encounter her compatriots - 500,000 to 600,000 german tourists visit the country annually and some of them have accidents or fall ill . but petra reichelt says a growing new clientele is beginning to combine health-care needs with holiday pleasures . " thailand is a beautiful destination and it has excellent health care services and the prices are - compared to germany - very , very affordable , " she said .
" so why not take a vacation for the same money , have your teeth done , have a laser done or whatever you need .
and just take your whole family , make a vacation of that and it wo n't cost you more than in germany . " a hub for medical care initially , the international hospital in thailand 's capital was built with the purpose of creating a comfortable ambience for customers from different cultures .
but these days , with a network of 12 network hospitals and more than 5,000 in-patient beds throughout thailand , bangkok hospital now sees itself as " the world 's premier medical hub " for foreign tourists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aftermath of a disaster attracting patients to paradise is the name of the game these days .
and due to germany 's current reform of the state health-system , germans are increasingly confronted with high costs for medical treatment at home .
the great uncertainty about further cuts has led to an unprecedented boom in health tourism as patients seek deals on the internet . and they are there to be had .
cosmetic breast enlargement in germany costs an average of 5,000 euros .
bangkok offers the same operation for 4,535 euros - but that 's including a return flight and one week worth of hotel accommodation in a luxury 5-star hotel . " i got dental implants in bangkok last summer , " said one satisfied customer .
" i had a face lift in cape town in the winter .
and i saved a lot of money .
it was fun and i feel fine and i had a holiday . " beaches and medical treatment health- and wellness-travel is the booming sector in tourism .
already , 20 percent of all cosmetic surgery is booked along with a stylish holiday .
and south east asia is well positioned in the expanding market .
from robotic cardiac surgery to cancer care , from gastro-intestinal surgery or hiv treatment , hospitals in india , korea , singapore and thailand often offer their medical services at a quarter of german prices .
and so far , no complaints have been registered in germany , according to petra reichelt . " do n't fear , the hospitals are great , " she said .
" the service is better .
the facilities are great , the technology is highly advanced . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as good as in the us or germany , hospital officials say indeed , medical care , technology and hygiene largely are on a level with us hospitals .
while ordinary patients share double or triple rooms in german hospitals , south east asian private institutions offer only luxury single rooms .
in many parts of south east asia , medicine provides good financial opportunities .

in her work , it is not unusual for her to encounter her compatriots - 500,000 to 600,000 german tourists visit the country annually and some of them have accidents or fall ill . but petra reichelt says a growing new clientele is beginning to combine health-care needs with holiday pleasures . " thailand is a beautiful destination and it has excellent health care services and the prices are - compared to germany - very , very affordable , " she said .
" so why not take a vacation for the same money , have your teeth done , have a laser done or whatever you need .
and just take your whole family , make a vacation of that and it wo n't cost you more than in germany . " a hub for medical care initially , the international hospital in thailand 's capital was built with the purpose of creating a comfortable ambience for customers from different cultures .
but these days , with a network of 12 network hospitals and more than 5,000 in-patient beds throughout thailand , bangkok hospital now sees itself as " the world 's premier medical hub " for foreign tourists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aftermath of a disaster attracting patients to paradise is the name of the game these days .
and due to germany 's current reform of the state health-system , germans are increasingly confronted with high costs for medical treatment at home .
the great uncertainty about further cuts has led to an unprecedented boom in health tourism as patients seek deals on the internet . and they are there to be had .
cosmetic breast enlargement in germany costs an average of 5,000 euros .
bangkok offers the same operation for 4,535 euros - but that 's including a return flight and one week worth of hotel accommodation in a luxury 5-star hotel . " i got dental implants in bangkok last summer , " said one satisfied customer .
" i had a face lift in cape town in the winter .
and i saved a lot of money .
it was fun and i feel fine and i had a holiday . " beaches and medical treatment health- and wellness-travel is the booming sector in tourism .
already , 20 percent of all cosmetic surgery is booked along with a stylish holiday .
and south east asia is well positioned in the expanding market .
from robotic cardiac surgery to cancer care , from gastro-intestinal surgery or hiv treatment , hospitals in india , korea , singapore and thailand often offer their medical services at a quarter of german prices .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.05.2005 german wetland under threat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gently down the stream : the spree is popular with vacationers the spree forest , a remote wetland south of berlin , is a nature-lover 's paradise known for its many narrow waterways .
but researchers say the pristine region is in danger , blaming changes in climate and industry . the spree river runs through the immense spreewald biosphere reserve southeast of berlin .
it starts in the lusatia region , near poland , and is known for its traditional irrigation system consisting of 1,300 kilometers -lrb- 800 miles -rrb- of small channels and waterways .
alder forests and wetlands alternate with sandy pine forests , grasslands and fields in a landscape that seems to have been little affected by the forces of modernity .
the spree runs into the havel , which becomes a feeder for the elbe , eastern germany 's major waterway .
while much of western germany has been soaked with seemingly endless spring rains this year , folks in the elbe valley have seen less precipitation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pear tree in spreewald given that europe is facing climate change due to global warming , this trend is likely to continue in the coming decades , said bernd hansjürgens of the leipzig-halle environmental research institute .
over the past 50 years , median temperatures in europe have risen by as much as 1.5 degrees celsius -lrb- 34.7 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , he said .
" we in the elbe catchment area find ourselves in a relatively dry area within central europe , " he said .
" this lack of rain is becoming more and more noticeable , " he said .
culprit : brown coal to make matters worse , climate change is only part of the story .
the structural changes in what was once a brown coal region also play a large part .
bildunterschrift : spreewald scenery when the brown coal mines were working , between 1950 and 1990 , it took six tons of water to unearth every ton of brown coal .
that means that during that time , gallons upon gallons of water were taken from lusatia and pumped into the spree .
without this infusion , the water level in the spree 's aquifer would sink to somewhere between one-fifth and one-tenth of what it has been for the past 50 years .
" that has consequences for the spree forest , for this valuable biotope , and it has consequences also for berlin , " hansjürgens said .
" there is really now a danger that the water table will recede if less water is pumped in from the brown coal regions .
and that would lead to part of the spree forest disappearing over time . "
poor water quality the problem did not end with the closing of the mines .
now , the strip mines that are left need to be flooded with fresh river water .
otherwise , the groundwater that would gather there would be extremely sulfurous and contaminated with toxins .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic culture along the spree in order to prepare part of the spree forest to survive without receiving water from lusatia , environmental planners are trying to soften the blow .
there are a few options .
first , planners may decide to flood the strip mines for a longer period of time .
this would buy them time to deal with the changing situation - but it would postpone the development of tourism in the region .
another alternative would be to dry up of some of the spree 's small branch rivers , or fliesse , and use that water to flood the strip mines .
and a final possibility would be to bring water from the nearby oder river into the spree-havel area .
but the consequences such an action would have on all of the waterways must be researched in greater depth .
no one knows just yet what the best alternative is .
but one thing appears certain : a part of the spree forest is destined to disappear . dagmar röhrlich -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de emissions threaten european plants a new study on the effects of global warming shows more than half of european plant species are at risk , especially mediterranean and alpine plants .

czech president vaclav klaus opposes the eu constitution , and hardly a day goes by in which he does n't remind his countrymen and women of the fact . vaclav klaus , 63 , an economist , prides himself on his title of professor .
one may also refer to him as mr. president , since he has held the position for over two years .
but what he does n't like is being called a euroskeptic . " some people are constantly using labels : euro-optimists , euro-pessimists or euroskeptics , " klaus told deutsche welle . " please do not do this .
those of us who are concerned with the future of europe and what is happening on this continent , we reject being labeled as euroskeptics , because we are actually optimists .
we are making a maximum effort to ensure that things turn out well for this continent and for all of us . " the royal we ? vaclav klaus likes saying " we " instead of " i , " though who he means is not always entirely clear .
but what is clear is that he likes speaking for the czech people . after all , other european countries seem to repeatedly equate the views of the czech republic as a whole with the personal opinion of vaclav klaus , although polls show that 51 percent of czech people are in favor of the eu constitution . for his part , the conservative has never made a secret of his fundamental rejection of the eu constitution .
he opposes the political integration of europe and has a different view of europe , more like the european community of the 1960s and 70s . as far as klaus is concerned , the eu charter is undemocratic and part of a socialist , anti-liberal mechanism that reduces the sovereignty of individual states , particularly of smaller countries .
but all this , klaus insists , is merely his own opinion .
as president of the czech republic he is required to remain neutral . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech president 's office is located in prague castle , overlooking the city vaclav klaus 's critics call him vain and arrogant , and they also accuse him of overstepping the boundaries of his position as president .
the czech president is meant to be little more than a figurehead .
nevertheless , klaus has been trying to do everything in his power to influence the public and convince voters to oppose the eu constitution .
" i do n't like it , " said a 34-year-old woman from prague .
" i do n't think that the president will be able to influence us .
we all have our own view of the issue .

the president has always had strange things to say . " unlikely partners indeed , klaus is backed in his opposition to the eu charter by conservative civic democratic party -lrb- ods -rrb- , which he led for 11 years .
on the other side of the political spectrum , the country 's communists also reject the eu constitution . both parties are influential in the czech republic : the ods is the czech party with the highest approval rating - 30 percent - and the communists follow in second place .
though public cooperation between the two parties is unthinkable , both want the czechs to reject the eu constitution , whether in a national referendum or a " no " vote in parliament . " i predict a glowing future if the constitution does not get ratified , " klaus said .

czech president vaclav klaus opposes the eu constitution , and hardly a day goes by in which he does n't remind his countrymen and women of the fact . vaclav klaus , 63 , an economist , prides himself on his title of professor .
one may also refer to him as mr. president , since he has held the position for over two years .
but what he does n't like is being called a euroskeptic . " some people are constantly using labels : euro-optimists , euro-pessimists or euroskeptics , " klaus told deutsche welle . " please do not do this .
those of us who are concerned with the future of europe and what is happening on this continent , we reject being labeled as euroskeptics , because we are actually optimists .
we are making a maximum effort to ensure that things turn out well for this continent and for all of us . " the royal we ? vaclav klaus likes saying " we " instead of " i , " though who he means is not always entirely clear .
but what is clear is that he likes speaking for the czech people . after all , other european countries seem to repeatedly equate the views of the czech republic as a whole with the personal opinion of vaclav klaus , although polls show that 51 percent of czech people are in favor of the eu constitution . for his part , the conservative has never made a secret of his fundamental rejection of the eu constitution .
he opposes the political integration of europe and has a different view of europe , more like the european community of the 1960s and 70s . as far as klaus is concerned , the eu charter is undemocratic and part of a socialist , anti-liberal mechanism that reduces the sovereignty of individual states , particularly of smaller countries .
but all this , klaus insists , is merely his own opinion .
as president of the czech republic he is required to remain neutral . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech president 's office is located in prague castle , overlooking the city vaclav klaus 's critics call him vain and arrogant , and they also accuse him of overstepping the boundaries of his position as president .
the czech president is meant to be little more than a figurehead .
nevertheless , klaus has been trying to do everything in his power to influence the public and convince voters to oppose the eu constitution .
" i do n't like it , " said a 34-year-old woman from prague .
" i do n't think that the president will be able to influence us .
we all have our own view of the issue .
when he says that we will lose our sovereignty , it 's just a joke .
the president has always had strange things to say . " unlikely partners indeed , klaus is backed in his opposition to the eu charter by conservative civic democratic party -lrb- ods -rrb- , which he led for 11 years .
on the other side of the political spectrum , the country 's communists also reject the eu constitution . both parties are influential in the czech republic : the ods is the czech party with the highest approval rating - 30 percent - and the communists follow in second place .
though public cooperation between the two parties is unthinkable , both want the czechs to reject the eu constitution , whether in a national referendum or a " no " vote in parliament . " i predict a glowing future if the constitution does not get ratified , " klaus said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.05.2005 france votes on eu constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a divided france goes to the polls a divided france voted sunday on the european union 's first-ever constitution , with final opinion polls pointing towards a " no " that would send a shockwave across the continent . polling stations opened at 8:00 a.m. to the country 's 42 million eligible voters , and were to remain open nationwide until 8:00 pm , with residents of paris and lyon given an extra two hours to cast their ballots . after a hard-fought campaign that mesmerized and polarized the country , the last opinion polls released friday indicated that opponents of the landmark eu charter would prevail , with between 51 and 56 percent of the vote . but with about one in five french voters expected to make their decision at the last minute , " everything is possible , " as the le parisien newspaper wrote sunday in its front-page headline . rejection of the constitution , which aims to simplify decision-making in the expanded 25-member bloc , would likely spark a period of political uncertainty both in the eu and in france , one of the union 's six founding members . other eu countries fear that a french " non " also would unleash a domino effect across the continent , influencing voters in the netherlands , poland , denmark and britain to say " no " in future referendums . bildunterschrift : vote results were not to be released before 10:00 p.m. , so as not to prejudice last-minute voters .
due to the time difference , the 1.4 million voters in france 's overseas territories went to the polls on saturday . when president jacques chirac , whose ruling center-right union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- is leading the " yes " campaign , called for a referendum on the eu text last year , treaty supporters had a comfortable lead in the opinion polls .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.05.2005 german wetland under threat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gently down the stream : the spree is popular with vacationers the spree forest , a remote wetland south of berlin , is a nature-lover 's paradise known for its many narrow waterways .
but researchers say the pristine region is in danger , blaming changes in climate and industry . the spree river runs through the immense spreewald biosphere reserve southeast of berlin .
it starts in the lusatia region , near poland , and is known for its traditional irrigation system consisting of 1,300 kilometers -lrb- 800 miles -rrb- of small channels and waterways .
alder forests and wetlands alternate with sandy pine forests , grasslands and fields in a landscape that seems to have been little affected by the forces of modernity .
the spree runs into the havel , which becomes a feeder for the elbe , eastern germany 's major waterway .
while much of western germany has been soaked with seemingly endless spring rains this year , folks in the elbe valley have seen less precipitation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pear tree in spreewald given that europe is facing climate change due to global warming , this trend is likely to continue in the coming decades , said bernd hansjürgens of the leipzig-halle environmental research institute .
over the past 50 years , median temperatures in europe have risen by as much as 1.5 degrees celsius -lrb- 34.7 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , he said .
" we in the elbe catchment area find ourselves in a relatively dry area within central europe , " he said .
" this lack of rain is becoming more and more noticeable , " he said .
culprit : brown coal to make matters worse , climate change is only part of the story .
the structural changes in what was once a brown coal region also play a large part .
bildunterschrift : spreewald scenery when the brown coal mines were working , between 1950 and 1990 , it took six tons of water to unearth every ton of brown coal .
that means that during that time , gallons upon gallons of water were taken from lusatia and pumped into the spree .
without this infusion , the water level in the spree 's aquifer would sink to somewhere between one-fifth and one-tenth of what it has been for the past 50 years .
" that has consequences for the spree forest , for this valuable biotope , and it has consequences also for berlin , " hansjürgens said .
" there is really now a danger that the water table will recede if less water is pumped in from the brown coal regions .
and that would lead to part of the spree forest disappearing over time . "
poor water quality the problem did not end with the closing of the mines .
now , the strip mines that are left need to be flooded with fresh river water .
otherwise , the groundwater that would gather there would be extremely sulfurous and contaminated with toxins .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic culture along the spree in order to prepare part of the spree forest to survive without receiving water from lusatia , environmental planners are trying to soften the blow .
there are a few options .
first , planners may decide to flood the strip mines for a longer period of time .
this would buy them time to deal with the changing situation - but it would postpone the development of tourism in the region .
another alternative would be to dry up of some of the spree 's small branch rivers , or fliesse , and use that water to flood the strip mines .
and a final possibility would be to bring water from the nearby oder river into the spree-havel area .
but the consequences such an action would have on all of the waterways must be researched in greater depth .
no one knows just yet what the best alternative is .
but one thing appears certain : a part of the spree forest is destined to disappear . dagmar röhrlich -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de emissions threaten european plants a new study on the effects of global warming shows more than half of european plant species are at risk , especially mediterranean and alpine plants .

but researchers say the pristine region is in danger , blaming changes in climate and industry . the spree river runs through the immense spreewald biosphere reserve southeast of berlin .
it starts in the lusatia region , near poland , and is known for its traditional irrigation system consisting of 1,300 kilometers -lrb- 800 miles -rrb- of small channels and waterways .
alder forests and wetlands alternate with sandy pine forests , grasslands and fields in a landscape that seems to have been little affected by the forces of modernity .
the spree runs into the havel , which becomes a feeder for the elbe , eastern germany 's major waterway .

over the past 50 years , median temperatures in europe have risen by as much as 1.5 degrees celsius -lrb- 34.7 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , he said .

bildunterschrift : spreewald scenery when the brown coal mines were working , between 1950 and 1990 , it took six tons of water to unearth every ton of brown coal .
that means that during that time , gallons upon gallons of water were taken from lusatia and pumped into the spree .
without this infusion , the water level in the spree 's aquifer would sink to somewhere between one-fifth and one-tenth of what it has been for the past 50 years .
" that has consequences for the spree forest , for this valuable biotope , and it has consequences also for berlin , " hansjürgens said .
" there is really now a danger that the water table will recede if less water is pumped in from the brown coal regions .
and that would lead to part of the spree forest disappearing over time . "
poor water quality the problem did not end with the closing of the mines .
now , the strip mines that are left need to be flooded with fresh river water .

there are a few options .
first , planners may decide to flood the strip mines for a longer period of time .
this would buy them time to deal with the changing situation - but it would postpone the development of tourism in the region .
another alternative would be to dry up of some of the spree 's small branch rivers , or fliesse , and use that water to flood the strip mines .
and a final possibility would be to bring water from the nearby oder river into the spree-havel area .

dw-world spoke with him about next year 's world cup as well as about his team 's success and german soccer 's image abroad . dw : year one of the klinsmann era is almost behind us .
from nine games the national team has played with you at the helm , they 've only lost one , to south korea .
how would you take stock of the team 's performance thus far ? jürgen klinsmann : i think our record is a very , very positive one , above all , because we have grown together as a team , and not just as a new coaching staff .
we complement each other very well .
we 've brought people on board who have brought enormous talents with them .
for example , i 'm thinking of areas like overall fitness , and the fact that we have been able to bring over coaches for that from the us .
there 's also our sports psychologist , who we have integrated into the team ... … and the red jerseys ? … the jerseys , they look really good , but they are n't going to be scoring any goals for us .
i think that the way the team has performed in the last ten months , with style and pizzazz , and all the enthusiasm they 've shown in every game , it 's simply fantastic .
it is incredibly fun to work with this team .
there 's a lot of potential there , and that gives us the confidence to say during the world cup here at home : we want to play for the title ! before the world cup , the confederations cup is taking place , from june 15 - 29 .
eight teams are playing for the trophy , among them germany and top teams such as brazil and argentina .
who do you think will win ? naturally , i hope we do !
and logically , if one says one wants to win the world cup title here in germany , then for the confederations cup , which is often called a test , miniature world cup , we have the same goal . so for you , the confederations cup is a real test run ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann it is a test run for us .
every single game will give us more information about the team 's performance standard .
there is also a bit of ambition involved .
when a team participates in a contest like this , you not only measure yourself against very good teams from around the world , you also want to beat countries like argentina or brazil .
even if the season was a very long one for the players , that provides enough incentive for all of us to really get out there and give it our all . and if the plan does n't work out like you want with the world cup ?
do you feel under pressure ? yes , but that 's normal in soccer .
if you carry the responsibility and things do n't go well , you get into hot water .
that would surely be the case if we do n't perform well , but if i were to think along those lines , i would n't be the right man for this job .
i have taken on this position with a lot of optimism .
if it does n't go as planned , then the avalanche is going to come , like it or not .
but that would happen with anyone . if it came down to playing a beautiful game or winning , which would you choose ? both !
both are important .
of course , we want to play an attractive game of soccer .
i think we 've shown in the last ten months that we have laid a good foundation for that , that we have a team that can play up front , fast and aggressively .
it 's a style of playing that will bear fruit for us .
we have also pursued a new philosophy in which the players identify themselves with their role in the national team .
it 's important that a certain self-image is anchored in the minds of our players that when it comes to the national team , they give it all they 've got ! can germany itself benefit from this kind of positive attitude you 're describing ?
what would a world cup victory mean for germany ?
how important is a good performance by the german team ? i think the team demonstrated how that can help already this year in the european cup .
whether it was in the game here in berlin against brazil , where the fans showed incredible enthusiasm , or the game in iran in front of 120,000 spectators , where the team was able to bring the iranian population over to its side . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann kicking the ball around at the opening of the street soccer festival in berlin we want to build on this positive attitude and we want our players to be aware of the fact that in a way , they act as ambassadors for germany , since we will be observed very closely by the entire world during the upcoming world cup .
everything is going to be reported about , whether it 's about the national team , the cities , or the people who live in germany .
we want to put forward a fantastic image and show people that germany has developed in an incredibly positive way , naturally also after reunification . you yourself live abroad .
how would you describe the image of german soccer outside of this country ? i think that in general , there 's a great respect for german soccer abroad , something which of course has been stamped by our three world championship titles and three european championship titles .
people know that when it comes to tournaments , the german team is always able to concentrate on the essentials .
we know that our opponents have a lot of respect for us .
as far as our domestic teams go , the situation this year has n't been all that positive , since they fell out of the running for the european cup relatively early .
we lost a little bit of our standing there , but we can win that back very quickly . how much has been lost due to the referee scandal ? the referee affair has certainly cost us in the eyes of the world , since most people could n't imagine that such a thing could happen in germany .
we stand for other kinds of values , such as straightforwardness , honesty and a serious business mentality .
the scandal hurt us , no doubt about it , but on the other hand , people abroad have been very impressed with the way the german football federation handled the affair and how consistent they have been in their actions , such as finding those who are guilty and making them pay the consequences . the interview was conducted by guido baumhauer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de referee scandal rears its ugly head in april , german soccer officials quietly put the referee scandal involving robert hoyzer to rest .

there 's a lot of potential there , and that gives us the confidence to say during the world cup here at home : we want to play for the title ! before the world cup , the confederations cup is taking place , from june 15 - 29 .
eight teams are playing for the trophy , among them germany and top teams such as brazil and argentina .
who do you think will win ? naturally , i hope we do !
and logically , if one says one wants to win the world cup title here in germany , then for the confederations cup , which is often called a test , miniature world cup , we have the same goal . so for you , the confederations cup is a real test run ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann it is a test run for us .
every single game will give us more information about the team 's performance standard .
there is also a bit of ambition involved .
when a team participates in a contest like this , you not only measure yourself against very good teams from around the world , you also want to beat countries like argentina or brazil .
even if the season was a very long one for the players , that provides enough incentive for all of us to really get out there and give it our all . and if the plan does n't work out like you want with the world cup ?
do you feel under pressure ? yes , but that 's normal in soccer .
if you carry the responsibility and things do n't go well , you get into hot water .
that would surely be the case if we do n't perform well , but if i were to think along those lines , i would n't be the right man for this job .
i have taken on this position with a lot of optimism .
if it does n't go as planned , then the avalanche is going to come , like it or not .
but that would happen with anyone . if it came down to playing a beautiful game or winning , which would you choose ? both !
both are important .
of course , we want to play an attractive game of soccer .
i think we 've shown in the last ten months that we have laid a good foundation for that , that we have a team that can play up front , fast and aggressively .
it 's a style of playing that will bear fruit for us .
we have also pursued a new philosophy in which the players identify themselves with their role in the national team .
it 's important that a certain self-image is anchored in the minds of our players that when it comes to the national team , they give it all they 've got ! can germany itself benefit from this kind of positive attitude you 're describing ?
what would a world cup victory mean for germany ?
how important is a good performance by the german team ? i think the team demonstrated how that can help already this year in the european cup .
whether it was in the game here in berlin against brazil , where the fans showed incredible enthusiasm , or the game in iran in front of 120,000 spectators , where the team was able to bring the iranian population over to its side . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann kicking the ball around at the opening of the street soccer festival in berlin we want to build on this positive attitude and we want our players to be aware of the fact that in a way , they act as ambassadors for germany , since we will be observed very closely by the entire world during the upcoming world cup .
everything is going to be reported about , whether it 's about the national team , the cities , or the people who live in germany .
we want to put forward a fantastic image and show people that germany has developed in an incredibly positive way , naturally also after reunification . you yourself live abroad .
how would you describe the image of german soccer outside of this country ? i think that in general , there 's a great respect for german soccer abroad , something which of course has been stamped by our three world championship titles and three european championship titles .
people know that when it comes to tournaments , the german team is always able to concentrate on the essentials .
we know that our opponents have a lot of respect for us .
as far as our domestic teams go , the situation this year has n't been all that positive , since they fell out of the running for the european cup relatively early .

dw-world spoke with him about next year 's world cup as well as about his team 's success and german soccer 's image abroad . dw : year one of the klinsmann era is almost behind us .
from nine games the national team has played with you at the helm , they 've only lost one , to south korea .
how would you take stock of the team 's performance thus far ? jürgen klinsmann : i think our record is a very , very positive one , above all , because we have grown together as a team , and not just as a new coaching staff .
we complement each other very well .
we 've brought people on board who have brought enormous talents with them .
for example , i 'm thinking of areas like overall fitness , and the fact that we have been able to bring over coaches for that from the us .
there 's also our sports psychologist , who we have integrated into the team ... … and the red jerseys ? … the jerseys , they look really good , but they are n't going to be scoring any goals for us .
i think that the way the team has performed in the last ten months , with style and pizzazz , and all the enthusiasm they 've shown in every game , it 's simply fantastic .
it is incredibly fun to work with this team .

but researchers say the pristine region is in danger , blaming changes in climate and industry . the spree river runs through the immense spreewald biosphere reserve southeast of berlin .
it starts in the lusatia region , near poland , and is known for its traditional irrigation system consisting of 1,300 kilometers -lrb- 800 miles -rrb- of small channels and waterways .
alder forests and wetlands alternate with sandy pine forests , grasslands and fields in a landscape that seems to have been little affected by the forces of modernity .

that means that during that time , gallons upon gallons of water were taken from lusatia and pumped into the spree .
without this infusion , the water level in the spree 's aquifer would sink to somewhere between one-fifth and one-tenth of what it has been for the past 50 years .
" that has consequences for the spree forest , for this valuable biotope , and it has consequences also for berlin , " hansjürgens said .

this would buy them time to deal with the changing situation - but it would postpone the development of tourism in the region .
another alternative would be to dry up of some of the spree 's small branch rivers , or fliesse , and use that water to flood the strip mines .
and a final possibility would be to bring water from the nearby oder river into the spree-havel area .

czech president vaclav klaus opposes the eu constitution , and hardly a day goes by in which he does n't remind his countrymen and women of the fact . vaclav klaus , 63 , an economist , prides himself on his title of professor .
one may also refer to him as mr. president , since he has held the position for over two years .
but what he does n't like is being called a euroskeptic . " some people are constantly using labels : euro-optimists , euro-pessimists or euroskeptics , " klaus told deutsche welle . " please do not do this .
those of us who are concerned with the future of europe and what is happening on this continent , we reject being labeled as euroskeptics , because we are actually optimists .
we are making a maximum effort to ensure that things turn out well for this continent and for all of us . " the royal we ? vaclav klaus likes saying " we " instead of " i , " though who he means is not always entirely clear .
but what is clear is that he likes speaking for the czech people . after all , other european countries seem to repeatedly equate the views of the czech republic as a whole with the personal opinion of vaclav klaus , although polls show that 51 percent of czech people are in favor of the eu constitution . for his part , the conservative has never made a secret of his fundamental rejection of the eu constitution .
he opposes the political integration of europe and has a different view of europe , more like the european community of the 1960s and 70s . as far as klaus is concerned , the eu charter is undemocratic and part of a socialist , anti-liberal mechanism that reduces the sovereignty of individual states , particularly of smaller countries .
but all this , klaus insists , is merely his own opinion .
as president of the czech republic he is required to remain neutral . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech president 's office is located in prague castle , overlooking the city vaclav klaus 's critics call him vain and arrogant , and they also accuse him of overstepping the boundaries of his position as president .
the czech president is meant to be little more than a figurehead .
nevertheless , klaus has been trying to do everything in his power to influence the public and convince voters to oppose the eu constitution .
" i do n't like it , " said a 34-year-old woman from prague .
" i do n't think that the president will be able to influence us .
we all have our own view of the issue .
when he says that we will lose our sovereignty , it 's just a joke .
the president has always had strange things to say . " unlikely partners indeed , klaus is backed in his opposition to the eu charter by conservative civic democratic party -lrb- ods -rrb- , which he led for 11 years .
on the other side of the political spectrum , the country 's communists also reject the eu constitution . both parties are influential in the czech republic : the ods is the czech party with the highest approval rating - 30 percent - and the communists follow in second place .
though public cooperation between the two parties is unthinkable , both want the czechs to reject the eu constitution , whether in a national referendum or a " no " vote in parliament . " i predict a glowing future if the constitution does not get ratified , " klaus said .
" i think that such documents are the last thing that the eu and its people need in order to lead happy and successful lives .

he opposes the political integration of europe and has a different view of europe , more like the european community of the 1960s and 70s . as far as klaus is concerned , the eu charter is undemocratic and part of a socialist , anti-liberal mechanism that reduces the sovereignty of individual states , particularly of smaller countries .

but researchers say the pristine region is in danger , blaming changes in climate and industry . the spree river runs through the immense spreewald biosphere reserve southeast of berlin .
it starts in the lusatia region , near poland , and is known for its traditional irrigation system consisting of 1,300 kilometers -lrb- 800 miles -rrb- of small channels and waterways .
alder forests and wetlands alternate with sandy pine forests , grasslands and fields in a landscape that seems to have been little affected by the forces of modernity .
the spree runs into the havel , which becomes a feeder for the elbe , eastern germany 's major waterway .
while much of western germany has been soaked with seemingly endless spring rains this year , folks in the elbe valley have seen less precipitation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pear tree in spreewald given that europe is facing climate change due to global warming , this trend is likely to continue in the coming decades , said bernd hansjürgens of the leipzig-halle environmental research institute .
over the past 50 years , median temperatures in europe have risen by as much as 1.5 degrees celsius -lrb- 34.7 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , he said .
" we in the elbe catchment area find ourselves in a relatively dry area within central europe , " he said .
" this lack of rain is becoming more and more noticeable , " he said .

the structural changes in what was once a brown coal region also play a large part .
bildunterschrift : spreewald scenery when the brown coal mines were working , between 1950 and 1990 , it took six tons of water to unearth every ton of brown coal .
that means that during that time , gallons upon gallons of water were taken from lusatia and pumped into the spree .
without this infusion , the water level in the spree 's aquifer would sink to somewhere between one-fifth and one-tenth of what it has been for the past 50 years .
" that has consequences for the spree forest , for this valuable biotope , and it has consequences also for berlin , " hansjürgens said .
" there is really now a danger that the water table will recede if less water is pumped in from the brown coal regions .
and that would lead to part of the spree forest disappearing over time . "
poor water quality the problem did not end with the closing of the mines .
now , the strip mines that are left need to be flooded with fresh river water .
otherwise , the groundwater that would gather there would be extremely sulfurous and contaminated with toxins .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic culture along the spree in order to prepare part of the spree forest to survive without receiving water from lusatia , environmental planners are trying to soften the blow .
there are a few options .
first , planners may decide to flood the strip mines for a longer period of time .
this would buy them time to deal with the changing situation - but it would postpone the development of tourism in the region .
another alternative would be to dry up of some of the spree 's small branch rivers , or fliesse , and use that water to flood the strip mines .
and a final possibility would be to bring water from the nearby oder river into the spree-havel area .
but the consequences such an action would have on all of the waterways must be researched in greater depth .
no one knows just yet what the best alternative is .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.05.2005 czech president wants old eu back großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foresees a glowing future without the eu constitution anyone looking for euroskeptics in the czech republic need n't look far .
czech president vaclav klaus opposes the eu constitution , and hardly a day goes by in which he does n't remind his countrymen and women of the fact . vaclav klaus , 63 , an economist , prides himself on his title of professor .
one may also refer to him as mr. president , since he has held the position for over two years .
but what he does n't like is being called a euroskeptic . " some people are constantly using labels : euro-optimists , euro-pessimists or euroskeptics , " klaus told deutsche welle . " please do not do this .
those of us who are concerned with the future of europe and what is happening on this continent , we reject being labeled as euroskeptics , because we are actually optimists .
we are making a maximum effort to ensure that things turn out well for this continent and for all of us . " the royal we ? vaclav klaus likes saying " we " instead of " i , " though who he means is not always entirely clear .
but what is clear is that he likes speaking for the czech people . after all , other european countries seem to repeatedly equate the views of the czech republic as a whole with the personal opinion of vaclav klaus , although polls show that 51 percent of czech people are in favor of the eu constitution . for his part , the conservative has never made a secret of his fundamental rejection of the eu constitution .
he opposes the political integration of europe and has a different view of europe , more like the european community of the 1960s and 70s . as far as klaus is concerned , the eu charter is undemocratic and part of a socialist , anti-liberal mechanism that reduces the sovereignty of individual states , particularly of smaller countries .
but all this , klaus insists , is merely his own opinion .
as president of the czech republic he is required to remain neutral . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech president 's office is located in prague castle , overlooking the city vaclav klaus 's critics call him vain and arrogant , and they also accuse him of overstepping the boundaries of his position as president .
the czech president is meant to be little more than a figurehead .
nevertheless , klaus has been trying to do everything in his power to influence the public and convince voters to oppose the eu constitution .
" i do n't like it , " said a 34-year-old woman from prague .
" i do n't think that the president will be able to influence us .
we all have our own view of the issue .
when he says that we will lose our sovereignty , it 's just a joke .
the president has always had strange things to say . " unlikely partners indeed , klaus is backed in his opposition to the eu charter by conservative civic democratic party -lrb- ods -rrb- , which he led for 11 years .
on the other side of the political spectrum , the country 's communists also reject the eu constitution . both parties are influential in the czech republic : the ods is the czech party with the highest approval rating - 30 percent - and the communists follow in second place .
though public cooperation between the two parties is unthinkable , both want the czechs to reject the eu constitution , whether in a national referendum or a " no " vote in parliament . " i predict a glowing future if the constitution does not get ratified , " klaus said .
" i think that such documents are the last thing that the eu and its people need in order to lead happy and successful lives .

in her work , it is not unusual for her to encounter her compatriots - 500,000 to 600,000 german tourists visit the country annually and some of them have accidents or fall ill . but petra reichelt says a growing new clientele is beginning to combine health-care needs with holiday pleasures . " thailand is a beautiful destination and it has excellent health care services and the prices are - compared to germany - very , very affordable , " she said .
" so why not take a vacation for the same money , have your teeth done , have a laser done or whatever you need .
and just take your whole family , make a vacation of that and it wo n't cost you more than in germany . " a hub for medical care initially , the international hospital in thailand 's capital was built with the purpose of creating a comfortable ambience for customers from different cultures .
but these days , with a network of 12 network hospitals and more than 5,000 in-patient beds throughout thailand , bangkok hospital now sees itself as " the world 's premier medical hub " for foreign tourists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aftermath of a disaster attracting patients to paradise is the name of the game these days .
and due to germany 's current reform of the state health-system , germans are increasingly confronted with high costs for medical treatment at home .
the great uncertainty about further cuts has led to an unprecedented boom in health tourism as patients seek deals on the internet . and they are there to be had .
cosmetic breast enlargement in germany costs an average of 5,000 euros .
bangkok offers the same operation for 4,535 euros - but that 's including a return flight and one week worth of hotel accommodation in a luxury 5-star hotel . " i got dental implants in bangkok last summer , " said one satisfied customer .
" i had a face lift in cape town in the winter .

already , 20 percent of all cosmetic surgery is booked along with a stylish holiday .
and south east asia is well positioned in the expanding market .
from robotic cardiac surgery to cancer care , from gastro-intestinal surgery or hiv treatment , hospitals in india , korea , singapore and thailand often offer their medical services at a quarter of german prices .
and so far , no complaints have been registered in germany , according to petra reichelt . " do n't fear , the hospitals are great , " she said .
" the service is better .
the facilities are great , the technology is highly advanced . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as good as in the us or germany , hospital officials say indeed , medical care , technology and hygiene largely are on a level with us hospitals .
while ordinary patients share double or triple rooms in german hospitals , south east asian private institutions offer only luxury single rooms .
in many parts of south east asia , medicine provides good financial opportunities .
investments in modern technology and luxury institutions are paying off , said bangkok hospital 's marketing manager ralf krewer .
almost all of the 500 doctors working at south east asia 's largest private hospital group are thai . " in the past , the majority of thai doctors went to the us , germany , australia or japan to practice and further their academic education , " he said .
" but the heavy investment on the thai side led to many of those top doctors coming back . " thai doctors tough competition thai doctors are tough competition for their german colleagues who are beginning to feel the pinch .
german doctors and dentists are highly sceptical about growing overseas health tourism .
they question the monitoring of medical standards .
they ask whether sophisticated treatments actually delivered , whether quality materials are used in complicated dental surgery and so on . also , doctors overseas are not able to deal with long-term patient preparation before operations and prophylactic care , specialists argue .
botched surgery is hard to rectify .
and who will be responsible for the often sensitive rehabilitation process , they wonder . the mutual trust between a patient and a doctor plays a vital role in the recovery process , german doctors say .
health tourism , they argue , can not provide that atmosphere of trust . petra reichelt dismisses such criticism and says that her hospital has a consistent focus on the quality of service provided and patient satisfaction .

" i had a face lift in cape town in the winter .
and i saved a lot of money .
it was fun and i feel fine and i had a holiday . " beaches and medical treatment health- and wellness-travel is the booming sector in tourism .
already , 20 percent of all cosmetic surgery is booked along with a stylish holiday .
and south east asia is well positioned in the expanding market .
from robotic cardiac surgery to cancer care , from gastro-intestinal surgery or hiv treatment , hospitals in india , korea , singapore and thailand often offer their medical services at a quarter of german prices .
and so far , no complaints have been registered in germany , according to petra reichelt . " do n't fear , the hospitals are great , " she said .
" the service is better .
the facilities are great , the technology is highly advanced . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as good as in the us or germany , hospital officials say indeed , medical care , technology and hygiene largely are on a level with us hospitals .
while ordinary patients share double or triple rooms in german hospitals , south east asian private institutions offer only luxury single rooms .
in many parts of south east asia , medicine provides good financial opportunities .
investments in modern technology and luxury institutions are paying off , said bangkok hospital 's marketing manager ralf krewer .
almost all of the 500 doctors working at south east asia 's largest private hospital group are thai . " in the past , the majority of thai doctors went to the us , germany , australia or japan to practice and further their academic education , " he said .
" but the heavy investment on the thai side led to many of those top doctors coming back . " thai doctors tough competition thai doctors are tough competition for their german colleagues who are beginning to feel the pinch .
german doctors and dentists are highly sceptical about growing overseas health tourism .
they question the monitoring of medical standards .
they ask whether sophisticated treatments actually delivered , whether quality materials are used in complicated dental surgery and so on . also , doctors overseas are not able to deal with long-term patient preparation before operations and prophylactic care , specialists argue .
botched surgery is hard to rectify .
and who will be responsible for the often sensitive rehabilitation process , they wonder . the mutual trust between a patient and a doctor plays a vital role in the recovery process , german doctors say .
health tourism , they argue , can not provide that atmosphere of trust . petra reichelt dismisses such criticism and says that her hospital has a consistent focus on the quality of service provided and patient satisfaction . " i think a lot of people were very surprised to learn how advanced and how great a standard we offer , " she said . peter zimmermann -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tourism after the flood thailand , sri lanka and the maldives are among the most popular holiday destinations for germans .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.05.2005 france votes on eu constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a divided france goes to the polls a divided france voted sunday on the european union 's first-ever constitution , with final opinion polls pointing towards a " no " that would send a shockwave across the continent . polling stations opened at 8:00 a.m. to the country 's 42 million eligible voters , and were to remain open nationwide until 8:00 pm , with residents of paris and lyon given an extra two hours to cast their ballots . after a hard-fought campaign that mesmerized and polarized the country , the last opinion polls released friday indicated that opponents of the landmark eu charter would prevail , with between 51 and 56 percent of the vote . but with about one in five french voters expected to make their decision at the last minute , " everything is possible , " as the le parisien newspaper wrote sunday in its front-page headline . rejection of the constitution , which aims to simplify decision-making in the expanded 25-member bloc , would likely spark a period of political uncertainty both in the eu and in france , one of the union 's six founding members . other eu countries fear that a french " non " also would unleash a domino effect across the continent , influencing voters in the netherlands , poland , denmark and britain to say " no " in future referendums . bildunterschrift : vote results were not to be released before 10:00 p.m. , so as not to prejudice last-minute voters .
due to the time difference , the 1.4 million voters in france 's overseas territories went to the polls on saturday . when president jacques chirac , whose ruling center-right union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- is leading the " yes " campaign , called for a referendum on the eu text last year , treaty supporters had a comfortable lead in the opinion polls . " no " camp has an edge now , the " no " camp - capitalizing on the increasing unpopularity of the government - seems to have the edge , and the 72-year-old french leader is counting on the country 's undecided voters to turn the tables . chirac 's ump is campaigning alongside its junior partner in government , the union for french democracy -lrb- udf -rrb- , as well as the opposition socialist party -lrb- ps -rrb- and the greens - a coalition of france 's mainstream political elite . they are facing a disparate " no " camp made up of the far-right national front of jean-marie le pen , the communist and trotskyist parties , nationalist euroskeptics and the former socialist prime minister laurent fabius . pollsters say that pro-european socialist party supporters - tempted to follow fabius and vote " no " but fearful of the consequences - will be the key , along with voter turnout . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac before addressing a french television program on sunday 's referendum on the eu constitution at the elysee palace in paris , thursday may 26 , 2005 .
a come-from-behind victory for the " yes " camp would bolster chirac , allow eu officials in brussels to breathe a sign of relief and keep the eu treaty on track ahead of a consultative referendum in the netherlands on wednesday . a string of european leaders travelled to france to make the case for the constitution including german chancellor gerhard schroeder and spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero , insisting there is no " plan b " . the french president , who has staked his prestige on approval of the treaty , has warned voters that a french " no " would diminish the country 's influence in europe , indeed making it the " black sheep " of the continent . what rejection would mean rejection of the treaty would have a profound political impact in france , tarnishing chirac 's record in the history books , prompting a government reshuffle and deepening the rift in the socialist party . no matter what the outcome on sunday , chirac is expected to dismiss his unpopular prime minister jean-pierre raffarin , with interior minister dominique de villepin and defense minister michele alliot-marie his possible successors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy should france reject the treaty , chirac - who celebrated his 10th year as president earlier this month - would be unlikely to seek a third term in office in 2007 , opening the door to his arch-rival , ump leader nicolas sarkozy -lrb- photo -rrb- . chirac has however ruled out his resignation should the " no " camp prevail . the constitution must be ratified by all 25 member states .
so far , nine eu countries have approved the treaty - austria , germany , greece , hungary , italy , lithuania , slovakia , slovenia and spain . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chirac 's final ' yes ' pitch for eu constitution president jacques chirac has made a last televised plea to the french people urging them to vote in favor of the european constitution on sunday .

dw-world spoke with him about next year 's world cup as well as about his team 's success and german soccer 's image abroad . dw : year one of the klinsmann era is almost behind us .
from nine games the national team has played with you at the helm , they 've only lost one , to south korea .
how would you take stock of the team 's performance thus far ? jürgen klinsmann : i think our record is a very , very positive one , above all , because we have grown together as a team , and not just as a new coaching staff .
we complement each other very well .
we 've brought people on board who have brought enormous talents with them .
for example , i 'm thinking of areas like overall fitness , and the fact that we have been able to bring over coaches for that from the us .
there 's also our sports psychologist , who we have integrated into the team ... … and the red jerseys ? … the jerseys , they look really good , but they are n't going to be scoring any goals for us .
i think that the way the team has performed in the last ten months , with style and pizzazz , and all the enthusiasm they 've shown in every game , it 's simply fantastic .
it is incredibly fun to work with this team .
there 's a lot of potential there , and that gives us the confidence to say during the world cup here at home : we want to play for the title ! before the world cup , the confederations cup is taking place , from june 15 - 29 .
eight teams are playing for the trophy , among them germany and top teams such as brazil and argentina .
who do you think will win ? naturally , i hope we do !
and logically , if one says one wants to win the world cup title here in germany , then for the confederations cup , which is often called a test , miniature world cup , we have the same goal . so for you , the confederations cup is a real test run ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann it is a test run for us .
every single game will give us more information about the team 's performance standard .
there is also a bit of ambition involved .
when a team participates in a contest like this , you not only measure yourself against very good teams from around the world , you also want to beat countries like argentina or brazil .
even if the season was a very long one for the players , that provides enough incentive for all of us to really get out there and give it our all . and if the plan does n't work out like you want with the world cup ?
do you feel under pressure ? yes , but that 's normal in soccer .
if you carry the responsibility and things do n't go well , you get into hot water .
that would surely be the case if we do n't perform well , but if i were to think along those lines , i would n't be the right man for this job .
i have taken on this position with a lot of optimism .
if it does n't go as planned , then the avalanche is going to come , like it or not .
but that would happen with anyone . if it came down to playing a beautiful game or winning , which would you choose ? both !
both are important .
of course , we want to play an attractive game of soccer .
i think we 've shown in the last ten months that we have laid a good foundation for that , that we have a team that can play up front , fast and aggressively .
it 's a style of playing that will bear fruit for us .
we have also pursued a new philosophy in which the players identify themselves with their role in the national team .
it 's important that a certain self-image is anchored in the minds of our players that when it comes to the national team , they give it all they 've got ! can germany itself benefit from this kind of positive attitude you 're describing ?
what would a world cup victory mean for germany ?
how important is a good performance by the german team ? i think the team demonstrated how that can help already this year in the european cup .
whether it was in the game here in berlin against brazil , where the fans showed incredible enthusiasm , or the game in iran in front of 120,000 spectators , where the team was able to bring the iranian population over to its side . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann kicking the ball around at the opening of the street soccer festival in berlin we want to build on this positive attitude and we want our players to be aware of the fact that in a way , they act as ambassadors for germany , since we will be observed very closely by the entire world during the upcoming world cup .
everything is going to be reported about , whether it 's about the national team , the cities , or the people who live in germany .
we want to put forward a fantastic image and show people that germany has developed in an incredibly positive way , naturally also after reunification . you yourself live abroad .
how would you describe the image of german soccer outside of this country ? i think that in general , there 's a great respect for german soccer abroad , something which of course has been stamped by our three world championship titles and three european championship titles .
people know that when it comes to tournaments , the german team is always able to concentrate on the essentials .
we know that our opponents have a lot of respect for us .
as far as our domestic teams go , the situation this year has n't been all that positive , since they fell out of the running for the european cup relatively early .
we lost a little bit of our standing there , but we can win that back very quickly . how much has been lost due to the referee scandal ? the referee affair has certainly cost us in the eyes of the world , since most people could n't imagine that such a thing could happen in germany .
we stand for other kinds of values , such as straightforwardness , honesty and a serious business mentality .
the scandal hurt us , no doubt about it , but on the other hand , people abroad have been very impressed with the way the german football federation handled the affair and how consistent they have been in their actions , such as finding those who are guilty and making them pay the consequences . the interview was conducted by guido baumhauer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de referee scandal rears its ugly head in april , german soccer officials quietly put the referee scandal involving robert hoyzer to rest .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.05.2005 france votes on eu constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a divided france goes to the polls a divided france voted sunday on the european union 's first-ever constitution , with final opinion polls pointing towards a " no " that would send a shockwave across the continent . polling stations opened at 8:00 a.m. to the country 's 42 million eligible voters , and were to remain open nationwide until 8:00 pm , with residents of paris and lyon given an extra two hours to cast their ballots . after a hard-fought campaign that mesmerized and polarized the country , the last opinion polls released friday indicated that opponents of the landmark eu charter would prevail , with between 51 and 56 percent of the vote . but with about one in five french voters expected to make their decision at the last minute , " everything is possible , " as the le parisien newspaper wrote sunday in its front-page headline . rejection of the constitution , which aims to simplify decision-making in the expanded 25-member bloc , would likely spark a period of political uncertainty both in the eu and in france , one of the union 's six founding members . other eu countries fear that a french " non " also would unleash a domino effect across the continent , influencing voters in the netherlands , poland , denmark and britain to say " no " in future referendums . bildunterschrift : vote results were not to be released before 10:00 p.m. , so as not to prejudice last-minute voters .
due to the time difference , the 1.4 million voters in france 's overseas territories went to the polls on saturday . when president jacques chirac , whose ruling center-right union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- is leading the " yes " campaign , called for a referendum on the eu text last year , treaty supporters had a comfortable lead in the opinion polls . " no " camp has an edge now , the " no " camp - capitalizing on the increasing unpopularity of the government - seems to have the edge , and the 72-year-old french leader is counting on the country 's undecided voters to turn the tables . chirac 's ump is campaigning alongside its junior partner in government , the union for french democracy -lrb- udf -rrb- , as well as the opposition socialist party -lrb- ps -rrb- and the greens - a coalition of france 's mainstream political elite . they are facing a disparate " no " camp made up of the far-right national front of jean-marie le pen , the communist and trotskyist parties , nationalist euroskeptics and the former socialist prime minister laurent fabius . pollsters say that pro-european socialist party supporters - tempted to follow fabius and vote " no " but fearful of the consequences - will be the key , along with voter turnout . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac before addressing a french television program on sunday 's referendum on the eu constitution at the elysee palace in paris , thursday may 26 , 2005 .
a come-from-behind victory for the " yes " camp would bolster chirac , allow eu officials in brussels to breathe a sign of relief and keep the eu treaty on track ahead of a consultative referendum in the netherlands on wednesday . a string of european leaders travelled to france to make the case for the constitution including german chancellor gerhard schroeder and spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero , insisting there is no " plan b " . the french president , who has staked his prestige on approval of the treaty , has warned voters that a french " no " would diminish the country 's influence in europe , indeed making it the " black sheep " of the continent . what rejection would mean rejection of the treaty would have a profound political impact in france , tarnishing chirac 's record in the history books , prompting a government reshuffle and deepening the rift in the socialist party . no matter what the outcome on sunday , chirac is expected to dismiss his unpopular prime minister jean-pierre raffarin , with interior minister dominique de villepin and defense minister michele alliot-marie his possible successors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy should france reject the treaty , chirac - who celebrated his 10th year as president earlier this month - would be unlikely to seek a third term in office in 2007 , opening the door to his arch-rival , ump leader nicolas sarkozy -lrb- photo -rrb- . chirac has however ruled out his resignation should the " no " camp prevail . the constitution must be ratified by all 25 member states .

dw-world spoke with him about next year 's world cup as well as about his team 's success and german soccer 's image abroad . dw : year one of the klinsmann era is almost behind us .
from nine games the national team has played with you at the helm , they 've only lost one , to south korea .
how would you take stock of the team 's performance thus far ? jürgen klinsmann : i think our record is a very , very positive one , above all , because we have grown together as a team , and not just as a new coaching staff .
we complement each other very well .
we 've brought people on board who have brought enormous talents with them .
for example , i 'm thinking of areas like overall fitness , and the fact that we have been able to bring over coaches for that from the us .
there 's also our sports psychologist , who we have integrated into the team ... … and the red jerseys ? … the jerseys , they look really good , but they are n't going to be scoring any goals for us .
i think that the way the team has performed in the last ten months , with style and pizzazz , and all the enthusiasm they 've shown in every game , it 's simply fantastic .
it is incredibly fun to work with this team .
there 's a lot of potential there , and that gives us the confidence to say during the world cup here at home : we want to play for the title ! before the world cup , the confederations cup is taking place , from june 15 - 29 .
eight teams are playing for the trophy , among them germany and top teams such as brazil and argentina .
who do you think will win ? naturally , i hope we do !
and logically , if one says one wants to win the world cup title here in germany , then for the confederations cup , which is often called a test , miniature world cup , we have the same goal . so for you , the confederations cup is a real test run ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann it is a test run for us .
every single game will give us more information about the team 's performance standard .
there is also a bit of ambition involved .
when a team participates in a contest like this , you not only measure yourself against very good teams from around the world , you also want to beat countries like argentina or brazil .
even if the season was a very long one for the players , that provides enough incentive for all of us to really get out there and give it our all . and if the plan does n't work out like you want with the world cup ?
do you feel under pressure ? yes , but that 's normal in soccer .
if you carry the responsibility and things do n't go well , you get into hot water .
that would surely be the case if we do n't perform well , but if i were to think along those lines , i would n't be the right man for this job .
i have taken on this position with a lot of optimism .
if it does n't go as planned , then the avalanche is going to come , like it or not .
but that would happen with anyone . if it came down to playing a beautiful game or winning , which would you choose ? both !
both are important .
of course , we want to play an attractive game of soccer .
i think we 've shown in the last ten months that we have laid a good foundation for that , that we have a team that can play up front , fast and aggressively .
it 's a style of playing that will bear fruit for us .
we have also pursued a new philosophy in which the players identify themselves with their role in the national team .
it 's important that a certain self-image is anchored in the minds of our players that when it comes to the national team , they give it all they 've got ! can germany itself benefit from this kind of positive attitude you 're describing ?
what would a world cup victory mean for germany ?
how important is a good performance by the german team ? i think the team demonstrated how that can help already this year in the european cup .
whether it was in the game here in berlin against brazil , where the fans showed incredible enthusiasm , or the game in iran in front of 120,000 spectators , where the team was able to bring the iranian population over to its side . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann kicking the ball around at the opening of the street soccer festival in berlin we want to build on this positive attitude and we want our players to be aware of the fact that in a way , they act as ambassadors for germany , since we will be observed very closely by the entire world during the upcoming world cup .
everything is going to be reported about , whether it 's about the national team , the cities , or the people who live in germany .
we want to put forward a fantastic image and show people that germany has developed in an incredibly positive way , naturally also after reunification . you yourself live abroad .

people know that when it comes to tournaments , the german team is always able to concentrate on the essentials .
we know that our opponents have a lot of respect for us .
as far as our domestic teams go , the situation this year has n't been all that positive , since they fell out of the running for the european cup relatively early .

we stand for other kinds of values , such as straightforwardness , honesty and a serious business mentality .
the scandal hurt us , no doubt about it , but on the other hand , people abroad have been very impressed with the way the german football federation handled the affair and how consistent they have been in their actions , such as finding those who are guilty and making them pay the consequences . the interview was conducted by guido baumhauer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de referee scandal rears its ugly head in april , german soccer officials quietly put the referee scandal involving robert hoyzer to rest .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.05.2005 france votes down eu constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the answer is " no " after a large voter turnout , france has overwhelmingly said " non " to the proposed eu constitution .
projections released immediately after polls closed show between 54.5 and 55.6 percent voted against the document . it was not much of a surprise , since surveys for several weeks have shown the " no " camp to be in the lead .
despite an urgent , last-minute appeal from president jacques chirac , a majority of french voters were not convinced that the proposed constitution , which was designed to simplify decision making after the eu 's enlargement last year , was in their best interests . the sharp defeat for the charter , which has been dreaded by eu leaders , could weaken france , one of the central pillars of the european union .
supporters have said a defeat could stall european integration and unsettle some financial markets . " the decision of france inevitably creates a difficult context for defending our interests in europe , " chirac said in an address broadcast on national television . bildunterschrift : but cheers went up from supporters of the " no " campaign when the exit polls results were announced just after voting ended at 2200 central european time .
those who rejected the treaty included communists , various left-wing groups , dissident socialists and far-right parties . with the french rejection , the eu constitution in its current form has been dealt a potentially fatal blow and the future path of the european bloc is unclear .
the charter needed the ratification of all 25 eu states to go into effect .

those who rejected the treaty included communists , various left-wing groups , dissident socialists and far-right parties . with the french rejection , the eu constitution in its current form has been dealt a potentially fatal blow and the future path of the european bloc is unclear .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.05.2005 france votes down eu constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the answer is " no " after a large voter turnout , france has overwhelmingly said " non " to the proposed eu constitution .
projections released immediately after polls closed show between 54.5 and 55.6 percent voted against the document . it was not much of a surprise , since surveys for several weeks have shown the " no " camp to be in the lead .
despite an urgent , last-minute appeal from president jacques chirac , a majority of french voters were not convinced that the proposed constitution , which was designed to simplify decision making after the eu 's enlargement last year , was in their best interests . the sharp defeat for the charter , which has been dreaded by eu leaders , could weaken france , one of the central pillars of the european union .
supporters have said a defeat could stall european integration and unsettle some financial markets . " the decision of france inevitably creates a difficult context for defending our interests in europe , " chirac said in an address broadcast on national television . bildunterschrift : but cheers went up from supporters of the " no " campaign when the exit polls results were announced just after voting ended at 2200 central european time .
those who rejected the treaty included communists , various left-wing groups , dissident socialists and far-right parties . with the french rejection , the eu constitution in its current form has been dealt a potentially fatal blow and the future path of the european bloc is unclear .
the charter needed the ratification of all 25 eu states to go into effect .
france was the tenth country to decide about the document .
previously , nine eu member states had given their approval . the question now is whether the ratification process will continue in the remaining eu states that have not yet voted .
french foreign minister michel barnier said the vote was a " real disappointment , " but added that other eu countries should go ahead with their own votes regardless . setback for president the results are a blow to french president jacques chirac , who had campaigned hard for the charter 's passage , including broadcasting a last-minute appeal on french television just days before sunday 's vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vote was seen by many to be as much about the popularity of chirac and his government as about the future course of the eu .
the bitter debate divided france and became a debate on france 's overall malaise and fears that low-wage new member countries in eastern europe could be dangerous to france 's economic health . french far-right leader jean-marie le pen and eurosceptic philippe de villiers urged chirac to step down on sunday .
previously , chirac had said he would not quit after the vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac leaves the polling station after casting his vote in sarran , southwestern france sunday may 29 , 2005 in a referendum on the eu constitution .
however , after the results came in , chirac said he would make a decision on the future of his center-right government " in the coming days " after french voters overwhelmingly rejected the eu constitution .
it 's largely expected he will dismiss unpopular prime minister jean-pierre raffarin . not dead yet the head of the european socialist party poul nyrup rasmussen lamented sunday france 's rejection of the eu constitution , saying it was a " sad day " for europe but insisting that the charter was not dead . " this is a sad , sad day for france and a sad day for europe too , " he said in a statement after exit polls indicated that some 55 percent of french voters rejected the constitution . " but rumors of the constitution 's demise have been greatly exaggerated , " he added .
" we must not read the ' non ' in france as a ' non ' to europe .
this is not the last word on the european constitution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and he added : " the french people wished to reject a tired and unpopular government that has failed to represent the concerns of ordinary people in france . " the dutch are scheduled to vote on the charter on wednesday .
dutch ministers urged their citizens to ignore the result in france . what now ? if the constitution does not survive , the eu will continue to operate under its current rules , which were laid out in the treaty of nice .
but the system is seen as largely unworkable with a union of 25 countries , since voting could soon become paralyzed . opponents want the eu to redraft a proposed constitution and improve it , putting in safeguards against labor from new member states dragging on wages and adding protections for europe 's social market economy . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dossier : france and the eu 's future dw-world looks back at france and its fraught relationship with the proposed eu constitution .
france votes on eu constitution a divided france voted sunday on the european union 's first-ever constitution , with final opinion polls pointing towards a " no " that would send a shockwave across the continent .
-lrb- may 29 , 2005 -rrb- franco-german ties after a french " non " if french voters do indeed reject the draft eu constitution in sunday 's referendum , the european union will likely be catapulted into a crisis and franco-german relations may suffer serious damage .

czech president vaclav klaus opposes the eu constitution , and hardly a day goes by in which he does n't remind his countrymen and women of the fact . vaclav klaus , 63 , an economist , prides himself on his title of professor .
one may also refer to him as mr. president , since he has held the position for over two years .
but what he does n't like is being called a euroskeptic . " some people are constantly using labels : euro-optimists , euro-pessimists or euroskeptics , " klaus told deutsche welle . " please do not do this .
those of us who are concerned with the future of europe and what is happening on this continent , we reject being labeled as euroskeptics , because we are actually optimists .
we are making a maximum effort to ensure that things turn out well for this continent and for all of us . " the royal we ? vaclav klaus likes saying " we " instead of " i , " though who he means is not always entirely clear .
but what is clear is that he likes speaking for the czech people . after all , other european countries seem to repeatedly equate the views of the czech republic as a whole with the personal opinion of vaclav klaus , although polls show that 51 percent of czech people are in favor of the eu constitution . for his part , the conservative has never made a secret of his fundamental rejection of the eu constitution .
he opposes the political integration of europe and has a different view of europe , more like the european community of the 1960s and 70s . as far as klaus is concerned , the eu charter is undemocratic and part of a socialist , anti-liberal mechanism that reduces the sovereignty of individual states , particularly of smaller countries .
but all this , klaus insists , is merely his own opinion .
as president of the czech republic he is required to remain neutral . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech president 's office is located in prague castle , overlooking the city vaclav klaus 's critics call him vain and arrogant , and they also accuse him of overstepping the boundaries of his position as president .
the czech president is meant to be little more than a figurehead .
nevertheless , klaus has been trying to do everything in his power to influence the public and convince voters to oppose the eu constitution .
" i do n't like it , " said a 34-year-old woman from prague .
" i do n't think that the president will be able to influence us .
we all have our own view of the issue .
when he says that we will lose our sovereignty , it 's just a joke .
the president has always had strange things to say . " unlikely partners indeed , klaus is backed in his opposition to the eu charter by conservative civic democratic party -lrb- ods -rrb- , which he led for 11 years .
on the other side of the political spectrum , the country 's communists also reject the eu constitution . both parties are influential in the czech republic : the ods is the czech party with the highest approval rating - 30 percent - and the communists follow in second place .
though public cooperation between the two parties is unthinkable , both want the czechs to reject the eu constitution , whether in a national referendum or a " no " vote in parliament . " i predict a glowing future if the constitution does not get ratified , " klaus said .
" i think that such documents are the last thing that the eu and its people need in order to lead happy and successful lives .

due to the time difference , the 1.4 million voters in france 's overseas territories went to the polls on saturday . when president jacques chirac , whose ruling center-right union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- is leading the " yes " campaign , called for a referendum on the eu text last year , treaty supporters had a comfortable lead in the opinion polls . " no " camp has an edge now , the " no " camp - capitalizing on the increasing unpopularity of the government - seems to have the edge , and the 72-year-old french leader is counting on the country 's undecided voters to turn the tables . chirac 's ump is campaigning alongside its junior partner in government , the union for french democracy -lrb- udf -rrb- , as well as the opposition socialist party -lrb- ps -rrb- and the greens - a coalition of france 's mainstream political elite . they are facing a disparate " no " camp made up of the far-right national front of jean-marie le pen , the communist and trotskyist parties , nationalist euroskeptics and the former socialist prime minister laurent fabius . pollsters say that pro-european socialist party supporters - tempted to follow fabius and vote " no " but fearful of the consequences - will be the key , along with voter turnout . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac before addressing a french television program on sunday 's referendum on the eu constitution at the elysee palace in paris , thursday may 26 , 2005 .
a come-from-behind victory for the " yes " camp would bolster chirac , allow eu officials in brussels to breathe a sign of relief and keep the eu treaty on track ahead of a consultative referendum in the netherlands on wednesday . a string of european leaders travelled to france to make the case for the constitution including german chancellor gerhard schroeder and spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero , insisting there is no " plan b " . the french president , who has staked his prestige on approval of the treaty , has warned voters that a french " no " would diminish the country 's influence in europe , indeed making it the " black sheep " of the continent . what rejection would mean rejection of the treaty would have a profound political impact in france , tarnishing chirac 's record in the history books , prompting a government reshuffle and deepening the rift in the socialist party . no matter what the outcome on sunday , chirac is expected to dismiss his unpopular prime minister jean-pierre raffarin , with interior minister dominique de villepin and defense minister michele alliot-marie his possible successors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy should france reject the treaty , chirac - who celebrated his 10th year as president earlier this month - would be unlikely to seek a third term in office in 2007 , opening the door to his arch-rival , ump leader nicolas sarkozy -lrb- photo -rrb- . chirac has however ruled out his resignation should the " no " camp prevail . the constitution must be ratified by all 25 member states .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.05.2005 german wetland under threat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gently down the stream : the spree is popular with vacationers the spree forest , a remote wetland south of berlin , is a nature-lover 's paradise known for its many narrow waterways .
but researchers say the pristine region is in danger , blaming changes in climate and industry . the spree river runs through the immense spreewald biosphere reserve southeast of berlin .
it starts in the lusatia region , near poland , and is known for its traditional irrigation system consisting of 1,300 kilometers -lrb- 800 miles -rrb- of small channels and waterways .
alder forests and wetlands alternate with sandy pine forests , grasslands and fields in a landscape that seems to have been little affected by the forces of modernity .
the spree runs into the havel , which becomes a feeder for the elbe , eastern germany 's major waterway .
while much of western germany has been soaked with seemingly endless spring rains this year , folks in the elbe valley have seen less precipitation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pear tree in spreewald given that europe is facing climate change due to global warming , this trend is likely to continue in the coming decades , said bernd hansjürgens of the leipzig-halle environmental research institute .
over the past 50 years , median temperatures in europe have risen by as much as 1.5 degrees celsius -lrb- 34.7 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , he said .
" we in the elbe catchment area find ourselves in a relatively dry area within central europe , " he said .
" this lack of rain is becoming more and more noticeable , " he said .
culprit : brown coal to make matters worse , climate change is only part of the story .
the structural changes in what was once a brown coal region also play a large part .
bildunterschrift : spreewald scenery when the brown coal mines were working , between 1950 and 1990 , it took six tons of water to unearth every ton of brown coal .
that means that during that time , gallons upon gallons of water were taken from lusatia and pumped into the spree .
without this infusion , the water level in the spree 's aquifer would sink to somewhere between one-fifth and one-tenth of what it has been for the past 50 years .
" that has consequences for the spree forest , for this valuable biotope , and it has consequences also for berlin , " hansjürgens said .
" there is really now a danger that the water table will recede if less water is pumped in from the brown coal regions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.05.2005 german wetland under threat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gently down the stream : the spree is popular with vacationers the spree forest , a remote wetland south of berlin , is a nature-lover 's paradise known for its many narrow waterways .
but researchers say the pristine region is in danger , blaming changes in climate and industry . the spree river runs through the immense spreewald biosphere reserve southeast of berlin .
it starts in the lusatia region , near poland , and is known for its traditional irrigation system consisting of 1,300 kilometers -lrb- 800 miles -rrb- of small channels and waterways .
alder forests and wetlands alternate with sandy pine forests , grasslands and fields in a landscape that seems to have been little affected by the forces of modernity .
the spree runs into the havel , which becomes a feeder for the elbe , eastern germany 's major waterway .
while much of western germany has been soaked with seemingly endless spring rains this year , folks in the elbe valley have seen less precipitation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pear tree in spreewald given that europe is facing climate change due to global warming , this trend is likely to continue in the coming decades , said bernd hansjürgens of the leipzig-halle environmental research institute .
over the past 50 years , median temperatures in europe have risen by as much as 1.5 degrees celsius -lrb- 34.7 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , he said .
" we in the elbe catchment area find ourselves in a relatively dry area within central europe , " he said .
" this lack of rain is becoming more and more noticeable , " he said .
culprit : brown coal to make matters worse , climate change is only part of the story .
the structural changes in what was once a brown coal region also play a large part .
bildunterschrift : spreewald scenery when the brown coal mines were working , between 1950 and 1990 , it took six tons of water to unearth every ton of brown coal .
that means that during that time , gallons upon gallons of water were taken from lusatia and pumped into the spree .
without this infusion , the water level in the spree 's aquifer would sink to somewhere between one-fifth and one-tenth of what it has been for the past 50 years .
" that has consequences for the spree forest , for this valuable biotope , and it has consequences also for berlin , " hansjürgens said .
" there is really now a danger that the water table will recede if less water is pumped in from the brown coal regions .
and that would lead to part of the spree forest disappearing over time . "
poor water quality the problem did not end with the closing of the mines .
now , the strip mines that are left need to be flooded with fresh river water .
otherwise , the groundwater that would gather there would be extremely sulfurous and contaminated with toxins .

dw-world spoke with him about next year 's world cup as well as about his team 's success and german soccer 's image abroad . dw : year one of the klinsmann era is almost behind us .
from nine games the national team has played with you at the helm , they 've only lost one , to south korea .
how would you take stock of the team 's performance thus far ? jürgen klinsmann : i think our record is a very , very positive one , above all , because we have grown together as a team , and not just as a new coaching staff .
we complement each other very well .
we 've brought people on board who have brought enormous talents with them .
for example , i 'm thinking of areas like overall fitness , and the fact that we have been able to bring over coaches for that from the us .
there 's also our sports psychologist , who we have integrated into the team ... … and the red jerseys ? … the jerseys , they look really good , but they are n't going to be scoring any goals for us .
i think that the way the team has performed in the last ten months , with style and pizzazz , and all the enthusiasm they 've shown in every game , it 's simply fantastic .
it is incredibly fun to work with this team .
there 's a lot of potential there , and that gives us the confidence to say during the world cup here at home : we want to play for the title ! before the world cup , the confederations cup is taking place , from june 15 - 29 .
eight teams are playing for the trophy , among them germany and top teams such as brazil and argentina .
who do you think will win ? naturally , i hope we do !
and logically , if one says one wants to win the world cup title here in germany , then for the confederations cup , which is often called a test , miniature world cup , we have the same goal . so for you , the confederations cup is a real test run ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann it is a test run for us .
every single game will give us more information about the team 's performance standard .
there is also a bit of ambition involved .
when a team participates in a contest like this , you not only measure yourself against very good teams from around the world , you also want to beat countries like argentina or brazil .
even if the season was a very long one for the players , that provides enough incentive for all of us to really get out there and give it our all . and if the plan does n't work out like you want with the world cup ?
do you feel under pressure ? yes , but that 's normal in soccer .
if you carry the responsibility and things do n't go well , you get into hot water .
that would surely be the case if we do n't perform well , but if i were to think along those lines , i would n't be the right man for this job .
i have taken on this position with a lot of optimism .
if it does n't go as planned , then the avalanche is going to come , like it or not .
but that would happen with anyone . if it came down to playing a beautiful game or winning , which would you choose ? both !
both are important .
of course , we want to play an attractive game of soccer .
i think we 've shown in the last ten months that we have laid a good foundation for that , that we have a team that can play up front , fast and aggressively .
it 's a style of playing that will bear fruit for us .
we have also pursued a new philosophy in which the players identify themselves with their role in the national team .
it 's important that a certain self-image is anchored in the minds of our players that when it comes to the national team , they give it all they 've got ! can germany itself benefit from this kind of positive attitude you 're describing ?
what would a world cup victory mean for germany ?
how important is a good performance by the german team ? i think the team demonstrated how that can help already this year in the european cup .
whether it was in the game here in berlin against brazil , where the fans showed incredible enthusiasm , or the game in iran in front of 120,000 spectators , where the team was able to bring the iranian population over to its side . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann kicking the ball around at the opening of the street soccer festival in berlin we want to build on this positive attitude and we want our players to be aware of the fact that in a way , they act as ambassadors for germany , since we will be observed very closely by the entire world during the upcoming world cup .
everything is going to be reported about , whether it 's about the national team , the cities , or the people who live in germany .
we want to put forward a fantastic image and show people that germany has developed in an incredibly positive way , naturally also after reunification . you yourself live abroad .
how would you describe the image of german soccer outside of this country ? i think that in general , there 's a great respect for german soccer abroad , something which of course has been stamped by our three world championship titles and three european championship titles .
people know that when it comes to tournaments , the german team is always able to concentrate on the essentials .
we know that our opponents have a lot of respect for us .
as far as our domestic teams go , the situation this year has n't been all that positive , since they fell out of the running for the european cup relatively early .
we lost a little bit of our standing there , but we can win that back very quickly . how much has been lost due to the referee scandal ? the referee affair has certainly cost us in the eyes of the world , since most people could n't imagine that such a thing could happen in germany .
we stand for other kinds of values , such as straightforwardness , honesty and a serious business mentality .
the scandal hurt us , no doubt about it , but on the other hand , people abroad have been very impressed with the way the german football federation handled the affair and how consistent they have been in their actions , such as finding those who are guilty and making them pay the consequences . the interview was conducted by guido baumhauer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de referee scandal rears its ugly head in april , german soccer officials quietly put the referee scandal involving robert hoyzer to rest .
but manipulation accusations have risen again , this time involving another ref .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.05.2005 france votes down eu constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the answer is " no " after a large voter turnout , france has overwhelmingly said " non " to the proposed eu constitution .
projections released immediately after polls closed show between 54.5 and 55.6 percent voted against the document . it was not much of a surprise , since surveys for several weeks have shown the " no " camp to be in the lead .
despite an urgent , last-minute appeal from president jacques chirac , a majority of french voters were not convinced that the proposed constitution , which was designed to simplify decision making after the eu 's enlargement last year , was in their best interests . the sharp defeat for the charter , which has been dreaded by eu leaders , could weaken france , one of the central pillars of the european union .
supporters have said a defeat could stall european integration and unsettle some financial markets . " the decision of france inevitably creates a difficult context for defending our interests in europe , " chirac said in an address broadcast on national television . bildunterschrift : but cheers went up from supporters of the " no " campaign when the exit polls results were announced just after voting ended at 2200 central european time .
those who rejected the treaty included communists , various left-wing groups , dissident socialists and far-right parties . with the french rejection , the eu constitution in its current form has been dealt a potentially fatal blow and the future path of the european bloc is unclear .
the charter needed the ratification of all 25 eu states to go into effect .
france was the tenth country to decide about the document .
previously , nine eu member states had given their approval . the question now is whether the ratification process will continue in the remaining eu states that have not yet voted .
french foreign minister michel barnier said the vote was a " real disappointment , " but added that other eu countries should go ahead with their own votes regardless . setback for president the results are a blow to french president jacques chirac , who had campaigned hard for the charter 's passage , including broadcasting a last-minute appeal on french television just days before sunday 's vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vote was seen by many to be as much about the popularity of chirac and his government as about the future course of the eu .
the bitter debate divided france and became a debate on france 's overall malaise and fears that low-wage new member countries in eastern europe could be dangerous to france 's economic health . french far-right leader jean-marie le pen and eurosceptic philippe de villiers urged chirac to step down on sunday .
previously , chirac had said he would not quit after the vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac leaves the polling station after casting his vote in sarran , southwestern france sunday may 29 , 2005 in a referendum on the eu constitution .
however , after the results came in , chirac said he would make a decision on the future of his center-right government " in the coming days " after french voters overwhelmingly rejected the eu constitution .

dw-world spoke with him about next year 's world cup as well as about his team 's success and german soccer 's image abroad . dw : year one of the klinsmann era is almost behind us .
from nine games the national team has played with you at the helm , they 've only lost one , to south korea .
how would you take stock of the team 's performance thus far ? jürgen klinsmann : i think our record is a very , very positive one , above all , because we have grown together as a team , and not just as a new coaching staff .
we complement each other very well .
we 've brought people on board who have brought enormous talents with them .
for example , i 'm thinking of areas like overall fitness , and the fact that we have been able to bring over coaches for that from the us .
there 's also our sports psychologist , who we have integrated into the team ... … and the red jerseys ? … the jerseys , they look really good , but they are n't going to be scoring any goals for us .
i think that the way the team has performed in the last ten months , with style and pizzazz , and all the enthusiasm they 've shown in every game , it 's simply fantastic .
it is incredibly fun to work with this team .
there 's a lot of potential there , and that gives us the confidence to say during the world cup here at home : we want to play for the title ! before the world cup , the confederations cup is taking place , from june 15 - 29 .
eight teams are playing for the trophy , among them germany and top teams such as brazil and argentina .
who do you think will win ? naturally , i hope we do !
and logically , if one says one wants to win the world cup title here in germany , then for the confederations cup , which is often called a test , miniature world cup , we have the same goal . so for you , the confederations cup is a real test run ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann it is a test run for us .
every single game will give us more information about the team 's performance standard .
there is also a bit of ambition involved .
when a team participates in a contest like this , you not only measure yourself against very good teams from around the world , you also want to beat countries like argentina or brazil .
even if the season was a very long one for the players , that provides enough incentive for all of us to really get out there and give it our all . and if the plan does n't work out like you want with the world cup ?
do you feel under pressure ? yes , but that 's normal in soccer .
if you carry the responsibility and things do n't go well , you get into hot water .
that would surely be the case if we do n't perform well , but if i were to think along those lines , i would n't be the right man for this job .
i have taken on this position with a lot of optimism .
if it does n't go as planned , then the avalanche is going to come , like it or not .
but that would happen with anyone . if it came down to playing a beautiful game or winning , which would you choose ? both !
both are important .
of course , we want to play an attractive game of soccer .
i think we 've shown in the last ten months that we have laid a good foundation for that , that we have a team that can play up front , fast and aggressively .
it 's a style of playing that will bear fruit for us .
we have also pursued a new philosophy in which the players identify themselves with their role in the national team .
it 's important that a certain self-image is anchored in the minds of our players that when it comes to the national team , they give it all they 've got ! can germany itself benefit from this kind of positive attitude you 're describing ?
what would a world cup victory mean for germany ?
how important is a good performance by the german team ? i think the team demonstrated how that can help already this year in the european cup .
whether it was in the game here in berlin against brazil , where the fans showed incredible enthusiasm , or the game in iran in front of 120,000 spectators , where the team was able to bring the iranian population over to its side . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann kicking the ball around at the opening of the street soccer festival in berlin we want to build on this positive attitude and we want our players to be aware of the fact that in a way , they act as ambassadors for germany , since we will be observed very closely by the entire world during the upcoming world cup .
everything is going to be reported about , whether it 's about the national team , the cities , or the people who live in germany .
we want to put forward a fantastic image and show people that germany has developed in an incredibly positive way , naturally also after reunification . you yourself live abroad .
how would you describe the image of german soccer outside of this country ? i think that in general , there 's a great respect for german soccer abroad , something which of course has been stamped by our three world championship titles and three european championship titles .
people know that when it comes to tournaments , the german team is always able to concentrate on the essentials .
we know that our opponents have a lot of respect for us .
as far as our domestic teams go , the situation this year has n't been all that positive , since they fell out of the running for the european cup relatively early .
we lost a little bit of our standing there , but we can win that back very quickly . how much has been lost due to the referee scandal ? the referee affair has certainly cost us in the eyes of the world , since most people could n't imagine that such a thing could happen in germany .
we stand for other kinds of values , such as straightforwardness , honesty and a serious business mentality .
the scandal hurt us , no doubt about it , but on the other hand , people abroad have been very impressed with the way the german football federation handled the affair and how consistent they have been in their actions , such as finding those who are guilty and making them pay the consequences . the interview was conducted by guido baumhauer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de referee scandal rears its ugly head in april , german soccer officials quietly put the referee scandal involving robert hoyzer to rest .
but manipulation accusations have risen again , this time involving another ref .

but researchers say the pristine region is in danger , blaming changes in climate and industry . the spree river runs through the immense spreewald biosphere reserve southeast of berlin .
it starts in the lusatia region , near poland , and is known for its traditional irrigation system consisting of 1,300 kilometers -lrb- 800 miles -rrb- of small channels and waterways .
alder forests and wetlands alternate with sandy pine forests , grasslands and fields in a landscape that seems to have been little affected by the forces of modernity .
the spree runs into the havel , which becomes a feeder for the elbe , eastern germany 's major waterway .

" we in the elbe catchment area find ourselves in a relatively dry area within central europe , " he said .
" this lack of rain is becoming more and more noticeable , " he said .

bildunterschrift : spreewald scenery when the brown coal mines were working , between 1950 and 1990 , it took six tons of water to unearth every ton of brown coal .
that means that during that time , gallons upon gallons of water were taken from lusatia and pumped into the spree .
without this infusion , the water level in the spree 's aquifer would sink to somewhere between one-fifth and one-tenth of what it has been for the past 50 years .
" that has consequences for the spree forest , for this valuable biotope , and it has consequences also for berlin , " hansjürgens said .
" there is really now a danger that the water table will recede if less water is pumped in from the brown coal regions .
and that would lead to part of the spree forest disappearing over time . "
poor water quality the problem did not end with the closing of the mines .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic culture along the spree in order to prepare part of the spree forest to survive without receiving water from lusatia , environmental planners are trying to soften the blow .
there are a few options .
first , planners may decide to flood the strip mines for a longer period of time .
this would buy them time to deal with the changing situation - but it would postpone the development of tourism in the region .
another alternative would be to dry up of some of the spree 's small branch rivers , or fliesse , and use that water to flood the strip mines .
and a final possibility would be to bring water from the nearby oder river into the spree-havel area .
but the consequences such an action would have on all of the waterways must be researched in greater depth .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.05.2005 german wetland under threat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gently down the stream : the spree is popular with vacationers the spree forest , a remote wetland south of berlin , is a nature-lover 's paradise known for its many narrow waterways .
but researchers say the pristine region is in danger , blaming changes in climate and industry . the spree river runs through the immense spreewald biosphere reserve southeast of berlin .
it starts in the lusatia region , near poland , and is known for its traditional irrigation system consisting of 1,300 kilometers -lrb- 800 miles -rrb- of small channels and waterways .
alder forests and wetlands alternate with sandy pine forests , grasslands and fields in a landscape that seems to have been little affected by the forces of modernity .
the spree runs into the havel , which becomes a feeder for the elbe , eastern germany 's major waterway .
while much of western germany has been soaked with seemingly endless spring rains this year , folks in the elbe valley have seen less precipitation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pear tree in spreewald given that europe is facing climate change due to global warming , this trend is likely to continue in the coming decades , said bernd hansjürgens of the leipzig-halle environmental research institute .
over the past 50 years , median temperatures in europe have risen by as much as 1.5 degrees celsius -lrb- 34.7 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , he said .
" we in the elbe catchment area find ourselves in a relatively dry area within central europe , " he said .
" this lack of rain is becoming more and more noticeable , " he said .
culprit : brown coal to make matters worse , climate change is only part of the story .
the structural changes in what was once a brown coal region also play a large part .
bildunterschrift : spreewald scenery when the brown coal mines were working , between 1950 and 1990 , it took six tons of water to unearth every ton of brown coal .
that means that during that time , gallons upon gallons of water were taken from lusatia and pumped into the spree .
without this infusion , the water level in the spree 's aquifer would sink to somewhere between one-fifth and one-tenth of what it has been for the past 50 years .
" that has consequences for the spree forest , for this valuable biotope , and it has consequences also for berlin , " hansjürgens said .
" there is really now a danger that the water table will recede if less water is pumped in from the brown coal regions .
and that would lead to part of the spree forest disappearing over time . "
poor water quality the problem did not end with the closing of the mines .
now , the strip mines that are left need to be flooded with fresh river water .
otherwise , the groundwater that would gather there would be extremely sulfurous and contaminated with toxins .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic culture along the spree in order to prepare part of the spree forest to survive without receiving water from lusatia , environmental planners are trying to soften the blow .
there are a few options .
first , planners may decide to flood the strip mines for a longer period of time .
this would buy them time to deal with the changing situation - but it would postpone the development of tourism in the region .
another alternative would be to dry up of some of the spree 's small branch rivers , or fliesse , and use that water to flood the strip mines .
and a final possibility would be to bring water from the nearby oder river into the spree-havel area .
but the consequences such an action would have on all of the waterways must be researched in greater depth .
no one knows just yet what the best alternative is .
but one thing appears certain : a part of the spree forest is destined to disappear . dagmar röhrlich -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de emissions threaten european plants a new study on the effects of global warming shows more than half of european plant species are at risk , especially mediterranean and alpine plants .

projections released immediately after polls closed show between 54.5 and 55.6 percent voted against the document . it was not much of a surprise , since surveys for several weeks have shown the " no " camp to be in the lead .
despite an urgent , last-minute appeal from president jacques chirac , a majority of french voters were not convinced that the proposed constitution , which was designed to simplify decision making after the eu 's enlargement last year , was in their best interests . the sharp defeat for the charter , which has been dreaded by eu leaders , could weaken france , one of the central pillars of the european union .
supporters have said a defeat could stall european integration and unsettle some financial markets . " the decision of france inevitably creates a difficult context for defending our interests in europe , " chirac said in an address broadcast on national television . bildunterschrift : but cheers went up from supporters of the " no " campaign when the exit polls results were announced just after voting ended at 2200 central european time .
those who rejected the treaty included communists , various left-wing groups , dissident socialists and far-right parties . with the french rejection , the eu constitution in its current form has been dealt a potentially fatal blow and the future path of the european bloc is unclear .
the charter needed the ratification of all 25 eu states to go into effect .
france was the tenth country to decide about the document .
previously , nine eu member states had given their approval . the question now is whether the ratification process will continue in the remaining eu states that have not yet voted .
french foreign minister michel barnier said the vote was a " real disappointment , " but added that other eu countries should go ahead with their own votes regardless . setback for president the results are a blow to french president jacques chirac , who had campaigned hard for the charter 's passage , including broadcasting a last-minute appeal on french television just days before sunday 's vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vote was seen by many to be as much about the popularity of chirac and his government as about the future course of the eu .
the bitter debate divided france and became a debate on france 's overall malaise and fears that low-wage new member countries in eastern europe could be dangerous to france 's economic health . french far-right leader jean-marie le pen and eurosceptic philippe de villiers urged chirac to step down on sunday .

it 's largely expected he will dismiss unpopular prime minister jean-pierre raffarin . not dead yet the head of the european socialist party poul nyrup rasmussen lamented sunday france 's rejection of the eu constitution , saying it was a " sad day " for europe but insisting that the charter was not dead . " this is a sad , sad day for france and a sad day for europe too , " he said in a statement after exit polls indicated that some 55 percent of french voters rejected the constitution . " but rumors of the constitution 's demise have been greatly exaggerated , " he added .

projections released immediately after polls closed show between 54.5 and 55.6 percent voted against the document . it was not much of a surprise , since surveys for several weeks have shown the " no " camp to be in the lead .
despite an urgent , last-minute appeal from president jacques chirac , a majority of french voters were not convinced that the proposed constitution , which was designed to simplify decision making after the eu 's enlargement last year , was in their best interests . the sharp defeat for the charter , which has been dreaded by eu leaders , could weaken france , one of the central pillars of the european union .
supporters have said a defeat could stall european integration and unsettle some financial markets . " the decision of france inevitably creates a difficult context for defending our interests in europe , " chirac said in an address broadcast on national television . bildunterschrift : but cheers went up from supporters of the " no " campaign when the exit polls results were announced just after voting ended at 2200 central european time .
those who rejected the treaty included communists , various left-wing groups , dissident socialists and far-right parties . with the french rejection , the eu constitution in its current form has been dealt a potentially fatal blow and the future path of the european bloc is unclear .
the charter needed the ratification of all 25 eu states to go into effect .
france was the tenth country to decide about the document .
previously , nine eu member states had given their approval . the question now is whether the ratification process will continue in the remaining eu states that have not yet voted .
french foreign minister michel barnier said the vote was a " real disappointment , " but added that other eu countries should go ahead with their own votes regardless . setback for president the results are a blow to french president jacques chirac , who had campaigned hard for the charter 's passage , including broadcasting a last-minute appeal on french television just days before sunday 's vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vote was seen by many to be as much about the popularity of chirac and his government as about the future course of the eu .
the bitter debate divided france and became a debate on france 's overall malaise and fears that low-wage new member countries in eastern europe could be dangerous to france 's economic health . french far-right leader jean-marie le pen and eurosceptic philippe de villiers urged chirac to step down on sunday .

czech president vaclav klaus opposes the eu constitution , and hardly a day goes by in which he does n't remind his countrymen and women of the fact . vaclav klaus , 63 , an economist , prides himself on his title of professor .
one may also refer to him as mr. president , since he has held the position for over two years .
but what he does n't like is being called a euroskeptic . " some people are constantly using labels : euro-optimists , euro-pessimists or euroskeptics , " klaus told deutsche welle . " please do not do this .
those of us who are concerned with the future of europe and what is happening on this continent , we reject being labeled as euroskeptics , because we are actually optimists .
we are making a maximum effort to ensure that things turn out well for this continent and for all of us . " the royal we ? vaclav klaus likes saying " we " instead of " i , " though who he means is not always entirely clear .
but what is clear is that he likes speaking for the czech people . after all , other european countries seem to repeatedly equate the views of the czech republic as a whole with the personal opinion of vaclav klaus , although polls show that 51 percent of czech people are in favor of the eu constitution . for his part , the conservative has never made a secret of his fundamental rejection of the eu constitution .
he opposes the political integration of europe and has a different view of europe , more like the european community of the 1960s and 70s . as far as klaus is concerned , the eu charter is undemocratic and part of a socialist , anti-liberal mechanism that reduces the sovereignty of individual states , particularly of smaller countries .
but all this , klaus insists , is merely his own opinion .
as president of the czech republic he is required to remain neutral . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech president 's office is located in prague castle , overlooking the city vaclav klaus 's critics call him vain and arrogant , and they also accuse him of overstepping the boundaries of his position as president .
the czech president is meant to be little more than a figurehead .
nevertheless , klaus has been trying to do everything in his power to influence the public and convince voters to oppose the eu constitution .
" i do n't like it , " said a 34-year-old woman from prague .
" i do n't think that the president will be able to influence us .
we all have our own view of the issue .
when he says that we will lose our sovereignty , it 's just a joke .
the president has always had strange things to say . " unlikely partners indeed , klaus is backed in his opposition to the eu charter by conservative civic democratic party -lrb- ods -rrb- , which he led for 11 years .
on the other side of the political spectrum , the country 's communists also reject the eu constitution . both parties are influential in the czech republic : the ods is the czech party with the highest approval rating - 30 percent - and the communists follow in second place .
though public cooperation between the two parties is unthinkable , both want the czechs to reject the eu constitution , whether in a national referendum or a " no " vote in parliament . " i predict a glowing future if the constitution does not get ratified , " klaus said .

but what he does n't like is being called a euroskeptic . " some people are constantly using labels : euro-optimists , euro-pessimists or euroskeptics , " klaus told deutsche welle . " please do not do this .
those of us who are concerned with the future of europe and what is happening on this continent , we reject being labeled as euroskeptics , because we are actually optimists .
we are making a maximum effort to ensure that things turn out well for this continent and for all of us . " the royal we ? vaclav klaus likes saying " we " instead of " i , " though who he means is not always entirely clear .
but what is clear is that he likes speaking for the czech people . after all , other european countries seem to repeatedly equate the views of the czech republic as a whole with the personal opinion of vaclav klaus , although polls show that 51 percent of czech people are in favor of the eu constitution . for his part , the conservative has never made a secret of his fundamental rejection of the eu constitution .
he opposes the political integration of europe and has a different view of europe , more like the european community of the 1960s and 70s . as far as klaus is concerned , the eu charter is undemocratic and part of a socialist , anti-liberal mechanism that reduces the sovereignty of individual states , particularly of smaller countries .
but all this , klaus insists , is merely his own opinion .
as president of the czech republic he is required to remain neutral . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech president 's office is located in prague castle , overlooking the city vaclav klaus 's critics call him vain and arrogant , and they also accuse him of overstepping the boundaries of his position as president .
the czech president is meant to be little more than a figurehead .
nevertheless , klaus has been trying to do everything in his power to influence the public and convince voters to oppose the eu constitution .
" i do n't like it , " said a 34-year-old woman from prague .
" i do n't think that the president will be able to influence us .
we all have our own view of the issue .
when he says that we will lose our sovereignty , it 's just a joke .
the president has always had strange things to say . " unlikely partners indeed , klaus is backed in his opposition to the eu charter by conservative civic democratic party -lrb- ods -rrb- , which he led for 11 years .
on the other side of the political spectrum , the country 's communists also reject the eu constitution . both parties are influential in the czech republic : the ods is the czech party with the highest approval rating - 30 percent - and the communists follow in second place .
though public cooperation between the two parties is unthinkable , both want the czechs to reject the eu constitution , whether in a national referendum or a " no " vote in parliament . " i predict a glowing future if the constitution does not get ratified , " klaus said .
" i think that such documents are the last thing that the eu and its people need in order to lead happy and successful lives .

due to the time difference , the 1.4 million voters in france 's overseas territories went to the polls on saturday . when president jacques chirac , whose ruling center-right union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- is leading the " yes " campaign , called for a referendum on the eu text last year , treaty supporters had a comfortable lead in the opinion polls . " no " camp has an edge now , the " no " camp - capitalizing on the increasing unpopularity of the government - seems to have the edge , and the 72-year-old french leader is counting on the country 's undecided voters to turn the tables . chirac 's ump is campaigning alongside its junior partner in government , the union for french democracy -lrb- udf -rrb- , as well as the opposition socialist party -lrb- ps -rrb- and the greens - a coalition of france 's mainstream political elite . they are facing a disparate " no " camp made up of the far-right national front of jean-marie le pen , the communist and trotskyist parties , nationalist euroskeptics and the former socialist prime minister laurent fabius . pollsters say that pro-european socialist party supporters - tempted to follow fabius and vote " no " but fearful of the consequences - will be the key , along with voter turnout . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac before addressing a french television program on sunday 's referendum on the eu constitution at the elysee palace in paris , thursday may 26 , 2005 .
a come-from-behind victory for the " yes " camp would bolster chirac , allow eu officials in brussels to breathe a sign of relief and keep the eu treaty on track ahead of a consultative referendum in the netherlands on wednesday . a string of european leaders travelled to france to make the case for the constitution including german chancellor gerhard schroeder and spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero , insisting there is no " plan b " . the french president , who has staked his prestige on approval of the treaty , has warned voters that a french " no " would diminish the country 's influence in europe , indeed making it the " black sheep " of the continent . what rejection would mean rejection of the treaty would have a profound political impact in france , tarnishing chirac 's record in the history books , prompting a government reshuffle and deepening the rift in the socialist party . no matter what the outcome on sunday , chirac is expected to dismiss his unpopular prime minister jean-pierre raffarin , with interior minister dominique de villepin and defense minister michele alliot-marie his possible successors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy should france reject the treaty , chirac - who celebrated his 10th year as president earlier this month - would be unlikely to seek a third term in office in 2007 , opening the door to his arch-rival , ump leader nicolas sarkozy -lrb- photo -rrb- . chirac has however ruled out his resignation should the " no " camp prevail . the constitution must be ratified by all 25 member states .

dw-world spoke with him about next year 's world cup as well as about his team 's success and german soccer 's image abroad . dw : year one of the klinsmann era is almost behind us .
from nine games the national team has played with you at the helm , they 've only lost one , to south korea .
how would you take stock of the team 's performance thus far ? jürgen klinsmann : i think our record is a very , very positive one , above all , because we have grown together as a team , and not just as a new coaching staff .
we complement each other very well .
we 've brought people on board who have brought enormous talents with them .
for example , i 'm thinking of areas like overall fitness , and the fact that we have been able to bring over coaches for that from the us .
there 's also our sports psychologist , who we have integrated into the team ... … and the red jerseys ? … the jerseys , they look really good , but they are n't going to be scoring any goals for us .
i think that the way the team has performed in the last ten months , with style and pizzazz , and all the enthusiasm they 've shown in every game , it 's simply fantastic .
it is incredibly fun to work with this team .
there 's a lot of potential there , and that gives us the confidence to say during the world cup here at home : we want to play for the title ! before the world cup , the confederations cup is taking place , from june 15 - 29 .
eight teams are playing for the trophy , among them germany and top teams such as brazil and argentina .
who do you think will win ? naturally , i hope we do !
and logically , if one says one wants to win the world cup title here in germany , then for the confederations cup , which is often called a test , miniature world cup , we have the same goal . so for you , the confederations cup is a real test run ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann it is a test run for us .
every single game will give us more information about the team 's performance standard .
there is also a bit of ambition involved .
when a team participates in a contest like this , you not only measure yourself against very good teams from around the world , you also want to beat countries like argentina or brazil .
even if the season was a very long one for the players , that provides enough incentive for all of us to really get out there and give it our all . and if the plan does n't work out like you want with the world cup ?
do you feel under pressure ? yes , but that 's normal in soccer .
if you carry the responsibility and things do n't go well , you get into hot water .
that would surely be the case if we do n't perform well , but if i were to think along those lines , i would n't be the right man for this job .
i have taken on this position with a lot of optimism .
if it does n't go as planned , then the avalanche is going to come , like it or not .
but that would happen with anyone . if it came down to playing a beautiful game or winning , which would you choose ? both !
both are important .
of course , we want to play an attractive game of soccer .
i think we 've shown in the last ten months that we have laid a good foundation for that , that we have a team that can play up front , fast and aggressively .
it 's a style of playing that will bear fruit for us .
we have also pursued a new philosophy in which the players identify themselves with their role in the national team .
it 's important that a certain self-image is anchored in the minds of our players that when it comes to the national team , they give it all they 've got ! can germany itself benefit from this kind of positive attitude you 're describing ?
what would a world cup victory mean for germany ?
how important is a good performance by the german team ? i think the team demonstrated how that can help already this year in the european cup .
whether it was in the game here in berlin against brazil , where the fans showed incredible enthusiasm , or the game in iran in front of 120,000 spectators , where the team was able to bring the iranian population over to its side . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann kicking the ball around at the opening of the street soccer festival in berlin we want to build on this positive attitude and we want our players to be aware of the fact that in a way , they act as ambassadors for germany , since we will be observed very closely by the entire world during the upcoming world cup .
everything is going to be reported about , whether it 's about the national team , the cities , or the people who live in germany .
we want to put forward a fantastic image and show people that germany has developed in an incredibly positive way , naturally also after reunification . you yourself live abroad .
how would you describe the image of german soccer outside of this country ? i think that in general , there 's a great respect for german soccer abroad , something which of course has been stamped by our three world championship titles and three european championship titles .
people know that when it comes to tournaments , the german team is always able to concentrate on the essentials .
we know that our opponents have a lot of respect for us .
as far as our domestic teams go , the situation this year has n't been all that positive , since they fell out of the running for the european cup relatively early .
we lost a little bit of our standing there , but we can win that back very quickly . how much has been lost due to the referee scandal ? the referee affair has certainly cost us in the eyes of the world , since most people could n't imagine that such a thing could happen in germany .
we stand for other kinds of values , such as straightforwardness , honesty and a serious business mentality .
the scandal hurt us , no doubt about it , but on the other hand , people abroad have been very impressed with the way the german football federation handled the affair and how consistent they have been in their actions , such as finding those who are guilty and making them pay the consequences . the interview was conducted by guido baumhauer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de referee scandal rears its ugly head in april , german soccer officials quietly put the referee scandal involving robert hoyzer to rest .

dw-world spoke with him about next year 's world cup as well as about his team 's success and german soccer 's image abroad . dw : year one of the klinsmann era is almost behind us .
from nine games the national team has played with you at the helm , they 've only lost one , to south korea .
how would you take stock of the team 's performance thus far ? jürgen klinsmann : i think our record is a very , very positive one , above all , because we have grown together as a team , and not just as a new coaching staff .
we complement each other very well .
we 've brought people on board who have brought enormous talents with them .
for example , i 'm thinking of areas like overall fitness , and the fact that we have been able to bring over coaches for that from the us .
there 's also our sports psychologist , who we have integrated into the team ... … and the red jerseys ? … the jerseys , they look really good , but they are n't going to be scoring any goals for us .
i think that the way the team has performed in the last ten months , with style and pizzazz , and all the enthusiasm they 've shown in every game , it 's simply fantastic .
it is incredibly fun to work with this team .
there 's a lot of potential there , and that gives us the confidence to say during the world cup here at home : we want to play for the title ! before the world cup , the confederations cup is taking place , from june 15 - 29 .
eight teams are playing for the trophy , among them germany and top teams such as brazil and argentina .
who do you think will win ? naturally , i hope we do !
and logically , if one says one wants to win the world cup title here in germany , then for the confederations cup , which is often called a test , miniature world cup , we have the same goal . so for you , the confederations cup is a real test run ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann it is a test run for us .
every single game will give us more information about the team 's performance standard .
there is also a bit of ambition involved .
when a team participates in a contest like this , you not only measure yourself against very good teams from around the world , you also want to beat countries like argentina or brazil .
even if the season was a very long one for the players , that provides enough incentive for all of us to really get out there and give it our all . and if the plan does n't work out like you want with the world cup ?

czech president vaclav klaus opposes the eu constitution , and hardly a day goes by in which he does n't remind his countrymen and women of the fact . vaclav klaus , 63 , an economist , prides himself on his title of professor .
one may also refer to him as mr. president , since he has held the position for over two years .
but what he does n't like is being called a euroskeptic . " some people are constantly using labels : euro-optimists , euro-pessimists or euroskeptics , " klaus told deutsche welle . " please do not do this .
those of us who are concerned with the future of europe and what is happening on this continent , we reject being labeled as euroskeptics , because we are actually optimists .
we are making a maximum effort to ensure that things turn out well for this continent and for all of us . " the royal we ? vaclav klaus likes saying " we " instead of " i , " though who he means is not always entirely clear .
but what is clear is that he likes speaking for the czech people . after all , other european countries seem to repeatedly equate the views of the czech republic as a whole with the personal opinion of vaclav klaus , although polls show that 51 percent of czech people are in favor of the eu constitution . for his part , the conservative has never made a secret of his fundamental rejection of the eu constitution .
he opposes the political integration of europe and has a different view of europe , more like the european community of the 1960s and 70s . as far as klaus is concerned , the eu charter is undemocratic and part of a socialist , anti-liberal mechanism that reduces the sovereignty of individual states , particularly of smaller countries .
but all this , klaus insists , is merely his own opinion .
as president of the czech republic he is required to remain neutral . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech president 's office is located in prague castle , overlooking the city vaclav klaus 's critics call him vain and arrogant , and they also accuse him of overstepping the boundaries of his position as president .
the czech president is meant to be little more than a figurehead .
nevertheless , klaus has been trying to do everything in his power to influence the public and convince voters to oppose the eu constitution .
" i do n't like it , " said a 34-year-old woman from prague .
" i do n't think that the president will be able to influence us .
we all have our own view of the issue .
when he says that we will lose our sovereignty , it 's just a joke .
the president has always had strange things to say . " unlikely partners indeed , klaus is backed in his opposition to the eu charter by conservative civic democratic party -lrb- ods -rrb- , which he led for 11 years .
on the other side of the political spectrum , the country 's communists also reject the eu constitution . both parties are influential in the czech republic : the ods is the czech party with the highest approval rating - 30 percent - and the communists follow in second place .
though public cooperation between the two parties is unthinkable , both want the czechs to reject the eu constitution , whether in a national referendum or a " no " vote in parliament . " i predict a glowing future if the constitution does not get ratified , " klaus said .
" i think that such documents are the last thing that the eu and its people need in order to lead happy and successful lives .

due to the time difference , the 1.4 million voters in france 's overseas territories went to the polls on saturday . when president jacques chirac , whose ruling center-right union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- is leading the " yes " campaign , called for a referendum on the eu text last year , treaty supporters had a comfortable lead in the opinion polls . " no " camp has an edge now , the " no " camp - capitalizing on the increasing unpopularity of the government - seems to have the edge , and the 72-year-old french leader is counting on the country 's undecided voters to turn the tables . chirac 's ump is campaigning alongside its junior partner in government , the union for french democracy -lrb- udf -rrb- , as well as the opposition socialist party -lrb- ps -rrb- and the greens - a coalition of france 's mainstream political elite . they are facing a disparate " no " camp made up of the far-right national front of jean-marie le pen , the communist and trotskyist parties , nationalist euroskeptics and the former socialist prime minister laurent fabius . pollsters say that pro-european socialist party supporters - tempted to follow fabius and vote " no " but fearful of the consequences - will be the key , along with voter turnout . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac before addressing a french television program on sunday 's referendum on the eu constitution at the elysee palace in paris , thursday may 26 , 2005 .
a come-from-behind victory for the " yes " camp would bolster chirac , allow eu officials in brussels to breathe a sign of relief and keep the eu treaty on track ahead of a consultative referendum in the netherlands on wednesday . a string of european leaders travelled to france to make the case for the constitution including german chancellor gerhard schroeder and spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero , insisting there is no " plan b " . the french president , who has staked his prestige on approval of the treaty , has warned voters that a french " no " would diminish the country 's influence in europe , indeed making it the " black sheep " of the continent . what rejection would mean rejection of the treaty would have a profound political impact in france , tarnishing chirac 's record in the history books , prompting a government reshuffle and deepening the rift in the socialist party . no matter what the outcome on sunday , chirac is expected to dismiss his unpopular prime minister jean-pierre raffarin , with interior minister dominique de villepin and defense minister michele alliot-marie his possible successors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy should france reject the treaty , chirac - who celebrated his 10th year as president earlier this month - would be unlikely to seek a third term in office in 2007 , opening the door to his arch-rival , ump leader nicolas sarkozy -lrb- photo -rrb- . chirac has however ruled out his resignation should the " no " camp prevail . the constitution must be ratified by all 25 member states .

when a team participates in a contest like this , you not only measure yourself against very good teams from around the world , you also want to beat countries like argentina or brazil .
even if the season was a very long one for the players , that provides enough incentive for all of us to really get out there and give it our all . and if the plan does n't work out like you want with the world cup ?
do you feel under pressure ? yes , but that 's normal in soccer .
if you carry the responsibility and things do n't go well , you get into hot water .
that would surely be the case if we do n't perform well , but if i were to think along those lines , i would n't be the right man for this job .
i have taken on this position with a lot of optimism .
if it does n't go as planned , then the avalanche is going to come , like it or not .
but that would happen with anyone . if it came down to playing a beautiful game or winning , which would you choose ? both !
both are important .
of course , we want to play an attractive game of soccer .
i think we 've shown in the last ten months that we have laid a good foundation for that , that we have a team that can play up front , fast and aggressively .
it 's a style of playing that will bear fruit for us .
we have also pursued a new philosophy in which the players identify themselves with their role in the national team .
it 's important that a certain self-image is anchored in the minds of our players that when it comes to the national team , they give it all they 've got ! can germany itself benefit from this kind of positive attitude you 're describing ?
what would a world cup victory mean for germany ?
how important is a good performance by the german team ? i think the team demonstrated how that can help already this year in the european cup .
whether it was in the game here in berlin against brazil , where the fans showed incredible enthusiasm , or the game in iran in front of 120,000 spectators , where the team was able to bring the iranian population over to its side . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann kicking the ball around at the opening of the street soccer festival in berlin we want to build on this positive attitude and we want our players to be aware of the fact that in a way , they act as ambassadors for germany , since we will be observed very closely by the entire world during the upcoming world cup .
everything is going to be reported about , whether it 's about the national team , the cities , or the people who live in germany .
we want to put forward a fantastic image and show people that germany has developed in an incredibly positive way , naturally also after reunification . you yourself live abroad .
how would you describe the image of german soccer outside of this country ? i think that in general , there 's a great respect for german soccer abroad , something which of course has been stamped by our three world championship titles and three european championship titles .
people know that when it comes to tournaments , the german team is always able to concentrate on the essentials .
we know that our opponents have a lot of respect for us .

dw-world spoke with him about next year 's world cup as well as about his team 's success and german soccer 's image abroad . dw : year one of the klinsmann era is almost behind us .
from nine games the national team has played with you at the helm , they 've only lost one , to south korea .
how would you take stock of the team 's performance thus far ? jürgen klinsmann : i think our record is a very , very positive one , above all , because we have grown together as a team , and not just as a new coaching staff .
we complement each other very well .
we 've brought people on board who have brought enormous talents with them .
for example , i 'm thinking of areas like overall fitness , and the fact that we have been able to bring over coaches for that from the us .
there 's also our sports psychologist , who we have integrated into the team ... … and the red jerseys ? … the jerseys , they look really good , but they are n't going to be scoring any goals for us .
i think that the way the team has performed in the last ten months , with style and pizzazz , and all the enthusiasm they 've shown in every game , it 's simply fantastic .
it is incredibly fun to work with this team .
there 's a lot of potential there , and that gives us the confidence to say during the world cup here at home : we want to play for the title ! before the world cup , the confederations cup is taking place , from june 15 - 29 .
eight teams are playing for the trophy , among them germany and top teams such as brazil and argentina .
who do you think will win ? naturally , i hope we do !
and logically , if one says one wants to win the world cup title here in germany , then for the confederations cup , which is often called a test , miniature world cup , we have the same goal . so for you , the confederations cup is a real test run ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann it is a test run for us .
every single game will give us more information about the team 's performance standard .
there is also a bit of ambition involved .

dw-world spoke with him about next year 's world cup as well as about his team 's success and german soccer 's image abroad . dw : year one of the klinsmann era is almost behind us .
from nine games the national team has played with you at the helm , they 've only lost one , to south korea .
how would you take stock of the team 's performance thus far ? jürgen klinsmann : i think our record is a very , very positive one , above all , because we have grown together as a team , and not just as a new coaching staff .
we complement each other very well .
we 've brought people on board who have brought enormous talents with them .
for example , i 'm thinking of areas like overall fitness , and the fact that we have been able to bring over coaches for that from the us .
there 's also our sports psychologist , who we have integrated into the team ... … and the red jerseys ? … the jerseys , they look really good , but they are n't going to be scoring any goals for us .
i think that the way the team has performed in the last ten months , with style and pizzazz , and all the enthusiasm they 've shown in every game , it 's simply fantastic .
it is incredibly fun to work with this team .
there 's a lot of potential there , and that gives us the confidence to say during the world cup here at home : we want to play for the title ! before the world cup , the confederations cup is taking place , from june 15 - 29 .
eight teams are playing for the trophy , among them germany and top teams such as brazil and argentina .
who do you think will win ? naturally , i hope we do !
and logically , if one says one wants to win the world cup title here in germany , then for the confederations cup , which is often called a test , miniature world cup , we have the same goal . so for you , the confederations cup is a real test run ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann it is a test run for us .
every single game will give us more information about the team 's performance standard .
there is also a bit of ambition involved .
when a team participates in a contest like this , you not only measure yourself against very good teams from around the world , you also want to beat countries like argentina or brazil .
even if the season was a very long one for the players , that provides enough incentive for all of us to really get out there and give it our all . and if the plan does n't work out like you want with the world cup ?
do you feel under pressure ? yes , but that 's normal in soccer .
if you carry the responsibility and things do n't go well , you get into hot water .
that would surely be the case if we do n't perform well , but if i were to think along those lines , i would n't be the right man for this job .
i have taken on this position with a lot of optimism .
if it does n't go as planned , then the avalanche is going to come , like it or not .
but that would happen with anyone . if it came down to playing a beautiful game or winning , which would you choose ? both !
both are important .
of course , we want to play an attractive game of soccer .
i think we 've shown in the last ten months that we have laid a good foundation for that , that we have a team that can play up front , fast and aggressively .
it 's a style of playing that will bear fruit for us .
we have also pursued a new philosophy in which the players identify themselves with their role in the national team .
it 's important that a certain self-image is anchored in the minds of our players that when it comes to the national team , they give it all they 've got ! can germany itself benefit from this kind of positive attitude you 're describing ?
what would a world cup victory mean for germany ?
how important is a good performance by the german team ? i think the team demonstrated how that can help already this year in the european cup .
whether it was in the game here in berlin against brazil , where the fans showed incredible enthusiasm , or the game in iran in front of 120,000 spectators , where the team was able to bring the iranian population over to its side . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann kicking the ball around at the opening of the street soccer festival in berlin we want to build on this positive attitude and we want our players to be aware of the fact that in a way , they act as ambassadors for germany , since we will be observed very closely by the entire world during the upcoming world cup .
everything is going to be reported about , whether it 's about the national team , the cities , or the people who live in germany .
we want to put forward a fantastic image and show people that germany has developed in an incredibly positive way , naturally also after reunification . you yourself live abroad .
how would you describe the image of german soccer outside of this country ? i think that in general , there 's a great respect for german soccer abroad , something which of course has been stamped by our three world championship titles and three european championship titles .
people know that when it comes to tournaments , the german team is always able to concentrate on the essentials .
we know that our opponents have a lot of respect for us .
as far as our domestic teams go , the situation this year has n't been all that positive , since they fell out of the running for the european cup relatively early .
we lost a little bit of our standing there , but we can win that back very quickly . how much has been lost due to the referee scandal ? the referee affair has certainly cost us in the eyes of the world , since most people could n't imagine that such a thing could happen in germany .
we stand for other kinds of values , such as straightforwardness , honesty and a serious business mentality .
the scandal hurt us , no doubt about it , but on the other hand , people abroad have been very impressed with the way the german football federation handled the affair and how consistent they have been in their actions , such as finding those who are guilty and making them pay the consequences . the interview was conducted by guido baumhauer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de referee scandal rears its ugly head in april , german soccer officials quietly put the referee scandal involving robert hoyzer to rest .
but manipulation accusations have risen again , this time involving another ref .

but researchers say the pristine region is in danger , blaming changes in climate and industry . the spree river runs through the immense spreewald biosphere reserve southeast of berlin .
it starts in the lusatia region , near poland , and is known for its traditional irrigation system consisting of 1,300 kilometers -lrb- 800 miles -rrb- of small channels and waterways .
alder forests and wetlands alternate with sandy pine forests , grasslands and fields in a landscape that seems to have been little affected by the forces of modernity .
the spree runs into the havel , which becomes a feeder for the elbe , eastern germany 's major waterway .
while much of western germany has been soaked with seemingly endless spring rains this year , folks in the elbe valley have seen less precipitation .

over the past 50 years , median temperatures in europe have risen by as much as 1.5 degrees celsius -lrb- 34.7 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , he said .

the structural changes in what was once a brown coal region also play a large part .
bildunterschrift : spreewald scenery when the brown coal mines were working , between 1950 and 1990 , it took six tons of water to unearth every ton of brown coal .
that means that during that time , gallons upon gallons of water were taken from lusatia and pumped into the spree .
without this infusion , the water level in the spree 's aquifer would sink to somewhere between one-fifth and one-tenth of what it has been for the past 50 years .
" that has consequences for the spree forest , for this valuable biotope , and it has consequences also for berlin , " hansjürgens said .
" there is really now a danger that the water table will recede if less water is pumped in from the brown coal regions .
and that would lead to part of the spree forest disappearing over time . "
poor water quality the problem did not end with the closing of the mines .
now , the strip mines that are left need to be flooded with fresh river water .

there are a few options .
first , planners may decide to flood the strip mines for a longer period of time .
this would buy them time to deal with the changing situation - but it would postpone the development of tourism in the region .
another alternative would be to dry up of some of the spree 's small branch rivers , or fliesse , and use that water to flood the strip mines .
and a final possibility would be to bring water from the nearby oder river into the spree-havel area .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.05.2005 czech president wants old eu back großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foresees a glowing future without the eu constitution anyone looking for euroskeptics in the czech republic need n't look far .
czech president vaclav klaus opposes the eu constitution , and hardly a day goes by in which he does n't remind his countrymen and women of the fact . vaclav klaus , 63 , an economist , prides himself on his title of professor .
one may also refer to him as mr. president , since he has held the position for over two years .
but what he does n't like is being called a euroskeptic . " some people are constantly using labels : euro-optimists , euro-pessimists or euroskeptics , " klaus told deutsche welle . " please do not do this .
those of us who are concerned with the future of europe and what is happening on this continent , we reject being labeled as euroskeptics , because we are actually optimists .
we are making a maximum effort to ensure that things turn out well for this continent and for all of us . " the royal we ? vaclav klaus likes saying " we " instead of " i , " though who he means is not always entirely clear .
but what is clear is that he likes speaking for the czech people . after all , other european countries seem to repeatedly equate the views of the czech republic as a whole with the personal opinion of vaclav klaus , although polls show that 51 percent of czech people are in favor of the eu constitution . for his part , the conservative has never made a secret of his fundamental rejection of the eu constitution .
he opposes the political integration of europe and has a different view of europe , more like the european community of the 1960s and 70s . as far as klaus is concerned , the eu charter is undemocratic and part of a socialist , anti-liberal mechanism that reduces the sovereignty of individual states , particularly of smaller countries .
but all this , klaus insists , is merely his own opinion .
as president of the czech republic he is required to remain neutral . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech president 's office is located in prague castle , overlooking the city vaclav klaus 's critics call him vain and arrogant , and they also accuse him of overstepping the boundaries of his position as president .
the czech president is meant to be little more than a figurehead .
nevertheless , klaus has been trying to do everything in his power to influence the public and convince voters to oppose the eu constitution .
" i do n't like it , " said a 34-year-old woman from prague .
" i do n't think that the president will be able to influence us .
we all have our own view of the issue .
when he says that we will lose our sovereignty , it 's just a joke .
the president has always had strange things to say . " unlikely partners indeed , klaus is backed in his opposition to the eu charter by conservative civic democratic party -lrb- ods -rrb- , which he led for 11 years .
on the other side of the political spectrum , the country 's communists also reject the eu constitution . both parties are influential in the czech republic : the ods is the czech party with the highest approval rating - 30 percent - and the communists follow in second place .
though public cooperation between the two parties is unthinkable , both want the czechs to reject the eu constitution , whether in a national referendum or a " no " vote in parliament . " i predict a glowing future if the constitution does not get ratified , " klaus said .
" i think that such documents are the last thing that the eu and its people need in order to lead happy and successful lives .

czech president vaclav klaus opposes the eu constitution , and hardly a day goes by in which he does n't remind his countrymen and women of the fact . vaclav klaus , 63 , an economist , prides himself on his title of professor .
one may also refer to him as mr. president , since he has held the position for over two years .
but what he does n't like is being called a euroskeptic . " some people are constantly using labels : euro-optimists , euro-pessimists or euroskeptics , " klaus told deutsche welle . " please do not do this .
those of us who are concerned with the future of europe and what is happening on this continent , we reject being labeled as euroskeptics , because we are actually optimists .
we are making a maximum effort to ensure that things turn out well for this continent and for all of us . " the royal we ? vaclav klaus likes saying " we " instead of " i , " though who he means is not always entirely clear .
but what is clear is that he likes speaking for the czech people . after all , other european countries seem to repeatedly equate the views of the czech republic as a whole with the personal opinion of vaclav klaus , although polls show that 51 percent of czech people are in favor of the eu constitution . for his part , the conservative has never made a secret of his fundamental rejection of the eu constitution .
he opposes the political integration of europe and has a different view of europe , more like the european community of the 1960s and 70s . as far as klaus is concerned , the eu charter is undemocratic and part of a socialist , anti-liberal mechanism that reduces the sovereignty of individual states , particularly of smaller countries .
but all this , klaus insists , is merely his own opinion .
as president of the czech republic he is required to remain neutral . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech president 's office is located in prague castle , overlooking the city vaclav klaus 's critics call him vain and arrogant , and they also accuse him of overstepping the boundaries of his position as president .
the czech president is meant to be little more than a figurehead .
nevertheless , klaus has been trying to do everything in his power to influence the public and convince voters to oppose the eu constitution .
" i do n't like it , " said a 34-year-old woman from prague .
" i do n't think that the president will be able to influence us .
we all have our own view of the issue .
when he says that we will lose our sovereignty , it 's just a joke .
the president has always had strange things to say . " unlikely partners indeed , klaus is backed in his opposition to the eu charter by conservative civic democratic party -lrb- ods -rrb- , which he led for 11 years .
on the other side of the political spectrum , the country 's communists also reject the eu constitution . both parties are influential in the czech republic : the ods is the czech party with the highest approval rating - 30 percent - and the communists follow in second place .
though public cooperation between the two parties is unthinkable , both want the czechs to reject the eu constitution , whether in a national referendum or a " no " vote in parliament . " i predict a glowing future if the constitution does not get ratified , " klaus said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.05.2005 german wetland under threat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gently down the stream : the spree is popular with vacationers the spree forest , a remote wetland south of berlin , is a nature-lover 's paradise known for its many narrow waterways .
but researchers say the pristine region is in danger , blaming changes in climate and industry . the spree river runs through the immense spreewald biosphere reserve southeast of berlin .
it starts in the lusatia region , near poland , and is known for its traditional irrigation system consisting of 1,300 kilometers -lrb- 800 miles -rrb- of small channels and waterways .
alder forests and wetlands alternate with sandy pine forests , grasslands and fields in a landscape that seems to have been little affected by the forces of modernity .
the spree runs into the havel , which becomes a feeder for the elbe , eastern germany 's major waterway .
while much of western germany has been soaked with seemingly endless spring rains this year , folks in the elbe valley have seen less precipitation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pear tree in spreewald given that europe is facing climate change due to global warming , this trend is likely to continue in the coming decades , said bernd hansjürgens of the leipzig-halle environmental research institute .
over the past 50 years , median temperatures in europe have risen by as much as 1.5 degrees celsius -lrb- 34.7 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , he said .
" we in the elbe catchment area find ourselves in a relatively dry area within central europe , " he said .
" this lack of rain is becoming more and more noticeable , " he said .
culprit : brown coal to make matters worse , climate change is only part of the story .
the structural changes in what was once a brown coal region also play a large part .
bildunterschrift : spreewald scenery when the brown coal mines were working , between 1950 and 1990 , it took six tons of water to unearth every ton of brown coal .
that means that during that time , gallons upon gallons of water were taken from lusatia and pumped into the spree .
without this infusion , the water level in the spree 's aquifer would sink to somewhere between one-fifth and one-tenth of what it has been for the past 50 years .
" that has consequences for the spree forest , for this valuable biotope , and it has consequences also for berlin , " hansjürgens said .
" there is really now a danger that the water table will recede if less water is pumped in from the brown coal regions .
and that would lead to part of the spree forest disappearing over time . "
poor water quality the problem did not end with the closing of the mines .
now , the strip mines that are left need to be flooded with fresh river water .
otherwise , the groundwater that would gather there would be extremely sulfurous and contaminated with toxins .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic culture along the spree in order to prepare part of the spree forest to survive without receiving water from lusatia , environmental planners are trying to soften the blow .
there are a few options .
first , planners may decide to flood the strip mines for a longer period of time .
this would buy them time to deal with the changing situation - but it would postpone the development of tourism in the region .
another alternative would be to dry up of some of the spree 's small branch rivers , or fliesse , and use that water to flood the strip mines .
and a final possibility would be to bring water from the nearby oder river into the spree-havel area .
but the consequences such an action would have on all of the waterways must be researched in greater depth .
no one knows just yet what the best alternative is .
but one thing appears certain : a part of the spree forest is destined to disappear . dagmar röhrlich -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de emissions threaten european plants a new study on the effects of global warming shows more than half of european plant species are at risk , especially mediterranean and alpine plants .

" but the heavy investment on the thai side led to many of those top doctors coming back . " thai doctors tough competition thai doctors are tough competition for their german colleagues who are beginning to feel the pinch .
german doctors and dentists are highly sceptical about growing overseas health tourism .
they question the monitoring of medical standards .
they ask whether sophisticated treatments actually delivered , whether quality materials are used in complicated dental surgery and so on . also , doctors overseas are not able to deal with long-term patient preparation before operations and prophylactic care , specialists argue .
botched surgery is hard to rectify .
and who will be responsible for the often sensitive rehabilitation process , they wonder . the mutual trust between a patient and a doctor plays a vital role in the recovery process , german doctors say .
health tourism , they argue , can not provide that atmosphere of trust . petra reichelt dismisses such criticism and says that her hospital has a consistent focus on the quality of service provided and patient satisfaction .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.05.2005 czech president wants old eu back großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foresees a glowing future without the eu constitution anyone looking for euroskeptics in the czech republic need n't look far .
czech president vaclav klaus opposes the eu constitution , and hardly a day goes by in which he does n't remind his countrymen and women of the fact . vaclav klaus , 63 , an economist , prides himself on his title of professor .
one may also refer to him as mr. president , since he has held the position for over two years .
but what he does n't like is being called a euroskeptic . " some people are constantly using labels : euro-optimists , euro-pessimists or euroskeptics , " klaus told deutsche welle . " please do not do this .
those of us who are concerned with the future of europe and what is happening on this continent , we reject being labeled as euroskeptics , because we are actually optimists .
we are making a maximum effort to ensure that things turn out well for this continent and for all of us . " the royal we ? vaclav klaus likes saying " we " instead of " i , " though who he means is not always entirely clear .
but what is clear is that he likes speaking for the czech people . after all , other european countries seem to repeatedly equate the views of the czech republic as a whole with the personal opinion of vaclav klaus , although polls show that 51 percent of czech people are in favor of the eu constitution . for his part , the conservative has never made a secret of his fundamental rejection of the eu constitution .
he opposes the political integration of europe and has a different view of europe , more like the european community of the 1960s and 70s . as far as klaus is concerned , the eu charter is undemocratic and part of a socialist , anti-liberal mechanism that reduces the sovereignty of individual states , particularly of smaller countries .
but all this , klaus insists , is merely his own opinion .
as president of the czech republic he is required to remain neutral . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech president 's office is located in prague castle , overlooking the city vaclav klaus 's critics call him vain and arrogant , and they also accuse him of overstepping the boundaries of his position as president .
the czech president is meant to be little more than a figurehead .
nevertheless , klaus has been trying to do everything in his power to influence the public and convince voters to oppose the eu constitution .
" i do n't like it , " said a 34-year-old woman from prague .
" i do n't think that the president will be able to influence us .
we all have our own view of the issue .

czech president vaclav klaus opposes the eu constitution , and hardly a day goes by in which he does n't remind his countrymen and women of the fact . vaclav klaus , 63 , an economist , prides himself on his title of professor .
one may also refer to him as mr. president , since he has held the position for over two years .
but what he does n't like is being called a euroskeptic . " some people are constantly using labels : euro-optimists , euro-pessimists or euroskeptics , " klaus told deutsche welle . " please do not do this .
those of us who are concerned with the future of europe and what is happening on this continent , we reject being labeled as euroskeptics , because we are actually optimists .
we are making a maximum effort to ensure that things turn out well for this continent and for all of us . " the royal we ? vaclav klaus likes saying " we " instead of " i , " though who he means is not always entirely clear .
but what is clear is that he likes speaking for the czech people . after all , other european countries seem to repeatedly equate the views of the czech republic as a whole with the personal opinion of vaclav klaus , although polls show that 51 percent of czech people are in favor of the eu constitution . for his part , the conservative has never made a secret of his fundamental rejection of the eu constitution .
he opposes the political integration of europe and has a different view of europe , more like the european community of the 1960s and 70s . as far as klaus is concerned , the eu charter is undemocratic and part of a socialist , anti-liberal mechanism that reduces the sovereignty of individual states , particularly of smaller countries .
but all this , klaus insists , is merely his own opinion .
as president of the czech republic he is required to remain neutral . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech president 's office is located in prague castle , overlooking the city vaclav klaus 's critics call him vain and arrogant , and they also accuse him of overstepping the boundaries of his position as president .
the czech president is meant to be little more than a figurehead .
nevertheless , klaus has been trying to do everything in his power to influence the public and convince voters to oppose the eu constitution .
" i do n't like it , " said a 34-year-old woman from prague .
" i do n't think that the president will be able to influence us .
we all have our own view of the issue .
when he says that we will lose our sovereignty , it 's just a joke .
the president has always had strange things to say . " unlikely partners indeed , klaus is backed in his opposition to the eu charter by conservative civic democratic party -lrb- ods -rrb- , which he led for 11 years .
on the other side of the political spectrum , the country 's communists also reject the eu constitution . both parties are influential in the czech republic : the ods is the czech party with the highest approval rating - 30 percent - and the communists follow in second place .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.05.2005 france votes down eu constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the answer is " no " after a large voter turnout , france has overwhelmingly said " non " to the proposed eu constitution .
projections released immediately after polls closed show between 54.5 and 55.6 percent voted against the document . it was not much of a surprise , since surveys for several weeks have shown the " no " camp to be in the lead .
despite an urgent , last-minute appeal from president jacques chirac , a majority of french voters were not convinced that the proposed constitution , which was designed to simplify decision making after the eu 's enlargement last year , was in their best interests . the sharp defeat for the charter , which has been dreaded by eu leaders , could weaken france , one of the central pillars of the european union .
supporters have said a defeat could stall european integration and unsettle some financial markets . " the decision of france inevitably creates a difficult context for defending our interests in europe , " chirac said in an address broadcast on national television . bildunterschrift : but cheers went up from supporters of the " no " campaign when the exit polls results were announced just after voting ended at 2200 central european time .
those who rejected the treaty included communists , various left-wing groups , dissident socialists and far-right parties . with the french rejection , the eu constitution in its current form has been dealt a potentially fatal blow and the future path of the european bloc is unclear .
the charter needed the ratification of all 25 eu states to go into effect .
france was the tenth country to decide about the document .
previously , nine eu member states had given their approval . the question now is whether the ratification process will continue in the remaining eu states that have not yet voted .
french foreign minister michel barnier said the vote was a " real disappointment , " but added that other eu countries should go ahead with their own votes regardless . setback for president the results are a blow to french president jacques chirac , who had campaigned hard for the charter 's passage , including broadcasting a last-minute appeal on french television just days before sunday 's vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vote was seen by many to be as much about the popularity of chirac and his government as about the future course of the eu .
the bitter debate divided france and became a debate on france 's overall malaise and fears that low-wage new member countries in eastern europe could be dangerous to france 's economic health . french far-right leader jean-marie le pen and eurosceptic philippe de villiers urged chirac to step down on sunday .
previously , chirac had said he would not quit after the vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac leaves the polling station after casting his vote in sarran , southwestern france sunday may 29 , 2005 in a referendum on the eu constitution .
however , after the results came in , chirac said he would make a decision on the future of his center-right government " in the coming days " after french voters overwhelmingly rejected the eu constitution .
it 's largely expected he will dismiss unpopular prime minister jean-pierre raffarin . not dead yet the head of the european socialist party poul nyrup rasmussen lamented sunday france 's rejection of the eu constitution , saying it was a " sad day " for europe but insisting that the charter was not dead . " this is a sad , sad day for france and a sad day for europe too , " he said in a statement after exit polls indicated that some 55 percent of french voters rejected the constitution . " but rumors of the constitution 's demise have been greatly exaggerated , " he added .
" we must not read the ' non ' in france as a ' non ' to europe .
this is not the last word on the european constitution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and he added : " the french people wished to reject a tired and unpopular government that has failed to represent the concerns of ordinary people in france . " the dutch are scheduled to vote on the charter on wednesday .
dutch ministers urged their citizens to ignore the result in france . what now ? if the constitution does not survive , the eu will continue to operate under its current rules , which were laid out in the treaty of nice .
but the system is seen as largely unworkable with a union of 25 countries , since voting could soon become paralyzed . opponents want the eu to redraft a proposed constitution and improve it , putting in safeguards against labor from new member states dragging on wages and adding protections for europe 's social market economy . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dossier : france and the eu 's future dw-world looks back at france and its fraught relationship with the proposed eu constitution .

-lrb- may 29 , 2005 -rrb- franco-german ties after a french " non " if french voters do indeed reject the draft eu constitution in sunday 's referendum , the european union will likely be catapulted into a crisis and franco-german relations may suffer serious damage .

projections released immediately after polls closed show between 54.5 and 55.6 percent voted against the document . it was not much of a surprise , since surveys for several weeks have shown the " no " camp to be in the lead .
despite an urgent , last-minute appeal from president jacques chirac , a majority of french voters were not convinced that the proposed constitution , which was designed to simplify decision making after the eu 's enlargement last year , was in their best interests . the sharp defeat for the charter , which has been dreaded by eu leaders , could weaken france , one of the central pillars of the european union .

those who rejected the treaty included communists , various left-wing groups , dissident socialists and far-right parties . with the french rejection , the eu constitution in its current form has been dealt a potentially fatal blow and the future path of the european bloc is unclear .
the charter needed the ratification of all 25 eu states to go into effect .
france was the tenth country to decide about the document .
previously , nine eu member states had given their approval . the question now is whether the ratification process will continue in the remaining eu states that have not yet voted .
french foreign minister michel barnier said the vote was a " real disappointment , " but added that other eu countries should go ahead with their own votes regardless . setback for president the results are a blow to french president jacques chirac , who had campaigned hard for the charter 's passage , including broadcasting a last-minute appeal on french television just days before sunday 's vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vote was seen by many to be as much about the popularity of chirac and his government as about the future course of the eu .
the bitter debate divided france and became a debate on france 's overall malaise and fears that low-wage new member countries in eastern europe could be dangerous to france 's economic health . french far-right leader jean-marie le pen and eurosceptic philippe de villiers urged chirac to step down on sunday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 29.05.2005 interview : klinsmann cool under pressure großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann in conversation with dw-world head guido baumhauer jürgen klinsmann took the reigns of germany 's national soccer team almost a year ago .
dw-world spoke with him about next year 's world cup as well as about his team 's success and german soccer 's image abroad . dw : year one of the klinsmann era is almost behind us .
from nine games the national team has played with you at the helm , they 've only lost one , to south korea .
how would you take stock of the team 's performance thus far ? jürgen klinsmann : i think our record is a very , very positive one , above all , because we have grown together as a team , and not just as a new coaching staff .
we complement each other very well .
we 've brought people on board who have brought enormous talents with them .
for example , i 'm thinking of areas like overall fitness , and the fact that we have been able to bring over coaches for that from the us .
there 's also our sports psychologist , who we have integrated into the team ... … and the red jerseys ? … the jerseys , they look really good , but they are n't going to be scoring any goals for us .
i think that the way the team has performed in the last ten months , with style and pizzazz , and all the enthusiasm they 've shown in every game , it 's simply fantastic .
it is incredibly fun to work with this team .
there 's a lot of potential there , and that gives us the confidence to say during the world cup here at home : we want to play for the title ! before the world cup , the confederations cup is taking place , from june 15 - 29 .
eight teams are playing for the trophy , among them germany and top teams such as brazil and argentina .
who do you think will win ? naturally , i hope we do !
and logically , if one says one wants to win the world cup title here in germany , then for the confederations cup , which is often called a test , miniature world cup , we have the same goal . so for you , the confederations cup is a real test run ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann it is a test run for us .
every single game will give us more information about the team 's performance standard .
there is also a bit of ambition involved .
when a team participates in a contest like this , you not only measure yourself against very good teams from around the world , you also want to beat countries like argentina or brazil .
even if the season was a very long one for the players , that provides enough incentive for all of us to really get out there and give it our all . and if the plan does n't work out like you want with the world cup ?
do you feel under pressure ? yes , but that 's normal in soccer .
if you carry the responsibility and things do n't go well , you get into hot water .
that would surely be the case if we do n't perform well , but if i were to think along those lines , i would n't be the right man for this job .
i have taken on this position with a lot of optimism .
if it does n't go as planned , then the avalanche is going to come , like it or not .
but that would happen with anyone . if it came down to playing a beautiful game or winning , which would you choose ? both !
both are important .
of course , we want to play an attractive game of soccer .
i think we 've shown in the last ten months that we have laid a good foundation for that , that we have a team that can play up front , fast and aggressively .
it 's a style of playing that will bear fruit for us .
we have also pursued a new philosophy in which the players identify themselves with their role in the national team .
it 's important that a certain self-image is anchored in the minds of our players that when it comes to the national team , they give it all they 've got ! can germany itself benefit from this kind of positive attitude you 're describing ?
what would a world cup victory mean for germany ?
how important is a good performance by the german team ? i think the team demonstrated how that can help already this year in the european cup .
whether it was in the game here in berlin against brazil , where the fans showed incredible enthusiasm , or the game in iran in front of 120,000 spectators , where the team was able to bring the iranian population over to its side . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann kicking the ball around at the opening of the street soccer festival in berlin we want to build on this positive attitude and we want our players to be aware of the fact that in a way , they act as ambassadors for germany , since we will be observed very closely by the entire world during the upcoming world cup .
everything is going to be reported about , whether it 's about the national team , the cities , or the people who live in germany .
we want to put forward a fantastic image and show people that germany has developed in an incredibly positive way , naturally also after reunification . you yourself live abroad .
how would you describe the image of german soccer outside of this country ? i think that in general , there 's a great respect for german soccer abroad , something which of course has been stamped by our three world championship titles and three european championship titles .
people know that when it comes to tournaments , the german team is always able to concentrate on the essentials .
we know that our opponents have a lot of respect for us .
as far as our domestic teams go , the situation this year has n't been all that positive , since they fell out of the running for the european cup relatively early .
we lost a little bit of our standing there , but we can win that back very quickly . how much has been lost due to the referee scandal ? the referee affair has certainly cost us in the eyes of the world , since most people could n't imagine that such a thing could happen in germany .
we stand for other kinds of values , such as straightforwardness , honesty and a serious business mentality .
the scandal hurt us , no doubt about it , but on the other hand , people abroad have been very impressed with the way the german football federation handled the affair and how consistent they have been in their actions , such as finding those who are guilty and making them pay the consequences . the interview was conducted by guido baumhauer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de referee scandal rears its ugly head in april , german soccer officials quietly put the referee scandal involving robert hoyzer to rest .

but researchers say the pristine region is in danger , blaming changes in climate and industry . the spree river runs through the immense spreewald biosphere reserve southeast of berlin .
it starts in the lusatia region , near poland , and is known for its traditional irrigation system consisting of 1,300 kilometers -lrb- 800 miles -rrb- of small channels and waterways .
alder forests and wetlands alternate with sandy pine forests , grasslands and fields in a landscape that seems to have been little affected by the forces of modernity .
the spree runs into the havel , which becomes a feeder for the elbe , eastern germany 's major waterway .
while much of western germany has been soaked with seemingly endless spring rains this year , folks in the elbe valley have seen less precipitation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pear tree in spreewald given that europe is facing climate change due to global warming , this trend is likely to continue in the coming decades , said bernd hansjürgens of the leipzig-halle environmental research institute .
over the past 50 years , median temperatures in europe have risen by as much as 1.5 degrees celsius -lrb- 34.7 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , he said .
" we in the elbe catchment area find ourselves in a relatively dry area within central europe , " he said .
" this lack of rain is becoming more and more noticeable , " he said .
culprit : brown coal to make matters worse , climate change is only part of the story .
the structural changes in what was once a brown coal region also play a large part .
bildunterschrift : spreewald scenery when the brown coal mines were working , between 1950 and 1990 , it took six tons of water to unearth every ton of brown coal .
that means that during that time , gallons upon gallons of water were taken from lusatia and pumped into the spree .
without this infusion , the water level in the spree 's aquifer would sink to somewhere between one-fifth and one-tenth of what it has been for the past 50 years .
" that has consequences for the spree forest , for this valuable biotope , and it has consequences also for berlin , " hansjürgens said .
" there is really now a danger that the water table will recede if less water is pumped in from the brown coal regions .
and that would lead to part of the spree forest disappearing over time . "
poor water quality the problem did not end with the closing of the mines .
now , the strip mines that are left need to be flooded with fresh river water .
otherwise , the groundwater that would gather there would be extremely sulfurous and contaminated with toxins .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic culture along the spree in order to prepare part of the spree forest to survive without receiving water from lusatia , environmental planners are trying to soften the blow .
there are a few options .
first , planners may decide to flood the strip mines for a longer period of time .
this would buy them time to deal with the changing situation - but it would postpone the development of tourism in the region .
another alternative would be to dry up of some of the spree 's small branch rivers , or fliesse , and use that water to flood the strip mines .
and a final possibility would be to bring water from the nearby oder river into the spree-havel area .
but the consequences such an action would have on all of the waterways must be researched in greater depth .
no one knows just yet what the best alternative is .
but one thing appears certain : a part of the spree forest is destined to disappear . dagmar röhrlich -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de emissions threaten european plants a new study on the effects of global warming shows more than half of european plant species are at risk , especially mediterranean and alpine plants .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.05.2005 czech president wants old eu back großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foresees a glowing future without the eu constitution anyone looking for euroskeptics in the czech republic need n't look far .
czech president vaclav klaus opposes the eu constitution , and hardly a day goes by in which he does n't remind his countrymen and women of the fact . vaclav klaus , 63 , an economist , prides himself on his title of professor .
one may also refer to him as mr. president , since he has held the position for over two years .
but what he does n't like is being called a euroskeptic . " some people are constantly using labels : euro-optimists , euro-pessimists or euroskeptics , " klaus told deutsche welle . " please do not do this .
those of us who are concerned with the future of europe and what is happening on this continent , we reject being labeled as euroskeptics , because we are actually optimists .
we are making a maximum effort to ensure that things turn out well for this continent and for all of us . " the royal we ? vaclav klaus likes saying " we " instead of " i , " though who he means is not always entirely clear .
but what is clear is that he likes speaking for the czech people . after all , other european countries seem to repeatedly equate the views of the czech republic as a whole with the personal opinion of vaclav klaus , although polls show that 51 percent of czech people are in favor of the eu constitution . for his part , the conservative has never made a secret of his fundamental rejection of the eu constitution .
he opposes the political integration of europe and has a different view of europe , more like the european community of the 1960s and 70s . as far as klaus is concerned , the eu charter is undemocratic and part of a socialist , anti-liberal mechanism that reduces the sovereignty of individual states , particularly of smaller countries .
but all this , klaus insists , is merely his own opinion .
as president of the czech republic he is required to remain neutral . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech president 's office is located in prague castle , overlooking the city vaclav klaus 's critics call him vain and arrogant , and they also accuse him of overstepping the boundaries of his position as president .
the czech president is meant to be little more than a figurehead .
nevertheless , klaus has been trying to do everything in his power to influence the public and convince voters to oppose the eu constitution .
" i do n't like it , " said a 34-year-old woman from prague .
" i do n't think that the president will be able to influence us .
we all have our own view of the issue .
when he says that we will lose our sovereignty , it 's just a joke .
the president has always had strange things to say . " unlikely partners indeed , klaus is backed in his opposition to the eu charter by conservative civic democratic party -lrb- ods -rrb- , which he led for 11 years .
on the other side of the political spectrum , the country 's communists also reject the eu constitution . both parties are influential in the czech republic : the ods is the czech party with the highest approval rating - 30 percent - and the communists follow in second place .
though public cooperation between the two parties is unthinkable , both want the czechs to reject the eu constitution , whether in a national referendum or a " no " vote in parliament . " i predict a glowing future if the constitution does not get ratified , " klaus said .
" i think that such documents are the last thing that the eu and its people need in order to lead happy and successful lives .

dw-world spoke with him about next year 's world cup as well as about his team 's success and german soccer 's image abroad . dw : year one of the klinsmann era is almost behind us .
from nine games the national team has played with you at the helm , they 've only lost one , to south korea .
how would you take stock of the team 's performance thus far ? jürgen klinsmann : i think our record is a very , very positive one , above all , because we have grown together as a team , and not just as a new coaching staff .
we complement each other very well .
we 've brought people on board who have brought enormous talents with them .
for example , i 'm thinking of areas like overall fitness , and the fact that we have been able to bring over coaches for that from the us .
there 's also our sports psychologist , who we have integrated into the team ... … and the red jerseys ? … the jerseys , they look really good , but they are n't going to be scoring any goals for us .
i think that the way the team has performed in the last ten months , with style and pizzazz , and all the enthusiasm they 've shown in every game , it 's simply fantastic .
it is incredibly fun to work with this team .
there 's a lot of potential there , and that gives us the confidence to say during the world cup here at home : we want to play for the title ! before the world cup , the confederations cup is taking place , from june 15 - 29 .
eight teams are playing for the trophy , among them germany and top teams such as brazil and argentina .
who do you think will win ? naturally , i hope we do !
and logically , if one says one wants to win the world cup title here in germany , then for the confederations cup , which is often called a test , miniature world cup , we have the same goal . so for you , the confederations cup is a real test run ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann it is a test run for us .
every single game will give us more information about the team 's performance standard .
there is also a bit of ambition involved .
when a team participates in a contest like this , you not only measure yourself against very good teams from around the world , you also want to beat countries like argentina or brazil .
even if the season was a very long one for the players , that provides enough incentive for all of us to really get out there and give it our all . and if the plan does n't work out like you want with the world cup ?
do you feel under pressure ? yes , but that 's normal in soccer .
if you carry the responsibility and things do n't go well , you get into hot water .
that would surely be the case if we do n't perform well , but if i were to think along those lines , i would n't be the right man for this job .
i have taken on this position with a lot of optimism .
if it does n't go as planned , then the avalanche is going to come , like it or not .
but that would happen with anyone . if it came down to playing a beautiful game or winning , which would you choose ? both !
both are important .
of course , we want to play an attractive game of soccer .
i think we 've shown in the last ten months that we have laid a good foundation for that , that we have a team that can play up front , fast and aggressively .
it 's a style of playing that will bear fruit for us .
we have also pursued a new philosophy in which the players identify themselves with their role in the national team .
it 's important that a certain self-image is anchored in the minds of our players that when it comes to the national team , they give it all they 've got ! can germany itself benefit from this kind of positive attitude you 're describing ?
what would a world cup victory mean for germany ?
how important is a good performance by the german team ? i think the team demonstrated how that can help already this year in the european cup .
whether it was in the game here in berlin against brazil , where the fans showed incredible enthusiasm , or the game in iran in front of 120,000 spectators , where the team was able to bring the iranian population over to its side . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann kicking the ball around at the opening of the street soccer festival in berlin we want to build on this positive attitude and we want our players to be aware of the fact that in a way , they act as ambassadors for germany , since we will be observed very closely by the entire world during the upcoming world cup .
everything is going to be reported about , whether it 's about the national team , the cities , or the people who live in germany .
we want to put forward a fantastic image and show people that germany has developed in an incredibly positive way , naturally also after reunification . you yourself live abroad .
how would you describe the image of german soccer outside of this country ? i think that in general , there 's a great respect for german soccer abroad , something which of course has been stamped by our three world championship titles and three european championship titles .
people know that when it comes to tournaments , the german team is always able to concentrate on the essentials .
we know that our opponents have a lot of respect for us .
as far as our domestic teams go , the situation this year has n't been all that positive , since they fell out of the running for the european cup relatively early .
we lost a little bit of our standing there , but we can win that back very quickly . how much has been lost due to the referee scandal ? the referee affair has certainly cost us in the eyes of the world , since most people could n't imagine that such a thing could happen in germany .
we stand for other kinds of values , such as straightforwardness , honesty and a serious business mentality .
the scandal hurt us , no doubt about it , but on the other hand , people abroad have been very impressed with the way the german football federation handled the affair and how consistent they have been in their actions , such as finding those who are guilty and making them pay the consequences . the interview was conducted by guido baumhauer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de referee scandal rears its ugly head in april , german soccer officials quietly put the referee scandal involving robert hoyzer to rest .

dw-world spoke with him about next year 's world cup as well as about his team 's success and german soccer 's image abroad . dw : year one of the klinsmann era is almost behind us .
from nine games the national team has played with you at the helm , they 've only lost one , to south korea .
how would you take stock of the team 's performance thus far ? jürgen klinsmann : i think our record is a very , very positive one , above all , because we have grown together as a team , and not just as a new coaching staff .
we complement each other very well .
we 've brought people on board who have brought enormous talents with them .
for example , i 'm thinking of areas like overall fitness , and the fact that we have been able to bring over coaches for that from the us .
there 's also our sports psychologist , who we have integrated into the team ... … and the red jerseys ? … the jerseys , they look really good , but they are n't going to be scoring any goals for us .
i think that the way the team has performed in the last ten months , with style and pizzazz , and all the enthusiasm they 've shown in every game , it 's simply fantastic .
it is incredibly fun to work with this team .
there 's a lot of potential there , and that gives us the confidence to say during the world cup here at home : we want to play for the title ! before the world cup , the confederations cup is taking place , from june 15 - 29 .
eight teams are playing for the trophy , among them germany and top teams such as brazil and argentina .
who do you think will win ? naturally , i hope we do !
and logically , if one says one wants to win the world cup title here in germany , then for the confederations cup , which is often called a test , miniature world cup , we have the same goal . so for you , the confederations cup is a real test run ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann it is a test run for us .
every single game will give us more information about the team 's performance standard .
there is also a bit of ambition involved .
when a team participates in a contest like this , you not only measure yourself against very good teams from around the world , you also want to beat countries like argentina or brazil .
even if the season was a very long one for the players , that provides enough incentive for all of us to really get out there and give it our all . and if the plan does n't work out like you want with the world cup ?
do you feel under pressure ? yes , but that 's normal in soccer .
if you carry the responsibility and things do n't go well , you get into hot water .
that would surely be the case if we do n't perform well , but if i were to think along those lines , i would n't be the right man for this job .
i have taken on this position with a lot of optimism .
if it does n't go as planned , then the avalanche is going to come , like it or not .
but that would happen with anyone . if it came down to playing a beautiful game or winning , which would you choose ? both !
both are important .
of course , we want to play an attractive game of soccer .
i think we 've shown in the last ten months that we have laid a good foundation for that , that we have a team that can play up front , fast and aggressively .
it 's a style of playing that will bear fruit for us .
we have also pursued a new philosophy in which the players identify themselves with their role in the national team .
it 's important that a certain self-image is anchored in the minds of our players that when it comes to the national team , they give it all they 've got ! can germany itself benefit from this kind of positive attitude you 're describing ?
what would a world cup victory mean for germany ?
how important is a good performance by the german team ? i think the team demonstrated how that can help already this year in the european cup .
whether it was in the game here in berlin against brazil , where the fans showed incredible enthusiasm , or the game in iran in front of 120,000 spectators , where the team was able to bring the iranian population over to its side . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann kicking the ball around at the opening of the street soccer festival in berlin we want to build on this positive attitude and we want our players to be aware of the fact that in a way , they act as ambassadors for germany , since we will be observed very closely by the entire world during the upcoming world cup .
everything is going to be reported about , whether it 's about the national team , the cities , or the people who live in germany .
we want to put forward a fantastic image and show people that germany has developed in an incredibly positive way , naturally also after reunification . you yourself live abroad .
how would you describe the image of german soccer outside of this country ? i think that in general , there 's a great respect for german soccer abroad , something which of course has been stamped by our three world championship titles and three european championship titles .
people know that when it comes to tournaments , the german team is always able to concentrate on the essentials .
we know that our opponents have a lot of respect for us .
as far as our domestic teams go , the situation this year has n't been all that positive , since they fell out of the running for the european cup relatively early .
we lost a little bit of our standing there , but we can win that back very quickly . how much has been lost due to the referee scandal ? the referee affair has certainly cost us in the eyes of the world , since most people could n't imagine that such a thing could happen in germany .
we stand for other kinds of values , such as straightforwardness , honesty and a serious business mentality .
the scandal hurt us , no doubt about it , but on the other hand , people abroad have been very impressed with the way the german football federation handled the affair and how consistent they have been in their actions , such as finding those who are guilty and making them pay the consequences . the interview was conducted by guido baumhauer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de referee scandal rears its ugly head in april , german soccer officials quietly put the referee scandal involving robert hoyzer to rest .
but manipulation accusations have risen again , this time involving another ref .

what would a world cup victory mean for germany ?
how important is a good performance by the german team ? i think the team demonstrated how that can help already this year in the european cup .
whether it was in the game here in berlin against brazil , where the fans showed incredible enthusiasm , or the game in iran in front of 120,000 spectators , where the team was able to bring the iranian population over to its side . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann kicking the ball around at the opening of the street soccer festival in berlin we want to build on this positive attitude and we want our players to be aware of the fact that in a way , they act as ambassadors for germany , since we will be observed very closely by the entire world during the upcoming world cup .
everything is going to be reported about , whether it 's about the national team , the cities , or the people who live in germany .
we want to put forward a fantastic image and show people that germany has developed in an incredibly positive way , naturally also after reunification . you yourself live abroad .
how would you describe the image of german soccer outside of this country ? i think that in general , there 's a great respect for german soccer abroad , something which of course has been stamped by our three world championship titles and three european championship titles .
people know that when it comes to tournaments , the german team is always able to concentrate on the essentials .
we know that our opponents have a lot of respect for us .
as far as our domestic teams go , the situation this year has n't been all that positive , since they fell out of the running for the european cup relatively early .
we lost a little bit of our standing there , but we can win that back very quickly . how much has been lost due to the referee scandal ? the referee affair has certainly cost us in the eyes of the world , since most people could n't imagine that such a thing could happen in germany .
we stand for other kinds of values , such as straightforwardness , honesty and a serious business mentality .
the scandal hurt us , no doubt about it , but on the other hand , people abroad have been very impressed with the way the german football federation handled the affair and how consistent they have been in their actions , such as finding those who are guilty and making them pay the consequences . the interview was conducted by guido baumhauer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de referee scandal rears its ugly head in april , german soccer officials quietly put the referee scandal involving robert hoyzer to rest .
but manipulation accusations have risen again , this time involving another ref .

but these days , with a network of 12 network hospitals and more than 5,000 in-patient beds throughout thailand , bangkok hospital now sees itself as " the world 's premier medical hub " for foreign tourists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aftermath of a disaster attracting patients to paradise is the name of the game these days .
and due to germany 's current reform of the state health-system , germans are increasingly confronted with high costs for medical treatment at home .
the great uncertainty about further cuts has led to an unprecedented boom in health tourism as patients seek deals on the internet . and they are there to be had .
cosmetic breast enlargement in germany costs an average of 5,000 euros .
bangkok offers the same operation for 4,535 euros - but that 's including a return flight and one week worth of hotel accommodation in a luxury 5-star hotel . " i got dental implants in bangkok last summer , " said one satisfied customer .
" i had a face lift in cape town in the winter .
and i saved a lot of money .
it was fun and i feel fine and i had a holiday . " beaches and medical treatment health- and wellness-travel is the booming sector in tourism .
already , 20 percent of all cosmetic surgery is booked along with a stylish holiday .
and south east asia is well positioned in the expanding market .
from robotic cardiac surgery to cancer care , from gastro-intestinal surgery or hiv treatment , hospitals in india , korea , singapore and thailand often offer their medical services at a quarter of german prices .
and so far , no complaints have been registered in germany , according to petra reichelt . " do n't fear , the hospitals are great , " she said .
" the service is better .
the facilities are great , the technology is highly advanced . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as good as in the us or germany , hospital officials say indeed , medical care , technology and hygiene largely are on a level with us hospitals .
while ordinary patients share double or triple rooms in german hospitals , south east asian private institutions offer only luxury single rooms .
in many parts of south east asia , medicine provides good financial opportunities .
investments in modern technology and luxury institutions are paying off , said bangkok hospital 's marketing manager ralf krewer .
almost all of the 500 doctors working at south east asia 's largest private hospital group are thai . " in the past , the majority of thai doctors went to the us , germany , australia or japan to practice and further their academic education , " he said .
" but the heavy investment on the thai side led to many of those top doctors coming back . " thai doctors tough competition thai doctors are tough competition for their german colleagues who are beginning to feel the pinch .
german doctors and dentists are highly sceptical about growing overseas health tourism .
they question the monitoring of medical standards .
they ask whether sophisticated treatments actually delivered , whether quality materials are used in complicated dental surgery and so on . also , doctors overseas are not able to deal with long-term patient preparation before operations and prophylactic care , specialists argue .
botched surgery is hard to rectify .
and who will be responsible for the often sensitive rehabilitation process , they wonder . the mutual trust between a patient and a doctor plays a vital role in the recovery process , german doctors say .
health tourism , they argue , can not provide that atmosphere of trust . petra reichelt dismisses such criticism and says that her hospital has a consistent focus on the quality of service provided and patient satisfaction .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.05.2005 france votes down eu constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the answer is " no " after a large voter turnout , france has overwhelmingly said " non " to the proposed eu constitution .
projections released immediately after polls closed show between 54.5 and 55.6 percent voted against the document . it was not much of a surprise , since surveys for several weeks have shown the " no " camp to be in the lead .
despite an urgent , last-minute appeal from president jacques chirac , a majority of french voters were not convinced that the proposed constitution , which was designed to simplify decision making after the eu 's enlargement last year , was in their best interests . the sharp defeat for the charter , which has been dreaded by eu leaders , could weaken france , one of the central pillars of the european union .
supporters have said a defeat could stall european integration and unsettle some financial markets . " the decision of france inevitably creates a difficult context for defending our interests in europe , " chirac said in an address broadcast on national television . bildunterschrift : but cheers went up from supporters of the " no " campaign when the exit polls results were announced just after voting ended at 2200 central european time .
those who rejected the treaty included communists , various left-wing groups , dissident socialists and far-right parties . with the french rejection , the eu constitution in its current form has been dealt a potentially fatal blow and the future path of the european bloc is unclear .
the charter needed the ratification of all 25 eu states to go into effect .
france was the tenth country to decide about the document .
previously , nine eu member states had given their approval . the question now is whether the ratification process will continue in the remaining eu states that have not yet voted .
french foreign minister michel barnier said the vote was a " real disappointment , " but added that other eu countries should go ahead with their own votes regardless . setback for president the results are a blow to french president jacques chirac , who had campaigned hard for the charter 's passage , including broadcasting a last-minute appeal on french television just days before sunday 's vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vote was seen by many to be as much about the popularity of chirac and his government as about the future course of the eu .
the bitter debate divided france and became a debate on france 's overall malaise and fears that low-wage new member countries in eastern europe could be dangerous to france 's economic health . french far-right leader jean-marie le pen and eurosceptic philippe de villiers urged chirac to step down on sunday .
previously , chirac had said he would not quit after the vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac leaves the polling station after casting his vote in sarran , southwestern france sunday may 29 , 2005 in a referendum on the eu constitution .
however , after the results came in , chirac said he would make a decision on the future of his center-right government " in the coming days " after french voters overwhelmingly rejected the eu constitution .
it 's largely expected he will dismiss unpopular prime minister jean-pierre raffarin . not dead yet the head of the european socialist party poul nyrup rasmussen lamented sunday france 's rejection of the eu constitution , saying it was a " sad day " for europe but insisting that the charter was not dead . " this is a sad , sad day for france and a sad day for europe too , " he said in a statement after exit polls indicated that some 55 percent of french voters rejected the constitution . " but rumors of the constitution 's demise have been greatly exaggerated , " he added .
" we must not read the ' non ' in france as a ' non ' to europe .
this is not the last word on the european constitution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and he added : " the french people wished to reject a tired and unpopular government that has failed to represent the concerns of ordinary people in france . " the dutch are scheduled to vote on the charter on wednesday .
dutch ministers urged their citizens to ignore the result in france . what now ? if the constitution does not survive , the eu will continue to operate under its current rules , which were laid out in the treaty of nice .
but the system is seen as largely unworkable with a union of 25 countries , since voting could soon become paralyzed . opponents want the eu to redraft a proposed constitution and improve it , putting in safeguards against labor from new member states dragging on wages and adding protections for europe 's social market economy . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dossier : france and the eu 's future dw-world looks back at france and its fraught relationship with the proposed eu constitution .

projections released immediately after polls closed show between 54.5 and 55.6 percent voted against the document . it was not much of a surprise , since surveys for several weeks have shown the " no " camp to be in the lead .
despite an urgent , last-minute appeal from president jacques chirac , a majority of french voters were not convinced that the proposed constitution , which was designed to simplify decision making after the eu 's enlargement last year , was in their best interests . the sharp defeat for the charter , which has been dreaded by eu leaders , could weaken france , one of the central pillars of the european union .
supporters have said a defeat could stall european integration and unsettle some financial markets . " the decision of france inevitably creates a difficult context for defending our interests in europe , " chirac said in an address broadcast on national television . bildunterschrift : but cheers went up from supporters of the " no " campaign when the exit polls results were announced just after voting ended at 2200 central european time .
those who rejected the treaty included communists , various left-wing groups , dissident socialists and far-right parties . with the french rejection , the eu constitution in its current form has been dealt a potentially fatal blow and the future path of the european bloc is unclear .
the charter needed the ratification of all 25 eu states to go into effect .
france was the tenth country to decide about the document .
previously , nine eu member states had given their approval . the question now is whether the ratification process will continue in the remaining eu states that have not yet voted .
french foreign minister michel barnier said the vote was a " real disappointment , " but added that other eu countries should go ahead with their own votes regardless . setback for president the results are a blow to french president jacques chirac , who had campaigned hard for the charter 's passage , including broadcasting a last-minute appeal on french television just days before sunday 's vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vote was seen by many to be as much about the popularity of chirac and his government as about the future course of the eu .
the bitter debate divided france and became a debate on france 's overall malaise and fears that low-wage new member countries in eastern europe could be dangerous to france 's economic health . french far-right leader jean-marie le pen and eurosceptic philippe de villiers urged chirac to step down on sunday .
previously , chirac had said he would not quit after the vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac leaves the polling station after casting his vote in sarran , southwestern france sunday may 29 , 2005 in a referendum on the eu constitution .
however , after the results came in , chirac said he would make a decision on the future of his center-right government " in the coming days " after french voters overwhelmingly rejected the eu constitution .
it 's largely expected he will dismiss unpopular prime minister jean-pierre raffarin . not dead yet the head of the european socialist party poul nyrup rasmussen lamented sunday france 's rejection of the eu constitution , saying it was a " sad day " for europe but insisting that the charter was not dead . " this is a sad , sad day for france and a sad day for europe too , " he said in a statement after exit polls indicated that some 55 percent of french voters rejected the constitution . " but rumors of the constitution 's demise have been greatly exaggerated , " he added .
" we must not read the ' non ' in france as a ' non ' to europe .
this is not the last word on the european constitution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and he added : " the french people wished to reject a tired and unpopular government that has failed to represent the concerns of ordinary people in france .

dutch ministers urged their citizens to ignore the result in france . what now ? if the constitution does not survive , the eu will continue to operate under its current rules , which were laid out in the treaty of nice .
but the system is seen as largely unworkable with a union of 25 countries , since voting could soon become paralyzed . opponents want the eu to redraft a proposed constitution and improve it , putting in safeguards against labor from new member states dragging on wages and adding protections for europe 's social market economy . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dossier : france and the eu 's future dw-world looks back at france and its fraught relationship with the proposed eu constitution .

projections released immediately after polls closed show between 54.5 and 55.6 percent voted against the document . it was not much of a surprise , since surveys for several weeks have shown the " no " camp to be in the lead .
despite an urgent , last-minute appeal from president jacques chirac , a majority of french voters were not convinced that the proposed constitution , which was designed to simplify decision making after the eu 's enlargement last year , was in their best interests . the sharp defeat for the charter , which has been dreaded by eu leaders , could weaken france , one of the central pillars of the european union .
supporters have said a defeat could stall european integration and unsettle some financial markets . " the decision of france inevitably creates a difficult context for defending our interests in europe , " chirac said in an address broadcast on national television . bildunterschrift : but cheers went up from supporters of the " no " campaign when the exit polls results were announced just after voting ended at 2200 central european time .
those who rejected the treaty included communists , various left-wing groups , dissident socialists and far-right parties . with the french rejection , the eu constitution in its current form has been dealt a potentially fatal blow and the future path of the european bloc is unclear .
the charter needed the ratification of all 25 eu states to go into effect .
france was the tenth country to decide about the document .
previously , nine eu member states had given their approval . the question now is whether the ratification process will continue in the remaining eu states that have not yet voted .
french foreign minister michel barnier said the vote was a " real disappointment , " but added that other eu countries should go ahead with their own votes regardless . setback for president the results are a blow to french president jacques chirac , who had campaigned hard for the charter 's passage , including broadcasting a last-minute appeal on french television just days before sunday 's vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vote was seen by many to be as much about the popularity of chirac and his government as about the future course of the eu .
the bitter debate divided france and became a debate on france 's overall malaise and fears that low-wage new member countries in eastern europe could be dangerous to france 's economic health . french far-right leader jean-marie le pen and eurosceptic philippe de villiers urged chirac to step down on sunday .

it 's largely expected he will dismiss unpopular prime minister jean-pierre raffarin . not dead yet the head of the european socialist party poul nyrup rasmussen lamented sunday france 's rejection of the eu constitution , saying it was a " sad day " for europe but insisting that the charter was not dead . " this is a sad , sad day for france and a sad day for europe too , " he said in a statement after exit polls indicated that some 55 percent of french voters rejected the constitution . " but rumors of the constitution 's demise have been greatly exaggerated , " he added .

due to the time difference , the 1.4 million voters in france 's overseas territories went to the polls on saturday . when president jacques chirac , whose ruling center-right union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- is leading the " yes " campaign , called for a referendum on the eu text last year , treaty supporters had a comfortable lead in the opinion polls . " no " camp has an edge now , the " no " camp - capitalizing on the increasing unpopularity of the government - seems to have the edge , and the 72-year-old french leader is counting on the country 's undecided voters to turn the tables . chirac 's ump is campaigning alongside its junior partner in government , the union for french democracy -lrb- udf -rrb- , as well as the opposition socialist party -lrb- ps -rrb- and the greens - a coalition of france 's mainstream political elite . they are facing a disparate " no " camp made up of the far-right national front of jean-marie le pen , the communist and trotskyist parties , nationalist euroskeptics and the former socialist prime minister laurent fabius . pollsters say that pro-european socialist party supporters - tempted to follow fabius and vote " no " but fearful of the consequences - will be the key , along with voter turnout . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac before addressing a french television program on sunday 's referendum on the eu constitution at the elysee palace in paris , thursday may 26 , 2005 .
a come-from-behind victory for the " yes " camp would bolster chirac , allow eu officials in brussels to breathe a sign of relief and keep the eu treaty on track ahead of a consultative referendum in the netherlands on wednesday . a string of european leaders travelled to france to make the case for the constitution including german chancellor gerhard schroeder and spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero , insisting there is no " plan b " . the french president , who has staked his prestige on approval of the treaty , has warned voters that a french " no " would diminish the country 's influence in europe , indeed making it the " black sheep " of the continent . what rejection would mean rejection of the treaty would have a profound political impact in france , tarnishing chirac 's record in the history books , prompting a government reshuffle and deepening the rift in the socialist party . no matter what the outcome on sunday , chirac is expected to dismiss his unpopular prime minister jean-pierre raffarin , with interior minister dominique de villepin and defense minister michele alliot-marie his possible successors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy should france reject the treaty , chirac - who celebrated his 10th year as president earlier this month - would be unlikely to seek a third term in office in 2007 , opening the door to his arch-rival , ump leader nicolas sarkozy -lrb- photo -rrb- . chirac has however ruled out his resignation should the " no " camp prevail . the constitution must be ratified by all 25 member states .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 29.05.2005 interview : klinsmann cool under pressure großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann in conversation with dw-world head guido baumhauer jürgen klinsmann took the reigns of germany 's national soccer team almost a year ago .
dw-world spoke with him about next year 's world cup as well as about his team 's success and german soccer 's image abroad . dw : year one of the klinsmann era is almost behind us .
from nine games the national team has played with you at the helm , they 've only lost one , to south korea .
how would you take stock of the team 's performance thus far ? jürgen klinsmann : i think our record is a very , very positive one , above all , because we have grown together as a team , and not just as a new coaching staff .
we complement each other very well .
we 've brought people on board who have brought enormous talents with them .
for example , i 'm thinking of areas like overall fitness , and the fact that we have been able to bring over coaches for that from the us .
there 's also our sports psychologist , who we have integrated into the team ... … and the red jerseys ? … the jerseys , they look really good , but they are n't going to be scoring any goals for us .
i think that the way the team has performed in the last ten months , with style and pizzazz , and all the enthusiasm they 've shown in every game , it 's simply fantastic .
it is incredibly fun to work with this team .
there 's a lot of potential there , and that gives us the confidence to say during the world cup here at home : we want to play for the title ! before the world cup , the confederations cup is taking place , from june 15 - 29 .
eight teams are playing for the trophy , among them germany and top teams such as brazil and argentina .
who do you think will win ? naturally , i hope we do !
and logically , if one says one wants to win the world cup title here in germany , then for the confederations cup , which is often called a test , miniature world cup , we have the same goal . so for you , the confederations cup is a real test run ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann it is a test run for us .
every single game will give us more information about the team 's performance standard .
there is also a bit of ambition involved .
when a team participates in a contest like this , you not only measure yourself against very good teams from around the world , you also want to beat countries like argentina or brazil .
even if the season was a very long one for the players , that provides enough incentive for all of us to really get out there and give it our all . and if the plan does n't work out like you want with the world cup ?
do you feel under pressure ? yes , but that 's normal in soccer .
if you carry the responsibility and things do n't go well , you get into hot water .
that would surely be the case if we do n't perform well , but if i were to think along those lines , i would n't be the right man for this job .
i have taken on this position with a lot of optimism .
if it does n't go as planned , then the avalanche is going to come , like it or not .
but that would happen with anyone . if it came down to playing a beautiful game or winning , which would you choose ? both !
both are important .
of course , we want to play an attractive game of soccer .
i think we 've shown in the last ten months that we have laid a good foundation for that , that we have a team that can play up front , fast and aggressively .
it 's a style of playing that will bear fruit for us .
we have also pursued a new philosophy in which the players identify themselves with their role in the national team .
it 's important that a certain self-image is anchored in the minds of our players that when it comes to the national team , they give it all they 've got ! can germany itself benefit from this kind of positive attitude you 're describing ?
what would a world cup victory mean for germany ?
how important is a good performance by the german team ? i think the team demonstrated how that can help already this year in the european cup .
whether it was in the game here in berlin against brazil , where the fans showed incredible enthusiasm , or the game in iran in front of 120,000 spectators , where the team was able to bring the iranian population over to its side . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann kicking the ball around at the opening of the street soccer festival in berlin we want to build on this positive attitude and we want our players to be aware of the fact that in a way , they act as ambassadors for germany , since we will be observed very closely by the entire world during the upcoming world cup .
everything is going to be reported about , whether it 's about the national team , the cities , or the people who live in germany .
we want to put forward a fantastic image and show people that germany has developed in an incredibly positive way , naturally also after reunification . you yourself live abroad .
how would you describe the image of german soccer outside of this country ? i think that in general , there 's a great respect for german soccer abroad , something which of course has been stamped by our three world championship titles and three european championship titles .
people know that when it comes to tournaments , the german team is always able to concentrate on the essentials .
we know that our opponents have a lot of respect for us .

dw-world spoke with him about next year 's world cup as well as about his team 's success and german soccer 's image abroad . dw : year one of the klinsmann era is almost behind us .
from nine games the national team has played with you at the helm , they 've only lost one , to south korea .
how would you take stock of the team 's performance thus far ? jürgen klinsmann : i think our record is a very , very positive one , above all , because we have grown together as a team , and not just as a new coaching staff .
we complement each other very well .
we 've brought people on board who have brought enormous talents with them .
for example , i 'm thinking of areas like overall fitness , and the fact that we have been able to bring over coaches for that from the us .
there 's also our sports psychologist , who we have integrated into the team ... … and the red jerseys ? … the jerseys , they look really good , but they are n't going to be scoring any goals for us .
i think that the way the team has performed in the last ten months , with style and pizzazz , and all the enthusiasm they 've shown in every game , it 's simply fantastic .
it is incredibly fun to work with this team .
there 's a lot of potential there , and that gives us the confidence to say during the world cup here at home : we want to play for the title ! before the world cup , the confederations cup is taking place , from june 15 - 29 .
eight teams are playing for the trophy , among them germany and top teams such as brazil and argentina .
who do you think will win ? naturally , i hope we do !
and logically , if one says one wants to win the world cup title here in germany , then for the confederations cup , which is often called a test , miniature world cup , we have the same goal . so for you , the confederations cup is a real test run ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann it is a test run for us .
every single game will give us more information about the team 's performance standard .
there is also a bit of ambition involved .
when a team participates in a contest like this , you not only measure yourself against very good teams from around the world , you also want to beat countries like argentina or brazil .
even if the season was a very long one for the players , that provides enough incentive for all of us to really get out there and give it our all . and if the plan does n't work out like you want with the world cup ?
do you feel under pressure ? yes , but that 's normal in soccer .
if you carry the responsibility and things do n't go well , you get into hot water .
that would surely be the case if we do n't perform well , but if i were to think along those lines , i would n't be the right man for this job .

czech president vaclav klaus opposes the eu constitution , and hardly a day goes by in which he does n't remind his countrymen and women of the fact . vaclav klaus , 63 , an economist , prides himself on his title of professor .
one may also refer to him as mr. president , since he has held the position for over two years .
but what he does n't like is being called a euroskeptic . " some people are constantly using labels : euro-optimists , euro-pessimists or euroskeptics , " klaus told deutsche welle . " please do not do this .
those of us who are concerned with the future of europe and what is happening on this continent , we reject being labeled as euroskeptics , because we are actually optimists .
we are making a maximum effort to ensure that things turn out well for this continent and for all of us . " the royal we ? vaclav klaus likes saying " we " instead of " i , " though who he means is not always entirely clear .
but what is clear is that he likes speaking for the czech people . after all , other european countries seem to repeatedly equate the views of the czech republic as a whole with the personal opinion of vaclav klaus , although polls show that 51 percent of czech people are in favor of the eu constitution . for his part , the conservative has never made a secret of his fundamental rejection of the eu constitution .
he opposes the political integration of europe and has a different view of europe , more like the european community of the 1960s and 70s . as far as klaus is concerned , the eu charter is undemocratic and part of a socialist , anti-liberal mechanism that reduces the sovereignty of individual states , particularly of smaller countries .
but all this , klaus insists , is merely his own opinion .
as president of the czech republic he is required to remain neutral . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech president 's office is located in prague castle , overlooking the city vaclav klaus 's critics call him vain and arrogant , and they also accuse him of overstepping the boundaries of his position as president .

" i do n't think that the president will be able to influence us .

on the other side of the political spectrum , the country 's communists also reject the eu constitution . both parties are influential in the czech republic : the ods is the czech party with the highest approval rating - 30 percent - and the communists follow in second place .
though public cooperation between the two parties is unthinkable , both want the czechs to reject the eu constitution , whether in a national referendum or a " no " vote in parliament . " i predict a glowing future if the constitution does not get ratified , " klaus said .

czech president vaclav klaus opposes the eu constitution , and hardly a day goes by in which he does n't remind his countrymen and women of the fact . vaclav klaus , 63 , an economist , prides himself on his title of professor .
one may also refer to him as mr. president , since he has held the position for over two years .
but what he does n't like is being called a euroskeptic . " some people are constantly using labels : euro-optimists , euro-pessimists or euroskeptics , " klaus told deutsche welle . " please do not do this .
those of us who are concerned with the future of europe and what is happening on this continent , we reject being labeled as euroskeptics , because we are actually optimists .
we are making a maximum effort to ensure that things turn out well for this continent and for all of us . " the royal we ? vaclav klaus likes saying " we " instead of " i , " though who he means is not always entirely clear .
but what is clear is that he likes speaking for the czech people . after all , other european countries seem to repeatedly equate the views of the czech republic as a whole with the personal opinion of vaclav klaus , although polls show that 51 percent of czech people are in favor of the eu constitution . for his part , the conservative has never made a secret of his fundamental rejection of the eu constitution .
he opposes the political integration of europe and has a different view of europe , more like the european community of the 1960s and 70s . as far as klaus is concerned , the eu charter is undemocratic and part of a socialist , anti-liberal mechanism that reduces the sovereignty of individual states , particularly of smaller countries .
but all this , klaus insists , is merely his own opinion .
as president of the czech republic he is required to remain neutral . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech president 's office is located in prague castle , overlooking the city vaclav klaus 's critics call him vain and arrogant , and they also accuse him of overstepping the boundaries of his position as president .
the czech president is meant to be little more than a figurehead .
nevertheless , klaus has been trying to do everything in his power to influence the public and convince voters to oppose the eu constitution .
" i do n't like it , " said a 34-year-old woman from prague .
" i do n't think that the president will be able to influence us .
we all have our own view of the issue .
when he says that we will lose our sovereignty , it 's just a joke .
the president has always had strange things to say . " unlikely partners indeed , klaus is backed in his opposition to the eu charter by conservative civic democratic party -lrb- ods -rrb- , which he led for 11 years .
on the other side of the political spectrum , the country 's communists also reject the eu constitution . both parties are influential in the czech republic : the ods is the czech party with the highest approval rating - 30 percent - and the communists follow in second place .

but researchers say the pristine region is in danger , blaming changes in climate and industry . the spree river runs through the immense spreewald biosphere reserve southeast of berlin .
it starts in the lusatia region , near poland , and is known for its traditional irrigation system consisting of 1,300 kilometers -lrb- 800 miles -rrb- of small channels and waterways .
alder forests and wetlands alternate with sandy pine forests , grasslands and fields in a landscape that seems to have been little affected by the forces of modernity .
the spree runs into the havel , which becomes a feeder for the elbe , eastern germany 's major waterway .
while much of western germany has been soaked with seemingly endless spring rains this year , folks in the elbe valley have seen less precipitation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pear tree in spreewald given that europe is facing climate change due to global warming , this trend is likely to continue in the coming decades , said bernd hansjürgens of the leipzig-halle environmental research institute .
over the past 50 years , median temperatures in europe have risen by as much as 1.5 degrees celsius -lrb- 34.7 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , he said .
" we in the elbe catchment area find ourselves in a relatively dry area within central europe , " he said .
" this lack of rain is becoming more and more noticeable , " he said .
culprit : brown coal to make matters worse , climate change is only part of the story .
the structural changes in what was once a brown coal region also play a large part .
bildunterschrift : spreewald scenery when the brown coal mines were working , between 1950 and 1990 , it took six tons of water to unearth every ton of brown coal .
that means that during that time , gallons upon gallons of water were taken from lusatia and pumped into the spree .
without this infusion , the water level in the spree 's aquifer would sink to somewhere between one-fifth and one-tenth of what it has been for the past 50 years .
" that has consequences for the spree forest , for this valuable biotope , and it has consequences also for berlin , " hansjürgens said .
" there is really now a danger that the water table will recede if less water is pumped in from the brown coal regions .
and that would lead to part of the spree forest disappearing over time . "
poor water quality the problem did not end with the closing of the mines .
now , the strip mines that are left need to be flooded with fresh river water .
otherwise , the groundwater that would gather there would be extremely sulfurous and contaminated with toxins .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic culture along the spree in order to prepare part of the spree forest to survive without receiving water from lusatia , environmental planners are trying to soften the blow .
there are a few options .
first , planners may decide to flood the strip mines for a longer period of time .
this would buy them time to deal with the changing situation - but it would postpone the development of tourism in the region .
another alternative would be to dry up of some of the spree 's small branch rivers , or fliesse , and use that water to flood the strip mines .
and a final possibility would be to bring water from the nearby oder river into the spree-havel area .
but the consequences such an action would have on all of the waterways must be researched in greater depth .
no one knows just yet what the best alternative is .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pear tree in spreewald given that europe is facing climate change due to global warming , this trend is likely to continue in the coming decades , said bernd hansjürgens of the leipzig-halle environmental research institute .
over the past 50 years , median temperatures in europe have risen by as much as 1.5 degrees celsius -lrb- 34.7 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , he said .
" we in the elbe catchment area find ourselves in a relatively dry area within central europe , " he said .
" this lack of rain is becoming more and more noticeable , " he said .
culprit : brown coal to make matters worse , climate change is only part of the story .
the structural changes in what was once a brown coal region also play a large part .
bildunterschrift : spreewald scenery when the brown coal mines were working , between 1950 and 1990 , it took six tons of water to unearth every ton of brown coal .
that means that during that time , gallons upon gallons of water were taken from lusatia and pumped into the spree .
without this infusion , the water level in the spree 's aquifer would sink to somewhere between one-fifth and one-tenth of what it has been for the past 50 years .
" that has consequences for the spree forest , for this valuable biotope , and it has consequences also for berlin , " hansjürgens said .
" there is really now a danger that the water table will recede if less water is pumped in from the brown coal regions .
and that would lead to part of the spree forest disappearing over time . "
poor water quality the problem did not end with the closing of the mines .
now , the strip mines that are left need to be flooded with fresh river water .
otherwise , the groundwater that would gather there would be extremely sulfurous and contaminated with toxins .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic culture along the spree in order to prepare part of the spree forest to survive without receiving water from lusatia , environmental planners are trying to soften the blow .
there are a few options .
first , planners may decide to flood the strip mines for a longer period of time .
this would buy them time to deal with the changing situation - but it would postpone the development of tourism in the region .
another alternative would be to dry up of some of the spree 's small branch rivers , or fliesse , and use that water to flood the strip mines .
and a final possibility would be to bring water from the nearby oder river into the spree-havel area .
but the consequences such an action would have on all of the waterways must be researched in greater depth .
no one knows just yet what the best alternative is .
but one thing appears certain : a part of the spree forest is destined to disappear . dagmar röhrlich -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de emissions threaten european plants a new study on the effects of global warming shows more than half of european plant species are at risk , especially mediterranean and alpine plants .

czech president vaclav klaus opposes the eu constitution , and hardly a day goes by in which he does n't remind his countrymen and women of the fact . vaclav klaus , 63 , an economist , prides himself on his title of professor .
one may also refer to him as mr. president , since he has held the position for over two years .
but what he does n't like is being called a euroskeptic . " some people are constantly using labels : euro-optimists , euro-pessimists or euroskeptics , " klaus told deutsche welle . " please do not do this .
those of us who are concerned with the future of europe and what is happening on this continent , we reject being labeled as euroskeptics , because we are actually optimists .
we are making a maximum effort to ensure that things turn out well for this continent and for all of us . " the royal we ? vaclav klaus likes saying " we " instead of " i , " though who he means is not always entirely clear .
but what is clear is that he likes speaking for the czech people . after all , other european countries seem to repeatedly equate the views of the czech republic as a whole with the personal opinion of vaclav klaus , although polls show that 51 percent of czech people are in favor of the eu constitution . for his part , the conservative has never made a secret of his fundamental rejection of the eu constitution .
he opposes the political integration of europe and has a different view of europe , more like the european community of the 1960s and 70s . as far as klaus is concerned , the eu charter is undemocratic and part of a socialist , anti-liberal mechanism that reduces the sovereignty of individual states , particularly of smaller countries .
but all this , klaus insists , is merely his own opinion .
as president of the czech republic he is required to remain neutral . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech president 's office is located in prague castle , overlooking the city vaclav klaus 's critics call him vain and arrogant , and they also accuse him of overstepping the boundaries of his position as president .
the czech president is meant to be little more than a figurehead .
nevertheless , klaus has been trying to do everything in his power to influence the public and convince voters to oppose the eu constitution .
" i do n't like it , " said a 34-year-old woman from prague .
" i do n't think that the president will be able to influence us .
we all have our own view of the issue .
when he says that we will lose our sovereignty , it 's just a joke .
the president has always had strange things to say . " unlikely partners indeed , klaus is backed in his opposition to the eu charter by conservative civic democratic party -lrb- ods -rrb- , which he led for 11 years .
on the other side of the political spectrum , the country 's communists also reject the eu constitution . both parties are influential in the czech republic : the ods is the czech party with the highest approval rating - 30 percent - and the communists follow in second place .
though public cooperation between the two parties is unthinkable , both want the czechs to reject the eu constitution , whether in a national referendum or a " no " vote in parliament . " i predict a glowing future if the constitution does not get ratified , " klaus said .

but researchers say the pristine region is in danger , blaming changes in climate and industry . the spree river runs through the immense spreewald biosphere reserve southeast of berlin .
it starts in the lusatia region , near poland , and is known for its traditional irrigation system consisting of 1,300 kilometers -lrb- 800 miles -rrb- of small channels and waterways .
alder forests and wetlands alternate with sandy pine forests , grasslands and fields in a landscape that seems to have been little affected by the forces of modernity .
the spree runs into the havel , which becomes a feeder for the elbe , eastern germany 's major waterway .
while much of western germany has been soaked with seemingly endless spring rains this year , folks in the elbe valley have seen less precipitation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pear tree in spreewald given that europe is facing climate change due to global warming , this trend is likely to continue in the coming decades , said bernd hansjürgens of the leipzig-halle environmental research institute .
over the past 50 years , median temperatures in europe have risen by as much as 1.5 degrees celsius -lrb- 34.7 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , he said .
" we in the elbe catchment area find ourselves in a relatively dry area within central europe , " he said .
" this lack of rain is becoming more and more noticeable , " he said .
culprit : brown coal to make matters worse , climate change is only part of the story .
the structural changes in what was once a brown coal region also play a large part .
bildunterschrift : spreewald scenery when the brown coal mines were working , between 1950 and 1990 , it took six tons of water to unearth every ton of brown coal .
that means that during that time , gallons upon gallons of water were taken from lusatia and pumped into the spree .
without this infusion , the water level in the spree 's aquifer would sink to somewhere between one-fifth and one-tenth of what it has been for the past 50 years .
" that has consequences for the spree forest , for this valuable biotope , and it has consequences also for berlin , " hansjürgens said .
" there is really now a danger that the water table will recede if less water is pumped in from the brown coal regions .
and that would lead to part of the spree forest disappearing over time . "
poor water quality the problem did not end with the closing of the mines .
now , the strip mines that are left need to be flooded with fresh river water .
otherwise , the groundwater that would gather there would be extremely sulfurous and contaminated with toxins .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic culture along the spree in order to prepare part of the spree forest to survive without receiving water from lusatia , environmental planners are trying to soften the blow .
there are a few options .
first , planners may decide to flood the strip mines for a longer period of time .
this would buy them time to deal with the changing situation - but it would postpone the development of tourism in the region .
another alternative would be to dry up of some of the spree 's small branch rivers , or fliesse , and use that water to flood the strip mines .
and a final possibility would be to bring water from the nearby oder river into the spree-havel area .
but the consequences such an action would have on all of the waterways must be researched in greater depth .
no one knows just yet what the best alternative is .
but one thing appears certain : a part of the spree forest is destined to disappear . dagmar röhrlich -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : emissions threaten european plants a new study on the effects of global warming shows more than half of european plant species are at risk , especially mediterranean and alpine plants .

only i love flowers and this would be an item to cherish and remember my favourite programme .

a master class if ever there was !

sorry to see the end of a very good program .
chris burke , uk forget all the others , how about giles brandreth for leader of the tory party ?

is this one of the bbc 's " cuts " or has he just had enough , i do hope we shall seem him now and again .
however if david is retiring may i wish him a long and happy one .

becky barrett , united kingdom i have been an extremely keen follower of frost 's breakfast programme , and i fear losing it , especially as there are very few people able to even consider replacing him .
i would like to meet him , but will settle for finding out about how to win a cushion or chair .

stephen strange , england i would like to take issue with comments made in general about spelling .
not being brought up in a privileged society , i was branded to be thick because i was unable to spell correctly .
it is in fact due to the fact that i am dyslectic but this was not known until 5 years after leaving school .
some of the greatest people that have walked on this earth have had the same difficulties as myself .
comments made on the programme just endorses the ignorance that people have in understand disability and in turn fuels the constant embracement that people like myself face every day .
i sure that your guests have never made any spell errors !
chris caswell , uk the comments by your paper reviewers about spelling , really annoyed me this morning , some of us including my children and myself suffer with developmental dyspraxia , which because of the individuals high intelligence levels does not warrant statement by the education system because it leads to problems with short term memory and spelling and writing .
perhaps the programme should or the bbc should look at this hidden educational issue and not be so condemning of poor spelling !
william membery , uk i was very interested to hear michael portillo 's rather shallow comments about the miners ' strike - after all , if he thought that they believed in what they were doing and were fully informed , he might have to re-consider his own political opinion - and find himself lacking .

i asked what id i would need to bring with me , only to be told , none .
what sort of problems can we expect from this sort of attitude , when anybody could pretend that they are me and use my vote .
sarah shuker , england i am listening to tony blair and what a shock , i thought this country was taken to war because of wmd .
now this morning the pm says that the reason was regime change .

tony blair has lied over and over again .
fiaz hussain , england hello sir david , mr blair , seated comfortably on your sofa , has just declared that we should now forget about what 's past and decide which leadership we trust with the economy and education etc .
which planet is he hoping to lead ?
we all need to trust a leadership who will protect and respect our children 's lives .
if he had known that two of his own children would be in the frontline in iraq would he have been so keen to take us into war ?

former labour leader lord kinnock david frost : well john major got out the soap box , fought a tenacious campaign and to the surprise of some and the relief of others was returned to downing street .
but how totally different would the political landscape be today if the pollsters had been right .
it 's a very good morning to john major in norwich who was with us on our first programme too .
good morning john .
john major : good morning david .
david frost : and it 's a very warm welcome to neil kinnock here in the studio .
starting with you neil , that 1992 election - people say that it was a poisoned chalice to win that election because the erm was coming up and so on , or the end of the erm was coming up .
do you think ...
i mean obviously it was n't a good thing at the time for you .
but do you think it benefited labour not to be in power because of the erm and so on ?
neil kinnock : no i do n't think it did actually .
i do n't think there 's any form of defeat which is good news , especially after all those years and especially when so many people in the labour party have put so much effort in trying to win .
so we could have and would have dealt with the situation of the erm which was not entirely confidence making of course .
but that would have required radical action literally within days of being elected and for various ... reasons john did n't take that action .
i understand why he did n't but we would have taken it ...
david frost : and in terms of the last factor , the few votes that it would have needed and so on , the votes that just evaporated as it were .
do you think in fact that we saw a bit of the sheffield experience there and is that , was that actually important at the time or is that just hindsight ?
was the shadow budget more important ?
neil kinnock : in the order of things the shadow budget and the way in which it was pretty wrongly misrepresented , particularly in the press , was significant .
so far as the sheffield rally is concerned it did n't even register in any of the opinion poll returns or any other analysis , until after the election when a certain mythology developed , that attributed to the rally some kind of political significance .
but because of the time of the evening and because of the absence of coverage in the subsequent days , it made virtually no difference at all .
the only difference it makes is to scar my memory !
three seconds that i would not repeat had i had another chance .
david frost : well let 's turn to john down the line there in norwich .
john , people have said it to you i know , that it would have been better for the conservatives to have lost that election because then you would n't have had the erm and those things .
both parties were told that this was a poisoned chalice and so on .
but do you think it would have been better if the tories had n't won in 1992 ?
former prime minister sir john major john major : no , i do n't .
i entirely agree with neil .
nobody wishes to lose elections .
but i think some of the things that happened subsequently neil would have had different priorities .
but i think if we had n't been there we would n't have consolidated the 1980s market reforms .
i do n't think the destruction of inflation would have been quite so comprehensive , certainly not without the erm .
we may not have had the northern ireland peace process in the form we did .
we probably would n't have had the lottery which has revolutionised the arts and sport .
and some of the public sector reforms later adopted by the incoming labour government have now been copied around the world .
so one can never be certain what would have happened with an alternative government , but certainly those things did happen ' 92 to ' 97 , and i think there were all absolutely benevolent for the british economy .
david frost : but does the erm still , as neil said it was n't exactly ... the whole thing did n't go wrong because of this country - but i mean , with that erm situation is it still haunting the reputation of the conservatives , even to this day ?
john major : well , it 's still damaging because it has entered mythology .
in fact a series of things came together in the ten days before we were ejected from the erm which were probably unforeseeable and certainly impossible to change .
we had contemplated coming out but the real difficulty there was if we came out there was a real prospect that we 'd have a decline in the exchange rate and an increase in interest rates as well .
so actually coming out of it was an extremely difficult technical operation , we were beginning to consider it but i 'm afraid the crisis came upon us , partly as a result of the french referendum on maastricht before we were ready to come out .
so i think there was nothing much we could in reality have done about it .
david frost : what was the turning point in the last days , as i 've asked neil ?
was it the soapbox ?
john major : i do n't think so ...
david frost : the famous soapbox !
john major : i do n't think there was a single turning point .
i know people talk of the sheffield rally and i know they talk of the soapbox .
i think both those explanations are very heavily overdone .
the impression i had from the beginning of the campaign was that the opinion polls were wrong and that we always had a very good chance of winning .
now those were in the dear old days where prime ministers and leaders of the opposition actually met the public rather than their party audiences .
but it seemed to me right the way through the campaign that we probably had an edge .
i thought we probably would win .
i was n't absolutely certain that we would win but i thought it was probable .
so i do n't think that things did change in the last few days .
the opinion polls seemed to , but on the basis of what i saw in the campaign i did n't feel any particular change amongst the electorate .
david frost : and , i noticed then - i sensed out of the side of my eye there - that you nodded about when john major was talking about the polls .
neil kinnock : yes .
you mentioned earlier , you used the word evaporated about support for labour .
that did n't actually happen .
the support was never quite there and anybody with experience , john included , who 'd been on the streets fighting for most of our adult lives as it were , and both he and i and the people very close to us including i guess our wives , knew what the outcome was likely to be .
and the question then was , was the margin going to be very tight which it turned out to be , or slightly larger .
the most that we could have hoped for , i thought at all stages in the election , the most we could have hoped for was a hung parliament with labour as the biggest single party .
david frost : and , another point on that is that you had started the process of modernisation , laid the foundations for the new dawn - as you once put it - in that period and ...
neil kinnock : i never used the term " new dawn " .
david frost : new dawn .
neil kinnock : no , that 's for american thrillers and the current prime minister . -lrb- laughter and applause -rrb- david frost : and , you laid the foundations for what eventually became new labour , with the changes , the major changes that you did during that period .
in fact , i mean , i suppose the defeat hastened that process and made it easier for reform to go on ?
neil kinnock : it may have done .
i think that the labour party was incessantly getting instruction from defeat which is a very expensive course of education it has to be said .
and what people reasoned in the wake of the ' 92 defeat is the changes made have been gigantic , organisationally and in policy terms , plainly they had to be something more than one more heave .
and the changes , the alterations , the modernisation of the party had to become even more fundamental .
i very strongly advocated that and i 'm glad to see it came about .
david frost : what about today , just for one moment , let me ask you this first john .
we 're hearing obviously about the ... ca n't miss it ... about the french referendum today .
what would be the best outcome for britain , do you think , yes or no ?
john major : well i 've never been hostile to europe , but i think probably the best outcome for britain at the moment would be a " no " .
over the last few years the european union has been something of a juggernaut , and i fear it 's been concerned at naval gazing in so many ways that it has actually lost touch with the populations of europe .
and i think apart from the merits of the constitution , and that 's heavily misunderstood by many people , apart from the merits and the demerits of the constitution .
i think if it were defeated that the politicians and commission across europe would be forced to rethink their relationship with europe , rethink where they were going and why they were doing what they were doing .
and i think that would be a thoroughly good thing .
i do think europe has lost touch with people .
i wish to see the european union succeed .
at the moment i 'm not sure it is , i think a " no " would probably be the best for europe .
david frost : do you agree with that , as a distinguished servant of europe ?
neil kinnock : i do n't actually agree with it , for this simple reason and in a funny way for reasons similar to john 's desire for a " no " vote in france .
i want a " yes " vote in france and also in netherlands on wednesday .
i think both are unlikely frankly , i think there 's going to be a " no " .
and the reason that i want it is so that we can get on with the public information campaign that really only becomes evident , however much people try , when there 's some kind of specific focus on a decision .
now i did n't particularly want the referendum in the united kingdom because the treaty does n't change the way in which we are governed at all .
but since we were going to have one i really would like to get on with 9-12 months of real argument , but more important , proper public information so that people can make a decision on the basis of acquaintance with the facts and the real alternatives .
david frost : and one last - we 've been talking about political tactics and so on .
in terms of getting back to a wide ranging electorate , what would you like to see the tory party do john ?
john major : well i think at the moment they 're clearly concentrating on who should be the next leader .
but i think that is only part of what needs to be done .
for the first thing is self-evidently to elect the right person as leader .
the second thing is to make sure that everybody in the parliamentary party whether they were a candidate for the leadership or not , are prepared to follow and serve the new leader , and if necessary to serve him in the shadow cabinet .
i think all the candidates should be prepared to do that .
i think the other thing , there are two other things that are essential - firstly , plainly you can not win elections without winning the centre ground of politics .
you can be as right wing as you like or as left wing as you like .
but unless you attract to the centre ground you simply are not going to win the general election .
so plainly politics has to be geared to winning back the centre ground of politics .
and i ... there are a wide range of ways to do that .
we have a particularly attractive intake i think in 2005 , many of whom i know , many of whom i 've met on many occasions .
and i think it 's very attractive to see them there .
and we need to present a wide-ranging party and that means bringing all the talents of the conservative party into the shadow cabinet .
david frost : and do you think ken clarke could do it , or do you think that a younger leader in general is what what 's indicated ?
john major : well david , it 's very tempting , but i 'm not going to go into the question of personalities , and nor should you expect me to .
there was a time many years ago when i probably had to answer questions like that , but they 're long gone . -lrb- laughter -rrb- david frost : well , thank you both very much .
our thanks to john major in norwich and our thanks to neil kinnock here in the studio .

former labour leader lord kinnock david frost : well john major got out the soap box , fought a tenacious campaign and to the surprise of some and the relief of others was returned to downing street .
but how totally different would the political landscape be today if the pollsters had been right .
it 's a very good morning to john major in norwich who was with us on our first programme too .
good morning john .
john major : good morning david .
david frost : and it 's a very warm welcome to neil kinnock here in the studio .
starting with you neil , that 1992 election - people say that it was a poisoned chalice to win that election because the erm was coming up and so on , or the end of the erm was coming up .
do you think ...
i mean obviously it was n't a good thing at the time for you .
but do you think it benefited labour not to be in power because of the erm and so on ?
neil kinnock : no i do n't think it did actually .
i do n't think there 's any form of defeat which is good news , especially after all those years and especially when so many people in the labour party have put so much effort in trying to win .
so we could have and would have dealt with the situation of the erm which was not entirely confidence making of course .
but that would have required radical action literally within days of being elected and for various ... reasons john did n't take that action .
i understand why he did n't but we would have taken it ...
david frost : and in terms of the last factor , the few votes that it would have needed and so on , the votes that just evaporated as it were .
do you think in fact that we saw a bit of the sheffield experience there and is that , was that actually important at the time or is that just hindsight ?
was the shadow budget more important ?
neil kinnock : in the order of things the shadow budget and the way in which it was pretty wrongly misrepresented , particularly in the press , was significant .
so far as the sheffield rally is concerned it did n't even register in any of the opinion poll returns or any other analysis , until after the election when a certain mythology developed , that attributed to the rally some kind of political significance .
but because of the time of the evening and because of the absence of coverage in the subsequent days , it made virtually no difference at all .

over the last few years the european union has been something of a juggernaut , and i fear it 's been concerned at naval gazing in so many ways that it has actually lost touch with the populations of europe .
and i think apart from the merits of the constitution , and that 's heavily misunderstood by many people , apart from the merits and the demerits of the constitution .
i think if it were defeated that the politicians and commission across europe would be forced to rethink their relationship with europe , rethink where they were going and why they were doing what they were doing .
and i think that would be a thoroughly good thing .
i do think europe has lost touch with people .
i wish to see the european union succeed .
at the moment i 'm not sure it is , i think a " no " would probably be the best for europe .
david frost : do you agree with that , as a distinguished servant of europe ?
neil kinnock : i do n't actually agree with it , for this simple reason and in a funny way for reasons similar to john 's desire for a " no " vote in france .
i want a " yes " vote in france and also in netherlands on wednesday .
i think both are unlikely frankly , i think there 's going to be a " no " .
and the reason that i want it is so that we can get on with the public information campaign that really only becomes evident , however much people try , when there 's some kind of specific focus on a decision .
now i did n't particularly want the referendum in the united kingdom because the treaty does n't change the way in which we are governed at all .
but since we were going to have one i really would like to get on with 9-12 months of real argument , but more important , proper public information so that people can make a decision on the basis of acquaintance with the facts and the real alternatives .
david frost : and one last - we 've been talking about political tactics and so on .
in terms of getting back to a wide ranging electorate , what would you like to see the tory party do john ?
john major : well i think at the moment they 're clearly concentrating on who should be the next leader .
but i think that is only part of what needs to be done .
for the first thing is self-evidently to elect the right person as leader .
the second thing is to make sure that everybody in the parliamentary party whether they were a candidate for the leadership or not , are prepared to follow and serve the new leader , and if necessary to serve him in the shadow cabinet .
i think all the candidates should be prepared to do that .
i think the other thing , there are two other things that are essential - firstly , plainly you can not win elections without winning the centre ground of politics .
you can be as right wing as you like or as left wing as you like .
but unless you attract to the centre ground you simply are not going to win the general election .
so plainly politics has to be geared to winning back the centre ground of politics .
and i ... there are a wide range of ways to do that .
we have a particularly attractive intake i think in 2005 , many of whom i know , many of whom i 've met on many occasions .
and i think it 's very attractive to see them there .
and we need to present a wide-ranging party and that means bringing all the talents of the conservative party into the shadow cabinet .
david frost : and do you think ken clarke could do it , or do you think that a younger leader in general is what what 's indicated ?
john major : well david , it 's very tempting , but i 'm not going to go into the question of personalities , and nor should you expect me to .
there was a time many years ago when i probably had to answer questions like that , but they 're long gone . -lrb- laughter -rrb- david frost : well , thank you both very much .
our thanks to john major in norwich and our thanks to neil kinnock here in the studio .

former labour leader lord kinnock david frost : well john major got out the soap box , fought a tenacious campaign and to the surprise of some and the relief of others was returned to downing street .
but how totally different would the political landscape be today if the pollsters had been right .
it 's a very good morning to john major in norwich who was with us on our first programme too .
good morning john .
john major : good morning david .
david frost : and it 's a very warm welcome to neil kinnock here in the studio .
starting with you neil , that 1992 election - people say that it was a poisoned chalice to win that election because the erm was coming up and so on , or the end of the erm was coming up .
do you think ...
i mean obviously it was n't a good thing at the time for you .
but do you think it benefited labour not to be in power because of the erm and so on ?
neil kinnock : no i do n't think it did actually .
i do n't think there 's any form of defeat which is good news , especially after all those years and especially when so many people in the labour party have put so much effort in trying to win .
so we could have and would have dealt with the situation of the erm which was not entirely confidence making of course .
but that would have required radical action literally within days of being elected and for various ... reasons john did n't take that action .
i understand why he did n't but we would have taken it ...
david frost : and in terms of the last factor , the few votes that it would have needed and so on , the votes that just evaporated as it were .
do you think in fact that we saw a bit of the sheffield experience there and is that , was that actually important at the time or is that just hindsight ?
was the shadow budget more important ?
neil kinnock : in the order of things the shadow budget and the way in which it was pretty wrongly misrepresented , particularly in the press , was significant .
so far as the sheffield rally is concerned it did n't even register in any of the opinion poll returns or any other analysis , until after the election when a certain mythology developed , that attributed to the rally some kind of political significance .
but because of the time of the evening and because of the absence of coverage in the subsequent days , it made virtually no difference at all .
the only difference it makes is to scar my memory !
three seconds that i would not repeat had i had another chance .
david frost : well let 's turn to john down the line there in norwich .
john , people have said it to you i know , that it would have been better for the conservatives to have lost that election because then you would n't have had the erm and those things .
both parties were told that this was a poisoned chalice and so on .
but do you think it would have been better if the tories had n't won in 1992 ?
former prime minister sir john major john major : no , i do n't .
i entirely agree with neil .
nobody wishes to lose elections .
but i think some of the things that happened subsequently neil would have had different priorities .
but i think if we had n't been there we would n't have consolidated the 1980s market reforms .
i do n't think the destruction of inflation would have been quite so comprehensive , certainly not without the erm .
we may not have had the northern ireland peace process in the form we did .
we probably would n't have had the lottery which has revolutionised the arts and sport .
and some of the public sector reforms later adopted by the incoming labour government have now been copied around the world .
so one can never be certain what would have happened with an alternative government , but certainly those things did happen ' 92 to ' 97 , and i think there were all absolutely benevolent for the british economy .
david frost : but does the erm still , as neil said it was n't exactly ... the whole thing did n't go wrong because of this country - but i mean , with that erm situation is it still haunting the reputation of the conservatives , even to this day ?
john major : well , it 's still damaging because it has entered mythology .
in fact a series of things came together in the ten days before we were ejected from the erm which were probably unforeseeable and certainly impossible to change .
we had contemplated coming out but the real difficulty there was if we came out there was a real prospect that we 'd have a decline in the exchange rate and an increase in interest rates as well .
so actually coming out of it was an extremely difficult technical operation , we were beginning to consider it but i 'm afraid the crisis came upon us , partly as a result of the french referendum on maastricht before we were ready to come out .
so i think there was nothing much we could in reality have done about it .
david frost : what was the turning point in the last days , as i 've asked neil ?
was it the soapbox ?
john major : i do n't think so ...
david frost : the famous soapbox !
john major : i do n't think there was a single turning point .
i know people talk of the sheffield rally and i know they talk of the soapbox .
i think both those explanations are very heavily overdone .
the impression i had from the beginning of the campaign was that the opinion polls were wrong and that we always had a very good chance of winning .
now those were in the dear old days where prime ministers and leaders of the opposition actually met the public rather than their party audiences .
but it seemed to me right the way through the campaign that we probably had an edge .
i thought we probably would win .
i was n't absolutely certain that we would win but i thought it was probable .
so i do n't think that things did change in the last few days .
the opinion polls seemed to , but on the basis of what i saw in the campaign i did n't feel any particular change amongst the electorate .
david frost : and , i noticed then - i sensed out of the side of my eye there - that you nodded about when john major was talking about the polls .
neil kinnock : yes .
you mentioned earlier , you used the word evaporated about support for labour .
that did n't actually happen .
the support was never quite there and anybody with experience , john included , who 'd been on the streets fighting for most of our adult lives as it were , and both he and i and the people very close to us including i guess our wives , knew what the outcome was likely to be .
and the question then was , was the margin going to be very tight which it turned out to be , or slightly larger .
the most that we could have hoped for , i thought at all stages in the election , the most we could have hoped for was a hung parliament with labour as the biggest single party .
david frost : and , another point on that is that you had started the process of modernisation , laid the foundations for the new dawn - as you once put it - in that period and ...
neil kinnock : i never used the term " new dawn " .
david frost : new dawn .
neil kinnock : no , that 's for american thrillers and the current prime minister . -lrb- laughter and applause -rrb- david frost : and , you laid the foundations for what eventually became new labour , with the changes , the major changes that you did during that period .
in fact , i mean , i suppose the defeat hastened that process and made it easier for reform to go on ?
neil kinnock : it may have done .
i think that the labour party was incessantly getting instruction from defeat which is a very expensive course of education it has to be said .
and what people reasoned in the wake of the ' 92 defeat is the changes made have been gigantic , organisationally and in policy terms , plainly they had to be something more than one more heave .
and the changes , the alterations , the modernisation of the party had to become even more fundamental .
i very strongly advocated that and i 'm glad to see it came about .
david frost : what about today , just for one moment , let me ask you this first john .
we 're hearing obviously about the ... ca n't miss it ... about the french referendum today .
what would be the best outcome for britain , do you think , yes or no ?
john major : well i 've never been hostile to europe , but i think probably the best outcome for britain at the moment would be a " no " .
over the last few years the european union has been something of a juggernaut , and i fear it 's been concerned at naval gazing in so many ways that it has actually lost touch with the populations of europe .
and i think apart from the merits of the constitution , and that 's heavily misunderstood by many people , apart from the merits and the demerits of the constitution .
i think if it were defeated that the politicians and commission across europe would be forced to rethink their relationship with europe , rethink where they were going and why they were doing what they were doing .

david frost : and it 's a very warm welcome to neil kinnock here in the studio .
starting with you neil , that 1992 election - people say that it was a poisoned chalice to win that election because the erm was coming up and so on , or the end of the erm was coming up .
do you think ...
i mean obviously it was n't a good thing at the time for you .
but do you think it benefited labour not to be in power because of the erm and so on ?
neil kinnock : no i do n't think it did actually .
i do n't think there 's any form of defeat which is good news , especially after all those years and especially when so many people in the labour party have put so much effort in trying to win .
so we could have and would have dealt with the situation of the erm which was not entirely confidence making of course .
but that would have required radical action literally within days of being elected and for various ... reasons john did n't take that action .
i understand why he did n't but we would have taken it ...
david frost : and in terms of the last factor , the few votes that it would have needed and so on , the votes that just evaporated as it were .
do you think in fact that we saw a bit of the sheffield experience there and is that , was that actually important at the time or is that just hindsight ?
was the shadow budget more important ?
neil kinnock : in the order of things the shadow budget and the way in which it was pretty wrongly misrepresented , particularly in the press , was significant .
so far as the sheffield rally is concerned it did n't even register in any of the opinion poll returns or any other analysis , until after the election when a certain mythology developed , that attributed to the rally some kind of political significance .
but because of the time of the evening and because of the absence of coverage in the subsequent days , it made virtually no difference at all .
the only difference it makes is to scar my memory !
three seconds that i would not repeat had i had another chance .
david frost : well let 's turn to john down the line there in norwich .
john , people have said it to you i know , that it would have been better for the conservatives to have lost that election because then you would n't have had the erm and those things .
both parties were told that this was a poisoned chalice and so on .
but do you think it would have been better if the tories had n't won in 1992 ?
former prime minister sir john major john major : no , i do n't .
i entirely agree with neil .
nobody wishes to lose elections .
but i think some of the things that happened subsequently neil would have had different priorities .
but i think if we had n't been there we would n't have consolidated the 1980s market reforms .
i do n't think the destruction of inflation would have been quite so comprehensive , certainly not without the erm .
we may not have had the northern ireland peace process in the form we did .
we probably would n't have had the lottery which has revolutionised the arts and sport .
and some of the public sector reforms later adopted by the incoming labour government have now been copied around the world .
so one can never be certain what would have happened with an alternative government , but certainly those things did happen ' 92 to ' 97 , and i think there were all absolutely benevolent for the british economy .
david frost : but does the erm still , as neil said it was n't exactly ... the whole thing did n't go wrong because of this country - but i mean , with that erm situation is it still haunting the reputation of the conservatives , even to this day ?
john major : well , it 's still damaging because it has entered mythology .
in fact a series of things came together in the ten days before we were ejected from the erm which were probably unforeseeable and certainly impossible to change .
we had contemplated coming out but the real difficulty there was if we came out there was a real prospect that we 'd have a decline in the exchange rate and an increase in interest rates as well .
so actually coming out of it was an extremely difficult technical operation , we were beginning to consider it but i 'm afraid the crisis came upon us , partly as a result of the french referendum on maastricht before we were ready to come out .
so i think there was nothing much we could in reality have done about it .
david frost : what was the turning point in the last days , as i 've asked neil ?
was it the soapbox ?
john major : i do n't think so ...
david frost : the famous soapbox !
john major : i do n't think there was a single turning point .
i know people talk of the sheffield rally and i know they talk of the soapbox .
i think both those explanations are very heavily overdone .
the impression i had from the beginning of the campaign was that the opinion polls were wrong and that we always had a very good chance of winning .
now those were in the dear old days where prime ministers and leaders of the opposition actually met the public rather than their party audiences .
but it seemed to me right the way through the campaign that we probably had an edge .
i thought we probably would win .
i was n't absolutely certain that we would win but i thought it was probable .
so i do n't think that things did change in the last few days .
the opinion polls seemed to , but on the basis of what i saw in the campaign i did n't feel any particular change amongst the electorate .
david frost : and , i noticed then - i sensed out of the side of my eye there - that you nodded about when john major was talking about the polls .
neil kinnock : yes .
you mentioned earlier , you used the word evaporated about support for labour .
that did n't actually happen .
the support was never quite there and anybody with experience , john included , who 'd been on the streets fighting for most of our adult lives as it were , and both he and i and the people very close to us including i guess our wives , knew what the outcome was likely to be .
and the question then was , was the margin going to be very tight which it turned out to be , or slightly larger .
the most that we could have hoped for , i thought at all stages in the election , the most we could have hoped for was a hung parliament with labour as the biggest single party .
david frost : and , another point on that is that you had started the process of modernisation , laid the foundations for the new dawn - as you once put it - in that period and ...
neil kinnock : i never used the term " new dawn " .
david frost : new dawn .
neil kinnock : no , that 's for american thrillers and the current prime minister . -lrb- laughter and applause -rrb- david frost : and , you laid the foundations for what eventually became new labour , with the changes , the major changes that you did during that period .
in fact , i mean , i suppose the defeat hastened that process and made it easier for reform to go on ?
neil kinnock : it may have done .
i think that the labour party was incessantly getting instruction from defeat which is a very expensive course of education it has to be said .
and what people reasoned in the wake of the ' 92 defeat is the changes made have been gigantic , organisationally and in policy terms , plainly they had to be something more than one more heave .
and the changes , the alterations , the modernisation of the party had to become even more fundamental .
i very strongly advocated that and i 'm glad to see it came about .
david frost : what about today , just for one moment , let me ask you this first john .
we 're hearing obviously about the ... ca n't miss it ... about the french referendum today .
what would be the best outcome for britain , do you think , yes or no ?
john major : well i 've never been hostile to europe , but i think probably the best outcome for britain at the moment would be a " no " .
over the last few years the european union has been something of a juggernaut , and i fear it 's been concerned at naval gazing in so many ways that it has actually lost touch with the populations of europe .
and i think apart from the merits of the constitution , and that 's heavily misunderstood by many people , apart from the merits and the demerits of the constitution .
i think if it were defeated that the politicians and commission across europe would be forced to rethink their relationship with europe , rethink where they were going and why they were doing what they were doing .
and i think that would be a thoroughly good thing .
i do think europe has lost touch with people .
i wish to see the european union succeed .
at the moment i 'm not sure it is , i think a " no " would probably be the best for europe .
david frost : do you agree with that , as a distinguished servant of europe ?
neil kinnock : i do n't actually agree with it , for this simple reason and in a funny way for reasons similar to john 's desire for a " no " vote in france .
i want a " yes " vote in france and also in netherlands on wednesday .
i think both are unlikely frankly , i think there 's going to be a " no " .
and the reason that i want it is so that we can get on with the public information campaign that really only becomes evident , however much people try , when there 's some kind of specific focus on a decision .
now i did n't particularly want the referendum in the united kingdom because the treaty does n't change the way in which we are governed at all .
but since we were going to have one i really would like to get on with 9-12 months of real argument , but more important , proper public information so that people can make a decision on the basis of acquaintance with the facts and the real alternatives .
david frost : and one last - we 've been talking about political tactics and so on .
in terms of getting back to a wide ranging electorate , what would you like to see the tory party do john ?
john major : well i think at the moment they 're clearly concentrating on who should be the next leader .
but i think that is only part of what needs to be done .
for the first thing is self-evidently to elect the right person as leader .
the second thing is to make sure that everybody in the parliamentary party whether they were a candidate for the leadership or not , are prepared to follow and serve the new leader , and if necessary to serve him in the shadow cabinet .
i think all the candidates should be prepared to do that .
i think the other thing , there are two other things that are essential - firstly , plainly you can not win elections without winning the centre ground of politics .
you can be as right wing as you like or as left wing as you like .
but unless you attract to the centre ground you simply are not going to win the general election .
so plainly politics has to be geared to winning back the centre ground of politics .
and i ... there are a wide range of ways to do that .
we have a particularly attractive intake i think in 2005 , many of whom i know , many of whom i 've met on many occasions .
and i think it 's very attractive to see them there .
and we need to present a wide-ranging party and that means bringing all the talents of the conservative party into the shadow cabinet .
david frost : and do you think ken clarke could do it , or do you think that a younger leader in general is what what 's indicated ?
john major : well david , it 's very tempting , but i 'm not going to go into the question of personalities , and nor should you expect me to .
there was a time many years ago when i probably had to answer questions like that , but they 're long gone . -lrb- laughter -rrb- david frost : well , thank you both very much .
our thanks to john major in norwich and our thanks to neil kinnock here in the studio .

former labour leader lord kinnock david frost : well john major got out the soap box , fought a tenacious campaign and to the surprise of some and the relief of others was returned to downing street .

david frost : and , another point on that is that you had started the process of modernisation , laid the foundations for the new dawn - as you once put it - in that period and ...
neil kinnock : i never used the term " new dawn " .
david frost : new dawn .
neil kinnock : no , that 's for american thrillers and the current prime minister . -lrb- laughter and applause -rrb- david frost : and , you laid the foundations for what eventually became new labour , with the changes , the major changes that you did during that period .
in fact , i mean , i suppose the defeat hastened that process and made it easier for reform to go on ?
neil kinnock : it may have done .
i think that the labour party was incessantly getting instruction from defeat which is a very expensive course of education it has to be said .
and what people reasoned in the wake of the ' 92 defeat is the changes made have been gigantic , organisationally and in policy terms , plainly they had to be something more than one more heave .
and the changes , the alterations , the modernisation of the party had to become even more fundamental .
i very strongly advocated that and i 'm glad to see it came about .
david frost : what about today , just for one moment , let me ask you this first john .
we 're hearing obviously about the ... ca n't miss it ... about the french referendum today .
what would be the best outcome for britain , do you think , yes or no ?
john major : well i 've never been hostile to europe , but i think probably the best outcome for britain at the moment would be a " no " .
over the last few years the european union has been something of a juggernaut , and i fear it 's been concerned at naval gazing in so many ways that it has actually lost touch with the populations of europe .
and i think apart from the merits of the constitution , and that 's heavily misunderstood by many people , apart from the merits and the demerits of the constitution .
i think if it were defeated that the politicians and commission across europe would be forced to rethink their relationship with europe , rethink where they were going and why they were doing what they were doing .
and i think that would be a thoroughly good thing .
i do think europe has lost touch with people .
i wish to see the european union succeed .
at the moment i 'm not sure it is , i think a " no " would probably be the best for europe .
david frost : do you agree with that , as a distinguished servant of europe ?
neil kinnock : i do n't actually agree with it , for this simple reason and in a funny way for reasons similar to john 's desire for a " no " vote in france .
i want a " yes " vote in france and also in netherlands on wednesday .
i think both are unlikely frankly , i think there 's going to be a " no " .
and the reason that i want it is so that we can get on with the public information campaign that really only becomes evident , however much people try , when there 's some kind of specific focus on a decision .
now i did n't particularly want the referendum in the united kingdom because the treaty does n't change the way in which we are governed at all .
but since we were going to have one i really would like to get on with 9-12 months of real argument , but more important , proper public information so that people can make a decision on the basis of acquaintance with the facts and the real alternatives .
david frost : and one last - we 've been talking about political tactics and so on .
in terms of getting back to a wide ranging electorate , what would you like to see the tory party do john ?
john major : well i think at the moment they 're clearly concentrating on who should be the next leader .
but i think that is only part of what needs to be done .
for the first thing is self-evidently to elect the right person as leader .
the second thing is to make sure that everybody in the parliamentary party whether they were a candidate for the leadership or not , are prepared to follow and serve the new leader , and if necessary to serve him in the shadow cabinet .
i think all the candidates should be prepared to do that .
i think the other thing , there are two other things that are essential - firstly , plainly you can not win elections without winning the centre ground of politics .
you can be as right wing as you like or as left wing as you like .
but unless you attract to the centre ground you simply are not going to win the general election .
so plainly politics has to be geared to winning back the centre ground of politics .
and i ... there are a wide range of ways to do that .
we have a particularly attractive intake i think in 2005 , many of whom i know , many of whom i 've met on many occasions .
and i think it 's very attractive to see them there .
and we need to present a wide-ranging party and that means bringing all the talents of the conservative party into the shadow cabinet .
david frost : and do you think ken clarke could do it , or do you think that a younger leader in general is what what 's indicated ?
john major : well david , it 's very tempting , but i 'm not going to go into the question of personalities , and nor should you expect me to .
there was a time many years ago when i probably had to answer questions like that , but they 're long gone . -lrb- laughter -rrb- david frost : well , thank you both very much .
our thanks to john major in norwich and our thanks to neil kinnock here in the studio .

former labour leader lord kinnock david frost : well john major got out the soap box , fought a tenacious campaign and to the surprise of some and the relief of others was returned to downing street .
but how totally different would the political landscape be today if the pollsters had been right .
it 's a very good morning to john major in norwich who was with us on our first programme too .
good morning john .
john major : good morning david .
david frost : and it 's a very warm welcome to neil kinnock here in the studio .
starting with you neil , that 1992 election - people say that it was a poisoned chalice to win that election because the erm was coming up and so on , or the end of the erm was coming up .
do you think ...
i mean obviously it was n't a good thing at the time for you .
but do you think it benefited labour not to be in power because of the erm and so on ?
neil kinnock : no i do n't think it did actually .
i do n't think there 's any form of defeat which is good news , especially after all those years and especially when so many people in the labour party have put so much effort in trying to win .
so we could have and would have dealt with the situation of the erm which was not entirely confidence making of course .
but that would have required radical action literally within days of being elected and for various ... reasons john did n't take that action .
i understand why he did n't but we would have taken it ...
david frost : and in terms of the last factor , the few votes that it would have needed and so on , the votes that just evaporated as it were .
do you think in fact that we saw a bit of the sheffield experience there and is that , was that actually important at the time or is that just hindsight ?
was the shadow budget more important ?
neil kinnock : in the order of things the shadow budget and the way in which it was pretty wrongly misrepresented , particularly in the press , was significant .
so far as the sheffield rally is concerned it did n't even register in any of the opinion poll returns or any other analysis , until after the election when a certain mythology developed , that attributed to the rally some kind of political significance .
but because of the time of the evening and because of the absence of coverage in the subsequent days , it made virtually no difference at all .
the only difference it makes is to scar my memory !
three seconds that i would not repeat had i had another chance .
david frost : well let 's turn to john down the line there in norwich .
john , people have said it to you i know , that it would have been better for the conservatives to have lost that election because then you would n't have had the erm and those things .
both parties were told that this was a poisoned chalice and so on .
but do you think it would have been better if the tories had n't won in 1992 ?
former prime minister sir john major john major : no , i do n't .
i entirely agree with neil .
nobody wishes to lose elections .
but i think some of the things that happened subsequently neil would have had different priorities .
but i think if we had n't been there we would n't have consolidated the 1980s market reforms .
i do n't think the destruction of inflation would have been quite so comprehensive , certainly not without the erm .
we may not have had the northern ireland peace process in the form we did .
we probably would n't have had the lottery which has revolutionised the arts and sport .
and some of the public sector reforms later adopted by the incoming labour government have now been copied around the world .
so one can never be certain what would have happened with an alternative government , but certainly those things did happen ' 92 to ' 97 , and i think there were all absolutely benevolent for the british economy .
david frost : but does the erm still , as neil said it was n't exactly ... the whole thing did n't go wrong because of this country - but i mean , with that erm situation is it still haunting the reputation of the conservatives , even to this day ?
john major : well , it 's still damaging because it has entered mythology .
in fact a series of things came together in the ten days before we were ejected from the erm which were probably unforeseeable and certainly impossible to change .
we had contemplated coming out but the real difficulty there was if we came out there was a real prospect that we 'd have a decline in the exchange rate and an increase in interest rates as well .
so actually coming out of it was an extremely difficult technical operation , we were beginning to consider it but i 'm afraid the crisis came upon us , partly as a result of the french referendum on maastricht before we were ready to come out .
so i think there was nothing much we could in reality have done about it .
david frost : what was the turning point in the last days , as i 've asked neil ?
was it the soapbox ?
john major : i do n't think so ...
david frost : the famous soapbox !
john major : i do n't think there was a single turning point .
i know people talk of the sheffield rally and i know they talk of the soapbox .
i think both those explanations are very heavily overdone .
the impression i had from the beginning of the campaign was that the opinion polls were wrong and that we always had a very good chance of winning .
now those were in the dear old days where prime ministers and leaders of the opposition actually met the public rather than their party audiences .
but it seemed to me right the way through the campaign that we probably had an edge .
i thought we probably would win .
i was n't absolutely certain that we would win but i thought it was probable .
so i do n't think that things did change in the last few days .
the opinion polls seemed to , but on the basis of what i saw in the campaign i did n't feel any particular change amongst the electorate .
david frost : and , i noticed then - i sensed out of the side of my eye there - that you nodded about when john major was talking about the polls .
neil kinnock : yes .
you mentioned earlier , you used the word evaporated about support for labour .
that did n't actually happen .
the support was never quite there and anybody with experience , john included , who 'd been on the streets fighting for most of our adult lives as it were , and both he and i and the people very close to us including i guess our wives , knew what the outcome was likely to be .
and the question then was , was the margin going to be very tight which it turned out to be , or slightly larger .
the most that we could have hoped for , i thought at all stages in the election , the most we could have hoped for was a hung parliament with labour as the biggest single party .
david frost : and , another point on that is that you had started the process of modernisation , laid the foundations for the new dawn - as you once put it - in that period and ...

i think that the labour party was incessantly getting instruction from defeat which is a very expensive course of education it has to be said .
and what people reasoned in the wake of the ' 92 defeat is the changes made have been gigantic , organisationally and in policy terms , plainly they had to be something more than one more heave .

david frost : one of the most inspiring events of the last 12 and a half years was undoubtedly the coming of democracy to south africa .
archbishop desmond tutu was a key figure in the struggle against apartheid , and he 's been a regular guest on this programme .
i spoke to him once again , a little earlier , from new york .
and i began by asking him whether during all those long years of oppression did he always believe that apartheid really would one day be overthrown ?
desmond tutu : i have to say yes .
i believed that apartheid would end but i also have to confess that i was quite amazed at how quickly the end came when it did eventually come .
and , and of course i mean , the release of nelson mandela and all that followed after that .
it 's just unbelievable , quite out of this world really .
and god has been wonderfully , wonderfully good to us .
david frost : but of course south africa still faces a huge problem with poverty , does n't it ?
desmond tutu : oh absolutely .
i mean it 's devastating .
the legacy of apartheid has been enormous .
and we really needed to have something like a marshal plan to deal with the devastation that apartheid has left .
david frost : and as the g8 leaders prepare for their summit on world poverty at gleneagles in july , what would be your message to them ?
desmond tutu : we used to say , dear leaders we are family .
and if one part of the family suffers as so much of the so-called third world is suffering , groaning under the burden of debt and poverty , there 's no way in which other parts , even more prosperous parts , will not be affected .
it is in your interests and the interests of the people that you lead , that you will help to eradicate poverty .
you will remove the burden of international debt .
david frost : with all these problems facing the world , not just poverty , but the environment , the clash of cultures or religions which some people talk about - it 's pretty hard to be optimistic .
but i 've always thought of you as an optimist .
desmond tutu : david , i 've never been an optimist .
i am a prisoner of hope , which is different .
i am aware as you are , and as so many of us are , that the world grows and there 's so many awful things - poverty , tsunami , the awfulness 's that have happened in sarajevo , ethnic cleansing , rwanda , you go on and on and on and frequently you will say it is a real mess .
but it is important to keep remembering that in that mess good things have happened .
and i have no doubt myself that this is a moral universe and goodness and love and caring are ultimately what will prevail .
not the ghastly opposite .
david frost : finally desmond , how are you ?
how is your health ?
desmond tutu : -lrb- laughter -rrb- i should say before i answer that , david , heartiest congratulations on a tremendous achievement .
you 've been a national institution and your show has been an international institution .
heartiest congratulations on your achievement .
i am fine , i am fine .
i am made more aware of my mortality but then i also realise what a fantastic life god has blessed me with and how wonderful people have been to me .
and i just give thanks for what has happened .
david frost : desmond , thank you so much for being with us today .

desmond tutu : david , i 've never been an optimist .
i am a prisoner of hope , which is different .
i am aware as you are , and as so many of us are , that the world grows and there 's so many awful things - poverty , tsunami , the awfulness 's that have happened in sarajevo , ethnic cleansing , rwanda , you go on and on and on and frequently you will say it is a real mess .
but it is important to keep remembering that in that mess good things have happened .
and i have no doubt myself that this is a moral universe and goodness and love and caring are ultimately what will prevail .
not the ghastly opposite .
david frost : finally desmond , how are you ?
how is your health ?
desmond tutu : -lrb- laughter -rrb- i should say before i answer that , david , heartiest congratulations on a tremendous achievement .
you 've been a national institution and your show has been an international institution .
heartiest congratulations on your achievement .
i am fine , i am fine .
i am made more aware of my mortality but then i also realise what a fantastic life god has blessed me with and how wonderful people have been to me .
and i just give thanks for what has happened .
david frost : desmond , thank you so much for being with us today .

archbishop desmond tutu david frost : one of the most inspiring events of the last 12 and a half years was undoubtedly the coming of democracy to south africa .
archbishop desmond tutu was a key figure in the struggle against apartheid , and he 's been a regular guest on this programme .
i spoke to him once again , a little earlier , from new york .
and i began by asking him whether during all those long years of oppression did he always believe that apartheid really would one day be overthrown ?
desmond tutu : i have to say yes .
i believed that apartheid would end but i also have to confess that i was quite amazed at how quickly the end came when it did eventually come .
and , and of course i mean , the release of nelson mandela and all that followed after that .
it 's just unbelievable , quite out of this world really .
and god has been wonderfully , wonderfully good to us .
david frost : but of course south africa still faces a huge problem with poverty , does n't it ?
desmond tutu : oh absolutely .
i mean it 's devastating .
the legacy of apartheid has been enormous .
and we really needed to have something like a marshal plan to deal with the devastation that apartheid has left .
david frost : and as the g8 leaders prepare for their summit on world poverty at gleneagles in july , what would be your message to them ?
desmond tutu : we used to say , dear leaders we are family .
and if one part of the family suffers as so much of the so-called third world is suffering , groaning under the burden of debt and poverty , there 's no way in which other parts , even more prosperous parts , will not be affected .
it is in your interests and the interests of the people that you lead , that you will help to eradicate poverty .
you will remove the burden of international debt .
david frost : with all these problems facing the world , not just poverty , but the environment , the clash of cultures or religions which some people talk about - it 's pretty hard to be optimistic .

many claimed they were fooled into taking part in the trials at porton down which later damaged their health .
former airman douglas shave believes the nerve gas tests he underwent in 1950 left him with severe eczema .
he was exposed to the toxin , sarin , but experts at porton have told him his skin complaints are unrelated .
notes error a mix-up over his notes led him to believe he had been inside a sarin chamber for more than an hour .
" i do believe that if i had n't have gone there , i do n't think i 'd have had the problems i 've had over the years , " he said .
during his return visit to the laboratories , the director of porton down , rick hall , apologised to mr shave , admitting that there had been a mistake .
" the original person who looked at the records read it as one hour and forty-six seconds , when in fact it 's one minute and forty six seconds , " he said .
in november 2004 , an inquest into ronald maddison , who died 51 years ago during secret nerve gas tests , ruled that he was unlawfully killed .

a 29-man inquiry team from northern constabulary is hunting the lone gunman who killed mr wilson on his doorstep on 28 november last year .
detective chief inspector peter macphee said officers would be given all available resources to solve the case .
police have been unable to establish a motive for the 30-year-old 's killing .
speaking at the six-month point of the murder investigation , mr macphee , the officer leading the inquiry , said costs would rise further .
" the needs of the investigation will receive the appropriate resources , " he said .
" we have not included police salaries but the cost is currently over £ 380,000 .
running costs " this includes overtime , the cost of setting up the incident room plus most other day-to-day running costs .
" but we do n't have all the invoices in , for example , all the dna tests and other specific necessities . "
about 214 dna samples and 2,500 statements have been taken during the six months of the murder inquiry .
mr macphee added : " although there are fewer officers working on the case now , we can draft in the necessary personnel as and when necessary . "
mr wilson 's killer used a schmeisser semi-automatic pistol , of which about 40,000 were originally manufactured .
the gun is small enough to fit into the palm of a hand and police believe it may have been brought into the uk during or after world war ii .
the pistol was found in a drain about half a mile from mr wilson 's home where he lived with his wife , veronica , and two sons .

officers said they would use their new powers to prosecute anyone committing sectarian offences .
it follows a parades review earlier this year which called for marches to be better organised .
however , local council group cosla said the scottish executive had not yet committed to fund the extra measures brought in by the review .
good behaviour bond the parades review , carried out by former strathclyde police chief constable sir john orr , recommended that every march should be assessed so that the community can be consulted .
he suggested marches be blocked if there was a risk of intimidation to the local community or of serious disruption .
under the measures , groups must give 28 days notice of a march , instead of the present seven .
they may also be ordered to pay a good behaviour bond , which will be forfeited if marchers cause trouble .
sir john also said that there should be fewer marches in scotland .
there were about 1,700 parades in 2003 , with almost half being held by the orange order . "
as far as the teenagers who storm down the pavements and cause problems , we 'd ask them to away " robert maclean orange order he said that there were occasions when there were three orange marches in one area on the same day , which fuelled controversy over the parades .
cosla president pat watters said : " there is a lot more bureaucracy which goes along with what the orr report says and that means a lot more work for local authorities .
" we need the funds because there is a lot of bureaucracy attached to this : the consultation with the communities ; the assessment reports ; the consultations with the marchers , but there is also necessary legislation that needs to go through as well . "
the orange order said its lodges wanted to create " a family atmosphere " at its parades and urged those who were intent on causing trouble to stay away .
sectarian behaviour robert maclean , a spokesman for the orange order in scotland , said : " as far as the teenagers who storm down the pavements and cause problems , we 'd ask them to away .
" we 'd ask the police to be more robust when it comes to that and they should take more action against this type of people . "
strathclyde police deputy chief constable ricky gray said officers were ready to deal with sectarian behaviour .
he added : " the main area of focus for us this year will be on those who follow the parades , those who perhaps behave in a loutish manner , do n't conduct themselves in an appropriate manner , that 's the area of attention for us .
" we do that already around football matches , where we have aggravations of a breach of the peace .
" if it was a sectarian-aggravated offence then that would be incorporated in the police report and the court would give due cognisance to that . "

officers said they would use their new powers to prosecute anyone committing sectarian offences .
it follows a parades review earlier this year which called for marches to be better organised .
however , local council group cosla said the scottish executive had not yet committed to fund the extra measures brought in by the review .
good behaviour bond the parades review , carried out by former strathclyde police chief constable sir john orr , recommended that every march should be assessed so that the community can be consulted .
he suggested marches be blocked if there was a risk of intimidation to the local community or of serious disruption .
under the measures , groups must give 28 days notice of a march , instead of the present seven .
they may also be ordered to pay a good behaviour bond , which will be forfeited if marchers cause trouble .

he performed hits from throughout his 40-year career to the crowds at ynysangharad park on saturday night .
" tom jones in ponty park " marked his 65th birthday next week .
police said there were no big problems .
there were three arrests in the park - two for trying to supply drugs and one for being drunk and disorderly . "
i will never forget it and it is most definitely a story to tell the grandchildren .
tom jones in ponty park - magnificent " concert-goer meriel oliver it was a remarkable night , as jones sang within a few hundred yards of laura street in treforest , where he grew up honing one of the most distinctive voices in showbusiness .
it 's a voice which has brought him consistent success and untold wealth over four decades , and it was still in fantastic fettle back where it all began .
jones was greeted like a conquering hero as he appeared , dressed in lilac suit , studded black shirt and familiar cross medallion around his neck .
naturally , his greatest hits wrought the loudest cheers , from the breakthrough number one it 's not unusual , through to what 's new pussycat , thunderball , and delilah .
and - of course - green , green grass of home , with a nod of the head towards laura street as he reached the line ...
" the old house is still standing , though the paint is cracked and dry . "
but the ecstatic reception for more recent songs - from prince 's kiss to sex bomb and his stereophonics duet mama told me not to come - showed how he has won fans across the generations to stay at the top .
in between songs , jones fondly recalled his visits to ponty park as a young boy and with his own son mark , born when tom woodward was a teenager dreaming of stardom .
massive birthday cake jones told the audience that his last concert in ponty was on 30 june , 1964 , at the white hart pub with tommy scott and the senators .
the next day he went to london , on 11 november he recorded it 's not unusual , and on st david 's day 1965 it hit number one .
he spoke beforehand about how it would be a night for people from ponty and the surrounding valleys , and the warm-up pushed all the right buttons .
highlights from wales ' recent grand slam rugby win were shown , with recorded tributes to the singer from some players and well-known welsh faces .
but some of these went down better than others : pontypridd-born ex-international neil jenkins and former stereophonics drummer stuart cable won wild cheers , while both first minister rhodri morgan - another 65-year-old who told jones that was no age to retire - and teenage singer charlotte church were booed . "
he was as good as i expected .
and very sexy " fan liz cameron there was , though , a warm welcome from both the star of the night and the crowd for welsh classical singer katherine jenkins .
she appeared after green , green grass of home to serenade him with happy birthday and to present him with a massive cake .
most of the crowd appeared to be local , and some women wore spare knickers over their jeans , ready to throw on stage .
but one man , claudio pini , had travelled from palma , italy , to be there .
claudio , aged 44 - and membership number 1,901 in the tom jones appreciation society - brought with him both his girlfriend and a beautiful £ 400 miniature pool table which he has been trying to present to him for some months .
claudio was disappointed at failing to meet his idol to hand over the table , but this fan of 28 years was clearly not about to give up .
other fans from closer to tom 's home were just as impressed with the show .
" i thought it was gwych -lrb- fantastic -rrb- , " said liz cameron , aged 32 , originally from nantgarw , near pontypridd , and now living in cardiff .
" he was as good as i expected .
and very sexy . "
meriel oliver , aged 26 , from trallwn , pontypridd , said : " from a young age i 've been aware of ' the importance of being tom jones ' .
" i feel extremely glad to have seen him in the home town and very proud of him as he is in my opinion a true welshman .
" what a brilliant night .
i will never forget it and it is most definitely a story to tell the grandchildren .
tom jones in ponty park - magnificent . "
police said the event went smoothly after people arrived early and used public transport .
chief superintendent brian greaves said : " it seems that most concert-goers heeded our advice and made use of the park and ride facilities signposted from major roads , or shared lifts , so the anticipated road congestion in the town centre and on the a470 was avoided .
" it did take some time to get everyone away after the show with 20,000 people all leaving at once , trying to get to the park and ride and relatives and friends trying to pick people up .
" luckily the delays were n't too long and the congestion was dealt with in about 45 minutes .
" it was the first event of this kind in pontypridd and the emergency services , the local authority and the organisers have learnt a great deal from the experience , which will help us to develop and improve any subsequent plan for events in the park . "

claudio , aged 44 - and membership number 1,901 in the tom jones appreciation society - brought with him both his girlfriend and a beautiful £ 400 miniature pool table which he has been trying to present to him for some months .
claudio was disappointed at failing to meet his idol to hand over the table , but this fan of 28 years was clearly not about to give up .
other fans from closer to tom 's home were just as impressed with the show .
" i thought it was gwych -lrb- fantastic -rrb- , " said liz cameron , aged 32 , originally from nantgarw , near pontypridd , and now living in cardiff .
' what a brilliant night ' : the verdict of pontypridd fan meriel oliver " he was as good as i expected .
and very sexy . "
meriel oliver , aged 26 , from trallwn , pontypridd , said : " from a young age i 've been aware of ' the importance of being tom jones ' .
" i feel extremely glad to have seen him in the home town and very proud of him as he is in my opinion a true welshman .
" what a brilliant night .
i will never forget it and it is most definitely a story to tell the grandchildren .
tom jones in ponty park - magnificent . "
police said the event went smoothly after people arrived early and used public transport .
chief superintendent brian greaves said : " it seems that most concert-goers heeded our advice and made use of the park and ride facilities signposted from major roads , or shared lifts , so the anticipated road congestion in the town centre and on the a470 was avoided .
" it did take some time to get everyone away after the show with 20,000 people all leaving at once , trying to get to the park and ride and relatives and friends trying to pick people up .
" luckily the delays were n't too long and the congestion was dealt with in about 45 minutes .
" it was the first event of this kind in pontypridd and the emergency services , the local authority and the organisers have learnt a great deal from the experience , which will help us to develop and improve any subsequent plan for events in the park . "

he performed hits from throughout his 40-year career to the crowds at ynysangharad park on saturday night .
" tom jones in ponty park " marked his 65th birthday next week .
police said there were no big problems .
there were three arrests in the park - two for trying to supply drugs and one for being drunk and disorderly .
i will never forget it and it is most definitely a story to tell the grandchildren .
tom jones in ponty park - magnificent concert-goer meriel oliver it was a remarkable night , as jones sang within a few hundred yards of laura street in treforest , where he grew up honing one of the most distinctive voices in showbusiness .
it 's a voice which has brought him consistent success and untold wealth over four decades , and it was still in fantastic fettle back where it all began .
jones was greeted like a conquering hero as he appeared , dressed in lilac suit , studded black shirt and familiar cross medallion around his neck .
the singer grew up a stone 's throw away from the park naturally , his greatest hits wrought the loudest cheers , from the breakthrough number one it 's not unusual , through to what 's new pussycat , thunderball , and delilah .
and - of course - green , green grass of home , with a nod of the head towards laura street as he reached the line ...
" the old house is still standing , though the paint is cracked and dry . "
but the ecstatic reception for more recent songs - from prince 's kiss to sex bomb and his stereophonics duet mama told me not to come - showed how he has won fans across the generations to stay at the top .
in between songs , jones fondly recalled his visits to ponty park as a young boy and with his own son mark , born when tom woodward was a teenager dreaming of stardom .
massive birthday cake jones told the audience that his last concert in ponty was on 30 june , 1964 , at the white hart pub with tommy scott and the senators .
arise sir tom ... or so these dedicated fans think , anyway the next day he went to london , on 11 november he recorded it 's not unusual , and on st david 's day 1965 it hit number one .
he spoke beforehand about how it would be a night for people from ponty and the surrounding valleys , and the warm-up pushed all the right buttons .
highlights from wales ' recent grand slam rugby win were shown , with recorded tributes to the singer from some players and well-known welsh faces .
but some of these went down better than others : pontypridd-born ex-international neil jenkins and former stereophonics drummer stuart cable won wild cheers , while both first minister rhodri morgan - another 65-year-old who told jones that was no age to retire - and teenage singer charlotte church were booed .
he was as good as i expected .
and very sexy fan liz cameron there was , though , a warm welcome from both the star of the night and the crowd for welsh classical singer katherine jenkins .
she appeared after green , green grass of home to serenade him with happy birthday and to present him with a massive cake .
