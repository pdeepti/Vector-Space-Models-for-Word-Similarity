" legal proceedings under way in certain countries appear to show that individuals were abducted and transferred to other countries without respect for any legal assistance procedures , " council of europe rapporteur dick marty told a meeting of the body 's human rights committee in paris . the swiss senator said the results of his investigation lent credibility to reports that the cia flew terrorist suspects to and from secret prisons in europe .
marty added that he believed the united states was no longer holding prisoners clandestinely in europe .
it is suspected that the prisoners were moved to north africa in early november , when reports about secret us prisons first emerged in the washi n gto n post . " the elements we have gathered so far tend to reinforce the credibility of the allegations concerning the transport and temporary detention of detainees - outside all judicial procedure in european countries , " he said in an official statement , the first initial findings from the investigation into alleged cia flights and abductions in europe . the rapporteur " demands immediately that all member governments fully commit to uncovering the truth about flights and overflights on their territory in recent years , by aircraft transporting people arrested and detained outside of any legal procedure . " fear of legal " black hole " i n the heart of europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reports of cia prisons , like this one in kosovo , have raised concerns further .
the idea of a clandestine operation by the cia , possibly aided and abetted by unknown european states , is of particular concern to the investigators .
tony lloyd , a member of the council of europe committee , said : " the really difficult thing is the idea is that there is a kind of legal black hole in the middle of europe . " marty also criticized the united states for failing to provide information to the council of europe 's investigators and added that the us has never formally denied the allegations brought against the cia . us secretary of state condoleezza rice failed to rebut the cia prison and torture allegations during her recent visit to europe despite being repeatedly questioned about the affair , saying only that american interrogators were bound by a un treaty banning the use of torture , regardless of whether they were working in the us or abroad . marty bemoa n s lack of tra n spare n cy from rice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice failed to address the allegations fully , marty said .
" the rapporteur ... deplores the fact that no information or explanation had been provided on this point by ms. rice during her visit to europe , " marty said . claims have been mounting that the united states has been illegally using european airports and airspace to transport terror suspects as part of what the us central intelligence agency calls " extraordinary renditions . "
reports suggest that torture of suspects could have happened on flights in european airspace or at secret cia prisons on european soil . marty had words for european states that may have been involved in the transportation or internment of suspects on the cia 's behalf .
european states faced accusations of a serious breach of their human rights obligations if they had cooperated with the underground network , he said . complicit europea n states face harsh co n seque n ces bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suspected cia flights , like this one leaving frankfurt , have raised suspicions of european complicity .
" while it was still too early to assert that there had been any involvement or complicity of member states in illegal actions , the seriousness of the allegations and the consistency of the information gathered to date justified the continuation of an in-depth inquiry , " he said .
" if the allegations proved correct the member states would stand accused of having seriously breached their human rights obligations to the council of europe .

the world speaks english .
many german companies are making it their mother tongue .
some workers see this as an opportunity , others as a curse , for their careers .
yet corporate english is also a question of culture . the german business world is going through a tough transition period .
companies like technology giant siemens , auto manufacturer daimlerchrysler and software producer sap sell much more abroad than in germany - and nowadays , the language of business abroad is conducted primarily in english . already in 1999 , the publishing house bertelsmann began printing more and more books in english , which became the lingua franca .
other publishers soon followed suit . when the munich-based hypovereinsbank merged with italy 's unicredito , the boards decided that instead of denigrating german or italian by snubbing one over the other , they would use english in the company 's official communications - a fact that 's more befitting a bank of its size anyway . multilingualism costs money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : english resulted when german hvb group merged with italian unicredito in the international business world , fusions , takeovers and global interests are forcing corporations - in the plain interest of economics - to make one language the official company tongue , and that is usually english .
a multilingual environment is simply expensive .
interpreters and translators are necessary during talks and for internal communication , something that adds up over the long run . " that quickly becomes economically unfeasible , " said business expert jürgen hausschildt .
" and in spite of translations , there are repeated misunderstandings . " particularly the internal vernacular and terminology in a company are difficult to translate , according to hausschildt . companies in smaller countries do away with mother tongue a single company language can prevent such misunderstandings in addition to lowering costs .
nevertheless , the possible variations are limitless . " in small countries like norway , denmark and the netherlands , only english is spoken in companies .
they 've done away with their mother tongue all together , " said hausschildt . in most offices , there is a two-language culture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at siemens ' mobile phone plant in brazil , portuguese is spoken german banking giant deutsche bank is one example .
international queries are answered in english , questions from germany in german . siemens does it similarly , yet at the same time , it tries to promote an image as a company whose home is where the office is . " siemens is a global company , but in america we speak english , in india hindi , and in france french , " said company spokesman georg haux . fears of a manager what 's good for the goose , here the company , is n't necessarily good for the gander , in this case the employees .
managers frequently fear that their failure to speak a foreign language could hinder their chances of climbing further up the corporate ladder . " those who speak the mother tongue are preferred when it comes to managerial positions , " said hausschildt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when asking deutsche bank outside of germany , the response is in english even when a worker is better qualified , if the language skills are lacking , these shortcomings can cost them a promotion .
another problem confronts those who are good communicators and have even better than average english abilities - the loss of soft skills . " this is a terrible situation for many managers , " said expert hausschildt . back to basics those companies that do decide to put all their eggs in one basket and use english must exert a lot of energy in the beginning phase .
meetings take longer and any potential misunderstandings must be clarified . so that everyone manages to communicate on a similar level , or at least be able to , some companies resort to a basic english whose lexicon consists of between 400 and 800 , according to hausschildt .
in many offices , this minimum is mandatory . sonja lindenberg -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german banks grapple with change the recent takeover of germany 's hypovereinsbank by italy 's unicredito has led to speculation about further mergers and sales .

a secure pension plan can keep you going in the twilight years of your life when the last 40 or so years of work are just a bad and distant memory .
but few people consider that the benefits from a good pension can stretch beyond the grave . one person , however , did consider this .
but it was n't the german woman 's pension that kept on giving when the toes curled up - it was the pension of her dead father-in-law which she continued to claim for two decades past his departure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enjoy your pension , ladies , you 've earned it even though her father-in-law passed away in 1977 , the berlin resident continued to squirrel his pension payments away until 1997 after changing the bank account details from the dead man 's to her own .

" i find it surprising that a commitment made by the united states in the framework agreement last year to reform food aid ... should now be described as an obsession of the european union , " he said . " food aid for emergency relief can be a tool to advance development and for humanitarian relief but the large structured us program of food aid in kind is designed in reality to give support to us agricultural producers , " he said . " statistics show that the volume of this aid is directly related to the price shifts for the commodities concerned on the us market , " he added . last week , the heads of the world food program and unicef , plus the un high commissioner for refugees , called on wto negotiators to ensure food aid is protected . they said it would be even harder to get cash donations at a time when donations of food in kind are already slipping . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de at wto , security is tight and expectations low as the wto talks opened in hong kong tuesday , security was tight and key players , including germany , had lowered their expectations .

" legal proceedings under way in certain countries appear to show that individuals were abducted and transferred to other countries without respect for any legal assistance procedures , " council of europe rapporteur dick marty told a meeting of the body 's human rights committee in paris . the swiss senator said the results of his investigation lent credibility to reports that the cia flew terrorist suspects to and from secret prisons in europe .
marty added that he believed the united states was no longer holding prisoners clandestinely in europe .
it is suspected that the prisoners were moved to north africa in early november , when reports about secret us prisons first emerged in the washi n gto n post . " the elements we have gathered so far tend to reinforce the credibility of the allegations concerning the transport and temporary detention of detainees - outside all judicial procedure in european countries , " he said in an official statement , the first initial findings from the investigation into alleged cia flights and abductions in europe . the rapporteur " demands immediately that all member governments fully commit to uncovering the truth about flights and overflights on their territory in recent years , by aircraft transporting people arrested and detained outside of any legal procedure . " fear of legal " black hole " i n the heart of europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reports of cia prisons , like this one in kosovo , have raised concerns further .
the idea of a clandestine operation by the cia , possibly aided and abetted by unknown european states , is of particular concern to the investigators .
tony lloyd , a member of the council of europe committee , said : " the really difficult thing is the idea is that there is a kind of legal black hole in the middle of europe . " marty also criticized the united states for failing to provide information to the council of europe 's investigators and added that the us has never formally denied the allegations brought against the cia . us secretary of state condoleezza rice failed to rebut the cia prison and torture allegations during her recent visit to europe despite being repeatedly questioned about the affair , saying only that american interrogators were bound by a un treaty banning the use of torture , regardless of whether they were working in the us or abroad . marty bemoa n s lack of tra n spare n cy from rice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice failed to address the allegations fully , marty said .
" the rapporteur ... deplores the fact that no information or explanation had been provided on this point by ms. rice during her visit to europe , " marty said . claims have been mounting that the united states has been illegally using european airports and airspace to transport terror suspects as part of what the us central intelligence agency calls " extraordinary renditions . "
reports suggest that torture of suspects could have happened on flights in european airspace or at secret cia prisons on european soil . marty had words for european states that may have been involved in the transportation or internment of suspects on the cia 's behalf .
european states faced accusations of a serious breach of their human rights obligations if they had cooperated with the underground network , he said . complicit europea n states face harsh co n seque n ces bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suspected cia flights , like this one leaving frankfurt , have raised suspicions of european complicity .
" while it was still too early to assert that there had been any involvement or complicity of member states in illegal actions , the seriousness of the allegations and the consistency of the information gathered to date justified the continuation of an in-depth inquiry , " he said .
" if the allegations proved correct the member states would stand accused of having seriously breached their human rights obligations to the council of europe .

a secure pension plan can keep you going in the twilight years of your life when the last 40 or so years of work are just a bad and distant memory .
but few people consider that the benefits from a good pension can stretch beyond the grave . one person , however , did consider this .
but it was n't the german woman 's pension that kept on giving when the toes curled up - it was the pension of her dead father-in-law which she continued to claim for two decades past his departure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enjoy your pension , ladies , you 've earned it even though her father-in-law passed away in 1977 , the berlin resident continued to squirrel his pension payments away until 1997 after changing the bank account details from the dead man 's to her own .

" a lot of silly things are being spread in the political community and in the media , " he told süddeutsche zeitu n g in his first public comments on the issue .
" in the past , i supported this project politically because i thought it made sense .
i 'm only 61 years old and i want to work - i do n't want to get in my wife 's way at home .
besides , it is an honor . " he said that talk over his compensation - reportedly up to one million euros -lrb- $ 1.19 million -rrb- - was " pure invention " since the topic has not yet been broached .
he noted that he was only offered the job on friday and accepted it after consulting german companies involved in the project .
and he added that he was considering legal action . need code of co n duct some german politicians believe schröder is crossing the fine line separating politics from business , and have criticized him for choosing to work in such a controversial area . " i would never have imagined that a german head of government could act ... with such a lack of instinct , " said parliament president and cdu member norbert lammert . even politicians from schröder 's own social democratic party were skeptical . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : struck is not defending schröder " i would not have done it , " said peter struck , who served as defense minister in the coalition government led by schröder .
" but gerhard schröder is a private individual and can do what he wants . " meanwhile , criticism of the chancellor 's actions has led to a call for a new code of conduct that would limit government officials ' employment in the private sector after leaving office .
chancellor angela merkel is open to such an initiative , officials said . christian wulff , a leading member of merkel 's christian democratic union party , said he should not take the position .

schröder has argued that the pipeline is an essential piece of germany 's future energy strategy . the pipeline will help meet the country 's growing gas needs - about half of all german homes are heated by gas and three-quarters of new homes have gas heating . close relatio n ship the press in poland , already extremely critical of the project , was furious on monday . " the fact that he is taking a job in a company led by a former stasi agent and with russian president vladimir putin as one of the big bosses , 15 days after vacating the chancellery , is compromising to schroeder the statesman , " wrote the center-left gazeta wyborcza . while in office , schröder had a close political and personal relationship with putin , who speaks fluent german . stretching for 1,200 kilometers -lrb- 750 miles -rrb- under the baltic sea from vyborg near st. petersburg to greifswald on the northeastern coast of germany , the pipeline is scheduled to go into operation in 2010 , initially delivering 27.5 billion cubic meters a year which will rise to 55 billion . gazprom will control 51 percent of the venture while eon , the leading german energy group , and basf , the world 's biggest chemicals maker , will hold 24.5 percent each . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no pipe and slippers for rejuvenated schröder after running germany and sparring with some the world 's most powerful leaders for seven years , gerhard schröder could be excused for taking a rest .

former chancellor schröder is supposed to become head of the board of supervisors of the swiss-registered german-russian company for development and construction of the baltic sea pipeline . the pipeline agreement between the russian energy giant gazprom and german companies basf and eon was hastily signed in september , before the german parliamentary elections and in the presence of both schröder and russian president putin .

" we need a broad energy mix to guarantee supplies at low prices , " he said .
" it does n't make any sense for us to buy electricity produced by nuclear power from our neighbors but to totally turn our backs on it ourselves . "
germany 's grand coalition of conservative christian union parties and their social democratic partners disagree on nuclear policy but agreed to stick to a plan created by the social democrats and greens in 2000 to phase out the country 's nuclear power facilities .
glos is a member of the christian social union , the bavarian sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union .
two dow n , so far one of the most crucial pieces of legislation passed by outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , in the eyes of many , was a planned phase-out of germany 's atomic energy plants by 2020 .
the idea , largely pressed by the environmentally-friendly greens , was to focus on renewable energy and away from a crippling dependence on oil .
it also found support at a time when safety concerns over nuclear power reactors were highlighted with accidents like the one in chernobyl in 1986 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : due to close in 2008 so far , the government has closed two nuclear reactors .
the remaining 17 , owned by utilities rwe ag , e.on ag and enbw , are to be closed over the next 15 years .
the next due to close , according to the environment ministry , is rwe 's " biblis a " reactor , in 2008 .
merkel wa n ts to stop n uclear phase out the conservatives led by chancellor-designate angela merkel have made no secret of the fact that they intend to put the brakes on the nuclear-phase out .
earlier this year , merkel argued in a speech that if germany is no longer active in nuclear power , it would have no influence on the international market when it comes to exporting nuclear technology .
the conservatives are keen to provide germany , a large importer of oil and gas , with greater energy security and allow the energy industry to earn more by extending the life of their plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agree to disgree , for now " in my view , an ideologically motivated nuclear phase-out does not reflect economic demands , " merkel said , citing the fact that countries such as india and china are expanding their nuclear energy capacities . " for me , the question is , how can germany , with its technical know-how , profit from this export potential .
as a patriot , i would like to see my country profit from our expertise , not watch others take the profits . "
but , michael müller , vice-chairman of the spd parliamentary group demanded that the conservatives finally recognize that they " have no chance " to chip away at nuclear phase-out with the spd .
müller argued that if the nuclear plants were indeed allowed to run longer , they would have to undergo updated security modifications - something that would cost money , he said .
maki n g a comeback one thing that 's bolstered the conservatives ' case is the fact that nuclear energy has been gradually making a comeback in europe with the first new nuclear plant on the continent in years being built in finland .
its supporters also point out that nuclear reactors emit virtually no greenhouse gases .
" we should not turn our backs on a technology of the future , " glos told the newspaper .

former chancellor schröder is supposed to become head of the board of supervisors of the swiss-registered german-russian company for development and construction of the baltic sea pipeline . the pipeline agreement between the russian energy giant gazprom and german companies basf and eon was hastily signed in september , before the german parliamentary elections and in the presence of both schröder and russian president putin .
the event was accompanied by heavy criticism from the neighboring eastern european countries and references to the inefficiency of such a project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politics is out , big business is in for former chancellor schröder with his new job , schröder is complicating the future german policy toward the east , which should n't only be directed towards moscow .
he is , furthermore , damaging the reputation of his earlier russian policies , letting his historic legacy in the german-russian relations appear in unfavorable light . as chancellor , schröder pursued a controversial foreign policy with the goal of a close partnership with russia .
against resistance on the domestic front , schröder won a great deal of trust in russia , a historical sign of which was his participation in the celebrations of the sixtieth anniversary since the end of world war ii on the red square . europe n eeds russia but schröder 's russian policy was not only based on his wish to reconcile the germans and the russians , but also on a geopolitical and strategic realization that the european continent could be peaceful and prosperous only if russia , too , became sufficiently integrated .
europe and russia are also dependent on each other because of the mutually beneficial economic links .
only together can they survive in the world of the twenty-first century . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gas pipeline deal may end up as a political faux pas for germany these pragmatic factors of schröder 's russian policy are getting completely invalidated by his becoming head of the supervisory board for the baltic sea pipeline consortium .
from this perspective , his whole russian policy seems like a policy of personal advantage - especially if the new position is not honorary . there are many jobs schröder could have taken if he wanted to use his weight as an " elder statesman " on behalf of the german-russian relations - in connection with the " petersburg dialogue , " a forum on civil society , which he himself initiated , or in the ongoing german-russian youth projects .
as figurehead for the baltic sea pipeline , he is only doing a disservice to the german-russian relations . ingo mannteufel -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder calls pipeline job " an honor " former german chancellor gerhard schröder has deflected criticism over his new job tuesday as calls continue to mount for a code of conduct for government officials once they leave office .

as a patriot , i would like to see my country profit from our expertise , not watch others take the profits . "
but , michael müller , vice-chairman of the spd parliamentary group demanded that the conservatives finally recognize that they " have no chance " to chip away at nuclear phase-out with the spd .

" we need a broad energy mix to guarantee supplies at low prices , " he said .
" it does n't make any sense for us to buy electricity produced by nuclear power from our neighbors but to totally turn our backs on it ourselves . "
germany 's grand coalition of conservative christian union parties and their social democratic partners disagree on nuclear policy but agreed to stick to a plan created by the social democrats and greens in 2000 to phase out the country 's nuclear power facilities .
glos is a member of the christian social union , the bavarian sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union .
two dow n , so far one of the most crucial pieces of legislation passed by outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , in the eyes of many , was a planned phase-out of germany 's atomic energy plants by 2020 .
the idea , largely pressed by the environmentally-friendly greens , was to focus on renewable energy and away from a crippling dependence on oil .

" in the home country of english , the world language , the task of persuasion is especially difficult , " he added .
" i firmly believe this is also a matter of social justice because languages facilitate social mobility . " joe brown was the 2005 winner of the german teacher awards presented by the german embassy in london .

" starting early is therefore the best option , and in fact , you can argue it 's an ideal language for small children because the pronunciation is n't hard and it 's very logical . " the traditionally hostile relations between britain and germany also play a role .
" you have to break down prejudices , " said brown .
" it 's also a question of inter-cultural education . " plunging numbers informing matussek 's remarks were figures published by the national languages center showing that the number of high school pupils studying languages has slumped by more than 64,000 this year - the first year since languages became an optional subject for 14- to 16-year-olds . learning a language beyond the age of 14 is now compulsory in just one quarter of england 's state schools , where second languages have traditionally been french or german . the latter is particularly out of favor , with some 105,288 students taking junior high school exams in german , and 272,140 in french - but even the number of senior high school students taking french has plunged by almost half . " the problem is , german just is n't considered a young person 's language , " explained brown .

" there just are n't enough people coming through the system to deliver german as a foreign language , " he said .
" a high percentage of adults in britain say they wish they spoke a foreign language , but they did n't capitalize on the opportunities they had to learn .

" in the home country of english , the world language , the task of persuasion is especially difficult , " he added .
" i firmly believe this is also a matter of social justice because languages facilitate social mobility . " joe brown was the 2005 winner of the german teacher awards presented by the german embassy in london .
he works at a number of inner-city elementary schools and told dw-world that the main problems with language-learning occur at high-school level . " younger children enjoy learning german , and do n't tend to have any of the prejudices you find with older kids , " he said .
" starting early is therefore the best option , and in fact , you can argue it 's an ideal language for small children because the pronunciation is n't hard and it 's very logical . " the traditionally hostile relations between britain and germany also play a role .
" you have to break down prejudices , " said brown .
" it 's also a question of inter-cultural education . " plunging numbers informing matussek 's remarks were figures published by the national languages center showing that the number of high school pupils studying languages has slumped by more than 64,000 this year - the first year since languages became an optional subject for 14- to 16-year-olds . learning a language beyond the age of 14 is now compulsory in just one quarter of england 's state schools , where second languages have traditionally been french or german . the latter is particularly out of favor , with some 105,288 students taking junior high school exams in german , and 272,140 in french - but even the number of senior high school students taking french has plunged by almost half . " the problem is , german just is n't considered a young person 's language , " explained brown .
" teenagers these days want to learn spanish , because spain 's a popular holiday destination and it 's seen as more of a world language than german and french . " universities bear the brunt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oxford university one long-term consequence of the shrinking number of pupils learning german is already being felt by university modern language departments , which have fewer applicants than ever before and face a growing threat of closure as the popularity - and usefulness - of german degrees continues to wane . but as brown points out , it 's a vicious circle .
" there just are n't enough people coming through the system to deliver german as a foreign language , " he said .
" a high percentage of adults in britain say they wish they spoke a foreign language , but they did n't capitalize on the opportunities they had to learn .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.12.2005 council of europe investigators release initial cia findings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the investigators believe that the cia has now emptied all secret prisons in europe the cia appears to have abducted people in europe and illegally transferred them to other countries , according to the initial results of a council of europe investigation released on tuesday . " legal proceedings under way in certain countries appear to show that individuals were abducted and transferred to other countries without respect for any legal assistance procedures , " council of europe rapporteur dick marty told a meeting of the body 's human rights committee in paris . the swiss senator said the results of his investigation lent credibility to reports that the cia flew terrorist suspects to and from secret prisons in europe .
marty added that he believed the united states was no longer holding prisoners clandestinely in europe .
it is suspected that the prisoners were moved to north africa in early november , when reports about secret us prisons first emerged in the washi n gto n post . " the elements we have gathered so far tend to reinforce the credibility of the allegations concerning the transport and temporary detention of detainees - outside all judicial procedure in european countries , " he said in an official statement , the first initial findings from the investigation into alleged cia flights and abductions in europe . the rapporteur " demands immediately that all member governments fully commit to uncovering the truth about flights and overflights on their territory in recent years , by aircraft transporting people arrested and detained outside of any legal procedure . " fear of legal " black hole " i n the heart of europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reports of cia prisons , like this one in kosovo , have raised concerns further .
the idea of a clandestine operation by the cia , possibly aided and abetted by unknown european states , is of particular concern to the investigators .
tony lloyd , a member of the council of europe committee , said : " the really difficult thing is the idea is that there is a kind of legal black hole in the middle of europe . " marty also criticized the united states for failing to provide information to the council of europe 's investigators and added that the us has never formally denied the allegations brought against the cia . us secretary of state condoleezza rice failed to rebut the cia prison and torture allegations during her recent visit to europe despite being repeatedly questioned about the affair , saying only that american interrogators were bound by a un treaty banning the use of torture , regardless of whether they were working in the us or abroad . marty bemoa n s lack of tra n spare n cy from rice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice failed to address the allegations fully , marty said .
" the rapporteur ... deplores the fact that no information or explanation had been provided on this point by ms. rice during her visit to europe , " marty said . claims have been mounting that the united states has been illegally using european airports and airspace to transport terror suspects as part of what the us central intelligence agency calls " extraordinary renditions . "
reports suggest that torture of suspects could have happened on flights in european airspace or at secret cia prisons on european soil . marty had words for european states that may have been involved in the transportation or internment of suspects on the cia 's behalf .
european states faced accusations of a serious breach of their human rights obligations if they had cooperated with the underground network , he said . complicit europea n states face harsh co n seque n ces bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suspected cia flights , like this one leaving frankfurt , have raised suspicions of european complicity .

" legal proceedings under way in certain countries appear to show that individuals were abducted and transferred to other countries without respect for any legal assistance procedures , " council of europe rapporteur dick marty told a meeting of the body 's human rights committee in paris . the swiss senator said the results of his investigation lent credibility to reports that the cia flew terrorist suspects to and from secret prisons in europe .
marty added that he believed the united states was no longer holding prisoners clandestinely in europe .
it is suspected that the prisoners were moved to north africa in early november , when reports about secret us prisons first emerged in the washi n gto n post . " the elements we have gathered so far tend to reinforce the credibility of the allegations concerning the transport and temporary detention of detainees - outside all judicial procedure in european countries , " he said in an official statement , the first initial findings from the investigation into alleged cia flights and abductions in europe . the rapporteur " demands immediately that all member governments fully commit to uncovering the truth about flights and overflights on their territory in recent years , by aircraft transporting people arrested and detained outside of any legal procedure .

the idea of a clandestine operation by the cia , possibly aided and abetted by unknown european states , is of particular concern to the investigators .
tony lloyd , a member of the council of europe committee , said : " the really difficult thing is the idea is that there is a kind of legal black hole in the middle of europe . " marty also criticized the united states for failing to provide information to the council of europe 's investigators and added that the us has never formally denied the allegations brought against the cia . us secretary of state condoleezza rice failed to rebut the cia prison and torture allegations during her recent visit to europe despite being repeatedly questioned about the affair , saying only that american interrogators were bound by a un treaty banning the use of torture , regardless of whether they were working in the us or abroad . marty bemoa n s lack of tra n spare n cy from rice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice failed to address the allegations fully , marty said .
" the rapporteur ... deplores the fact that no information or explanation had been provided on this point by ms. rice during her visit to europe , " marty said . claims have been mounting that the united states has been illegally using european airports and airspace to transport terror suspects as part of what the us central intelligence agency calls " extraordinary renditions . "
reports suggest that torture of suspects could have happened on flights in european airspace or at secret cia prisons on european soil . marty had words for european states that may have been involved in the transportation or internment of suspects on the cia 's behalf .

" the spd-green government failed to keep its promise to reduce weapons export , " said gkke president and catholic prelate karl jüsten .
" the balance is disappointing . " co n tradictio n s in 2004 , germany exported some 3.8 billion euros worth of weapons .
in keeping with german habits of recent years , some 1.2 billion euros worth of arms - approximately one third of german export licenses - went to states that also receive development aid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weapons and aid do n't mix " arms sales jeopardize the chances of effective aid and often stand in stark contradiction to the german government 's stated development policy aims , " jüsten said . moreover , germany 's 900,000 euros worth of weapons exported to china last year suggest the eu 's 16-year-old arms embargo against china is , as jüsten said , a " patchy " one . other destinations included conflict regions such as the middle east , while two thirds of germany 's arms exports head for the us . mystery of missi n g figures little looks set to change under chancellor angela merkel . " we noted with dismay that the recent coalition negotiations barely addressed the question of arms export , " said protestant church representative stephan reimers .
so far , the new government has refrained from agreeing any restrictive arms export policy . the gkke report is based on figures made available by the eu rather than the german government - which has yet to publish its annual arms export report . calls for tra n spare n cy in 1998 , the foreign ministers of the 15 european union member states adopted an eu code of conduct on arms exports , aimed to set common standards for the management of and restraint in arms exports from the eu , which is a politically binding agreement under which member states agree to abide by certain criteria when granting arms export licenses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arms sales - a cloudy issue " at a european level we have attained a satisfactory level of transparency , which the german government falls far short of , " said bernhard moltmann from the hesse foundation for peace and conflict research , pointing out that decisions relating to arms exports are taken behind closed doors by the german security council .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.12.2005 council of europe investigators release initial cia findings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the investigators believe that the cia has now emptied all secret prisons in europe the cia appears to have abducted people in europe and illegally transferred them to other countries , according to the initial results of a council of europe investigation released on tuesday . " legal proceedings under way in certain countries appear to show that individuals were abducted and transferred to other countries without respect for any legal assistance procedures , " council of europe rapporteur dick marty told a meeting of the body 's human rights committee in paris . the swiss senator said the results of his investigation lent credibility to reports that the cia flew terrorist suspects to and from secret prisons in europe .
marty added that he believed the united states was no longer holding prisoners clandestinely in europe .
it is suspected that the prisoners were moved to north africa in early november , when reports about secret us prisons first emerged in the washi n gto n post . " the elements we have gathered so far tend to reinforce the credibility of the allegations concerning the transport and temporary detention of detainees - outside all judicial procedure in european countries , " he said in an official statement , the first initial findings from the investigation into alleged cia flights and abductions in europe . the rapporteur " demands immediately that all member governments fully commit to uncovering the truth about flights and overflights on their territory in recent years , by aircraft transporting people arrested and detained outside of any legal procedure . " fear of legal " black hole " i n the heart of europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reports of cia prisons , like this one in kosovo , have raised concerns further .
the idea of a clandestine operation by the cia , possibly aided and abetted by unknown european states , is of particular concern to the investigators .
tony lloyd , a member of the council of europe committee , said : " the really difficult thing is the idea is that there is a kind of legal black hole in the middle of europe . " marty also criticized the united states for failing to provide information to the council of europe 's investigators and added that the us has never formally denied the allegations brought against the cia . us secretary of state condoleezza rice failed to rebut the cia prison and torture allegations during her recent visit to europe despite being repeatedly questioned about the affair , saying only that american interrogators were bound by a un treaty banning the use of torture , regardless of whether they were working in the us or abroad . marty bemoa n s lack of tra n spare n cy from rice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice failed to address the allegations fully , marty said .
" the rapporteur ... deplores the fact that no information or explanation had been provided on this point by ms. rice during her visit to europe , " marty said . claims have been mounting that the united states has been illegally using european airports and airspace to transport terror suspects as part of what the us central intelligence agency calls " extraordinary renditions . "
reports suggest that torture of suspects could have happened on flights in european airspace or at secret cia prisons on european soil . marty had words for european states that may have been involved in the transportation or internment of suspects on the cia 's behalf .
european states faced accusations of a serious breach of their human rights obligations if they had cooperated with the underground network , he said . complicit europea n states face harsh co n seque n ces bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suspected cia flights , like this one leaving frankfurt , have raised suspicions of european complicity .
" while it was still too early to assert that there had been any involvement or complicity of member states in illegal actions , the seriousness of the allegations and the consistency of the information gathered to date justified the continuation of an in-depth inquiry , " he said .
" if the allegations proved correct the member states would stand accused of having seriously breached their human rights obligations to the council of europe .

the world speaks english .
many german companies are making it their mother tongue .
some workers see this as an opportunity , others as a curse , for their careers .
yet corporate english is also a question of culture . the german business world is going through a tough transition period .
companies like technology giant siemens , auto manufacturer daimlerchrysler and software producer sap sell much more abroad than in germany - and nowadays , the language of business abroad is conducted primarily in english . already in 1999 , the publishing house bertelsmann began printing more and more books in english , which became the lingua franca .
other publishers soon followed suit . when the munich-based hypovereinsbank merged with italy 's unicredito , the boards decided that instead of denigrating german or italian by snubbing one over the other , they would use english in the company 's official communications - a fact that 's more befitting a bank of its size anyway . multilingualism costs money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : english resulted when german hvb group merged with italian unicredito in the international business world , fusions , takeovers and global interests are forcing corporations - in the plain interest of economics - to make one language the official company tongue , and that is usually english .
a multilingual environment is simply expensive .
interpreters and translators are necessary during talks and for internal communication , something that adds up over the long run . " that quickly becomes economically unfeasible , " said business expert jürgen hausschildt .
" and in spite of translations , there are repeated misunderstandings . " particularly the internal vernacular and terminology in a company are difficult to translate , according to hausschildt . companies in smaller countries do away with mother tongue a single company language can prevent such misunderstandings in addition to lowering costs .
nevertheless , the possible variations are limitless . " in small countries like norway , denmark and the netherlands , only english is spoken in companies .
they 've done away with their mother tongue all together , " said hausschildt . in most offices , there is a two-language culture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at siemens ' mobile phone plant in brazil , portuguese is spoken german banking giant deutsche bank is one example .
international queries are answered in english , questions from germany in german . siemens does it similarly , yet at the same time , it tries to promote an image as a company whose home is where the office is . " siemens is a global company , but in america we speak english , in india hindi , and in france french , " said company spokesman georg haux . fears of a manager what 's good for the goose , here the company , is n't necessarily good for the gander , in this case the employees .
managers frequently fear that their failure to speak a foreign language could hinder their chances of climbing further up the corporate ladder . " those who speak the mother tongue are preferred when it comes to managerial positions , " said hausschildt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when asking deutsche bank outside of germany , the response is in english even when a worker is better qualified , if the language skills are lacking , these shortcomings can cost them a promotion .
another problem confronts those who are good communicators and have even better than average english abilities - the loss of soft skills . " this is a terrible situation for many managers , " said expert hausschildt . back to basics those companies that do decide to put all their eggs in one basket and use english must exert a lot of energy in the beginning phase .
meetings take longer and any potential misunderstandings must be clarified . so that everyone manages to communicate on a similar level , or at least be able to , some companies resort to a basic english whose lexicon consists of between 400 and 800 , according to hausschildt .
in many offices , this minimum is mandatory . sonja lindenberg -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german banks grapple with change the recent takeover of germany 's hypovereinsbank by italy 's unicredito has led to speculation about further mergers and sales .

" it would n't make any sense to set our hopes too high , " he said .
yet he added : " it 's very important that there is no failure . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economy minister glos : not-so-great expectations the notion that a trade agreement could be signed at the talks was widely seen as unlikely , amid continued deep differences between developed and developing countries , particularly over agriculture . brazil , india cited europe was under renewed pressure to lower farm-tariff barriers ahead of the conference ; while assistance for poor states , including duty-free access , have become a litmus test for success . echoing remarks made by other european officials such as eu trade commissioner peter mandelson , glos pointed the finger at brazil and india , saying current negotiations with those countries on custom rights were proving difficult . he said he would see it as a success if the wto could merely agree on a timetable for talks next year . preparing for protests meanwhile , given the history of sometimes violent protest at wto conferences , a huge security operation went into effect , making ready for the tuesday meeting .
already on sunday anti-globalization protesters had taken to the streets in a march that turned out to be peaceful . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in geneva in 2001 , riot police controlled crowds but police and security officials have barricaded the wan chai district of hong kong , shopkeepers have boarded up their windows for fear of rioting , and police have stepped up patrols . the protesters are claiming the global economic system benefits rich nations at the expense of poor ones , and they say the wto goal of reducing trade barriers threatens the livelihoods of millions of people in developing countries . looking for success stories oliver moldenhauer from attac , a german anti-globalization group , explained why non-government organizations , or ngos , around the world have flocked to hong kong to fight the wto . " we need more rights for developing countries , whereas here at the wto conference the goal is especially to lower the tariffs of the developing countries , " he said .

poor nations say richer countries , especially the us and the european union , should cut subsidies that block cheaper farm imports from developing countries .
the us has offered to cut subsidies to farmers by 60 percent and tariffs by up to 90 percent .
the eu is willing to reduce agricultural subsidies by 70 percent and import tariffs by up to 60 percent , but developing countries say this is not enough . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protest group attac marching against wto in frankfurt in 2001 andrea maksimovic , campaign manager of the international confederation of free trade unions , is one of the few demonstrators who have come to hong kong who is not completely opposed to the wto meeting .

it needs to become more transparent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.12.2005 council of europe investigators release initial cia findings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the investigators believe that the cia has now emptied all secret prisons in europe the cia appears to have abducted people in europe and illegally transferred them to other countries , according to the initial results of a council of europe investigation released on tuesday . " legal proceedings under way in certain countries appear to show that individuals were abducted and transferred to other countries without respect for any legal assistance procedures , " council of europe rapporteur dick marty told a meeting of the body 's human rights committee in paris . the swiss senator said the results of his investigation lent credibility to reports that the cia flew terrorist suspects to and from secret prisons in europe .
marty added that he believed the united states was no longer holding prisoners clandestinely in europe .
it is suspected that the prisoners were moved to north africa in early november , when reports about secret us prisons first emerged in the washi n gto n post . " the elements we have gathered so far tend to reinforce the credibility of the allegations concerning the transport and temporary detention of detainees - outside all judicial procedure in european countries , " he said in an official statement , the first initial findings from the investigation into alleged cia flights and abductions in europe . the rapporteur " demands immediately that all member governments fully commit to uncovering the truth about flights and overflights on their territory in recent years , by aircraft transporting people arrested and detained outside of any legal procedure . " fear of legal " black hole " i n the heart of europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reports of cia prisons , like this one in kosovo , have raised concerns further .
the idea of a clandestine operation by the cia , possibly aided and abetted by unknown european states , is of particular concern to the investigators .
tony lloyd , a member of the council of europe committee , said : " the really difficult thing is the idea is that there is a kind of legal black hole in the middle of europe . " marty also criticized the united states for failing to provide information to the council of europe 's investigators and added that the us has never formally denied the allegations brought against the cia . us secretary of state condoleezza rice failed to rebut the cia prison and torture allegations during her recent visit to europe despite being repeatedly questioned about the affair , saying only that american interrogators were bound by a un treaty banning the use of torture , regardless of whether they were working in the us or abroad . marty bemoa n s lack of tra n spare n cy from rice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice failed to address the allegations fully , marty said .
" the rapporteur ... deplores the fact that no information or explanation had been provided on this point by ms. rice during her visit to europe , " marty said . claims have been mounting that the united states has been illegally using european airports and airspace to transport terror suspects as part of what the us central intelligence agency calls " extraordinary renditions . "
reports suggest that torture of suspects could have happened on flights in european airspace or at secret cia prisons on european soil . marty had words for european states that may have been involved in the transportation or internment of suspects on the cia 's behalf .
european states faced accusations of a serious breach of their human rights obligations if they had cooperated with the underground network , he said . complicit europea n states face harsh co n seque n ces bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suspected cia flights , like this one leaving frankfurt , have raised suspicions of european complicity .
" while it was still too early to assert that there had been any involvement or complicity of member states in illegal actions , the seriousness of the allegations and the consistency of the information gathered to date justified the continuation of an in-depth inquiry , " he said .
" if the allegations proved correct the member states would stand accused of having seriously breached their human rights obligations to the council of europe .

the world speaks english .
many german companies are making it their mother tongue .
some workers see this as an opportunity , others as a curse , for their careers .
yet corporate english is also a question of culture . the german business world is going through a tough transition period .
companies like technology giant siemens , auto manufacturer daimlerchrysler and software producer sap sell much more abroad than in germany - and nowadays , the language of business abroad is conducted primarily in english . already in 1999 , the publishing house bertelsmann began printing more and more books in english , which became the lingua franca .

" i find it surprising that a commitment made by the united states in the framework agreement last year to reform food aid ... should now be described as an obsession of the european union , " he said . " food aid for emergency relief can be a tool to advance development and for humanitarian relief but the large structured us program of food aid in kind is designed in reality to give support to us agricultural producers , " he said . " statistics show that the volume of this aid is directly related to the price shifts for the commodities concerned on the us market , " he added . last week , the heads of the world food program and unicef , plus the un high commissioner for refugees , called on wto negotiators to ensure food aid is protected . they said it would be even harder to get cash donations at a time when donations of food in kind are already slipping . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de at wto , security is tight and expectations low as the wto talks opened in hong kong tuesday , security was tight and key players , including germany , had lowered their expectations .

" legal proceedings under way in certain countries appear to show that individuals were abducted and transferred to other countries without respect for any legal assistance procedures , " council of europe rapporteur dick marty told a meeting of the body 's human rights committee in paris . the swiss senator said the results of his investigation lent credibility to reports that the cia flew terrorist suspects to and from secret prisons in europe .
marty added that he believed the united states was no longer holding prisoners clandestinely in europe .
it is suspected that the prisoners were moved to north africa in early november , when reports about secret us prisons first emerged in the washi n gto n post . " the elements we have gathered so far tend to reinforce the credibility of the allegations concerning the transport and temporary detention of detainees - outside all judicial procedure in european countries , " he said in an official statement , the first initial findings from the investigation into alleged cia flights and abductions in europe . the rapporteur " demands immediately that all member governments fully commit to uncovering the truth about flights and overflights on their territory in recent years , by aircraft transporting people arrested and detained outside of any legal procedure .

the idea of a clandestine operation by the cia , possibly aided and abetted by unknown european states , is of particular concern to the investigators .
tony lloyd , a member of the council of europe committee , said : " the really difficult thing is the idea is that there is a kind of legal black hole in the middle of europe . " marty also criticized the united states for failing to provide information to the council of europe 's investigators and added that the us has never formally denied the allegations brought against the cia . us secretary of state condoleezza rice failed to rebut the cia prison and torture allegations during her recent visit to europe despite being repeatedly questioned about the affair , saying only that american interrogators were bound by a un treaty banning the use of torture , regardless of whether they were working in the us or abroad . marty bemoa n s lack of tra n spare n cy from rice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice failed to address the allegations fully , marty said .
" the rapporteur ... deplores the fact that no information or explanation had been provided on this point by ms. rice during her visit to europe , " marty said . claims have been mounting that the united states has been illegally using european airports and airspace to transport terror suspects as part of what the us central intelligence agency calls " extraordinary renditions . "
reports suggest that torture of suspects could have happened on flights in european airspace or at secret cia prisons on european soil . marty had words for european states that may have been involved in the transportation or internment of suspects on the cia 's behalf .

" it would n't make any sense to set our hopes too high , " he said .
yet he added : " it 's very important that there is no failure . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economy minister glos : not-so-great expectations the notion that a trade agreement could be signed at the talks was widely seen as unlikely , amid continued deep differences between developed and developing countries , particularly over agriculture . brazil , india cited europe was under renewed pressure to lower farm-tariff barriers ahead of the conference ; while assistance for poor states , including duty-free access , have become a litmus test for success . echoing remarks made by other european officials such as eu trade commissioner peter mandelson , glos pointed the finger at brazil and india , saying current negotiations with those countries on custom rights were proving difficult . he said he would see it as a success if the wto could merely agree on a timetable for talks next year . preparing for protests meanwhile , given the history of sometimes violent protest at wto conferences , a huge security operation went into effect , making ready for the tuesday meeting .
already on sunday anti-globalization protesters had taken to the streets in a march that turned out to be peaceful . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in geneva in 2001 , riot police controlled crowds but police and security officials have barricaded the wan chai district of hong kong , shopkeepers have boarded up their windows for fear of rioting , and police have stepped up patrols . the protesters are claiming the global economic system benefits rich nations at the expense of poor ones , and they say the wto goal of reducing trade barriers threatens the livelihoods of millions of people in developing countries . looking for success stories oliver moldenhauer from attac , a german anti-globalization group , explained why non-government organizations , or ngos , around the world have flocked to hong kong to fight the wto . " we need more rights for developing countries , whereas here at the wto conference the goal is especially to lower the tariffs of the developing countries , " he said . " if we see the success stories of development in the last decades , say korea , say japan , say china , these have not been economies that follow the rules of free trade and free capital movement , " he said . farming is key the key issue this week in hong kong is agricultural trade .
poor nations say richer countries , especially the us and the european union , should cut subsidies that block cheaper farm imports from developing countries .
the us has offered to cut subsidies to farmers by 60 percent and tariffs by up to 90 percent .
the eu is willing to reduce agricultural subsidies by 70 percent and import tariffs by up to 60 percent , but developing countries say this is not enough . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protest group attac marching against wto in frankfurt in 2001 andrea maksimovic , campaign manager of the international confederation of free trade unions , is one of the few demonstrators who have come to hong kong who is not completely opposed to the wto meeting .
she just wants to be sure that whatever deal comes out of it , it is good for the workers . " we are only opposed to a bad deal , " maksimovic said .
" the multilateral trading system is important , because otherwise what you 'll have is a number of bilateral and unilateral agreements , where industrialized powerful countries can basically get whatever they want from the developing countries . " hoping for disaster " but we think there needs to be some reform of the wto in terms of its processes .

in keeping with german habits of recent years , some 1.2 billion euros worth of arms - approximately one third of german export licenses - went to states that also receive development aid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weapons and aid do n't mix " arms sales jeopardize the chances of effective aid and often stand in stark contradiction to the german government 's stated development policy aims , " jüsten said . moreover , germany 's 900,000 euros worth of weapons exported to china last year suggest the eu 's 16-year-old arms embargo against china is , as jüsten said , a " patchy " one . other destinations included conflict regions such as the middle east , while two thirds of germany 's arms exports head for the us . mystery of missi n g figures little looks set to change under chancellor angela merkel . " we noted with dismay that the recent coalition negotiations barely addressed the question of arms export , " said protestant church representative stephan reimers .
so far , the new government has refrained from agreeing any restrictive arms export policy . the gkke report is based on figures made available by the eu rather than the german government - which has yet to publish its annual arms export report . calls for tra n spare n cy in 1998 , the foreign ministers of the 15 european union member states adopted an eu code of conduct on arms exports , aimed to set common standards for the management of and restraint in arms exports from the eu , which is a politically binding agreement under which member states agree to abide by certain criteria when granting arms export licenses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arms sales - a cloudy issue " at a european level we have attained a satisfactory level of transparency , which the german government falls far short of , " said bernhard moltmann from the hesse foundation for peace and conflict research , pointing out that decisions relating to arms exports are taken behind closed doors by the german security council . " parliament needs to play a more active role when it comes to export licenses , " he said . and reimers added that the fact that a report on arms export in 2004 has yet to be published by the government " is in clear contempt of both the parliament and the public .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.12.2005 council of europe investigators release initial cia findings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the investigators believe that the cia has now emptied all secret prisons in europe the cia appears to have abducted people in europe and illegally transferred them to other countries , according to the initial results of a council of europe investigation released on tuesday . " legal proceedings under way in certain countries appear to show that individuals were abducted and transferred to other countries without respect for any legal assistance procedures , " council of europe rapporteur dick marty told a meeting of the body 's human rights committee in paris . the swiss senator said the results of his investigation lent credibility to reports that the cia flew terrorist suspects to and from secret prisons in europe .
marty added that he believed the united states was no longer holding prisoners clandestinely in europe .
it is suspected that the prisoners were moved to north africa in early november , when reports about secret us prisons first emerged in the washi n gto n post . " the elements we have gathered so far tend to reinforce the credibility of the allegations concerning the transport and temporary detention of detainees - outside all judicial procedure in european countries , " he said in an official statement , the first initial findings from the investigation into alleged cia flights and abductions in europe . the rapporteur " demands immediately that all member governments fully commit to uncovering the truth about flights and overflights on their territory in recent years , by aircraft transporting people arrested and detained outside of any legal procedure . " fear of legal " black hole " i n the heart of europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reports of cia prisons , like this one in kosovo , have raised concerns further .
the idea of a clandestine operation by the cia , possibly aided and abetted by unknown european states , is of particular concern to the investigators .
tony lloyd , a member of the council of europe committee , said : " the really difficult thing is the idea is that there is a kind of legal black hole in the middle of europe . " marty also criticized the united states for failing to provide information to the council of europe 's investigators and added that the us has never formally denied the allegations brought against the cia . us secretary of state condoleezza rice failed to rebut the cia prison and torture allegations during her recent visit to europe despite being repeatedly questioned about the affair , saying only that american interrogators were bound by a un treaty banning the use of torture , regardless of whether they were working in the us or abroad . marty bemoa n s lack of tra n spare n cy from rice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice failed to address the allegations fully , marty said .
" the rapporteur ... deplores the fact that no information or explanation had been provided on this point by ms. rice during her visit to europe , " marty said . claims have been mounting that the united states has been illegally using european airports and airspace to transport terror suspects as part of what the us central intelligence agency calls " extraordinary renditions . "
reports suggest that torture of suspects could have happened on flights in european airspace or at secret cia prisons on european soil . marty had words for european states that may have been involved in the transportation or internment of suspects on the cia 's behalf .
european states faced accusations of a serious breach of their human rights obligations if they had cooperated with the underground network , he said . complicit europea n states face harsh co n seque n ces bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suspected cia flights , like this one leaving frankfurt , have raised suspicions of european complicity .
" while it was still too early to assert that there had been any involvement or complicity of member states in illegal actions , the seriousness of the allegations and the consistency of the information gathered to date justified the continuation of an in-depth inquiry , " he said .
" if the allegations proved correct the member states would stand accused of having seriously breached their human rights obligations to the council of europe .

marty added that he believed the united states was no longer holding prisoners clandestinely in europe .
it is suspected that the prisoners were moved to north africa in early november , when reports about secret us prisons first emerged in the washi n gto n post . " the elements we have gathered so far tend to reinforce the credibility of the allegations concerning the transport and temporary detention of detainees - outside all judicial procedure in european countries , " he said in an official statement , the first initial findings from the investigation into alleged cia flights and abductions in europe . the rapporteur " demands immediately that all member governments fully commit to uncovering the truth about flights and overflights on their territory in recent years , by aircraft transporting people arrested and detained outside of any legal procedure .

the idea of a clandestine operation by the cia , possibly aided and abetted by unknown european states , is of particular concern to the investigators .
tony lloyd , a member of the council of europe committee , said : " the really difficult thing is the idea is that there is a kind of legal black hole in the middle of europe . " marty also criticized the united states for failing to provide information to the council of europe 's investigators and added that the us has never formally denied the allegations brought against the cia . us secretary of state condoleezza rice failed to rebut the cia prison and torture allegations during her recent visit to europe despite being repeatedly questioned about the affair , saying only that american interrogators were bound by a un treaty banning the use of torture , regardless of whether they were working in the us or abroad . marty bemoa n s lack of tra n spare n cy from rice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice failed to address the allegations fully , marty said .
" the rapporteur ... deplores the fact that no information or explanation had been provided on this point by ms. rice during her visit to europe , " marty said . claims have been mounting that the united states has been illegally using european airports and airspace to transport terror suspects as part of what the us central intelligence agency calls " extraordinary renditions . "
reports suggest that torture of suspects could have happened on flights in european airspace or at secret cia prisons on european soil . marty had words for european states that may have been involved in the transportation or internment of suspects on the cia 's behalf .
european states faced accusations of a serious breach of their human rights obligations if they had cooperated with the underground network , he said . complicit europea n states face harsh co n seque n ces bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suspected cia flights , like this one leaving frankfurt , have raised suspicions of european complicity .
" while it was still too early to assert that there had been any involvement or complicity of member states in illegal actions , the seriousness of the allegations and the consistency of the information gathered to date justified the continuation of an in-depth inquiry , " he said .

" in the home country of english , the world language , the task of persuasion is especially difficult , " he added .
" i firmly believe this is also a matter of social justice because languages facilitate social mobility . " joe brown was the 2005 winner of the german teacher awards presented by the german embassy in london .
he works at a number of inner-city elementary schools and told dw-world that the main problems with language-learning occur at high-school level . " younger children enjoy learning german , and do n't tend to have any of the prejudices you find with older kids , " he said .
" starting early is therefore the best option , and in fact , you can argue it 's an ideal language for small children because the pronunciation is n't hard and it 's very logical . " the traditionally hostile relations between britain and germany also play a role .
" you have to break down prejudices , " said brown .
" it 's also a question of inter-cultural education . " plunging numbers informing matussek 's remarks were figures published by the national languages center showing that the number of high school pupils studying languages has slumped by more than 64,000 this year - the first year since languages became an optional subject for 14- to 16-year-olds . learning a language beyond the age of 14 is now compulsory in just one quarter of england 's state schools , where second languages have traditionally been french or german . the latter is particularly out of favor , with some 105,288 students taking junior high school exams in german , and 272,140 in french - but even the number of senior high school students taking french has plunged by almost half . " the problem is , german just is n't considered a young person 's language , " explained brown .
" teenagers these days want to learn spanish , because spain 's a popular holiday destination and it 's seen as more of a world language than german and french . " universities bear the brunt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oxford university one long-term consequence of the shrinking number of pupils learning german is already being felt by university modern language departments , which have fewer applicants than ever before and face a growing threat of closure as the popularity - and usefulness - of german degrees continues to wane . but as brown points out , it 's a vicious circle .
" there just are n't enough people coming through the system to deliver german as a foreign language , " he said .
" a high percentage of adults in britain say they wish they spoke a foreign language , but they did n't capitalize on the opportunities they had to learn .

" in the home country of english , the world language , the task of persuasion is especially difficult , " he added .
" i firmly believe this is also a matter of social justice because languages facilitate social mobility . " joe brown was the 2005 winner of the german teacher awards presented by the german embassy in london .
he works at a number of inner-city elementary schools and told dw-world that the main problems with language-learning occur at high-school level . " younger children enjoy learning german , and do n't tend to have any of the prejudices you find with older kids , " he said .
" starting early is therefore the best option , and in fact , you can argue it 's an ideal language for small children because the pronunciation is n't hard and it 's very logical . " the traditionally hostile relations between britain and germany also play a role .
" you have to break down prejudices , " said brown .
" it 's also a question of inter-cultural education . " plunging numbers informing matussek 's remarks were figures published by the national languages center showing that the number of high school pupils studying languages has slumped by more than 64,000 this year - the first year since languages became an optional subject for 14- to 16-year-olds . learning a language beyond the age of 14 is now compulsory in just one quarter of england 's state schools , where second languages have traditionally been french or german . the latter is particularly out of favor , with some 105,288 students taking junior high school exams in german , and 272,140 in french - but even the number of senior high school students taking french has plunged by almost half .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.12.2005 german economics minister says : nuclear power should stay großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crucial to the economy , glos says even though germany 's grand coalition agreed to make no changes to a plan to gradually phase out nuclear power in germany , german economics minister michael glos believes it should remain . nuclear power should play a role in electricity production in germany in the future and therefore germany needs to reconsider closing its reactors , glos told the fra n kfurter allgemei n e so n n tagszeitu n g .
" we need a broad energy mix to guarantee supplies at low prices , " he said .
" it does n't make any sense for us to buy electricity produced by nuclear power from our neighbors but to totally turn our backs on it ourselves . "
germany 's grand coalition of conservative christian union parties and their social democratic partners disagree on nuclear policy but agreed to stick to a plan created by the social democrats and greens in 2000 to phase out the country 's nuclear power facilities .
glos is a member of the christian social union , the bavarian sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union .
two dow n , so far one of the most crucial pieces of legislation passed by outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , in the eyes of many , was a planned phase-out of germany 's atomic energy plants by 2020 .
the idea , largely pressed by the environmentally-friendly greens , was to focus on renewable energy and away from a crippling dependence on oil .
it also found support at a time when safety concerns over nuclear power reactors were highlighted with accidents like the one in chernobyl in 1986 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : due to close in 2008 so far , the government has closed two nuclear reactors .
the remaining 17 , owned by utilities rwe ag , e.on ag and enbw , are to be closed over the next 15 years .
the next due to close , according to the environment ministry , is rwe 's " biblis a " reactor , in 2008 .
merkel wa n ts to stop n uclear phase out the conservatives led by chancellor-designate angela merkel have made no secret of the fact that they intend to put the brakes on the nuclear-phase out .
earlier this year , merkel argued in a speech that if germany is no longer active in nuclear power , it would have no influence on the international market when it comes to exporting nuclear technology .
the conservatives are keen to provide germany , a large importer of oil and gas , with greater energy security and allow the energy industry to earn more by extending the life of their plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agree to disgree , for now " in my view , an ideologically motivated nuclear phase-out does not reflect economic demands , " merkel said , citing the fact that countries such as india and china are expanding their nuclear energy capacities . " for me , the question is , how can germany , with its technical know-how , profit from this export potential .
as a patriot , i would like to see my country profit from our expertise , not watch others take the profits . "
but , michael müller , vice-chairman of the spd parliamentary group demanded that the conservatives finally recognize that they " have no chance " to chip away at nuclear phase-out with the spd .
müller argued that if the nuclear plants were indeed allowed to run longer , they would have to undergo updated security modifications - something that would cost money , he said .

" we need a broad energy mix to guarantee supplies at low prices , " he said .
" it does n't make any sense for us to buy electricity produced by nuclear power from our neighbors but to totally turn our backs on it ourselves . "
germany 's grand coalition of conservative christian union parties and their social democratic partners disagree on nuclear policy but agreed to stick to a plan created by the social democrats and greens in 2000 to phase out the country 's nuclear power facilities .
glos is a member of the christian social union , the bavarian sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union .
two dow n , so far one of the most crucial pieces of legislation passed by outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , in the eyes of many , was a planned phase-out of germany 's atomic energy plants by 2020 .
the idea , largely pressed by the environmentally-friendly greens , was to focus on renewable energy and away from a crippling dependence on oil .
it also found support at a time when safety concerns over nuclear power reactors were highlighted with accidents like the one in chernobyl in 1986 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : due to close in 2008 so far , the government has closed two nuclear reactors .
the remaining 17 , owned by utilities rwe ag , e.on ag and enbw , are to be closed over the next 15 years .
the next due to close , according to the environment ministry , is rwe 's " biblis a " reactor , in 2008 .
merkel wa n ts to stop n uclear phase out the conservatives led by chancellor-designate angela merkel have made no secret of the fact that they intend to put the brakes on the nuclear-phase out .
earlier this year , merkel argued in a speech that if germany is no longer active in nuclear power , it would have no influence on the international market when it comes to exporting nuclear technology .
the conservatives are keen to provide germany , a large importer of oil and gas , with greater energy security and allow the energy industry to earn more by extending the life of their plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agree to disgree , for now " in my view , an ideologically motivated nuclear phase-out does not reflect economic demands , " merkel said , citing the fact that countries such as india and china are expanding their nuclear energy capacities . " for me , the question is , how can germany , with its technical know-how , profit from this export potential .
as a patriot , i would like to see my country profit from our expertise , not watch others take the profits . "
but , michael müller , vice-chairman of the spd parliamentary group demanded that the conservatives finally recognize that they " have no chance " to chip away at nuclear phase-out with the spd .
müller argued that if the nuclear plants were indeed allowed to run longer , they would have to undergo updated security modifications - something that would cost money , he said .

merkel wa n ts to stop n uclear phase out the conservatives led by chancellor-designate angela merkel have made no secret of the fact that they intend to put the brakes on the nuclear-phase out .
earlier this year , merkel argued in a speech that if germany is no longer active in nuclear power , it would have no influence on the international market when it comes to exporting nuclear technology .
the conservatives are keen to provide germany , a large importer of oil and gas , with greater energy security and allow the energy industry to earn more by extending the life of their plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agree to disgree , for now " in my view , an ideologically motivated nuclear phase-out does not reflect economic demands , " merkel said , citing the fact that countries such as india and china are expanding their nuclear energy capacities . " for me , the question is , how can germany , with its technical know-how , profit from this export potential .
as a patriot , i would like to see my country profit from our expertise , not watch others take the profits . "
but , michael müller , vice-chairman of the spd parliamentary group demanded that the conservatives finally recognize that they " have no chance " to chip away at nuclear phase-out with the spd .
müller argued that if the nuclear plants were indeed allowed to run longer , they would have to undergo updated security modifications - something that would cost money , he said .
maki n g a comeback one thing that 's bolstered the conservatives ' case is the fact that nuclear energy has been gradually making a comeback in europe with the first new nuclear plant on the continent in years being built in finland .
its supporters also point out that nuclear reactors emit virtually no greenhouse gases .
" we should not turn our backs on a technology of the future , " glos told the newspaper .

" legal proceedings under way in certain countries appear to show that individuals were abducted and transferred to other countries without respect for any legal assistance procedures , " council of europe rapporteur dick marty told a meeting of the body 's human rights committee in paris . the swiss senator said the results of his investigation lent credibility to reports that the cia flew terrorist suspects to and from secret prisons in europe .
marty added that he believed the united states was no longer holding prisoners clandestinely in europe .
it is suspected that the prisoners were moved to north africa in early november , when reports about secret us prisons first emerged in the washi n gto n post . " the elements we have gathered so far tend to reinforce the credibility of the allegations concerning the transport and temporary detention of detainees - outside all judicial procedure in european countries , " he said in an official statement , the first initial findings from the investigation into alleged cia flights and abductions in europe . the rapporteur " demands immediately that all member governments fully commit to uncovering the truth about flights and overflights on their territory in recent years , by aircraft transporting people arrested and detained outside of any legal procedure . " fear of legal " black hole " i n the heart of europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reports of cia prisons , like this one in kosovo , have raised concerns further .
the idea of a clandestine operation by the cia , possibly aided and abetted by unknown european states , is of particular concern to the investigators .
tony lloyd , a member of the council of europe committee , said : " the really difficult thing is the idea is that there is a kind of legal black hole in the middle of europe . " marty also criticized the united states for failing to provide information to the council of europe 's investigators and added that the us has never formally denied the allegations brought against the cia . us secretary of state condoleezza rice failed to rebut the cia prison and torture allegations during her recent visit to europe despite being repeatedly questioned about the affair , saying only that american interrogators were bound by a un treaty banning the use of torture , regardless of whether they were working in the us or abroad . marty bemoa n s lack of tra n spare n cy from rice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice failed to address the allegations fully , marty said .
" the rapporteur ... deplores the fact that no information or explanation had been provided on this point by ms. rice during her visit to europe , " marty said . claims have been mounting that the united states has been illegally using european airports and airspace to transport terror suspects as part of what the us central intelligence agency calls " extraordinary renditions . "
reports suggest that torture of suspects could have happened on flights in european airspace or at secret cia prisons on european soil . marty had words for european states that may have been involved in the transportation or internment of suspects on the cia 's behalf .
european states faced accusations of a serious breach of their human rights obligations if they had cooperated with the underground network , he said . complicit europea n states face harsh co n seque n ces bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suspected cia flights , like this one leaving frankfurt , have raised suspicions of european complicity .
" while it was still too early to assert that there had been any involvement or complicity of member states in illegal actions , the seriousness of the allegations and the consistency of the information gathered to date justified the continuation of an in-depth inquiry , " he said .
" if the allegations proved correct the member states would stand accused of having seriously breached their human rights obligations to the council of europe .

the world speaks english .
many german companies are making it their mother tongue .
some workers see this as an opportunity , others as a curse , for their careers .
yet corporate english is also a question of culture . the german business world is going through a tough transition period .
companies like technology giant siemens , auto manufacturer daimlerchrysler and software producer sap sell much more abroad than in germany - and nowadays , the language of business abroad is conducted primarily in english . already in 1999 , the publishing house bertelsmann began printing more and more books in english , which became the lingua franca .
other publishers soon followed suit . when the munich-based hypovereinsbank merged with italy 's unicredito , the boards decided that instead of denigrating german or italian by snubbing one over the other , they would use english in the company 's official communications - a fact that 's more befitting a bank of its size anyway . multilingualism costs money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : english resulted when german hvb group merged with italian unicredito in the international business world , fusions , takeovers and global interests are forcing corporations - in the plain interest of economics - to make one language the official company tongue , and that is usually english .
a multilingual environment is simply expensive .
interpreters and translators are necessary during talks and for internal communication , something that adds up over the long run . " that quickly becomes economically unfeasible , " said business expert jürgen hausschildt .
" and in spite of translations , there are repeated misunderstandings . " particularly the internal vernacular and terminology in a company are difficult to translate , according to hausschildt . companies in smaller countries do away with mother tongue a single company language can prevent such misunderstandings in addition to lowering costs .
nevertheless , the possible variations are limitless . " in small countries like norway , denmark and the netherlands , only english is spoken in companies .
they 've done away with their mother tongue all together , " said hausschildt . in most offices , there is a two-language culture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at siemens ' mobile phone plant in brazil , portuguese is spoken german banking giant deutsche bank is one example .
international queries are answered in english , questions from germany in german . siemens does it similarly , yet at the same time , it tries to promote an image as a company whose home is where the office is . " siemens is a global company , but in america we speak english , in india hindi , and in france french , " said company spokesman georg haux . fears of a manager what 's good for the goose , here the company , is n't necessarily good for the gander , in this case the employees .
managers frequently fear that their failure to speak a foreign language could hinder their chances of climbing further up the corporate ladder . " those who speak the mother tongue are preferred when it comes to managerial positions , " said hausschildt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when asking deutsche bank outside of germany , the response is in english even when a worker is better qualified , if the language skills are lacking , these shortcomings can cost them a promotion .
another problem confronts those who are good communicators and have even better than average english abilities - the loss of soft skills . " this is a terrible situation for many managers , " said expert hausschildt . back to basics those companies that do decide to put all their eggs in one basket and use english must exert a lot of energy in the beginning phase .
meetings take longer and any potential misunderstandings must be clarified . so that everyone manages to communicate on a similar level , or at least be able to , some companies resort to a basic english whose lexicon consists of between 400 and 800 , according to hausschildt .
in many offices , this minimum is mandatory . sonja lindenberg -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german banks grapple with change the recent takeover of germany 's hypovereinsbank by italy 's unicredito has led to speculation about further mergers and sales .

" a lot of silly things are being spread in the political community and in the media , " he told süddeutsche zeitu n g in his first public comments on the issue .

" but gerhard schröder is a private individual and can do what he wants . " meanwhile , criticism of the chancellor 's actions has led to a call for a new code of conduct that would limit government officials ' employment in the private sector after leaving office .
chancellor angela merkel is open to such an initiative , officials said . christian wulff , a leading member of merkel 's christian democratic union party , said he should not take the position .

" legal proceedings under way in certain countries appear to show that individuals were abducted and transferred to other countries without respect for any legal assistance procedures , " council of europe rapporteur dick marty told a meeting of the body 's human rights committee in paris . the swiss senator said the results of his investigation lent credibility to reports that the cia flew terrorist suspects to and from secret prisons in europe .
marty added that he believed the united states was no longer holding prisoners clandestinely in europe .
it is suspected that the prisoners were moved to north africa in early november , when reports about secret us prisons first emerged in the washi n gto n post . " the elements we have gathered so far tend to reinforce the credibility of the allegations concerning the transport and temporary detention of detainees - outside all judicial procedure in european countries , " he said in an official statement , the first initial findings from the investigation into alleged cia flights and abductions in europe . the rapporteur " demands immediately that all member governments fully commit to uncovering the truth about flights and overflights on their territory in recent years , by aircraft transporting people arrested and detained outside of any legal procedure . " fear of legal " black hole " i n the heart of europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reports of cia prisons , like this one in kosovo , have raised concerns further .
the idea of a clandestine operation by the cia , possibly aided and abetted by unknown european states , is of particular concern to the investigators .
tony lloyd , a member of the council of europe committee , said : " the really difficult thing is the idea is that there is a kind of legal black hole in the middle of europe . " marty also criticized the united states for failing to provide information to the council of europe 's investigators and added that the us has never formally denied the allegations brought against the cia . us secretary of state condoleezza rice failed to rebut the cia prison and torture allegations during her recent visit to europe despite being repeatedly questioned about the affair , saying only that american interrogators were bound by a un treaty banning the use of torture , regardless of whether they were working in the us or abroad . marty bemoa n s lack of tra n spare n cy from rice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice failed to address the allegations fully , marty said .
" the rapporteur ... deplores the fact that no information or explanation had been provided on this point by ms. rice during her visit to europe , " marty said . claims have been mounting that the united states has been illegally using european airports and airspace to transport terror suspects as part of what the us central intelligence agency calls " extraordinary renditions . "
reports suggest that torture of suspects could have happened on flights in european airspace or at secret cia prisons on european soil . marty had words for european states that may have been involved in the transportation or internment of suspects on the cia 's behalf .
european states faced accusations of a serious breach of their human rights obligations if they had cooperated with the underground network , he said . complicit europea n states face harsh co n seque n ces bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suspected cia flights , like this one leaving frankfurt , have raised suspicions of european complicity .
" while it was still too early to assert that there had been any involvement or complicity of member states in illegal actions , the seriousness of the allegations and the consistency of the information gathered to date justified the continuation of an in-depth inquiry , " he said .
" if the allegations proved correct the member states would stand accused of having seriously breached their human rights obligations to the council of europe .

" legal proceedings under way in certain countries appear to show that individuals were abducted and transferred to other countries without respect for any legal assistance procedures , " council of europe rapporteur dick marty told a meeting of the body 's human rights committee in paris . the swiss senator said the results of his investigation lent credibility to reports that the cia flew terrorist suspects to and from secret prisons in europe .
marty added that he believed the united states was no longer holding prisoners clandestinely in europe .
it is suspected that the prisoners were moved to north africa in early november , when reports about secret us prisons first emerged in the washi n gto n post . " the elements we have gathered so far tend to reinforce the credibility of the allegations concerning the transport and temporary detention of detainees - outside all judicial procedure in european countries , " he said in an official statement , the first initial findings from the investigation into alleged cia flights and abductions in europe . the rapporteur " demands immediately that all member governments fully commit to uncovering the truth about flights and overflights on their territory in recent years , by aircraft transporting people arrested and detained outside of any legal procedure . " fear of legal " black hole " i n the heart of europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reports of cia prisons , like this one in kosovo , have raised concerns further .
the idea of a clandestine operation by the cia , possibly aided and abetted by unknown european states , is of particular concern to the investigators .
tony lloyd , a member of the council of europe committee , said : " the really difficult thing is the idea is that there is a kind of legal black hole in the middle of europe . " marty also criticized the united states for failing to provide information to the council of europe 's investigators and added that the us has never formally denied the allegations brought against the cia . us secretary of state condoleezza rice failed to rebut the cia prison and torture allegations during her recent visit to europe despite being repeatedly questioned about the affair , saying only that american interrogators were bound by a un treaty banning the use of torture , regardless of whether they were working in the us or abroad . marty bemoa n s lack of tra n spare n cy from rice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice failed to address the allegations fully , marty said .
" the rapporteur ... deplores the fact that no information or explanation had been provided on this point by ms. rice during her visit to europe , " marty said . claims have been mounting that the united states has been illegally using european airports and airspace to transport terror suspects as part of what the us central intelligence agency calls " extraordinary renditions . "
reports suggest that torture of suspects could have happened on flights in european airspace or at secret cia prisons on european soil . marty had words for european states that may have been involved in the transportation or internment of suspects on the cia 's behalf .
european states faced accusations of a serious breach of their human rights obligations if they had cooperated with the underground network , he said . complicit europea n states face harsh co n seque n ces bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suspected cia flights , like this one leaving frankfurt , have raised suspicions of european complicity .
" while it was still too early to assert that there had been any involvement or complicity of member states in illegal actions , the seriousness of the allegations and the consistency of the information gathered to date justified the continuation of an in-depth inquiry , " he said .

a secure pension plan can keep you going in the twilight years of your life when the last 40 or so years of work are just a bad and distant memory .
but few people consider that the benefits from a good pension can stretch beyond the grave . one person , however , did consider this .

a secure pension plan can keep you going in the twilight years of your life when the last 40 or so years of work are just a bad and distant memory .
but few people consider that the benefits from a good pension can stretch beyond the grave . one person , however , did consider this .
but it was n't the german woman 's pension that kept on giving when the toes curled up - it was the pension of her dead father-in-law which she continued to claim for two decades past his departure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enjoy your pension , ladies , you 've earned it even though her father-in-law passed away in 1977 , the berlin resident continued to squirrel his pension payments away until 1997 after changing the bank account details from the dead man 's to her own .
the authorities remained in the dark all that time , even sending the dead man congratulatory letters on his 100th , 101st and 102nd birthdays . however , the scam was recently discovered after the father-in-law 's death was made known to the pension authorities through another state department .
last week , the woman was ordered by a court in the german capital to repay the full amount of € 429,000 -lrb- $ 506,000 -rrb- to the government .

the world speaks english .
many german companies are making it their mother tongue .
some workers see this as an opportunity , others as a curse , for their careers .
yet corporate english is also a question of culture . the german business world is going through a tough transition period .
companies like technology giant siemens , auto manufacturer daimlerchrysler and software producer sap sell much more abroad than in germany - and nowadays , the language of business abroad is conducted primarily in english . already in 1999 , the publishing house bertelsmann began printing more and more books in english , which became the lingua franca .
other publishers soon followed suit . when the munich-based hypovereinsbank merged with italy 's unicredito , the boards decided that instead of denigrating german or italian by snubbing one over the other , they would use english in the company 's official communications - a fact that 's more befitting a bank of its size anyway . multilingualism costs money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : english resulted when german hvb group merged with italian unicredito in the international business world , fusions , takeovers and global interests are forcing corporations - in the plain interest of economics - to make one language the official company tongue , and that is usually english .
a multilingual environment is simply expensive .
interpreters and translators are necessary during talks and for internal communication , something that adds up over the long run . " that quickly becomes economically unfeasible , " said business expert jürgen hausschildt .
" and in spite of translations , there are repeated misunderstandings . " particularly the internal vernacular and terminology in a company are difficult to translate , according to hausschildt . companies in smaller countries do away with mother tongue a single company language can prevent such misunderstandings in addition to lowering costs .
nevertheless , the possible variations are limitless . " in small countries like norway , denmark and the netherlands , only english is spoken in companies .
they 've done away with their mother tongue all together , " said hausschildt . in most offices , there is a two-language culture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at siemens ' mobile phone plant in brazil , portuguese is spoken german banking giant deutsche bank is one example .
international queries are answered in english , questions from germany in german . siemens does it similarly , yet at the same time , it tries to promote an image as a company whose home is where the office is .

" we need a broad energy mix to guarantee supplies at low prices , " he said .
" it does n't make any sense for us to buy electricity produced by nuclear power from our neighbors but to totally turn our backs on it ourselves . "
germany 's grand coalition of conservative christian union parties and their social democratic partners disagree on nuclear policy but agreed to stick to a plan created by the social democrats and greens in 2000 to phase out the country 's nuclear power facilities .
glos is a member of the christian social union , the bavarian sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union .
two dow n , so far one of the most crucial pieces of legislation passed by outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , in the eyes of many , was a planned phase-out of germany 's atomic energy plants by 2020 .
the idea , largely pressed by the environmentally-friendly greens , was to focus on renewable energy and away from a crippling dependence on oil .
it also found support at a time when safety concerns over nuclear power reactors were highlighted with accidents like the one in chernobyl in 1986 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : due to close in 2008 so far , the government has closed two nuclear reactors .
the remaining 17 , owned by utilities rwe ag , e.on ag and enbw , are to be closed over the next 15 years .
the next due to close , according to the environment ministry , is rwe 's " biblis a " reactor , in 2008 .
merkel wa n ts to stop n uclear phase out the conservatives led by chancellor-designate angela merkel have made no secret of the fact that they intend to put the brakes on the nuclear-phase out .
earlier this year , merkel argued in a speech that if germany is no longer active in nuclear power , it would have no influence on the international market when it comes to exporting nuclear technology .
the conservatives are keen to provide germany , a large importer of oil and gas , with greater energy security and allow the energy industry to earn more by extending the life of their plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agree to disgree , for now " in my view , an ideologically motivated nuclear phase-out does not reflect economic demands , " merkel said , citing the fact that countries such as india and china are expanding their nuclear energy capacities . " for me , the question is , how can germany , with its technical know-how , profit from this export potential .
as a patriot , i would like to see my country profit from our expertise , not watch others take the profits . "
but , michael müller , vice-chairman of the spd parliamentary group demanded that the conservatives finally recognize that they " have no chance " to chip away at nuclear phase-out with the spd .
müller argued that if the nuclear plants were indeed allowed to run longer , they would have to undergo updated security modifications - something that would cost money , he said .
maki n g a comeback one thing that 's bolstered the conservatives ' case is the fact that nuclear energy has been gradually making a comeback in europe with the first new nuclear plant on the continent in years being built in finland .
its supporters also point out that nuclear reactors emit virtually no greenhouse gases .
" we should not turn our backs on a technology of the future , " glos told the newspaper .

" we need a broad energy mix to guarantee supplies at low prices , " he said .
" it does n't make any sense for us to buy electricity produced by nuclear power from our neighbors but to totally turn our backs on it ourselves . "
germany 's grand coalition of conservative christian union parties and their social democratic partners disagree on nuclear policy but agreed to stick to a plan created by the social democrats and greens in 2000 to phase out the country 's nuclear power facilities .
glos is a member of the christian social union , the bavarian sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union .
two dow n , so far one of the most crucial pieces of legislation passed by outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , in the eyes of many , was a planned phase-out of germany 's atomic energy plants by 2020 .
the idea , largely pressed by the environmentally-friendly greens , was to focus on renewable energy and away from a crippling dependence on oil .
it also found support at a time when safety concerns over nuclear power reactors were highlighted with accidents like the one in chernobyl in 1986 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : due to close in 2008 so far , the government has closed two nuclear reactors .
the remaining 17 , owned by utilities rwe ag , e.on ag and enbw , are to be closed over the next 15 years .
the next due to close , according to the environment ministry , is rwe 's " biblis a " reactor , in 2008 .
merkel wa n ts to stop n uclear phase out the conservatives led by chancellor-designate angela merkel have made no secret of the fact that they intend to put the brakes on the nuclear-phase out .
earlier this year , merkel argued in a speech that if germany is no longer active in nuclear power , it would have no influence on the international market when it comes to exporting nuclear technology .
the conservatives are keen to provide germany , a large importer of oil and gas , with greater energy security and allow the energy industry to earn more by extending the life of their plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agree to disgree , for now " in my view , an ideologically motivated nuclear phase-out does not reflect economic demands , " merkel said , citing the fact that countries such as india and china are expanding their nuclear energy capacities . " for me , the question is , how can germany , with its technical know-how , profit from this export potential .
as a patriot , i would like to see my country profit from our expertise , not watch others take the profits . "
but , michael müller , vice-chairman of the spd parliamentary group demanded that the conservatives finally recognize that they " have no chance " to chip away at nuclear phase-out with the spd .
müller argued that if the nuclear plants were indeed allowed to run longer , they would have to undergo updated security modifications - something that would cost money , he said .
maki n g a comeback one thing that 's bolstered the conservatives ' case is the fact that nuclear energy has been gradually making a comeback in europe with the first new nuclear plant on the continent in years being built in finland .
its supporters also point out that nuclear reactors emit virtually no greenhouse gases .

" in the home country of english , the world language , the task of persuasion is especially difficult , " he added .
" i firmly believe this is also a matter of social justice because languages facilitate social mobility . " joe brown was the 2005 winner of the german teacher awards presented by the german embassy in london .
he works at a number of inner-city elementary schools and told dw-world that the main problems with language-learning occur at high-school level . " younger children enjoy learning german , and do n't tend to have any of the prejudices you find with older kids , " he said .
" starting early is therefore the best option , and in fact , you can argue it 's an ideal language for small children because the pronunciation is n't hard and it 's very logical . " the traditionally hostile relations between britain and germany also play a role .
" you have to break down prejudices , " said brown .
" it 's also a question of inter-cultural education . " plunging numbers informing matussek 's remarks were figures published by the national languages center showing that the number of high school pupils studying languages has slumped by more than 64,000 this year - the first year since languages became an optional subject for 14- to 16-year-olds . learning a language beyond the age of 14 is now compulsory in just one quarter of england 's state schools , where second languages have traditionally been french or german . the latter is particularly out of favor , with some 105,288 students taking junior high school exams in german , and 272,140 in french - but even the number of senior high school students taking french has plunged by almost half . " the problem is , german just is n't considered a young person 's language , " explained brown .

" universities bear the brunt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oxford university one long-term consequence of the shrinking number of pupils learning german is already being felt by university modern language departments , which have fewer applicants than ever before and face a growing threat of closure as the popularity - and usefulness - of german degrees continues to wane . but as brown points out , it 's a vicious circle .
" there just are n't enough people coming through the system to deliver german as a foreign language , " he said .
" a high percentage of adults in britain say they wish they spoke a foreign language , but they did n't capitalize on the opportunities they had to learn .

" in the home country of english , the world language , the task of persuasion is especially difficult , " he added .
" i firmly believe this is also a matter of social justice because languages facilitate social mobility . " joe brown was the 2005 winner of the german teacher awards presented by the german embassy in london .
he works at a number of inner-city elementary schools and told dw-world that the main problems with language-learning occur at high-school level . " younger children enjoy learning german , and do n't tend to have any of the prejudices you find with older kids , " he said .
" starting early is therefore the best option , and in fact , you can argue it 's an ideal language for small children because the pronunciation is n't hard and it 's very logical . " the traditionally hostile relations between britain and germany also play a role .
" you have to break down prejudices , " said brown .
" it 's also a question of inter-cultural education . " plunging numbers informing matussek 's remarks were figures published by the national languages center showing that the number of high school pupils studying languages has slumped by more than 64,000 this year - the first year since languages became an optional subject for 14- to 16-year-olds . learning a language beyond the age of 14 is now compulsory in just one quarter of england 's state schools , where second languages have traditionally been french or german . the latter is particularly out of favor , with some 105,288 students taking junior high school exams in german , and 272,140 in french - but even the number of senior high school students taking french has plunged by almost half . " the problem is , german just is n't considered a young person 's language , " explained brown .
" teenagers these days want to learn spanish , because spain 's a popular holiday destination and it 's seen as more of a world language than german and french . " universities bear the brunt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oxford university one long-term consequence of the shrinking number of pupils learning german is already being felt by university modern language departments , which have fewer applicants than ever before and face a growing threat of closure as the popularity - and usefulness - of german degrees continues to wane . but as brown points out , it 's a vicious circle .
" there just are n't enough people coming through the system to deliver german as a foreign language , " he said .
" a high percentage of adults in britain say they wish they spoke a foreign language , but they did n't capitalize on the opportunities they had to learn .
often , this was because it was n't taught well and the curriculum was n't interesting enough . " " britain faces the great task of changing this trend , " said matussek at the conference .

" i find it surprising that a commitment made by the united states in the framework agreement last year to reform food aid ... should now be described as an obsession of the european union , " he said . " food aid for emergency relief can be a tool to advance development and for humanitarian relief but the large structured us program of food aid in kind is designed in reality to give support to us agricultural producers , " he said . " statistics show that the volume of this aid is directly related to the price shifts for the commodities concerned on the us market , " he added . last week , the heads of the world food program and unicef , plus the un high commissioner for refugees , called on wto negotiators to ensure food aid is protected . they said it would be even harder to get cash donations at a time when donations of food in kind are already slipping . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de at wto , security is tight and expectations low as the wto talks opened in hong kong tuesday , security was tight and key players , including germany , had lowered their expectations .

" it would n't make any sense to set our hopes too high , " he said .
yet he added : " it 's very important that there is no failure . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economy minister glos : not-so-great expectations the notion that a trade agreement could be signed at the talks was widely seen as unlikely , amid continued deep differences between developed and developing countries , particularly over agriculture . brazil , india cited europe was under renewed pressure to lower farm-tariff barriers ahead of the conference ; while assistance for poor states , including duty-free access , have become a litmus test for success . echoing remarks made by other european officials such as eu trade commissioner peter mandelson , glos pointed the finger at brazil and india , saying current negotiations with those countries on custom rights were proving difficult . he said he would see it as a success if the wto could merely agree on a timetable for talks next year . preparing for protests meanwhile , given the history of sometimes violent protest at wto conferences , a huge security operation went into effect , making ready for the tuesday meeting .
already on sunday anti-globalization protesters had taken to the streets in a march that turned out to be peaceful . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in geneva in 2001 , riot police controlled crowds but police and security officials have barricaded the wan chai district of hong kong , shopkeepers have boarded up their windows for fear of rioting , and police have stepped up patrols . the protesters are claiming the global economic system benefits rich nations at the expense of poor ones , and they say the wto goal of reducing trade barriers threatens the livelihoods of millions of people in developing countries . looking for success stories oliver moldenhauer from attac , a german anti-globalization group , explained why non-government organizations , or ngos , around the world have flocked to hong kong to fight the wto . " we need more rights for developing countries , whereas here at the wto conference the goal is especially to lower the tariffs of the developing countries , " he said . " if we see the success stories of development in the last decades , say korea , say japan , say china , these have not been economies that follow the rules of free trade and free capital movement , " he said . farming is key the key issue this week in hong kong is agricultural trade .
poor nations say richer countries , especially the us and the european union , should cut subsidies that block cheaper farm imports from developing countries .
the us has offered to cut subsidies to farmers by 60 percent and tariffs by up to 90 percent .
the eu is willing to reduce agricultural subsidies by 70 percent and import tariffs by up to 60 percent , but developing countries say this is not enough . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protest group attac marching against wto in frankfurt in 2001 andrea maksimovic , campaign manager of the international confederation of free trade unions , is one of the few demonstrators who have come to hong kong who is not completely opposed to the wto meeting .
she just wants to be sure that whatever deal comes out of it , it is good for the workers . " we are only opposed to a bad deal , " maksimovic said .
" the multilateral trading system is important , because otherwise what you 'll have is a number of bilateral and unilateral agreements , where industrialized powerful countries can basically get whatever they want from the developing countries . " hoping for disaster " but we think there needs to be some reform of the wto in terms of its processes .
it needs to become more transparent . " other groups are less generous - they simply want the wto meeting to end in disaster and show that the notions of fair trade and free trade are a contradiction in terms . " we do n't expect anything positive from this wto meeting here in hong kong , so we are happy if the whole meeting fails and a new start can be made , " attac 's moldenhauer said . thomas kohlmann -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the eu aims to avoid a stalemate at wto talks the eu is not anxious to be blamed for a possible stalemate at the upcoming world trade organization talks .

other publishers soon followed suit . when the munich-based hypovereinsbank merged with italy 's unicredito , the boards decided that instead of denigrating german or italian by snubbing one over the other , they would use english in the company 's official communications - a fact that 's more befitting a bank of its size anyway . multilingualism costs money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : english resulted when german hvb group merged with italian unicredito in the international business world , fusions , takeovers and global interests are forcing corporations - in the plain interest of economics - to make one language the official company tongue , and that is usually english .

the world speaks english .
many german companies are making it their mother tongue .
some workers see this as an opportunity , others as a curse , for their careers .
yet corporate english is also a question of culture . the german business world is going through a tough transition period .
companies like technology giant siemens , auto manufacturer daimlerchrysler and software producer sap sell much more abroad than in germany - and nowadays , the language of business abroad is conducted primarily in english . already in 1999 , the publishing house bertelsmann began printing more and more books in english , which became the lingua franca .
other publishers soon followed suit . when the munich-based hypovereinsbank merged with italy 's unicredito , the boards decided that instead of denigrating german or italian by snubbing one over the other , they would use english in the company 's official communications - a fact that 's more befitting a bank of its size anyway . multilingualism costs money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : english resulted when german hvb group merged with italian unicredito in the international business world , fusions , takeovers and global interests are forcing corporations - in the plain interest of economics - to make one language the official company tongue , and that is usually english .
a multilingual environment is simply expensive .
interpreters and translators are necessary during talks and for internal communication , something that adds up over the long run . " that quickly becomes economically unfeasible , " said business expert jürgen hausschildt .

" i find it surprising that a commitment made by the united states in the framework agreement last year to reform food aid ... should now be described as an obsession of the european union , " he said . " food aid for emergency relief can be a tool to advance development and for humanitarian relief but the large structured us program of food aid in kind is designed in reality to give support to us agricultural producers , " he said . " statistics show that the volume of this aid is directly related to the price shifts for the commodities concerned on the us market , " he added . last week , the heads of the world food program and unicef , plus the un high commissioner for refugees , called on wto negotiators to ensure food aid is protected . they said it would be even harder to get cash donations at a time when donations of food in kind are already slipping . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de at wto , security is tight and expectations low as the wto talks opened in hong kong tuesday , security was tight and key players , including germany , had lowered their expectations .

" legal proceedings under way in certain countries appear to show that individuals were abducted and transferred to other countries without respect for any legal assistance procedures , " council of europe rapporteur dick marty told a meeting of the body 's human rights committee in paris . the swiss senator said the results of his investigation lent credibility to reports that the cia flew terrorist suspects to and from secret prisons in europe .
marty added that he believed the united states was no longer holding prisoners clandestinely in europe .
it is suspected that the prisoners were moved to north africa in early november , when reports about secret us prisons first emerged in the washi n gto n post . " the elements we have gathered so far tend to reinforce the credibility of the allegations concerning the transport and temporary detention of detainees - outside all judicial procedure in european countries , " he said in an official statement , the first initial findings from the investigation into alleged cia flights and abductions in europe . the rapporteur " demands immediately that all member governments fully commit to uncovering the truth about flights and overflights on their territory in recent years , by aircraft transporting people arrested and detained outside of any legal procedure . " fear of legal " black hole " i n the heart of europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reports of cia prisons , like this one in kosovo , have raised concerns further .
the idea of a clandestine operation by the cia , possibly aided and abetted by unknown european states , is of particular concern to the investigators .
tony lloyd , a member of the council of europe committee , said : " the really difficult thing is the idea is that there is a kind of legal black hole in the middle of europe . " marty also criticized the united states for failing to provide information to the council of europe 's investigators and added that the us has never formally denied the allegations brought against the cia . us secretary of state condoleezza rice failed to rebut the cia prison and torture allegations during her recent visit to europe despite being repeatedly questioned about the affair , saying only that american interrogators were bound by a un treaty banning the use of torture , regardless of whether they were working in the us or abroad . marty bemoa n s lack of tra n spare n cy from rice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice failed to address the allegations fully , marty said .
" the rapporteur ... deplores the fact that no information or explanation had been provided on this point by ms. rice during her visit to europe , " marty said . claims have been mounting that the united states has been illegally using european airports and airspace to transport terror suspects as part of what the us central intelligence agency calls " extraordinary renditions . "
reports suggest that torture of suspects could have happened on flights in european airspace or at secret cia prisons on european soil . marty had words for european states that may have been involved in the transportation or internment of suspects on the cia 's behalf .
european states faced accusations of a serious breach of their human rights obligations if they had cooperated with the underground network , he said . complicit europea n states face harsh co n seque n ces bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suspected cia flights , like this one leaving frankfurt , have raised suspicions of european complicity .
" while it was still too early to assert that there had been any involvement or complicity of member states in illegal actions , the seriousness of the allegations and the consistency of the information gathered to date justified the continuation of an in-depth inquiry , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.12.2005 council of europe investigators release initial cia findings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the investigators believe that the cia has now emptied all secret prisons in europe the cia appears to have abducted people in europe and illegally transferred them to other countries , according to the initial results of a council of europe investigation released on tuesday . " legal proceedings under way in certain countries appear to show that individuals were abducted and transferred to other countries without respect for any legal assistance procedures , " council of europe rapporteur dick marty told a meeting of the body 's human rights committee in paris . the swiss senator said the results of his investigation lent credibility to reports that the cia flew terrorist suspects to and from secret prisons in europe .
marty added that he believed the united states was no longer holding prisoners clandestinely in europe .
it is suspected that the prisoners were moved to north africa in early november , when reports about secret us prisons first emerged in the washi n gto n post . " the elements we have gathered so far tend to reinforce the credibility of the allegations concerning the transport and temporary detention of detainees - outside all judicial procedure in european countries , " he said in an official statement , the first initial findings from the investigation into alleged cia flights and abductions in europe . the rapporteur " demands immediately that all member governments fully commit to uncovering the truth about flights and overflights on their territory in recent years , by aircraft transporting people arrested and detained outside of any legal procedure . " fear of legal " black hole " i n the heart of europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reports of cia prisons , like this one in kosovo , have raised concerns further .
the idea of a clandestine operation by the cia , possibly aided and abetted by unknown european states , is of particular concern to the investigators .
tony lloyd , a member of the council of europe committee , said : " the really difficult thing is the idea is that there is a kind of legal black hole in the middle of europe . " marty also criticized the united states for failing to provide information to the council of europe 's investigators and added that the us has never formally denied the allegations brought against the cia . us secretary of state condoleezza rice failed to rebut the cia prison and torture allegations during her recent visit to europe despite being repeatedly questioned about the affair , saying only that american interrogators were bound by a un treaty banning the use of torture , regardless of whether they were working in the us or abroad . marty bemoa n s lack of tra n spare n cy from rice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice failed to address the allegations fully , marty said .
" the rapporteur ... deplores the fact that no information or explanation had been provided on this point by ms. rice during her visit to europe , " marty said . claims have been mounting that the united states has been illegally using european airports and airspace to transport terror suspects as part of what the us central intelligence agency calls " extraordinary renditions . "
reports suggest that torture of suspects could have happened on flights in european airspace or at secret cia prisons on european soil . marty had words for european states that may have been involved in the transportation or internment of suspects on the cia 's behalf .
european states faced accusations of a serious breach of their human rights obligations if they had cooperated with the underground network , he said . complicit europea n states face harsh co n seque n ces bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suspected cia flights , like this one leaving frankfurt , have raised suspicions of european complicity .
" while it was still too early to assert that there had been any involvement or complicity of member states in illegal actions , the seriousness of the allegations and the consistency of the information gathered to date justified the continuation of an in-depth inquiry , " he said .
" if the allegations proved correct the member states would stand accused of having seriously breached their human rights obligations to the council of europe .

the idea , largely pressed by the environmentally-friendly greens , was to focus on renewable energy and away from a crippling dependence on oil .

" in the home country of english , the world language , the task of persuasion is especially difficult , " he added .
" i firmly believe this is also a matter of social justice because languages facilitate social mobility . " joe brown was the 2005 winner of the german teacher awards presented by the german embassy in london .
he works at a number of inner-city elementary schools and told dw-world that the main problems with language-learning occur at high-school level . " younger children enjoy learning german , and do n't tend to have any of the prejudices you find with older kids , " he said .
" starting early is therefore the best option , and in fact , you can argue it 's an ideal language for small children because the pronunciation is n't hard and it 's very logical . " the traditionally hostile relations between britain and germany also play a role .
" you have to break down prejudices , " said brown .
" it 's also a question of inter-cultural education . " plunging numbers informing matussek 's remarks were figures published by the national languages center showing that the number of high school pupils studying languages has slumped by more than 64,000 this year - the first year since languages became an optional subject for 14- to 16-year-olds . learning a language beyond the age of 14 is now compulsory in just one quarter of england 's state schools , where second languages have traditionally been french or german . the latter is particularly out of favor , with some 105,288 students taking junior high school exams in german , and 272,140 in french - but even the number of senior high school students taking french has plunged by almost half . " the problem is , german just is n't considered a young person 's language , " explained brown .
" teenagers these days want to learn spanish , because spain 's a popular holiday destination and it 's seen as more of a world language than german and french . " universities bear the brunt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oxford university one long-term consequence of the shrinking number of pupils learning german is already being felt by university modern language departments , which have fewer applicants than ever before and face a growing threat of closure as the popularity - and usefulness - of german degrees continues to wane . but as brown points out , it 's a vicious circle .
" there just are n't enough people coming through the system to deliver german as a foreign language , " he said .
" a high percentage of adults in britain say they wish they spoke a foreign language , but they did n't capitalize on the opportunities they had to learn .
often , this was because it was n't taught well and the curriculum was n't interesting enough . " " britain faces the great task of changing this trend , " said matussek at the conference .

" in the home country of english , the world language , the task of persuasion is especially difficult , " he added .
" i firmly believe this is also a matter of social justice because languages facilitate social mobility . " joe brown was the 2005 winner of the german teacher awards presented by the german embassy in london .
he works at a number of inner-city elementary schools and told dw-world that the main problems with language-learning occur at high-school level . " younger children enjoy learning german , and do n't tend to have any of the prejudices you find with older kids , " he said .
" starting early is therefore the best option , and in fact , you can argue it 's an ideal language for small children because the pronunciation is n't hard and it 's very logical . " the traditionally hostile relations between britain and germany also play a role .
" you have to break down prejudices , " said brown .
" it 's also a question of inter-cultural education . " plunging numbers informing matussek 's remarks were figures published by the national languages center showing that the number of high school pupils studying languages has slumped by more than 64,000 this year - the first year since languages became an optional subject for 14- to 16-year-olds . learning a language beyond the age of 14 is now compulsory in just one quarter of england 's state schools , where second languages have traditionally been french or german . the latter is particularly out of favor , with some 105,288 students taking junior high school exams in german , and 272,140 in french - but even the number of senior high school students taking french has plunged by almost half . " the problem is , german just is n't considered a young person 's language , " explained brown .
" teenagers these days want to learn spanish , because spain 's a popular holiday destination and it 's seen as more of a world language than german and french . " universities bear the brunt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oxford university one long-term consequence of the shrinking number of pupils learning german is already being felt by university modern language departments , which have fewer applicants than ever before and face a growing threat of closure as the popularity - and usefulness - of german degrees continues to wane . but as brown points out , it 's a vicious circle .
" there just are n't enough people coming through the system to deliver german as a foreign language , " he said .
" a high percentage of adults in britain say they wish they spoke a foreign language , but they did n't capitalize on the opportunities they had to learn .
often , this was because it was n't taught well and the curriculum was n't interesting enough . " " britain faces the great task of changing this trend , " said matussek at the conference .

former chancellor schröder is supposed to become head of the board of supervisors of the swiss-registered german-russian company for development and construction of the baltic sea pipeline . the pipeline agreement between the russian energy giant gazprom and german companies basf and eon was hastily signed in september , before the german parliamentary elections and in the presence of both schröder and russian president putin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.12.2005 church calls for transparency in arms exports großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany does n't mind exporting arms to trouble spots in the joint conference church and development 's annual report on arms exports , the gkke , criticized both germany 's continued sales of weapons to developing countries and trouble spots - and its lack of transparency . the report presented in berlin revealed that seven years of a red-green coalition government has left germany the world 's fourth busiest arms exporter after russia , the us and france . export licenses might have fallen from 4.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.7 billion -rrb- to 3.8 billion euros between 2003 and 2004 , but they still far exceed the figures of the previous decade , when germany was led by cdu chancellor helmut kohl . " the spd-green government failed to keep its promise to reduce weapons export , " said gkke president and catholic prelate karl jüsten .
" the balance is disappointing . " co n tradictio n s in 2004 , germany exported some 3.8 billion euros worth of weapons .
in keeping with german habits of recent years , some 1.2 billion euros worth of arms - approximately one third of german export licenses - went to states that also receive development aid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weapons and aid do n't mix " arms sales jeopardize the chances of effective aid and often stand in stark contradiction to the german government 's stated development policy aims , " jüsten said . moreover , germany 's 900,000 euros worth of weapons exported to china last year suggest the eu 's 16-year-old arms embargo against china is , as jüsten said , a " patchy " one . other destinations included conflict regions such as the middle east , while two thirds of germany 's arms exports head for the us . mystery of missi n g figures little looks set to change under chancellor angela merkel .

" the spd-green government failed to keep its promise to reduce weapons export , " said gkke president and catholic prelate karl jüsten .
" the balance is disappointing . " co n tradictio n s in 2004 , germany exported some 3.8 billion euros worth of weapons .
in keeping with german habits of recent years , some 1.2 billion euros worth of arms - approximately one third of german export licenses - went to states that also receive development aid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weapons and aid do n't mix " arms sales jeopardize the chances of effective aid and often stand in stark contradiction to the german government 's stated development policy aims , " jüsten said . moreover , germany 's 900,000 euros worth of weapons exported to china last year suggest the eu 's 16-year-old arms embargo against china is , as jüsten said , a " patchy " one . other destinations included conflict regions such as the middle east , while two thirds of germany 's arms exports head for the us . mystery of missi n g figures little looks set to change under chancellor angela merkel . " we noted with dismay that the recent coalition negotiations barely addressed the question of arms export , " said protestant church representative stephan reimers .

the world speaks english .
many german companies are making it their mother tongue .
some workers see this as an opportunity , others as a curse , for their careers .
yet corporate english is also a question of culture . the german business world is going through a tough transition period .
companies like technology giant siemens , auto manufacturer daimlerchrysler and software producer sap sell much more abroad than in germany - and nowadays , the language of business abroad is conducted primarily in english . already in 1999 , the publishing house bertelsmann began printing more and more books in english , which became the lingua franca .
other publishers soon followed suit . when the munich-based hypovereinsbank merged with italy 's unicredito , the boards decided that instead of denigrating german or italian by snubbing one over the other , they would use english in the company 's official communications - a fact that 's more befitting a bank of its size anyway . multilingualism costs money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : english resulted when german hvb group merged with italian unicredito in the international business world , fusions , takeovers and global interests are forcing corporations - in the plain interest of economics - to make one language the official company tongue , and that is usually english .
a multilingual environment is simply expensive .
interpreters and translators are necessary during talks and for internal communication , something that adds up over the long run . " that quickly becomes economically unfeasible , " said business expert jürgen hausschildt .
" and in spite of translations , there are repeated misunderstandings .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.12.2005 council of europe investigators release initial cia findings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the investigators believe that the cia has now emptied all secret prisons in europe the cia appears to have abducted people in europe and illegally transferred them to other countries , according to the initial results of a council of europe investigation released on tuesday . " legal proceedings under way in certain countries appear to show that individuals were abducted and transferred to other countries without respect for any legal assistance procedures , " council of europe rapporteur dick marty told a meeting of the body 's human rights committee in paris . the swiss senator said the results of his investigation lent credibility to reports that the cia flew terrorist suspects to and from secret prisons in europe .
marty added that he believed the united states was no longer holding prisoners clandestinely in europe .
it is suspected that the prisoners were moved to north africa in early november , when reports about secret us prisons first emerged in the washi n gto n post . " the elements we have gathered so far tend to reinforce the credibility of the allegations concerning the transport and temporary detention of detainees - outside all judicial procedure in european countries , " he said in an official statement , the first initial findings from the investigation into alleged cia flights and abductions in europe . the rapporteur " demands immediately that all member governments fully commit to uncovering the truth about flights and overflights on their territory in recent years , by aircraft transporting people arrested and detained outside of any legal procedure . " fear of legal " black hole " i n the heart of europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reports of cia prisons , like this one in kosovo , have raised concerns further .
the idea of a clandestine operation by the cia , possibly aided and abetted by unknown european states , is of particular concern to the investigators .
tony lloyd , a member of the council of europe committee , said : " the really difficult thing is the idea is that there is a kind of legal black hole in the middle of europe . " marty also criticized the united states for failing to provide information to the council of europe 's investigators and added that the us has never formally denied the allegations brought against the cia . us secretary of state condoleezza rice failed to rebut the cia prison and torture allegations during her recent visit to europe despite being repeatedly questioned about the affair , saying only that american interrogators were bound by a un treaty banning the use of torture , regardless of whether they were working in the us or abroad . marty bemoa n s lack of tra n spare n cy from rice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice failed to address the allegations fully , marty said .
" the rapporteur ... deplores the fact that no information or explanation had been provided on this point by ms. rice during her visit to europe , " marty said . claims have been mounting that the united states has been illegally using european airports and airspace to transport terror suspects as part of what the us central intelligence agency calls " extraordinary renditions . "
reports suggest that torture of suspects could have happened on flights in european airspace or at secret cia prisons on european soil . marty had words for european states that may have been involved in the transportation or internment of suspects on the cia 's behalf .
european states faced accusations of a serious breach of their human rights obligations if they had cooperated with the underground network , he said . complicit europea n states face harsh co n seque n ces bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suspected cia flights , like this one leaving frankfurt , have raised suspicions of european complicity .
" while it was still too early to assert that there had been any involvement or complicity of member states in illegal actions , the seriousness of the allegations and the consistency of the information gathered to date justified the continuation of an in-depth inquiry , " he said .
" if the allegations proved correct the member states would stand accused of having seriously breached their human rights obligations to the council of europe .

" legal proceedings under way in certain countries appear to show that individuals were abducted and transferred to other countries without respect for any legal assistance procedures , " council of europe rapporteur dick marty told a meeting of the body 's human rights committee in paris . the swiss senator said the results of his investigation lent credibility to reports that the cia flew terrorist suspects to and from secret prisons in europe .
marty added that he believed the united states was no longer holding prisoners clandestinely in europe .
it is suspected that the prisoners were moved to north africa in early november , when reports about secret us prisons first emerged in the washi n gto n post . " the elements we have gathered so far tend to reinforce the credibility of the allegations concerning the transport and temporary detention of detainees - outside all judicial procedure in european countries , " he said in an official statement , the first initial findings from the investigation into alleged cia flights and abductions in europe . the rapporteur " demands immediately that all member governments fully commit to uncovering the truth about flights and overflights on their territory in recent years , by aircraft transporting people arrested and detained outside of any legal procedure .

tony lloyd , a member of the council of europe committee , said : " the really difficult thing is the idea is that there is a kind of legal black hole in the middle of europe . " marty also criticized the united states for failing to provide information to the council of europe 's investigators and added that the us has never formally denied the allegations brought against the cia . us secretary of state condoleezza rice failed to rebut the cia prison and torture allegations during her recent visit to europe despite being repeatedly questioned about the affair , saying only that american interrogators were bound by a un treaty banning the use of torture , regardless of whether they were working in the us or abroad . marty bemoa n s lack of tra n spare n cy from rice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice failed to address the allegations fully , marty said .

"
reports suggest that torture of suspects could have happened on flights in european airspace or at secret cia prisons on european soil . marty had words for european states that may have been involved in the transportation or internment of suspects on the cia 's behalf .

former chancellor schröder is supposed to become head of the board of supervisors of the swiss-registered german-russian company for development and construction of the baltic sea pipeline . the pipeline agreement between the russian energy giant gazprom and german companies basf and eon was hastily signed in september , before the german parliamentary elections and in the presence of both schröder and russian president putin .
the event was accompanied by heavy criticism from the neighboring eastern european countries and references to the inefficiency of such a project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politics is out , big business is in for former chancellor schröder with his new job , schröder is complicating the future german policy toward the east , which should n't only be directed towards moscow .
he is , furthermore , damaging the reputation of his earlier russian policies , letting his historic legacy in the german-russian relations appear in unfavorable light . as chancellor , schröder pursued a controversial foreign policy with the goal of a close partnership with russia .
against resistance on the domestic front , schröder won a great deal of trust in russia , a historical sign of which was his participation in the celebrations of the sixtieth anniversary since the end of world war ii on the red square . europe n eeds russia but schröder 's russian policy was not only based on his wish to reconcile the germans and the russians , but also on a geopolitical and strategic realization that the european continent could be peaceful and prosperous only if russia , too , became sufficiently integrated .
europe and russia are also dependent on each other because of the mutually beneficial economic links .
only together can they survive in the world of the twenty-first century . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gas pipeline deal may end up as a political faux pas for germany these pragmatic factors of schröder 's russian policy are getting completely invalidated by his becoming head of the supervisory board for the baltic sea pipeline consortium .
from this perspective , his whole russian policy seems like a policy of personal advantage - especially if the new position is not honorary . there are many jobs schröder could have taken if he wanted to use his weight as an " elder statesman " on behalf of the german-russian relations - in connection with the " petersburg dialogue , " a forum on civil society , which he himself initiated , or in the ongoing german-russian youth projects .

" we need a broad energy mix to guarantee supplies at low prices , " he said .
" it does n't make any sense for us to buy electricity produced by nuclear power from our neighbors but to totally turn our backs on it ourselves . "
germany 's grand coalition of conservative christian union parties and their social democratic partners disagree on nuclear policy but agreed to stick to a plan created by the social democrats and greens in 2000 to phase out the country 's nuclear power facilities .
glos is a member of the christian social union , the bavarian sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union .
two dow n , so far one of the most crucial pieces of legislation passed by outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , in the eyes of many , was a planned phase-out of germany 's atomic energy plants by 2020 .
the idea , largely pressed by the environmentally-friendly greens , was to focus on renewable energy and away from a crippling dependence on oil .
it also found support at a time when safety concerns over nuclear power reactors were highlighted with accidents like the one in chernobyl in 1986 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : due to close in 2008 so far , the government has closed two nuclear reactors .
the remaining 17 , owned by utilities rwe ag , e.on ag and enbw , are to be closed over the next 15 years .
the next due to close , according to the environment ministry , is rwe 's " biblis a " reactor , in 2008 .
merkel wa n ts to stop n uclear phase out the conservatives led by chancellor-designate angela merkel have made no secret of the fact that they intend to put the brakes on the nuclear-phase out .
earlier this year , merkel argued in a speech that if germany is no longer active in nuclear power , it would have no influence on the international market when it comes to exporting nuclear technology .
the conservatives are keen to provide germany , a large importer of oil and gas , with greater energy security and allow the energy industry to earn more by extending the life of their plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agree to disgree , for now " in my view , an ideologically motivated nuclear phase-out does not reflect economic demands , " merkel said , citing the fact that countries such as india and china are expanding their nuclear energy capacities . " for me , the question is , how can germany , with its technical know-how , profit from this export potential .
as a patriot , i would like to see my country profit from our expertise , not watch others take the profits . "
but , michael müller , vice-chairman of the spd parliamentary group demanded that the conservatives finally recognize that they " have no chance " to chip away at nuclear phase-out with the spd .
müller argued that if the nuclear plants were indeed allowed to run longer , they would have to undergo updated security modifications - something that would cost money , he said .
maki n g a comeback one thing that 's bolstered the conservatives ' case is the fact that nuclear energy has been gradually making a comeback in europe with the first new nuclear plant on the continent in years being built in finland .
its supporters also point out that nuclear reactors emit virtually no greenhouse gases .

" the spd-green government failed to keep its promise to reduce weapons export , " said gkke president and catholic prelate karl jüsten .
" the balance is disappointing . " co n tradictio n s in 2004 , germany exported some 3.8 billion euros worth of weapons .
in keeping with german habits of recent years , some 1.2 billion euros worth of arms - approximately one third of german export licenses - went to states that also receive development aid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weapons and aid do n't mix " arms sales jeopardize the chances of effective aid and often stand in stark contradiction to the german government 's stated development policy aims , " jüsten said . moreover , germany 's 900,000 euros worth of weapons exported to china last year suggest the eu 's 16-year-old arms embargo against china is , as jüsten said , a " patchy " one . other destinations included conflict regions such as the middle east , while two thirds of germany 's arms exports head for the us . mystery of missi n g figures little looks set to change under chancellor angela merkel . " we noted with dismay that the recent coalition negotiations barely addressed the question of arms export , " said protestant church representative stephan reimers .
so far , the new government has refrained from agreeing any restrictive arms export policy . the gkke report is based on figures made available by the eu rather than the german government - which has yet to publish its annual arms export report . calls for tra n spare n cy in 1998 , the foreign ministers of the 15 european union member states adopted an eu code of conduct on arms exports , aimed to set common standards for the management of and restraint in arms exports from the eu , which is a politically binding agreement under which member states agree to abide by certain criteria when granting arms export licenses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arms sales - a cloudy issue " at a european level we have attained a satisfactory level of transparency , which the german government falls far short of , " said bernhard moltmann from the hesse foundation for peace and conflict research , pointing out that decisions relating to arms exports are taken behind closed doors by the german security council . " parliament needs to play a more active role when it comes to export licenses , " he said . and reimers added that the fact that a report on arms export in 2004 has yet to be published by the government " is in clear contempt of both the parliament and the public .

former chancellor schröder is supposed to become head of the board of supervisors of the swiss-registered german-russian company for development and construction of the baltic sea pipeline . the pipeline agreement between the russian energy giant gazprom and german companies basf and eon was hastily signed in september , before the german parliamentary elections and in the presence of both schröder and russian president putin .
the event was accompanied by heavy criticism from the neighboring eastern european countries and references to the inefficiency of such a project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politics is out , big business is in for former chancellor schröder with his new job , schröder is complicating the future german policy toward the east , which should n't only be directed towards moscow .
he is , furthermore , damaging the reputation of his earlier russian policies , letting his historic legacy in the german-russian relations appear in unfavorable light . as chancellor , schröder pursued a controversial foreign policy with the goal of a close partnership with russia .
against resistance on the domestic front , schröder won a great deal of trust in russia , a historical sign of which was his participation in the celebrations of the sixtieth anniversary since the end of world war ii on the red square . europe n eeds russia but schröder 's russian policy was not only based on his wish to reconcile the germans and the russians , but also on a geopolitical and strategic realization that the european continent could be peaceful and prosperous only if russia , too , became sufficiently integrated .
europe and russia are also dependent on each other because of the mutually beneficial economic links .
only together can they survive in the world of the twenty-first century . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gas pipeline deal may end up as a political faux pas for germany these pragmatic factors of schröder 's russian policy are getting completely invalidated by his becoming head of the supervisory board for the baltic sea pipeline consortium .
from this perspective , his whole russian policy seems like a policy of personal advantage - especially if the new position is not honorary . there are many jobs schröder could have taken if he wanted to use his weight as an " elder statesman " on behalf of the german-russian relations - in connection with the " petersburg dialogue , " a forum on civil society , which he himself initiated , or in the ongoing german-russian youth projects .
as figurehead for the baltic sea pipeline , he is only doing a disservice to the german-russian relations . ingo mannteufel -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder calls pipeline job " an honor " former german chancellor gerhard schröder has deflected criticism over his new job tuesday as calls continue to mount for a code of conduct for government officials once they leave office .

" we need a broad energy mix to guarantee supplies at low prices , " he said .
" it does n't make any sense for us to buy electricity produced by nuclear power from our neighbors but to totally turn our backs on it ourselves . "
germany 's grand coalition of conservative christian union parties and their social democratic partners disagree on nuclear policy but agreed to stick to a plan created by the social democrats and greens in 2000 to phase out the country 's nuclear power facilities .
glos is a member of the christian social union , the bavarian sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union .
two dow n , so far one of the most crucial pieces of legislation passed by outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , in the eyes of many , was a planned phase-out of germany 's atomic energy plants by 2020 .
the idea , largely pressed by the environmentally-friendly greens , was to focus on renewable energy and away from a crippling dependence on oil .
it also found support at a time when safety concerns over nuclear power reactors were highlighted with accidents like the one in chernobyl in 1986 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : due to close in 2008 so far , the government has closed two nuclear reactors .
the remaining 17 , owned by utilities rwe ag , e.on ag and enbw , are to be closed over the next 15 years .
the next due to close , according to the environment ministry , is rwe 's " biblis a " reactor , in 2008 .
merkel wa n ts to stop n uclear phase out the conservatives led by chancellor-designate angela merkel have made no secret of the fact that they intend to put the brakes on the nuclear-phase out .
earlier this year , merkel argued in a speech that if germany is no longer active in nuclear power , it would have no influence on the international market when it comes to exporting nuclear technology .
the conservatives are keen to provide germany , a large importer of oil and gas , with greater energy security and allow the energy industry to earn more by extending the life of their plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agree to disgree , for now " in my view , an ideologically motivated nuclear phase-out does not reflect economic demands , " merkel said , citing the fact that countries such as india and china are expanding their nuclear energy capacities . " for me , the question is , how can germany , with its technical know-how , profit from this export potential .
as a patriot , i would like to see my country profit from our expertise , not watch others take the profits . "
but , michael müller , vice-chairman of the spd parliamentary group demanded that the conservatives finally recognize that they " have no chance " to chip away at nuclear phase-out with the spd .
müller argued that if the nuclear plants were indeed allowed to run longer , they would have to undergo updated security modifications - something that would cost money , he said .
maki n g a comeback one thing that 's bolstered the conservatives ' case is the fact that nuclear energy has been gradually making a comeback in europe with the first new nuclear plant on the continent in years being built in finland .
its supporters also point out that nuclear reactors emit virtually no greenhouse gases .
" we should not turn our backs on a technology of the future , " glos told the newspaper .

" in the home country of english , the world language , the task of persuasion is especially difficult , " he added .
" i firmly believe this is also a matter of social justice because languages facilitate social mobility . " joe brown was the 2005 winner of the german teacher awards presented by the german embassy in london .
he works at a number of inner-city elementary schools and told dw-world that the main problems with language-learning occur at high-school level . " younger children enjoy learning german , and do n't tend to have any of the prejudices you find with older kids , " he said .
" starting early is therefore the best option , and in fact , you can argue it 's an ideal language for small children because the pronunciation is n't hard and it 's very logical . " the traditionally hostile relations between britain and germany also play a role .
" you have to break down prejudices , " said brown .
" it 's also a question of inter-cultural education . " plunging numbers informing matussek 's remarks were figures published by the national languages center showing that the number of high school pupils studying languages has slumped by more than 64,000 this year - the first year since languages became an optional subject for 14- to 16-year-olds . learning a language beyond the age of 14 is now compulsory in just one quarter of england 's state schools , where second languages have traditionally been french or german . the latter is particularly out of favor , with some 105,288 students taking junior high school exams in german , and 272,140 in french - but even the number of senior high school students taking french has plunged by almost half . " the problem is , german just is n't considered a young person 's language , " explained brown .

" there just are n't enough people coming through the system to deliver german as a foreign language , " he said .
" a high percentage of adults in britain say they wish they spoke a foreign language , but they did n't capitalize on the opportunities they had to learn .

" we need a broad energy mix to guarantee supplies at low prices , " he said .
" it does n't make any sense for us to buy electricity produced by nuclear power from our neighbors but to totally turn our backs on it ourselves . "
germany 's grand coalition of conservative christian union parties and their social democratic partners disagree on nuclear policy but agreed to stick to a plan created by the social democrats and greens in 2000 to phase out the country 's nuclear power facilities .
glos is a member of the christian social union , the bavarian sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union .
two dow n , so far one of the most crucial pieces of legislation passed by outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , in the eyes of many , was a planned phase-out of germany 's atomic energy plants by 2020 .
the idea , largely pressed by the environmentally-friendly greens , was to focus on renewable energy and away from a crippling dependence on oil .
it also found support at a time when safety concerns over nuclear power reactors were highlighted with accidents like the one in chernobyl in 1986 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : due to close in 2008 so far , the government has closed two nuclear reactors .
the remaining 17 , owned by utilities rwe ag , e.on ag and enbw , are to be closed over the next 15 years .
the next due to close , according to the environment ministry , is rwe 's " biblis a " reactor , in 2008 .
merkel wa n ts to stop n uclear phase out the conservatives led by chancellor-designate angela merkel have made no secret of the fact that they intend to put the brakes on the nuclear-phase out .
earlier this year , merkel argued in a speech that if germany is no longer active in nuclear power , it would have no influence on the international market when it comes to exporting nuclear technology .
the conservatives are keen to provide germany , a large importer of oil and gas , with greater energy security and allow the energy industry to earn more by extending the life of their plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agree to disgree , for now " in my view , an ideologically motivated nuclear phase-out does not reflect economic demands , " merkel said , citing the fact that countries such as india and china are expanding their nuclear energy capacities . " for me , the question is , how can germany , with its technical know-how , profit from this export potential .
as a patriot , i would like to see my country profit from our expertise , not watch others take the profits . "
but , michael müller , vice-chairman of the spd parliamentary group demanded that the conservatives finally recognize that they " have no chance " to chip away at nuclear phase-out with the spd .
müller argued that if the nuclear plants were indeed allowed to run longer , they would have to undergo updated security modifications - something that would cost money , he said .
maki n g a comeback one thing that 's bolstered the conservatives ' case is the fact that nuclear energy has been gradually making a comeback in europe with the first new nuclear plant on the continent in years being built in finland .
its supporters also point out that nuclear reactors emit virtually no greenhouse gases .
" we should not turn our backs on a technology of the future , " glos told the newspaper .

" i firmly believe this is also a matter of social justice because languages facilitate social mobility . " joe brown was the 2005 winner of the german teacher awards presented by the german embassy in london .
he works at a number of inner-city elementary schools and told dw-world that the main problems with language-learning occur at high-school level . " younger children enjoy learning german , and do n't tend to have any of the prejudices you find with older kids , " he said .
" starting early is therefore the best option , and in fact , you can argue it 's an ideal language for small children because the pronunciation is n't hard and it 's very logical . " the traditionally hostile relations between britain and germany also play a role .

" it 's also a question of inter-cultural education . " plunging numbers informing matussek 's remarks were figures published by the national languages center showing that the number of high school pupils studying languages has slumped by more than 64,000 this year - the first year since languages became an optional subject for 14- to 16-year-olds . learning a language beyond the age of 14 is now compulsory in just one quarter of england 's state schools , where second languages have traditionally been french or german . the latter is particularly out of favor , with some 105,288 students taking junior high school exams in german , and 272,140 in french - but even the number of senior high school students taking french has plunged by almost half .

" legal proceedings under way in certain countries appear to show that individuals were abducted and transferred to other countries without respect for any legal assistance procedures , " council of europe rapporteur dick marty told a meeting of the body 's human rights committee in paris . the swiss senator said the results of his investigation lent credibility to reports that the cia flew terrorist suspects to and from secret prisons in europe .
marty added that he believed the united states was no longer holding prisoners clandestinely in europe .
it is suspected that the prisoners were moved to north africa in early november , when reports about secret us prisons first emerged in the washi n gto n post . " the elements we have gathered so far tend to reinforce the credibility of the allegations concerning the transport and temporary detention of detainees - outside all judicial procedure in european countries , " he said in an official statement , the first initial findings from the investigation into alleged cia flights and abductions in europe . the rapporteur " demands immediately that all member governments fully commit to uncovering the truth about flights and overflights on their territory in recent years , by aircraft transporting people arrested and detained outside of any legal procedure .

the idea of a clandestine operation by the cia , possibly aided and abetted by unknown european states , is of particular concern to the investigators .
tony lloyd , a member of the council of europe committee , said : " the really difficult thing is the idea is that there is a kind of legal black hole in the middle of europe . " marty also criticized the united states for failing to provide information to the council of europe 's investigators and added that the us has never formally denied the allegations brought against the cia . us secretary of state condoleezza rice failed to rebut the cia prison and torture allegations during her recent visit to europe despite being repeatedly questioned about the affair , saying only that american interrogators were bound by a un treaty banning the use of torture , regardless of whether they were working in the us or abroad . marty bemoa n s lack of tra n spare n cy from rice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice failed to address the allegations fully , marty said .
" the rapporteur ... deplores the fact that no information or explanation had been provided on this point by ms. rice during her visit to europe , " marty said . claims have been mounting that the united states has been illegally using european airports and airspace to transport terror suspects as part of what the us central intelligence agency calls " extraordinary renditions . "
reports suggest that torture of suspects could have happened on flights in european airspace or at secret cia prisons on european soil . marty had words for european states that may have been involved in the transportation or internment of suspects on the cia 's behalf .

former chancellor schröder is supposed to become head of the board of supervisors of the swiss-registered german-russian company for development and construction of the baltic sea pipeline . the pipeline agreement between the russian energy giant gazprom and german companies basf and eon was hastily signed in september , before the german parliamentary elections and in the presence of both schröder and russian president putin .
the event was accompanied by heavy criticism from the neighboring eastern european countries and references to the inefficiency of such a project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politics is out , big business is in for former chancellor schröder with his new job , schröder is complicating the future german policy toward the east , which should n't only be directed towards moscow .
he is , furthermore , damaging the reputation of his earlier russian policies , letting his historic legacy in the german-russian relations appear in unfavorable light . as chancellor , schröder pursued a controversial foreign policy with the goal of a close partnership with russia .
against resistance on the domestic front , schröder won a great deal of trust in russia , a historical sign of which was his participation in the celebrations of the sixtieth anniversary since the end of world war ii on the red square . europe n eeds russia but schröder 's russian policy was not only based on his wish to reconcile the germans and the russians , but also on a geopolitical and strategic realization that the european continent could be peaceful and prosperous only if russia , too , became sufficiently integrated .
europe and russia are also dependent on each other because of the mutually beneficial economic links .
only together can they survive in the world of the twenty-first century . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gas pipeline deal may end up as a political faux pas for germany these pragmatic factors of schröder 's russian policy are getting completely invalidated by his becoming head of the supervisory board for the baltic sea pipeline consortium .
from this perspective , his whole russian policy seems like a policy of personal advantage - especially if the new position is not honorary . there are many jobs schröder could have taken if he wanted to use his weight as an " elder statesman " on behalf of the german-russian relations - in connection with the " petersburg dialogue , " a forum on civil society , which he himself initiated , or in the ongoing german-russian youth projects .
as figurehead for the baltic sea pipeline , he is only doing a disservice to the german-russian relations . ingo mannteufel -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder calls pipeline job " an honor " former german chancellor gerhard schröder has deflected criticism over his new job tuesday as calls continue to mount for a code of conduct for government officials once they leave office .

" legal proceedings under way in certain countries appear to show that individuals were abducted and transferred to other countries without respect for any legal assistance procedures , " council of europe rapporteur dick marty told a meeting of the body 's human rights committee in paris . the swiss senator said the results of his investigation lent credibility to reports that the cia flew terrorist suspects to and from secret prisons in europe .
marty added that he believed the united states was no longer holding prisoners clandestinely in europe .
it is suspected that the prisoners were moved to north africa in early november , when reports about secret us prisons first emerged in the washi n gto n post . " the elements we have gathered so far tend to reinforce the credibility of the allegations concerning the transport and temporary detention of detainees - outside all judicial procedure in european countries , " he said in an official statement , the first initial findings from the investigation into alleged cia flights and abductions in europe . the rapporteur " demands immediately that all member governments fully commit to uncovering the truth about flights and overflights on their territory in recent years , by aircraft transporting people arrested and detained outside of any legal procedure . " fear of legal " black hole " i n the heart of europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reports of cia prisons , like this one in kosovo , have raised concerns further .
the idea of a clandestine operation by the cia , possibly aided and abetted by unknown european states , is of particular concern to the investigators .
tony lloyd , a member of the council of europe committee , said : " the really difficult thing is the idea is that there is a kind of legal black hole in the middle of europe . " marty also criticized the united states for failing to provide information to the council of europe 's investigators and added that the us has never formally denied the allegations brought against the cia . us secretary of state condoleezza rice failed to rebut the cia prison and torture allegations during her recent visit to europe despite being repeatedly questioned about the affair , saying only that american interrogators were bound by a un treaty banning the use of torture , regardless of whether they were working in the us or abroad . marty bemoa n s lack of tra n spare n cy from rice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice failed to address the allegations fully , marty said .
" the rapporteur ... deplores the fact that no information or explanation had been provided on this point by ms. rice during her visit to europe , " marty said . claims have been mounting that the united states has been illegally using european airports and airspace to transport terror suspects as part of what the us central intelligence agency calls " extraordinary renditions . "
reports suggest that torture of suspects could have happened on flights in european airspace or at secret cia prisons on european soil . marty had words for european states that may have been involved in the transportation or internment of suspects on the cia 's behalf .
european states faced accusations of a serious breach of their human rights obligations if they had cooperated with the underground network , he said . complicit europea n states face harsh co n seque n ces bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suspected cia flights , like this one leaving frankfurt , have raised suspicions of european complicity .
" while it was still too early to assert that there had been any involvement or complicity of member states in illegal actions , the seriousness of the allegations and the consistency of the information gathered to date justified the continuation of an in-depth inquiry , " he said .

former chancellor schröder is supposed to become head of the board of supervisors of the swiss-registered german-russian company for development and construction of the baltic sea pipeline . the pipeline agreement between the russian energy giant gazprom and german companies basf and eon was hastily signed in september , before the german parliamentary elections and in the presence of both schröder and russian president putin .
the event was accompanied by heavy criticism from the neighboring eastern european countries and references to the inefficiency of such a project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politics is out , big business is in for former chancellor schröder with his new job , schröder is complicating the future german policy toward the east , which should n't only be directed towards moscow .
he is , furthermore , damaging the reputation of his earlier russian policies , letting his historic legacy in the german-russian relations appear in unfavorable light . as chancellor , schröder pursued a controversial foreign policy with the goal of a close partnership with russia .
against resistance on the domestic front , schröder won a great deal of trust in russia , a historical sign of which was his participation in the celebrations of the sixtieth anniversary since the end of world war ii on the red square . europe n eeds russia but schröder 's russian policy was not only based on his wish to reconcile the germans and the russians , but also on a geopolitical and strategic realization that the european continent could be peaceful and prosperous only if russia , too , became sufficiently integrated .
europe and russia are also dependent on each other because of the mutually beneficial economic links .
only together can they survive in the world of the twenty-first century . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gas pipeline deal may end up as a political faux pas for germany these pragmatic factors of schröder 's russian policy are getting completely invalidated by his becoming head of the supervisory board for the baltic sea pipeline consortium .
from this perspective , his whole russian policy seems like a policy of personal advantage - especially if the new position is not honorary . there are many jobs schröder could have taken if he wanted to use his weight as an " elder statesman " on behalf of the german-russian relations - in connection with the " petersburg dialogue , " a forum on civil society , which he himself initiated , or in the ongoing german-russian youth projects .
as figurehead for the baltic sea pipeline , he is only doing a disservice to the german-russian relations . ingo mannteufel -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder calls pipeline job " an honor " former german chancellor gerhard schröder has deflected criticism over his new job tuesday as calls continue to mount for a code of conduct for government officials once they leave office .

" in the home country of english , the world language , the task of persuasion is especially difficult , " he added .
" i firmly believe this is also a matter of social justice because languages facilitate social mobility . " joe brown was the 2005 winner of the german teacher awards presented by the german embassy in london .
he works at a number of inner-city elementary schools and told dw-world that the main problems with language-learning occur at high-school level . " younger children enjoy learning german , and do n't tend to have any of the prejudices you find with older kids , " he said .
" starting early is therefore the best option , and in fact , you can argue it 's an ideal language for small children because the pronunciation is n't hard and it 's very logical . " the traditionally hostile relations between britain and germany also play a role .
" you have to break down prejudices , " said brown .
" it 's also a question of inter-cultural education . " plunging numbers informing matussek 's remarks were figures published by the national languages center showing that the number of high school pupils studying languages has slumped by more than 64,000 this year - the first year since languages became an optional subject for 14- to 16-year-olds . learning a language beyond the age of 14 is now compulsory in just one quarter of england 's state schools , where second languages have traditionally been french or german . the latter is particularly out of favor , with some 105,288 students taking junior high school exams in german , and 272,140 in french - but even the number of senior high school students taking french has plunged by almost half . " the problem is , german just is n't considered a young person 's language , " explained brown .
" teenagers these days want to learn spanish , because spain 's a popular holiday destination and it 's seen as more of a world language than german and french . " universities bear the brunt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oxford university one long-term consequence of the shrinking number of pupils learning german is already being felt by university modern language departments , which have fewer applicants than ever before and face a growing threat of closure as the popularity - and usefulness - of german degrees continues to wane . but as brown points out , it 's a vicious circle .
" there just are n't enough people coming through the system to deliver german as a foreign language , " he said .
" a high percentage of adults in britain say they wish they spoke a foreign language , but they did n't capitalize on the opportunities they had to learn .
often , this was because it was n't taught well and the curriculum was n't interesting enough . " " britain faces the great task of changing this trend , " said matussek at the conference .
" languages are not just an ornamental necessity but vital to the real interests of this country . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : britain isolates itself linguistically britain is an island nation and in no way is this more visible than in the country 's stance on foreign languages .

" in the home country of english , the world language , the task of persuasion is especially difficult , " he added .
" i firmly believe this is also a matter of social justice because languages facilitate social mobility . " joe brown was the 2005 winner of the german teacher awards presented by the german embassy in london .
he works at a number of inner-city elementary schools and told dw-world that the main problems with language-learning occur at high-school level . " younger children enjoy learning german , and do n't tend to have any of the prejudices you find with older kids , " he said .
" starting early is therefore the best option , and in fact , you can argue it 's an ideal language for small children because the pronunciation is n't hard and it 's very logical . " the traditionally hostile relations between britain and germany also play a role .
" you have to break down prejudices , " said brown .
" it 's also a question of inter-cultural education . " plunging numbers informing matussek 's remarks were figures published by the national languages center showing that the number of high school pupils studying languages has slumped by more than 64,000 this year - the first year since languages became an optional subject for 14- to 16-year-olds . learning a language beyond the age of 14 is now compulsory in just one quarter of england 's state schools , where second languages have traditionally been french or german . the latter is particularly out of favor , with some 105,288 students taking junior high school exams in german , and 272,140 in french - but even the number of senior high school students taking french has plunged by almost half . " the problem is , german just is n't considered a young person 's language , " explained brown .
" teenagers these days want to learn spanish , because spain 's a popular holiday destination and it 's seen as more of a world language than german and french . " universities bear the brunt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oxford university one long-term consequence of the shrinking number of pupils learning german is already being felt by university modern language departments , which have fewer applicants than ever before and face a growing threat of closure as the popularity - and usefulness - of german degrees continues to wane . but as brown points out , it 's a vicious circle .
" there just are n't enough people coming through the system to deliver german as a foreign language , " he said .
" a high percentage of adults in britain say they wish they spoke a foreign language , but they did n't capitalize on the opportunities they had to learn .
often , this was because it was n't taught well and the curriculum was n't interesting enough . " " britain faces the great task of changing this trend , " said matussek at the conference .
" languages are not just an ornamental necessity but vital to the real interests of this country . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : britain isolates itself linguistically britain is an island nation and in no way is this more visible than in the country 's stance on foreign languages .

a secure pension plan can keep you going in the twilight years of your life when the last 40 or so years of work are just a bad and distant memory .
but few people consider that the benefits from a good pension can stretch beyond the grave . one person , however , did consider this .
but it was n't the german woman 's pension that kept on giving when the toes curled up - it was the pension of her dead father-in-law which she continued to claim for two decades past his departure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enjoy your pension , ladies , you 've earned it even though her father-in-law passed away in 1977 , the berlin resident continued to squirrel his pension payments away until 1997 after changing the bank account details from the dead man 's to her own .

" we need a broad energy mix to guarantee supplies at low prices , " he said .
" it does n't make any sense for us to buy electricity produced by nuclear power from our neighbors but to totally turn our backs on it ourselves . "
germany 's grand coalition of conservative christian union parties and their social democratic partners disagree on nuclear policy but agreed to stick to a plan created by the social democrats and greens in 2000 to phase out the country 's nuclear power facilities .
glos is a member of the christian social union , the bavarian sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union .
two dow n , so far one of the most crucial pieces of legislation passed by outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , in the eyes of many , was a planned phase-out of germany 's atomic energy plants by 2020 .
the idea , largely pressed by the environmentally-friendly greens , was to focus on renewable energy and away from a crippling dependence on oil .
it also found support at a time when safety concerns over nuclear power reactors were highlighted with accidents like the one in chernobyl in 1986 .

merkel wa n ts to stop n uclear phase out the conservatives led by chancellor-designate angela merkel have made no secret of the fact that they intend to put the brakes on the nuclear-phase out .
earlier this year , merkel argued in a speech that if germany is no longer active in nuclear power , it would have no influence on the international market when it comes to exporting nuclear technology .
the conservatives are keen to provide germany , a large importer of oil and gas , with greater energy security and allow the energy industry to earn more by extending the life of their plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agree to disgree , for now " in my view , an ideologically motivated nuclear phase-out does not reflect economic demands , " merkel said , citing the fact that countries such as india and china are expanding their nuclear energy capacities . " for me , the question is , how can germany , with its technical know-how , profit from this export potential .
as a patriot , i would like to see my country profit from our expertise , not watch others take the profits . "
but , michael müller , vice-chairman of the spd parliamentary group demanded that the conservatives finally recognize that they " have no chance " to chip away at nuclear phase-out with the spd .
müller argued that if the nuclear plants were indeed allowed to run longer , they would have to undergo updated security modifications - something that would cost money , he said .

" we need a broad energy mix to guarantee supplies at low prices , " he said .
" it does n't make any sense for us to buy electricity produced by nuclear power from our neighbors but to totally turn our backs on it ourselves . "
germany 's grand coalition of conservative christian union parties and their social democratic partners disagree on nuclear policy but agreed to stick to a plan created by the social democrats and greens in 2000 to phase out the country 's nuclear power facilities .
glos is a member of the christian social union , the bavarian sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union .
two dow n , so far one of the most crucial pieces of legislation passed by outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , in the eyes of many , was a planned phase-out of germany 's atomic energy plants by 2020 .
the idea , largely pressed by the environmentally-friendly greens , was to focus on renewable energy and away from a crippling dependence on oil .
it also found support at a time when safety concerns over nuclear power reactors were highlighted with accidents like the one in chernobyl in 1986 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : due to close in 2008 so far , the government has closed two nuclear reactors .
the remaining 17 , owned by utilities rwe ag , e.on ag and enbw , are to be closed over the next 15 years .
the next due to close , according to the environment ministry , is rwe 's " biblis a " reactor , in 2008 .
merkel wa n ts to stop n uclear phase out the conservatives led by chancellor-designate angela merkel have made no secret of the fact that they intend to put the brakes on the nuclear-phase out .
earlier this year , merkel argued in a speech that if germany is no longer active in nuclear power , it would have no influence on the international market when it comes to exporting nuclear technology .
the conservatives are keen to provide germany , a large importer of oil and gas , with greater energy security and allow the energy industry to earn more by extending the life of their plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agree to disgree , for now " in my view , an ideologically motivated nuclear phase-out does not reflect economic demands , " merkel said , citing the fact that countries such as india and china are expanding their nuclear energy capacities . " for me , the question is , how can germany , with its technical know-how , profit from this export potential .
as a patriot , i would like to see my country profit from our expertise , not watch others take the profits . "
but , michael müller , vice-chairman of the spd parliamentary group demanded that the conservatives finally recognize that they " have no chance " to chip away at nuclear phase-out with the spd .
müller argued that if the nuclear plants were indeed allowed to run longer , they would have to undergo updated security modifications - something that would cost money , he said .
maki n g a comeback one thing that 's bolstered the conservatives ' case is the fact that nuclear energy has been gradually making a comeback in europe with the first new nuclear plant on the continent in years being built in finland .
its supporters also point out that nuclear reactors emit virtually no greenhouse gases .

" the spd-green government failed to keep its promise to reduce weapons export , " said gkke president and catholic prelate karl jüsten .
" the balance is disappointing . " co n tradictio n s in 2004 , germany exported some 3.8 billion euros worth of weapons .
in keeping with german habits of recent years , some 1.2 billion euros worth of arms - approximately one third of german export licenses - went to states that also receive development aid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weapons and aid do n't mix " arms sales jeopardize the chances of effective aid and often stand in stark contradiction to the german government 's stated development policy aims , " jüsten said . moreover , germany 's 900,000 euros worth of weapons exported to china last year suggest the eu 's 16-year-old arms embargo against china is , as jüsten said , a " patchy " one . other destinations included conflict regions such as the middle east , while two thirds of germany 's arms exports head for the us . mystery of missi n g figures little looks set to change under chancellor angela merkel . " we noted with dismay that the recent coalition negotiations barely addressed the question of arms export , " said protestant church representative stephan reimers .
so far , the new government has refrained from agreeing any restrictive arms export policy . the gkke report is based on figures made available by the eu rather than the german government - which has yet to publish its annual arms export report . calls for tra n spare n cy in 1998 , the foreign ministers of the 15 european union member states adopted an eu code of conduct on arms exports , aimed to set common standards for the management of and restraint in arms exports from the eu , which is a politically binding agreement under which member states agree to abide by certain criteria when granting arms export licenses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arms sales - a cloudy issue " at a european level we have attained a satisfactory level of transparency , which the german government falls far short of , " said bernhard moltmann from the hesse foundation for peace and conflict research , pointing out that decisions relating to arms exports are taken behind closed doors by the german security council . " parliament needs to play a more active role when it comes to export licenses , " he said . and reimers added that the fact that a report on arms export in 2004 has yet to be published by the government " is in clear contempt of both the parliament and the public .

the world speaks english .
many german companies are making it their mother tongue .
some workers see this as an opportunity , others as a curse , for their careers .
yet corporate english is also a question of culture . the german business world is going through a tough transition period .
companies like technology giant siemens , auto manufacturer daimlerchrysler and software producer sap sell much more abroad than in germany - and nowadays , the language of business abroad is conducted primarily in english . already in 1999 , the publishing house bertelsmann began printing more and more books in english , which became the lingua franca .
other publishers soon followed suit . when the munich-based hypovereinsbank merged with italy 's unicredito , the boards decided that instead of denigrating german or italian by snubbing one over the other , they would use english in the company 's official communications - a fact that 's more befitting a bank of its size anyway . multilingualism costs money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : english resulted when german hvb group merged with italian unicredito in the international business world , fusions , takeovers and global interests are forcing corporations - in the plain interest of economics - to make one language the official company tongue , and that is usually english .
a multilingual environment is simply expensive .
interpreters and translators are necessary during talks and for internal communication , something that adds up over the long run . " that quickly becomes economically unfeasible , " said business expert jürgen hausschildt .
" and in spite of translations , there are repeated misunderstandings . " particularly the internal vernacular and terminology in a company are difficult to translate , according to hausschildt . companies in smaller countries do away with mother tongue a single company language can prevent such misunderstandings in addition to lowering costs .
nevertheless , the possible variations are limitless . " in small countries like norway , denmark and the netherlands , only english is spoken in companies .
they 've done away with their mother tongue all together , " said hausschildt . in most offices , there is a two-language culture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at siemens ' mobile phone plant in brazil , portuguese is spoken german banking giant deutsche bank is one example .
international queries are answered in english , questions from germany in german . siemens does it similarly , yet at the same time , it tries to promote an image as a company whose home is where the office is . " siemens is a global company , but in america we speak english , in india hindi , and in france french , " said company spokesman georg haux . fears of a manager what 's good for the goose , here the company , is n't necessarily good for the gander , in this case the employees .
managers frequently fear that their failure to speak a foreign language could hinder their chances of climbing further up the corporate ladder . " those who speak the mother tongue are preferred when it comes to managerial positions , " said hausschildt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when asking deutsche bank outside of germany , the response is in english even when a worker is better qualified , if the language skills are lacking , these shortcomings can cost them a promotion .
another problem confronts those who are good communicators and have even better than average english abilities - the loss of soft skills . " this is a terrible situation for many managers , " said expert hausschildt . back to basics those companies that do decide to put all their eggs in one basket and use english must exert a lot of energy in the beginning phase .
meetings take longer and any potential misunderstandings must be clarified . so that everyone manages to communicate on a similar level , or at least be able to , some companies resort to a basic english whose lexicon consists of between 400 and 800 , according to hausschildt .

" parliament needs to play a more active role when it comes to export licenses , " he said . and reimers added that the fact that a report on arms export in 2004 has yet to be published by the government " is in clear contempt of both the parliament and the public .

" a lot of silly things are being spread in the political community and in the media , " he told süddeutsche zeitu n g in his first public comments on the issue .
" in the past , i supported this project politically because i thought it made sense .
i 'm only 61 years old and i want to work - i do n't want to get in my wife 's way at home .
besides , it is an honor . " he said that talk over his compensation - reportedly up to one million euros -lrb- $ 1.19 million -rrb- - was " pure invention " since the topic has not yet been broached .
he noted that he was only offered the job on friday and accepted it after consulting german companies involved in the project .
and he added that he was considering legal action . need code of co n duct some german politicians believe schröder is crossing the fine line separating politics from business , and have criticized him for choosing to work in such a controversial area . " i would never have imagined that a german head of government could act ... with such a lack of instinct , " said parliament president and cdu member norbert lammert . even politicians from schröder 's own social democratic party were skeptical . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : struck is not defending schröder " i would not have done it , " said peter struck , who served as defense minister in the coalition government led by schröder .
" but gerhard schröder is a private individual and can do what he wants . " meanwhile , criticism of the chancellor 's actions has led to a call for a new code of conduct that would limit government officials ' employment in the private sector after leaving office .
chancellor angela merkel is open to such an initiative , officials said . christian wulff , a leading member of merkel 's christian democratic union party , said he should not take the position . " with his behavior , gerhard schröder has inflicted heavy damage to the image of politics in germany , " wulff , schröder 's successor as premier of the state of lower saxony , told bild newspaper . pipeli n e n ecessary the issue began after russian energy giant gazprom announced on friday that schröder would head the supervisory board of the consortium building the north european gas pipeline .

schröder has argued that the pipeline is an essential piece of germany 's future energy strategy . the pipeline will help meet the country 's growing gas needs - about half of all german homes are heated by gas and three-quarters of new homes have gas heating . close relatio n ship the press in poland , already extremely critical of the project , was furious on monday . " the fact that he is taking a job in a company led by a former stasi agent and with russian president vladimir putin as one of the big bosses , 15 days after vacating the chancellery , is compromising to schroeder the statesman , " wrote the center-left gazeta wyborcza . while in office , schröder had a close political and personal relationship with putin , who speaks fluent german . stretching for 1,200 kilometers -lrb- 750 miles -rrb- under the baltic sea from vyborg near st. petersburg to greifswald on the northeastern coast of germany , the pipeline is scheduled to go into operation in 2010 , initially delivering 27.5 billion cubic meters a year which will rise to 55 billion . gazprom will control 51 percent of the venture while eon , the leading german energy group , and basf , the world 's biggest chemicals maker , will hold 24.5 percent each . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no pipe and slippers for rejuvenated schröder after running germany and sparring with some the world 's most powerful leaders for seven years , gerhard schröder could be excused for taking a rest .

" i find it surprising that a commitment made by the united states in the framework agreement last year to reform food aid ... should now be described as an obsession of the european union , " he said . " food aid for emergency relief can be a tool to advance development and for humanitarian relief but the large structured us program of food aid in kind is designed in reality to give support to us agricultural producers , " he said . " statistics show that the volume of this aid is directly related to the price shifts for the commodities concerned on the us market , " he added . last week , the heads of the world food program and unicef , plus the un high commissioner for refugees , called on wto negotiators to ensure food aid is protected . they said it would be even harder to get cash donations at a time when donations of food in kind are already slipping . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de at wto , security is tight and expectations low as the wto talks opened in hong kong tuesday , security was tight and key players , including germany , had lowered their expectations .

" in the home country of english , the world language , the task of persuasion is especially difficult , " he added .
" i firmly believe this is also a matter of social justice because languages facilitate social mobility . " joe brown was the 2005 winner of the german teacher awards presented by the german embassy in london .
he works at a number of inner-city elementary schools and told dw-world that the main problems with language-learning occur at high-school level . " younger children enjoy learning german , and do n't tend to have any of the prejudices you find with older kids , " he said .
" starting early is therefore the best option , and in fact , you can argue it 's an ideal language for small children because the pronunciation is n't hard and it 's very logical . " the traditionally hostile relations between britain and germany also play a role .
" you have to break down prejudices , " said brown .
" it 's also a question of inter-cultural education . " plunging numbers informing matussek 's remarks were figures published by the national languages center showing that the number of high school pupils studying languages has slumped by more than 64,000 this year - the first year since languages became an optional subject for 14- to 16-year-olds . learning a language beyond the age of 14 is now compulsory in just one quarter of england 's state schools , where second languages have traditionally been french or german . the latter is particularly out of favor , with some 105,288 students taking junior high school exams in german , and 272,140 in french - but even the number of senior high school students taking french has plunged by almost half . " the problem is , german just is n't considered a young person 's language , " explained brown .
" teenagers these days want to learn spanish , because spain 's a popular holiday destination and it 's seen as more of a world language than german and french . " universities bear the brunt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oxford university one long-term consequence of the shrinking number of pupils learning german is already being felt by university modern language departments , which have fewer applicants than ever before and face a growing threat of closure as the popularity - and usefulness - of german degrees continues to wane . but as brown points out , it 's a vicious circle .
" there just are n't enough people coming through the system to deliver german as a foreign language , " he said .
" a high percentage of adults in britain say they wish they spoke a foreign language , but they did n't capitalize on the opportunities they had to learn .
often , this was because it was n't taught well and the curriculum was n't interesting enough . " " britain faces the great task of changing this trend , " said matussek at the conference .
" languages are not just an ornamental necessity but vital to the real interests of this country . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : britain isolates itself linguistically britain is an island nation and in no way is this more visible than in the country 's stance on foreign languages .

" a lot of silly things are being spread in the political community and in the media , " he told süddeutsche zeitu n g in his first public comments on the issue .
" in the past , i supported this project politically because i thought it made sense .
i 'm only 61 years old and i want to work - i do n't want to get in my wife 's way at home .
besides , it is an honor . " he said that talk over his compensation - reportedly up to one million euros -lrb- $ 1.19 million -rrb- - was " pure invention " since the topic has not yet been broached .
he noted that he was only offered the job on friday and accepted it after consulting german companies involved in the project .
and he added that he was considering legal action . need code of co n duct some german politicians believe schröder is crossing the fine line separating politics from business , and have criticized him for choosing to work in such a controversial area . " i would never have imagined that a german head of government could act ... with such a lack of instinct , " said parliament president and cdu member norbert lammert . even politicians from schröder 's own social democratic party were skeptical . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : struck is not defending schröder " i would not have done it , " said peter struck , who served as defense minister in the coalition government led by schröder .
" but gerhard schröder is a private individual and can do what he wants . " meanwhile , criticism of the chancellor 's actions has led to a call for a new code of conduct that would limit government officials ' employment in the private sector after leaving office .
chancellor angela merkel is open to such an initiative , officials said . christian wulff , a leading member of merkel 's christian democratic union party , said he should not take the position . " with his behavior , gerhard schröder has inflicted heavy damage to the image of politics in germany , " wulff , schröder 's successor as premier of the state of lower saxony , told bild newspaper . pipeli n e n ecessary the issue began after russian energy giant gazprom announced on friday that schröder would head the supervisory board of the consortium building the north european gas pipeline .

schröder has argued that the pipeline is an essential piece of germany 's future energy strategy . the pipeline will help meet the country 's growing gas needs - about half of all german homes are heated by gas and three-quarters of new homes have gas heating . close relatio n ship the press in poland , already extremely critical of the project , was furious on monday . " the fact that he is taking a job in a company led by a former stasi agent and with russian president vladimir putin as one of the big bosses , 15 days after vacating the chancellery , is compromising to schroeder the statesman , " wrote the center-left gazeta wyborcza . while in office , schröder had a close political and personal relationship with putin , who speaks fluent german . stretching for 1,200 kilometers -lrb- 750 miles -rrb- under the baltic sea from vyborg near st. petersburg to greifswald on the northeastern coast of germany , the pipeline is scheduled to go into operation in 2010 , initially delivering 27.5 billion cubic meters a year which will rise to 55 billion . gazprom will control 51 percent of the venture while eon , the leading german energy group , and basf , the world 's biggest chemicals maker , will hold 24.5 percent each . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no pipe and slippers for rejuvenated schröder after running germany and sparring with some the world 's most powerful leaders for seven years , gerhard schröder could be excused for taking a rest .

" the spd-green government failed to keep its promise to reduce weapons export , " said gkke president and catholic prelate karl jüsten .
" the balance is disappointing . " co n tradictio n s in 2004 , germany exported some 3.8 billion euros worth of weapons .
in keeping with german habits of recent years , some 1.2 billion euros worth of arms - approximately one third of german export licenses - went to states that also receive development aid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weapons and aid do n't mix " arms sales jeopardize the chances of effective aid and often stand in stark contradiction to the german government 's stated development policy aims , " jüsten said . moreover , germany 's 900,000 euros worth of weapons exported to china last year suggest the eu 's 16-year-old arms embargo against china is , as jüsten said , a " patchy " one . other destinations included conflict regions such as the middle east , while two thirds of germany 's arms exports head for the us . mystery of missi n g figures little looks set to change under chancellor angela merkel . " we noted with dismay that the recent coalition negotiations barely addressed the question of arms export , " said protestant church representative stephan reimers .
so far , the new government has refrained from agreeing any restrictive arms export policy . the gkke report is based on figures made available by the eu rather than the german government - which has yet to publish its annual arms export report . calls for tra n spare n cy in 1998 , the foreign ministers of the 15 european union member states adopted an eu code of conduct on arms exports , aimed to set common standards for the management of and restraint in arms exports from the eu , which is a politically binding agreement under which member states agree to abide by certain criteria when granting arms export licenses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arms sales - a cloudy issue " at a european level we have attained a satisfactory level of transparency , which the german government falls far short of , " said bernhard moltmann from the hesse foundation for peace and conflict research , pointing out that decisions relating to arms exports are taken behind closed doors by the german security council . " parliament needs to play a more active role when it comes to export licenses , " he said . and reimers added that the fact that a report on arms export in 2004 has yet to be published by the government " is in clear contempt of both the parliament and the public .

former chancellor schröder is supposed to become head of the board of supervisors of the swiss-registered german-russian company for development and construction of the baltic sea pipeline . the pipeline agreement between the russian energy giant gazprom and german companies basf and eon was hastily signed in september , before the german parliamentary elections and in the presence of both schröder and russian president putin .
the event was accompanied by heavy criticism from the neighboring eastern european countries and references to the inefficiency of such a project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politics is out , big business is in for former chancellor schröder with his new job , schröder is complicating the future german policy toward the east , which should n't only be directed towards moscow .
he is , furthermore , damaging the reputation of his earlier russian policies , letting his historic legacy in the german-russian relations appear in unfavorable light . as chancellor , schröder pursued a controversial foreign policy with the goal of a close partnership with russia .
against resistance on the domestic front , schröder won a great deal of trust in russia , a historical sign of which was his participation in the celebrations of the sixtieth anniversary since the end of world war ii on the red square . europe n eeds russia but schröder 's russian policy was not only based on his wish to reconcile the germans and the russians , but also on a geopolitical and strategic realization that the european continent could be peaceful and prosperous only if russia , too , became sufficiently integrated .
europe and russia are also dependent on each other because of the mutually beneficial economic links .
only together can they survive in the world of the twenty-first century . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gas pipeline deal may end up as a political faux pas for germany these pragmatic factors of schröder 's russian policy are getting completely invalidated by his becoming head of the supervisory board for the baltic sea pipeline consortium .
from this perspective , his whole russian policy seems like a policy of personal advantage - especially if the new position is not honorary . there are many jobs schröder could have taken if he wanted to use his weight as an " elder statesman " on behalf of the german-russian relations - in connection with the " petersburg dialogue , " a forum on civil society , which he himself initiated , or in the ongoing german-russian youth projects .

" the spd-green government failed to keep its promise to reduce weapons export , " said gkke president and catholic prelate karl jüsten .
" the balance is disappointing . " co n tradictio n s in 2004 , germany exported some 3.8 billion euros worth of weapons .
in keeping with german habits of recent years , some 1.2 billion euros worth of arms - approximately one third of german export licenses - went to states that also receive development aid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weapons and aid do n't mix " arms sales jeopardize the chances of effective aid and often stand in stark contradiction to the german government 's stated development policy aims , " jüsten said . moreover , germany 's 900,000 euros worth of weapons exported to china last year suggest the eu 's 16-year-old arms embargo against china is , as jüsten said , a " patchy " one . other destinations included conflict regions such as the middle east , while two thirds of germany 's arms exports head for the us . mystery of missi n g figures little looks set to change under chancellor angela merkel . " we noted with dismay that the recent coalition negotiations barely addressed the question of arms export , " said protestant church representative stephan reimers .
so far , the new government has refrained from agreeing any restrictive arms export policy . the gkke report is based on figures made available by the eu rather than the german government - which has yet to publish its annual arms export report . calls for tra n spare n cy in 1998 , the foreign ministers of the 15 european union member states adopted an eu code of conduct on arms exports , aimed to set common standards for the management of and restraint in arms exports from the eu , which is a politically binding agreement under which member states agree to abide by certain criteria when granting arms export licenses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arms sales - a cloudy issue " at a european level we have attained a satisfactory level of transparency , which the german government falls far short of , " said bernhard moltmann from the hesse foundation for peace and conflict research , pointing out that decisions relating to arms exports are taken behind closed doors by the german security council . " parliament needs to play a more active role when it comes to export licenses , " he said . and reimers added that the fact that a report on arms export in 2004 has yet to be published by the government " is in clear contempt of both the parliament and the public .

williams , 51 , is now scheduled for execution at 0001 -lrb- 0801gmt -rrb- on tuesday .
on monday evening , the us supreme court refused a stay of execution , as had california 's supreme court and a federal appeals court .
a high-profile campaign with celebrity backing has fought to save williams , who denies four murders in 1979 .
with the rejection of his appeal by the us supreme court , williams has exhausted all legal avenues .
he will be executed by lethal injection just after midnight local time at san quentin prison , north of san francisco .
several hundred of his supporters have gathered at the prison gates to protest his innocence , burning candles , beating drums and singing .
the bbc 's peter bowes says the atmosphere is growing increasingly tense , as the hour of williams ' execution approaches .
a handful of people are staging a counter demonstration in favour of the death penalty .
' no redemption ' " after studying the evidence , searching the history , listening to the arguments and wrestling with the profound consequences , i could find no justification for granting clemency , " mr schwarzenegger said .
the case has generated widespread debate in the us " stanley williams insists he is innocent , and that he will not and should not apologise or otherwise atone for the murders of the four victims in this case .
without apology and atonement for these senseless and brutal killings , there can be no redemption , " he said .
" based on the cumulative weight of the evidence , there is no reason to second-guess the jury 's decision of guilt or raise significant doubts or serious reservations about williams ' conviction and death sentence , " the governor added .
mr schwarzenegger could have commuted the death sentence to life in prison without parole .
the california national association for the advancement of colored people said it was saddened by the governor 's decision .
the facts do not justify overturning the jury 's verdict or the decisions of the courts in this case arnold schwarzenegger governor of california governor 's statement your views " we believe this is a serious blow to our effort to fight gangs , " its president , alice huffman , said .
during his 24 years in jail , williams has won praise for his anti-gang books , earning nobel peace prize nominations for his teachings .
his high-profile supporters have included oscar-winning actor jamie foxx , rap star snoop dogg - himself a former crips member- bishop desmond tutu and the reverend jesse jackson .
however , the relatives of some of his victims have insisted he did not deserve clemency because he had not owned up to his crimes and refused to inform on fellow gang members .

what a waste !
christmas dinner with all the trimmings is the high point of the year for many of us .
but , as the pressure grows on cooks to serve the perfect meal - with every conceivable extra - we 're actually wasting millions of tonnes of food .
every christmas , the average family throws away a whole bin bag full of uneaten food , according to the charity recycle now , creating an extra 3m tonnes of waste for landfill sites in the uk .
that 's on top of the unwanted christmas presents - and the cards which get dumped as soon as the festive season finishes .
so , how can you avoid creating unnecessary waste this christmas ?
we got some tips from julie brown from recycle now - and the chef kevin woodford .
a recording of our interview will be available later this morning on this page .
this christmas , as a nation we 're expected to buy 16.5 m turkeys ; 175m mince pies and 15,000 tonnes of sprouts .
many end up going straight into the bin , as the guests depart .
recycle now has some tips for avoiding waste : confirm how many people you 're cooking for so you do n't over-cater .
make a list before you do the big shop : it will save duplication and avoid you having to go out for a second time .
buy what you need instead of lots of " just in case " extras .
buy fruit and vegetables loose rather than pre-packed , so you do n't end up with too much .
avoid putting out large amounts of perishable items like cooked meats , cheese and cream .
and remember to put them in the fridge afterwards .
take a moment to think how you can use any left-overs creatively use the peelings for compost make sure you recycle your used bottles and cans - and do n't forget to recycle your tree .

every christmas , the average family throws away a whole bin bag full of uneaten food , according to the charity recycle now , creating an extra 3m tonnes of waste for landfill sites in the uk .

buy fruit and vegetables loose rather than pre-packed , so you do n't end up with too much .
avoid putting out large amounts of perishable items like cooked meats , cheese and cream .

the twice-daily air wales service to the belgian capital will be restored after a gap of nearly two years .
the route is the first to benefit from a £ 4m welsh assembly government fund to attract new air connections to wales .
transport minister andrew davies said the brussels link sent an " important signal " about wales ' place in europe .
air wales scrapped scheduled flights between cardiff and brussels in april 2004 , blaming insufficient interest .
the service had been running for only three months .
ministers hope the new route development fund will attract many more direct air links to wales over the next few years .
mr davies said : " the fund will play a key role in improving accessibility and competitiveness for welsh businesses , opening up new markets and encouraging tourism and inward investment .
" support will be focused on those routes which deliver a net economic benefit for wales . "
' important signal ' the fund - which will support international and domestic routes - aims to share the risk in starting new air services which benefit business or tourism .
support is limited to a maximum of three years .
mr davies said he was " particularly pleased " to announce the new flights to brussels .
he added : " this service will restore our direct connection with the very heart of europe .
" it sends an important signal about our place in europe and means that people travelling to brussels from south wales will once again have a convenient service on their doorstep . "

the kits contain a small pipette and three test areas which will test for ketamine , rohypnol and ghb .
police have distributed them to bar staff so customers who suspect their drink is spiked can ask for a test .
