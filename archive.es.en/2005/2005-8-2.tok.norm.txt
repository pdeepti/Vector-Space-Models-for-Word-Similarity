on monday , 1,400 doctors took to the streets in two states to kick off the weeklong action . the pain threshold for young doctors in german hospitals has been reached .
on monday in the states of baden-württemberg and hesse , over 1,400 physicians hung up their stethoscopes on the office door and hit the streets to protest poor working conditions .
the banners the doctors carried sent a clear signal to hospitals , particularly state-run facilities , around the country : " better pay for better work " and " england pays twice as much . "
on the first day of weeklong protests that will culminate on friday in berlin with a " national day of protest , " leaders from the marburger bund doctors ' union are looking to raise the awareness of the plight of german doctors compared to their peers abroad .
overtime without compensation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : physicians of frankfurt 's university hospital protest against their working conditions .
the banner reads " money away , doctor away . "
in a country where many laborers receive extra compensation for working overtime , at night or under dangerous conditions , the doctors seem to have a point .
the marburger bund said that some 146,000 hospital doctors perform 50 million hours of overtime each year , most of them without extra compensation , and that germany trailed far behind comparable nations in physicians ' salaries .
the chairman of the union , frank ulrich montgomery , said the budget cuts at university clinics were equal to " state-supported robbery of wages . "
the doctors say they have been forced to bear the brunt of budget cutbacks at public health institutions , seeing their christmas and vacation bonuses slashed while working hours increase .
" as long as french , british and american colleagues earn two or three times as much , nothing will stop the flight of doctors abroad and the shortage of physicians , " said montgomery . particularly disturbing to the union was the grave discrepancy between young assistant doctors and head physicians .
27-year-olds fresh out of college begin with a take-home pay of around 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,000 -rrb- per month .
their superiors , frequently with managerial duties , earn up to 12 times that amount .
the system is at fault bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overtime is frequently left unpaid in german hospitals while the younger physicians have taken to the streets demanding fairer work schedules and more pay , others say it is the system that doctors created for themselves that is at fault .
" the union leaders ca n't come up with a better idea than to demand more pay , " criticized kurt lauterbach .
the health care economist points out that the two-tier health care system , where little money can be earned with public health plan patients and a lot with private patients , leads to young doctors receiving poor wages .
" this system is unjust and must be revamped , " lauterbach declared .
this must also be done in the interest of german patients .
young doctors are taking their abilities to other countries where they know the rewards are greater .
according to the latest figures from the doctors ' union , around 6,000 positions remain unfilled at german hospitals .
the same number are registered abroad .
one area where all parties concerned agree , is the amount of time that german physicians spend mired in medical bureaucratic procedures .
according to christian democratic social affairs expert andreas strom , this costs them up to 30 percent of their work time . dw staff / afp -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de doctors defect to blissful britain germany 's health system is a troubled soul .

while conservative challenger angela merkel is too busy to appear in two tv debates , media-savvy chancellor schröder is even eager to go for a duel with himself .
the debate about the debate is heating up . chancellor schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- failed to reach an agreement saturday on the number of televised debates that the chancellor candidates would participate in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : broadcaster would like to see two tv debates citing a short campaign and a very busy schedule , cdu candidate angela merkel and a favorite to become germany 's next and first female chancellor has so far agreed on only one tv debate with her political rival .
schröder 's camp , on the other hand , is still pushing for two . the final decision regarding the format and number of debates will have to be made this week to give the broadcasters enough time to organize and schedule the events . a new meeting with german public and private broadcasters will take place on wednesday . schröder an experienced hand schröder 's spokesperson , bela anda , said monday it would be " strange " if angela merkel did not meet the expectations of the population . " i wonder if they 're trying to hide something , " said anda . according to the government spokesperson , two tv duels have become a national and regional standard .
they have been requested by both public and private broadcasters , as well as the general public . however , television face-offs between the main chancellor candidates are relatively new in germany as opposed to the us .
germans were treated to their first taste of the event during campaigning for the last federal elections in 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is what the debate looked like in 2002 then , the media-savvy schröder appeared in two such events with his opponent at the time , edmund stoiber of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
the televised discussions saw schröder using his slick debating skills to boost his poll ratings and stage a comeback by outshining stoiber .
14,9 million viewers watched the first debate , and 15,2 tuned in to the second debate , including seven million viewers who had not seen the first one . some merkel allies fear that schröder could use the same tactic to narrow the poll lead of their candidate , an unassuming former scientist who often looks awkward on television .
schröder is also said to want to introduce more bite by scrapping some of the restrictions on speaking time . one or none willi hausmann , the cdu negotiator , said that it was up to schröder to decide whether there would be " one tv duel , or none at all . " " two duels are not negotiable for us , " he said . merkel 's spokesperson , eva christiansen , stressed that the tv debate was only one in a series of campaign events . " the duel with the chancellor is one format , but the election campaign has many other forms , " she said . a compromise ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maybe she does n't like the make-up : angela merkel preparing for a tv appearance the two tv debates in 2002 lasted 60 minutes each , but the government spokesman did not rule out the possibility that schröder would agree on one , significantly longer , discussion with merkel . he also said , however , that in the case no compromise was reached , schröder would be willing to discuss his reform plans alone , without merkel as an interlocutor . schröder , who appeared sunday night as a guest at the popular political talk-show " sabine christiansen , " promised a " well-mannered , fair and , by all means , hard though respectful interaction " with his opponent during the campaign . " should i make a faux pas , which i hope i not to , i wo n't be afraid to apologize , " schröder said . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans to tune in for first candidate debate millions of germans will tune into the country 's first-ever televised debate between chancellor candidates this sunday .

on monday , 1,400 doctors took to the streets in two states to kick off the weeklong action . the pain threshold for young doctors in german hospitals has been reached .
on monday in the states of baden-württemberg and hesse , over 1,400 physicians hung up their stethoscopes on the office door and hit the streets to protest poor working conditions .
the banners the doctors carried sent a clear signal to hospitals , particularly state-run facilities , around the country : " better pay for better work " and " england pays twice as much . "
on the first day of weeklong protests that will culminate on friday in berlin with a " national day of protest , " leaders from the marburger bund doctors ' union are looking to raise the awareness of the plight of german doctors compared to their peers abroad .
overtime without compensation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : physicians of frankfurt 's university hospital protest against their working conditions .
the banner reads " money away , doctor away . "
in a country where many laborers receive extra compensation for working overtime , at night or under dangerous conditions , the doctors seem to have a point .
the marburger bund said that some 146,000 hospital doctors perform 50 million hours of overtime each year , most of them without extra compensation , and that germany trailed far behind comparable nations in physicians ' salaries .
the chairman of the union , frank ulrich montgomery , said the budget cuts at university clinics were equal to " state-supported robbery of wages . "
the doctors say they have been forced to bear the brunt of budget cutbacks at public health institutions , seeing their christmas and vacation bonuses slashed while working hours increase .
" as long as french , british and american colleagues earn two or three times as much , nothing will stop the flight of doctors abroad and the shortage of physicians , " said montgomery . particularly disturbing to the union was the grave discrepancy between young assistant doctors and head physicians .
27-year-olds fresh out of college begin with a take-home pay of around 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,000 -rrb- per month .
their superiors , frequently with managerial duties , earn up to 12 times that amount .
the system is at fault bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overtime is frequently left unpaid in german hospitals while the younger physicians have taken to the streets demanding fairer work schedules and more pay , others say it is the system that doctors created for themselves that is at fault .
" the union leaders ca n't come up with a better idea than to demand more pay , " criticized kurt lauterbach .
the health care economist points out that the two-tier health care system , where little money can be earned with public health plan patients and a lot with private patients , leads to young doctors receiving poor wages .
" this system is unjust and must be revamped , " lauterbach declared .
this must also be done in the interest of german patients .
young doctors are taking their abilities to other countries where they know the rewards are greater .
according to the latest figures from the doctors ' union , around 6,000 positions remain unfilled at german hospitals .
the same number are registered abroad .
one area where all parties concerned agree , is the amount of time that german physicians spend mired in medical bureaucratic procedures .
according to christian democratic social affairs expert andreas strom , this costs them up to 30 percent of their work time . dw staff / afp -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de doctors defect to blissful britain germany 's health system is a troubled soul .

" you can take it for granted that a future government led by a christian democrat chancellor , would aspire to keep these good relations intact or improve them wherever needed , " she said . but merkel has been very critical of the way the german government under gerhard schröder has approached transatlantic relations . " i do n't understand why previously excellent relations with the united states had to worsen to the extent known to all of us just because of our good ties with other nations , " merkel said . friendship , but no servitude bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder won the 2002 re-election greatly thanks to his opposition to the us invasion of iraq chancellor schröder , on his part , made it clear that for him friendship did not equal total obedience .

" it 's never been our idea to say yes to everything that comes our way , and we 're not planning to change this in future either . " merkel keeps stressing that loyalty in the transatlantic alliance is a great virtue .

in order to gain more direct influence on important foreign policy issues , she 's planning to have a security advisor at her side in the chancellery .
cdu foreign policy spokesman friedbert pflüger is being viewed as the most likely candidate for this post . there had also been talk about angela merkel wanting to install a separate ministry for european affairs , but the latest reports say these plans are now off the table . either way , merkel 's plans are going to hurt the opposition liberal democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- as the cdu 's likely junior partner would claim the post of foreign minister .
it stands to reason that both a ministry for european affairs and a security advisor in the chancellery would leave the foreign ministry with considerably less power and influence . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel 's envoy lauds meeting with bush the cdu 's wolfgang schäuble went to the us to lay out the basis of his party 's foreign policy in the case of a conservative election victory and got a welcome surprise - 45 minutes with the man himself , president bush .

the southern german state of bavaria went into a state of uproar as rumors begin to circulate that european bureaucrats would ban low-neckline dresses in beer gardens to protect the waitresses from the sun . the bavarians can finally breathe a collective sigh of relief because now they know that nobody is going to mess with their beloved dirndl - the traditional bavarian dress that accentuates the upper part of the female body with a revealing neckline .
only yesterday , however , the dirndl as we know it , seemed to be on the brink of extinction , and proud bavarians ready to declare a cultural war on brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : proud to wear a dirndl : german starlet verona pooth née feldbusch during oktoberfest in munich after the european parliament passed a directive to protect employees from optical radiation , including sunlight , the bavarians started worrying that petty bureaucrats from brussels would start meddling into their private affairs , crippling the time-honored bavarian sense for fun and seriously limiting the freedom of expression of those friendly and well-muscled beer garden waitresses . state of shock a newspaper from munich described the eu initiative as the outright " cleavage ban . "
the mayor of munich , christian ude , warned of " european legal perfectionism " and threatened never to enter a beer garden again if he were not to be greeted by plunging necklines . " the dirndl is an integral part of bavarian culture and joy of living - a culture that many are jealous of , " said frank-ulrich john , the spokesperson for the bavarian association of hotels and inns . " i have spoken with many servers , and i have never heard that a sunburn in the cleavage area has been a problem , " john said . munich is no brussels according to john , eu citizens are more mature than eu bureaucrats think . " i could imagine a buttoned-up waitress with a sunshade , but only in brussels , " john added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the beer garden is a bavarian social institution of utmost importance the eu representative in bavaria , paul-joachim kubosch , however , assured the beer garden fans that there was no need for the neckline scare , since the european directive on optical radiation would only concern high-risk professions , which does not include beer garden servers . so it seems that the dirndl is safe , after all , and , along with it , the bavarian sense of friendliness and cheerful openness to the world . which is probably a good enough reason to hit the first beer garden and celebrate . beer , anyone ? dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " click here for a selection of best stories from dw-world 's " and finally ...

while conservative challenger angela merkel is too busy to appear in two tv debates , media-savvy chancellor schröder is even eager to go for a duel with himself .
the debate about the debate is heating up . chancellor schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- failed to reach an agreement saturday on the number of televised debates that the chancellor candidates would participate in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : broadcaster would like to see two tv debates citing a short campaign and a very busy schedule , cdu candidate angela merkel and a favorite to become germany 's next and first female chancellor has so far agreed on only one tv debate with her political rival .
schröder 's camp , on the other hand , is still pushing for two . the final decision regarding the format and number of debates will have to be made this week to give the broadcasters enough time to organize and schedule the events . a new meeting with german public and private broadcasters will take place on wednesday . schröder an experienced hand schröder 's spokesperson , bela anda , said monday it would be " strange " if angela merkel did not meet the expectations of the population . " i wonder if they 're trying to hide something , " said anda . according to the government spokesperson , two tv duels have become a national and regional standard .
they have been requested by both public and private broadcasters , as well as the general public . however , television face-offs between the main chancellor candidates are relatively new in germany as opposed to the us .
germans were treated to their first taste of the event during campaigning for the last federal elections in 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is what the debate looked like in 2002 then , the media-savvy schröder appeared in two such events with his opponent at the time , edmund stoiber of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
the televised discussions saw schröder using his slick debating skills to boost his poll ratings and stage a comeback by outshining stoiber .
14,9 million viewers watched the first debate , and 15,2 tuned in to the second debate , including seven million viewers who had not seen the first one . some merkel allies fear that schröder could use the same tactic to narrow the poll lead of their candidate , an unassuming former scientist who often looks awkward on television .
schröder is also said to want to introduce more bite by scrapping some of the restrictions on speaking time . one or none willi hausmann , the cdu negotiator , said that it was up to schröder to decide whether there would be " one tv duel , or none at all . " " two duels are not negotiable for us , " he said . merkel 's spokesperson , eva christiansen , stressed that the tv debate was only one in a series of campaign events . " the duel with the chancellor is one format , but the election campaign has many other forms , " she said . a compromise ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maybe she does n't like the make-up : angela merkel preparing for a tv appearance the two tv debates in 2002 lasted 60 minutes each , but the government spokesman did not rule out the possibility that schröder would agree on one , significantly longer , discussion with merkel . he also said , however , that in the case no compromise was reached , schröder would be willing to discuss his reform plans alone , without merkel as an interlocutor . schröder , who appeared sunday night as a guest at the popular political talk-show " sabine christiansen , " promised a " well-mannered , fair and , by all means , hard though respectful interaction " with his opponent during the campaign . " should i make a faux pas , which i hope i not to , i wo n't be afraid to apologize , " schröder said . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans to tune in for first candidate debate millions of germans will tune into the country 's first-ever televised debate between chancellor candidates this sunday .
for both candidates there is much to win - and lose .

" she says she ca n't remember how they were killed because she drank heavily when the contractions began , " prosecutor annette bargenda said at a news conference .
the mother is suspected of giving birth to each of the infants and then killing them one by one between 1988 and 2004 . the woman told police that in every instance , she had given birth to the children without any assistance or other people being there .
the father of the children , who divorced the woman earlier this year , did n't know that she was pregnant , the woman claims .
the couple also have three children aged 18 , 19 and 20 . the ex-husband , who was not named , is a professional who spent long periods away from home on business .
he is said to be horrified by the news . babies already buried when woman sobered up in at least seven cases , the woman " knows she put a covering over each child .
she said she woke or sobered up only after the children were already buried , " bargenda said .
some of the remains were first stored on her balcony before being moved to the garden and shed , she added . a police spokesman said earlier tuesday that the woman had admitted killing some of the children , but the spokesman later said that was incorrect . german prosecutors said monday the bodies of the nine newborn babies were discovered in a shed the woman used for storage . " we are assuming there are at least nine corpses , " said michael neff of the frankfurt / oder state prosecutor 's office .

" we must ask ourselves how this unbelievable crime remained hidden all these years . " it 's a question directed at relatives , neighbors , doctors and the authorities , " he added . the state prosecutor 's office in the city said the find in the town of brieskow-finkenheerd , 10 kilometers -lrb- six miles -rrb- south of frankfurt in a depressed region of former east germany , was made on sunday . remains found in plant pots , buckets , aquarium " when someone went to clean up the lot , he found human bones in an aquarium , " state prosecutor ulrich scherding told news channel n24 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outside view of the house in brieskow-finkenheerd where police discovered the remains of the nine newborn babies authorities added that other bodies were hidden in flower boxes and pots in the shed and in buckets buried under sand and earth .

each of the infants appeared to have been killed immediately after birth . some 40 police officers with eight sniffer dogs were combing the area for other corpses . the mayor of brieskow-finkenheerd , ralf theuer , said he had not known the suspect but heard from neighbors that she tended to keep to herself . unprecedented infanticide in germany the vice-president of the association of german psychologists , uwe wetter , said that such cases , while extremely rare , often stem from social isolation combined with extreme symptoms of post-partum depression . in october 2003 , a 38-year-old woman from czerniejow , poland admitted to drowning five of her children after their births .

economy set to dominate german election the world according to merkel germany 's long road to multiculturalism election 2005 -pipe- 02.08.2005 energy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carrying conventional or renewable energy ?
oil and gas are scarce resources .
politicians have vastly different ideas when it comes to meeting growing energy demand . spd the spd plans to invest 20 billion euros -lrb- $ 24.5 billion -rrb- in renewable energy by 2010 with the goal of making germany the global market leader in the solar and wind power industries .
the party remains committed to the agreed on subsidies for phasing out coal production as well as nuclear energy .
the energy supply should come from climate-friendly ' clean coal ' plants , natural gas , biomass , and a mix of various renewable energy sources . cdu / csu the cdu and csu envision an energy supply from a diverse array of sources : oil , coal , gas , nuclear as well as biomass , hydro , wind , and solar energy .
regenerative energies should make up at least 12.5 percent of the energy supply , but should receive fewer subsidies than in the past .
the german nuclear power plants should be allowed to continue operation longer than currently intended . the greens the greens want to disembark from the nuclear age and move away from crude oil .
energy should increasingly come from solar , wind , hydro , biomass and geothermal generating plants .
the goal for 2020 is to produce a full quarter of the present energy supply , heating demand , fuel consumption , and goods of the petrochemical industry , respectively , from renewable energies and renewable primary products .
the coal subsidies should be reduced and completely eliminated by 2012 .
greenhouse gas emissions should be cut by 40 percent of their 1990 levels by 2020 ; the eu stipulates only a 30 percent reduction .
the greens clearly have the longest resume with legislation for environmental and consumer protection . fdp the free democratic party wants to slash subsidies , whether for hard coal power plants or for renewable energies .
the european electricity and gas markets should be more fully liberalized .
market regulation should only be oriented to increasing competitiveness , demands the fdp .
as with the christian union , the party is bent on atomic energy . the left party the left party is calling for a " rapid departure from nuclear energy . "
by 2050 the left party wants to see germany 's entire energy supply coming from renewables . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a rebirth for german nuclear energy ?
the prospect of victory by germany 's conservative opposition in an early general election has shaken up the country 's energy sector .
the nuclear power industry is hoping to slow the planned phase out atomic energy .

the southern german state of bavaria went into a state of uproar as rumors begin to circulate that european bureaucrats would ban low-neckline dresses in beer gardens to protect the waitresses from the sun . the bavarians can finally breathe a collective sigh of relief because now they know that nobody is going to mess with their beloved dirndl - the traditional bavarian dress that accentuates the upper part of the female body with a revealing neckline .

on monday , 1,400 doctors took to the streets in two states to kick off the weeklong action . the pain threshold for young doctors in german hospitals has been reached .
on monday in the states of baden-württemberg and hesse , over 1,400 physicians hung up their stethoscopes on the office door and hit the streets to protest poor working conditions .
the banners the doctors carried sent a clear signal to hospitals , particularly state-run facilities , around the country : " better pay for better work " and " england pays twice as much . "
on the first day of weeklong protests that will culminate on friday in berlin with a " national day of protest , " leaders from the marburger bund doctors ' union are looking to raise the awareness of the plight of german doctors compared to their peers abroad .
overtime without compensation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : physicians of frankfurt 's university hospital protest against their working conditions .
the banner reads " money away , doctor away . "
in a country where many laborers receive extra compensation for working overtime , at night or under dangerous conditions , the doctors seem to have a point .
the marburger bund said that some 146,000 hospital doctors perform 50 million hours of overtime each year , most of them without extra compensation , and that germany trailed far behind comparable nations in physicians ' salaries .
the chairman of the union , frank ulrich montgomery , said the budget cuts at university clinics were equal to " state-supported robbery of wages . "
the doctors say they have been forced to bear the brunt of budget cutbacks at public health institutions , seeing their christmas and vacation bonuses slashed while working hours increase .
" as long as french , british and american colleagues earn two or three times as much , nothing will stop the flight of doctors abroad and the shortage of physicians , " said montgomery . particularly disturbing to the union was the grave discrepancy between young assistant doctors and head physicians .
27-year-olds fresh out of college begin with a take-home pay of around 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,000 -rrb- per month .
their superiors , frequently with managerial duties , earn up to 12 times that amount .
the system is at fault bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overtime is frequently left unpaid in german hospitals while the younger physicians have taken to the streets demanding fairer work schedules and more pay , others say it is the system that doctors created for themselves that is at fault .
" the union leaders ca n't come up with a better idea than to demand more pay , " criticized kurt lauterbach .
the health care economist points out that the two-tier health care system , where little money can be earned with public health plan patients and a lot with private patients , leads to young doctors receiving poor wages .
" this system is unjust and must be revamped , " lauterbach declared .
this must also be done in the interest of german patients .
young doctors are taking their abilities to other countries where they know the rewards are greater .
according to the latest figures from the doctors ' union , around 6,000 positions remain unfilled at german hospitals .

spd presents election manifesto election 2005 -pipe- 02.08.2005 social justice or economic folly ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the redistribution of wealth is central to the left party 's plank the new hard-left grouping in germany , the left party , is sending tremors across the political landscape .
but , the party 's economic program has industry groups and economists shaking their heads , and worrying . it calls itself the left party , die linkspartei in german , and it 's making an already unusual election campaign even stranger .
made up of the successors to east germany 's communist party , the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , and disaffected left-wingers who split off from the social democrats , the election alternative for jobs and social justice , the left party has attracted surprising support with its message of wealth redistribution , bigger government and offers of more for everyone , except the capitalists . one and a half months before possible early elections in september , the new party is polling 12 percent nationwide .
in eastern germany , it has the support of a stunning 33 percent of the population , according to a poll conducted last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gregor gysi " we need a new culture , " gregor gysi , the former charismatic leader of the pds who is now heading the left party campaign , said in an interview .
" we need wage increases .
we have to see social costs as something positive , and taxes have to be fair . " that means , the well-off should pay more of them , according to the economic platform that the party has released .
it says its suggestions will restore balance and justice to a german economy which has been thrown out of kilter by seven years of neo-liberal policies and which is structured to benefit only the rich . " those who earn the most , they are given tax relief , and that ’ s not right , " said bernd ihme , a policy spokesman for the left party .
" we want to make clear that it 's possible through redistribution to change how money is spent and whom it benefits . " bigger government the list of changes the party wants to make to germany 's tax and welfare system is long .
first on the agenda is the scrapping of the unpopular hartz iv labor and welfare reforms , which were instrumental in triggering the formation of the party in the first place . bildunterschrift : not happy with hartz iv the reforms , which were put in place by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government , were meant to tackle unemployment , spur job creation and ease the strain on germany 's severely burdened state coffers .
but to the left party , which balked at the cuts in welfare payments for the long-term jobless , the reforms are nothing more than " legally decreed poverty . " the party 's economic ideas include raising corporate taxes , which schröder had lowered , shortening the work week , establishing a minimum wage of 1,400 euros -lrb- $ 1,708 -rrb- a month , bringing back a tax on stock market transactions , raising inheritance and gift taxes and reintroducing a wealth tax . the party would increase welfare payments and government subsidies , financing it all with what it says are the 65 billion euros it would take in through the new taxes . roll back reforms all in all , it would overturn most of the reforms that schröder 's social democratic-green coalition put into place over the past seven years .
it is also the stuff that gives economists and business leaders nightmares , since they say it has no place in the world of 21st century economics . " we live in a globalized world , " said winfried fuest , an analyst at the cologne institute for business research .
" with those kinds of suggestions put into place , we would no longer be competitive .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.08.2005 german doctors go on strike großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " overtime is unhealthy " german doctors have begun nationwide protests against long working hours and pay cuts .
on monday , 1,400 doctors took to the streets in two states to kick off the weeklong action . the pain threshold for young doctors in german hospitals has been reached .
on monday in the states of baden-württemberg and hesse , over 1,400 physicians hung up their stethoscopes on the office door and hit the streets to protest poor working conditions .
the banners the doctors carried sent a clear signal to hospitals , particularly state-run facilities , around the country : " better pay for better work " and " england pays twice as much . "
on the first day of weeklong protests that will culminate on friday in berlin with a " national day of protest , " leaders from the marburger bund doctors ' union are looking to raise the awareness of the plight of german doctors compared to their peers abroad .
overtime without compensation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : physicians of frankfurt 's university hospital protest against their working conditions .
the banner reads " money away , doctor away . "
in a country where many laborers receive extra compensation for working overtime , at night or under dangerous conditions , the doctors seem to have a point .
the marburger bund said that some 146,000 hospital doctors perform 50 million hours of overtime each year , most of them without extra compensation , and that germany trailed far behind comparable nations in physicians ' salaries .
the chairman of the union , frank ulrich montgomery , said the budget cuts at university clinics were equal to " state-supported robbery of wages . "
the doctors say they have been forced to bear the brunt of budget cutbacks at public health institutions , seeing their christmas and vacation bonuses slashed while working hours increase .
" as long as french , british and american colleagues earn two or three times as much , nothing will stop the flight of doctors abroad and the shortage of physicians , " said montgomery . particularly disturbing to the union was the grave discrepancy between young assistant doctors and head physicians .

on monday , 1,400 doctors took to the streets in two states to kick off the weeklong action . the pain threshold for young doctors in german hospitals has been reached .
on monday in the states of baden-württemberg and hesse , over 1,400 physicians hung up their stethoscopes on the office door and hit the streets to protest poor working conditions .
the banners the doctors carried sent a clear signal to hospitals , particularly state-run facilities , around the country : " better pay for better work " and " england pays twice as much . "
on the first day of weeklong protests that will culminate on friday in berlin with a " national day of protest , " leaders from the marburger bund doctors ' union are looking to raise the awareness of the plight of german doctors compared to their peers abroad .
overtime without compensation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : physicians of frankfurt 's university hospital protest against their working conditions .
the banner reads " money away , doctor away . "
in a country where many laborers receive extra compensation for working overtime , at night or under dangerous conditions , the doctors seem to have a point .
the marburger bund said that some 146,000 hospital doctors perform 50 million hours of overtime each year , most of them without extra compensation , and that germany trailed far behind comparable nations in physicians ' salaries .
the chairman of the union , frank ulrich montgomery , said the budget cuts at university clinics were equal to " state-supported robbery of wages . "
the doctors say they have been forced to bear the brunt of budget cutbacks at public health institutions , seeing their christmas and vacation bonuses slashed while working hours increase .
" as long as french , british and american colleagues earn two or three times as much , nothing will stop the flight of doctors abroad and the shortage of physicians , " said montgomery . particularly disturbing to the union was the grave discrepancy between young assistant doctors and head physicians .
27-year-olds fresh out of college begin with a take-home pay of around 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,000 -rrb- per month .
their superiors , frequently with managerial duties , earn up to 12 times that amount .

on the first day of weeklong protests that will culminate on friday in berlin with a " national day of protest , " leaders from the marburger bund doctors ' union are looking to raise the awareness of the plight of german doctors compared to their peers abroad .
overtime without compensation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : physicians of frankfurt 's university hospital protest against their working conditions .
the banner reads " money away , doctor away . "
in a country where many laborers receive extra compensation for working overtime , at night or under dangerous conditions , the doctors seem to have a point .
the marburger bund said that some 146,000 hospital doctors perform 50 million hours of overtime each year , most of them without extra compensation , and that germany trailed far behind comparable nations in physicians ' salaries .
the chairman of the union , frank ulrich montgomery , said the budget cuts at university clinics were equal to " state-supported robbery of wages . "
the doctors say they have been forced to bear the brunt of budget cutbacks at public health institutions , seeing their christmas and vacation bonuses slashed while working hours increase .
" as long as french , british and american colleagues earn two or three times as much , nothing will stop the flight of doctors abroad and the shortage of physicians , " said montgomery . particularly disturbing to the union was the grave discrepancy between young assistant doctors and head physicians .
27-year-olds fresh out of college begin with a take-home pay of around 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,000 -rrb- per month .
their superiors , frequently with managerial duties , earn up to 12 times that amount .
the system is at fault bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overtime is frequently left unpaid in german hospitals while the younger physicians have taken to the streets demanding fairer work schedules and more pay , others say it is the system that doctors created for themselves that is at fault .
" the union leaders ca n't come up with a better idea than to demand more pay , " criticized kurt lauterbach .
the health care economist points out that the two-tier health care system , where little money can be earned with public health plan patients and a lot with private patients , leads to young doctors receiving poor wages .
" this system is unjust and must be revamped , " lauterbach declared .
this must also be done in the interest of german patients .
young doctors are taking their abilities to other countries where they know the rewards are greater .
according to the latest figures from the doctors ' union , around 6,000 positions remain unfilled at german hospitals .
the same number are registered abroad .
one area where all parties concerned agree , is the amount of time that german physicians spend mired in medical bureaucratic procedures .

while conservative challenger angela merkel is too busy to appear in two tv debates , media-savvy chancellor schröder is even eager to go for a duel with himself .
the debate about the debate is heating up . chancellor schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- failed to reach an agreement saturday on the number of televised debates that the chancellor candidates would participate in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : broadcaster would like to see two tv debates citing a short campaign and a very busy schedule , cdu candidate angela merkel and a favorite to become germany 's next and first female chancellor has so far agreed on only one tv debate with her political rival .
schröder 's camp , on the other hand , is still pushing for two . the final decision regarding the format and number of debates will have to be made this week to give the broadcasters enough time to organize and schedule the events . a new meeting with german public and private broadcasters will take place on wednesday . schröder an experienced hand schröder 's spokesperson , bela anda , said monday it would be " strange " if angela merkel did not meet the expectations of the population .

" you can take it for granted that a future government led by a christian democrat chancellor , would aspire to keep these good relations intact or improve them wherever needed , " she said . but merkel has been very critical of the way the german government under gerhard schröder has approached transatlantic relations . " i do n't understand why previously excellent relations with the united states had to worsen to the extent known to all of us just because of our good ties with other nations , " merkel said . friendship , but no servitude bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder won the 2002 re-election greatly thanks to his opposition to the us invasion of iraq chancellor schröder , on his part , made it clear that for him friendship did not equal total obedience . " it 's been our firm conviction that friendship with another nation does not rule out being of a different opinion once in a while and does not rule out pursuing another foreign policy , if need be , " schröder said .
" it 's never been our idea to say yes to everything that comes our way , and we 're not planning to change this in future either . " merkel keeps stressing that loyalty in the transatlantic alliance is a great virtue .

in order to gain more direct influence on important foreign policy issues , she 's planning to have a security advisor at her side in the chancellery .
cdu foreign policy spokesman friedbert pflüger is being viewed as the most likely candidate for this post . there had also been talk about angela merkel wanting to install a separate ministry for european affairs , but the latest reports say these plans are now off the table . either way , merkel 's plans are going to hurt the opposition liberal democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- as the cdu 's likely junior partner would claim the post of foreign minister .
it stands to reason that both a ministry for european affairs and a security advisor in the chancellery would leave the foreign ministry with considerably less power and influence . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel 's envoy lauds meeting with bush the cdu 's wolfgang schäuble went to the us to lay out the basis of his party 's foreign policy in the case of a conservative election victory and got a welcome surprise - 45 minutes with the man himself , president bush .

" she says she ca n't remember how they were killed because she drank heavily when the contractions began , " prosecutor annette bargenda said at a news conference .
the mother is suspected of giving birth to each of the infants and then killing them one by one between 1988 and 2004 . the woman told police that in every instance , she had given birth to the children without any assistance or other people being there .
the father of the children , who divorced the woman earlier this year , did n't know that she was pregnant , the woman claims .
the couple also have three children aged 18 , 19 and 20 . the ex-husband , who was not named , is a professional who spent long periods away from home on business .
he is said to be horrified by the news . babies already buried when woman sobered up in at least seven cases , the woman " knows she put a covering over each child .
she said she woke or sobered up only after the children were already buried , " bargenda said .
some of the remains were first stored on her balcony before being moved to the garden and shed , she added . a police spokesman said earlier tuesday that the woman had admitted killing some of the children , but the spokesman later said that was incorrect . german prosecutors said monday the bodies of the nine newborn babies were discovered in a shed the woman used for storage .

spd presents election manifesto election 2005 -pipe- 02.08.2005 social justice or economic folly ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the redistribution of wealth is central to the left party 's plank the new hard-left grouping in germany , the left party , is sending tremors across the political landscape .
but , the party 's economic program has industry groups and economists shaking their heads , and worrying . it calls itself the left party , die linkspartei in german , and it 's making an already unusual election campaign even stranger .
made up of the successors to east germany 's communist party , the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , and disaffected left-wingers who split off from the social democrats , the election alternative for jobs and social justice , the left party has attracted surprising support with its message of wealth redistribution , bigger government and offers of more for everyone , except the capitalists . one and a half months before possible early elections in september , the new party is polling 12 percent nationwide .
in eastern germany , it has the support of a stunning 33 percent of the population , according to a poll conducted last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gregor gysi " we need a new culture , " gregor gysi , the former charismatic leader of the pds who is now heading the left party campaign , said in an interview .
" we need wage increases .
we have to see social costs as something positive , and taxes have to be fair . " that means , the well-off should pay more of them , according to the economic platform that the party has released .
it says its suggestions will restore balance and justice to a german economy which has been thrown out of kilter by seven years of neo-liberal policies and which is structured to benefit only the rich . " those who earn the most , they are given tax relief , and that ’ s not right , " said bernd ihme , a policy spokesman for the left party .
" we want to make clear that it 's possible through redistribution to change how money is spent and whom it benefits . " bigger government the list of changes the party wants to make to germany 's tax and welfare system is long .
first on the agenda is the scrapping of the unpopular hartz iv labor and welfare reforms , which were instrumental in triggering the formation of the party in the first place . bildunterschrift : not happy with hartz iv the reforms , which were put in place by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government , were meant to tackle unemployment , spur job creation and ease the strain on germany 's severely burdened state coffers .
but to the left party , which balked at the cuts in welfare payments for the long-term jobless , the reforms are nothing more than " legally decreed poverty . " the party 's economic ideas include raising corporate taxes , which schröder had lowered , shortening the work week , establishing a minimum wage of 1,400 euros -lrb- $ 1,708 -rrb- a month , bringing back a tax on stock market transactions , raising inheritance and gift taxes and reintroducing a wealth tax . the party would increase welfare payments and government subsidies , financing it all with what it says are the 65 billion euros it would take in through the new taxes . roll back reforms all in all , it would overturn most of the reforms that schröder 's social democratic-green coalition put into place over the past seven years .
it is also the stuff that gives economists and business leaders nightmares , since they say it has no place in the world of 21st century economics . " we live in a globalized world , " said winfried fuest , an analyst at the cologne institute for business research .
" with those kinds of suggestions put into place , we would no longer be competitive .
it ’ s a backwards-looking policy that economically is completely mistaken . " bildunterschrift : " we 're hiring for .. " says the sign , but there 's nothing underneath to complete the sentence . they say increasing the tax burden on corporations would weaken domestic and foreign investment in germany and make an already expensive labor force even pricier .
that could increase the number of firms who move production abroad because of lower wage costs and dissuade new or foreign firms from setting up shop in germany .
that , in turn , would increase unemployment and drive up the costs of germany ’ s already expensive welfare system . " we need growth , that is what will bring us jobs , " said rene hagemann-miksits , spokesperson for the bdi industry association .
" and it 's very clear that the -lrb- left party -rrb- program will do nothing to provide that . " his group has released a statement detailing the left party 's plans , concluding by saying " such a program would be fatal if it ever were realized as economic policy . " same old neo-liberal story ? but for the left party 's ihme , such talk is merely political posturing by groups interested more in defending their own interests than looking after the common welfare of the population . " those are standard arguments that we 've heard for years , " he said .
" if you lower non-wage costs , then jobs will be created .
well , we 've had two legislative periods to try that , and it has n't happened . "
now is the time to do something new , he added . he admits that the program , no matter how well the party does in the sept .
18 vote , will likely not be put into practice 100 percent .
but that it could help influence the debate and help shift economic policy from its current less-regulated course . according to financial analyst fuest , it 's already done that .
according to him , the success of the party in opinion polls has already made the bigger parties nervous and they are already backing away from some of the previous pro-reform stances they had .
the spd added a wealth tax to its party platform , bowing to the strong political wind .
even the conservative cdu , which is largely expected to come out on top in september , has toned down talk of bitter , but necessary medicine for germany . " the cdu has become very cautious when it comes to announcing further painful reforms , " he said .
" they ’ re just not saying much these days .

" germany weighs in german chancellor gerhard schröder told iran that the west would not be divided in its opposition to tehran building an atomic bomb .
schröder said the iranian government could not pit european countries against each other over the issue and urged iran not to make any " unilateral arrangements " during its ongoing negotiations with germany and its eu partners britain and france . he said in berlin that the european union was ready to offer major economic incentives if tehran made significant efforts at resolving what he called a " difficult and highly sensitive " situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea logo for their parts , the french and us governments said , after the iaea meeting , the issue could be taken to the un security council where sanctions could be imposed on tehran as punishment . " we therefore call upon iran not to resume suspended activities or take other unilateral steps and to confirm without delay it full commitment to the paris agreement , " the european ministers said in their letter . french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy told reporters after a cabinet meeting chaired by president jacques chirac that the iranian decision might spark " a major international crisis . " november agreement under the paris agreement struck in november last year , iran agreed to suspend its nuclear activities in exchange for trade and nuclear co-operation incentives from the european union . but tehran on monday told the iaea it planned imminently to resume uranium ore conversion , the first step in the cycle to producing fuel for nuclear reactors . " the decision to resume suspended activities at isfahan would , if carried out , breach both the paris agreement and the iaea board of governors ' resolution of 29 november 2004 , " the eu letter said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali agha mohammadi " it would also further heighten international concern about the real objective of iran 's nuclear program . "
iran 's main nuclear negotiator , ali agha mohammadi -lrb- photo -rrb- , said in tehran that " for us , the question is closed . " he stressed however that " the resumption is in no way a hostile act towards the europeans and we regard the europeans as our partners .
we do not want a confrontation with the europeans .
the path to negotiations remains open . " bomb plans ? the united states fears iran intends to use its nuclear program to build the atomic bomb despite tehran 's insistence that it is pursuing only energy options . us president george w. bush has mildly endorsed the eu initiative to find a peaceful resolution , but also previously stated that " all options are on the table " to ensure iran does not build a nuclear arsenal . his spokesman , scott mcclellan , said of iranian authorities : " if they 're not going to abide by their agreement and obligations , then we would have to look to the security council . " french prime minister dominique de villepin also said iran must comply with the paris agreement or face un security council retribution . " iran must honour the commitments it has made .
these commitments are commitments suspending all activity , conversion , treatment and enrichment of uranium , " he told europe 1 radio . if tehran refuses , " the international community will be forced to draw conclusions .
and the security council will be called on if iran refuses to comply .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.08.2005 -pipe- 14:00 utc schröder warns iran over nuclear program german chancellor german schröder warned iran on tuesday against resuming sensitive nuclear activities , saying the west would not be divided in its opposition to tehran building an atomic bomb . schröder said the iranian government could not pit european countries against each other over the issue and urged iran not to make any " unilateral arrangements " during its ongoing negotiations with germany and its eu partners britain and france .
the chancellor , who was accepting a peace prize from a german charity foundation , said the european union was ready to offer major economic incentives if tehran made significant efforts at resolving what he called a " difficult and highly sensitive " situation .
but he warned that iran would be making a mistake if it doubted the west 's firm resolve to prevent tehran from acquiring a nuclear weapon .
iran told the un nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency , on monday that it intended to resume uranium ore conversion , the precursor to enrichment in the nuclear fuel cycle .
the move would violate a deal with the so-called eu-3 - france , britain and germany - under which tehran agreed to suspend its nuclear activities in return for trade and security benefits .
the united states , which also fears iran wants to use its nuclear program to build atomic weapons , has backed the eu 's diplomatic efforts . dw-world.de opinion : much ado about nothing in iran iranian technicians are expected to remove the un seals to a nuclear power plant .
the eu is unhappy but dw 's mideast expert peter philipp does n't think that the move should change negotiation strategies .

the marburger bund said that some 146,000 hospital doctors perform 50 million hours of overtime each year , most of them without extra compensation , and that germany trailed far behind comparable nations in physicians ' salaries .

the health care economist points out that the two-tier health care system , where little money can be earned with public health plan patients and a lot with private patients , leads to young doctors receiving poor wages .

the marburger bund said that some 146,000 hospital doctors perform 50 million hours of overtime each year , most of them without extra compensation , and that germany trailed far behind comparable nations in physicians ' salaries .
the chairman of the union , frank ulrich montgomery , said the budget cuts at university clinics were equal to " state-supported robbery of wages . "
the doctors say they have been forced to bear the brunt of budget cutbacks at public health institutions , seeing their christmas and vacation bonuses slashed while working hours increase .

" the union leaders ca n't come up with a better idea than to demand more pay , " criticized kurt lauterbach .
the health care economist points out that the two-tier health care system , where little money can be earned with public health plan patients and a lot with private patients , leads to young doctors receiving poor wages .

while conservative challenger angela merkel is too busy to appear in two tv debates , media-savvy chancellor schröder is even eager to go for a duel with himself .
the debate about the debate is heating up . chancellor schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- failed to reach an agreement saturday on the number of televised debates that the chancellor candidates would participate in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : broadcaster would like to see two tv debates citing a short campaign and a very busy schedule , cdu candidate angela merkel and a favorite to become germany 's next and first female chancellor has so far agreed on only one tv debate with her political rival .
schröder 's camp , on the other hand , is still pushing for two . the final decision regarding the format and number of debates will have to be made this week to give the broadcasters enough time to organize and schedule the events . a new meeting with german public and private broadcasters will take place on wednesday . schröder an experienced hand schröder 's spokesperson , bela anda , said monday it would be " strange " if angela merkel did not meet the expectations of the population . " i wonder if they 're trying to hide something , " said anda . according to the government spokesperson , two tv duels have become a national and regional standard .
they have been requested by both public and private broadcasters , as well as the general public . however , television face-offs between the main chancellor candidates are relatively new in germany as opposed to the us .

the televised discussions saw schröder using his slick debating skills to boost his poll ratings and stage a comeback by outshining stoiber .
14,9 million viewers watched the first debate , and 15,2 tuned in to the second debate , including seven million viewers who had not seen the first one . some merkel allies fear that schröder could use the same tactic to narrow the poll lead of their candidate , an unassuming former scientist who often looks awkward on television .
schröder is also said to want to introduce more bite by scrapping some of the restrictions on speaking time . one or none willi hausmann , the cdu negotiator , said that it was up to schröder to decide whether there would be " one tv duel , or none at all . " " two duels are not negotiable for us , " he said . merkel 's spokesperson , eva christiansen , stressed that the tv debate was only one in a series of campaign events . " the duel with the chancellor is one format , but the election campaign has many other forms , " she said . a compromise ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maybe she does n't like the make-up : angela merkel preparing for a tv appearance the two tv debates in 2002 lasted 60 minutes each , but the government spokesman did not rule out the possibility that schröder would agree on one , significantly longer , discussion with merkel . he also said , however , that in the case no compromise was reached , schröder would be willing to discuss his reform plans alone , without merkel as an interlocutor . schröder , who appeared sunday night as a guest at the popular political talk-show " sabine christiansen , " promised a " well-mannered , fair and , by all means , hard though respectful interaction " with his opponent during the campaign .

" she says she ca n't remember how they were killed because she drank heavily when the contractions began , " prosecutor annette bargenda said at a news conference .
the mother is suspected of giving birth to each of the infants and then killing them one by one between 1988 and 2004 . the woman told police that in every instance , she had given birth to the children without any assistance or other people being there .
the father of the children , who divorced the woman earlier this year , did n't know that she was pregnant , the woman claims .
the couple also have three children aged 18 , 19 and 20 . the ex-husband , who was not named , is a professional who spent long periods away from home on business .
he is said to be horrified by the news . babies already buried when woman sobered up in at least seven cases , the woman " knows she put a covering over each child .

" we are assuming there are at least nine corpses , " said michael neff of the frankfurt / oder state prosecutor 's office .
he did not comment on a possible motive . local politicians reacted with shock to the discovery and asked how it was possible that the disappearance of the babies over a period of some 16 years had not come to light earlier . crime leaves officials stunned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jörg schönbohm " we are faced with a crime whose scope , in my memory , we have never seen in the history of the federal republic " since 1945 , said brandenburg state interior minister jörg schönbohm .
" we must ask ourselves how this unbelievable crime remained hidden all these years . " it 's a question directed at relatives , neighbors , doctors and the authorities , " he added . the state prosecutor 's office in the city said the find in the town of brieskow-finkenheerd , 10 kilometers -lrb- six miles -rrb- south of frankfurt in a depressed region of former east germany , was made on sunday . remains found in plant pots , buckets , aquarium " when someone went to clean up the lot , he found human bones in an aquarium , " state prosecutor ulrich scherding told news channel n24 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outside view of the house in brieskow-finkenheerd where police discovered the remains of the nine newborn babies authorities added that other bodies were hidden in flower boxes and pots in the shed and in buckets buried under sand and earth .
they were to be taken for autopsy .
each of the infants appeared to have been killed immediately after birth . some 40 police officers with eight sniffer dogs were combing the area for other corpses . the mayor of brieskow-finkenheerd , ralf theuer , said he had not known the suspect but heard from neighbors that she tended to keep to herself . unprecedented infanticide in germany the vice-president of the association of german psychologists , uwe wetter , said that such cases , while extremely rare , often stem from social isolation combined with extreme symptoms of post-partum depression . in october 2003 , a 38-year-old woman from czerniejow , poland admitted to drowning five of her children after their births .

" she says she ca n't remember how they were killed because she drank heavily when the contractions began , " prosecutor annette bargenda said at a news conference .
the mother is suspected of giving birth to each of the infants and then killing them one by one between 1988 and 2004 . the woman told police that in every instance , she had given birth to the children without any assistance or other people being there .
the father of the children , who divorced the woman earlier this year , did n't know that she was pregnant , the woman claims .
the couple also have three children aged 18 , 19 and 20 . the ex-husband , who was not named , is a professional who spent long periods away from home on business .
he is said to be horrified by the news . babies already buried when woman sobered up in at least seven cases , the woman " knows she put a covering over each child .
she said she woke or sobered up only after the children were already buried , " bargenda said .
some of the remains were first stored on her balcony before being moved to the garden and shed , she added . a police spokesman said earlier tuesday that the woman had admitted killing some of the children , but the spokesman later said that was incorrect . german prosecutors said monday the bodies of the nine newborn babies were discovered in a shed the woman used for storage . " we are assuming there are at least nine corpses , " said michael neff of the frankfurt / oder state prosecutor 's office .
he did not comment on a possible motive . local politicians reacted with shock to the discovery and asked how it was possible that the disappearance of the babies over a period of some 16 years had not come to light earlier . crime leaves officials stunned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jörg schönbohm " we are faced with a crime whose scope , in my memory , we have never seen in the history of the federal republic " since 1945 , said brandenburg state interior minister jörg schönbohm .
" we must ask ourselves how this unbelievable crime remained hidden all these years . " it 's a question directed at relatives , neighbors , doctors and the authorities , " he added . the state prosecutor 's office in the city said the find in the town of brieskow-finkenheerd , 10 kilometers -lrb- six miles -rrb- south of frankfurt in a depressed region of former east germany , was made on sunday . remains found in plant pots , buckets , aquarium " when someone went to clean up the lot , he found human bones in an aquarium , " state prosecutor ulrich scherding told news channel n24 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outside view of the house in brieskow-finkenheerd where police discovered the remains of the nine newborn babies authorities added that other bodies were hidden in flower boxes and pots in the shed and in buckets buried under sand and earth .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 02.08.2005 -pipe- 12:00 utc cordes sells shares in daimlerchrysler eckard cordes , head of daimlerchrysler 's mercedes car division , sold a big packet of shares in the german-us parent company last week , it emerged on tuesday , in another sign that he is likely to quit . cordes exercised an option to buy 92,500 daimlerchrysler shares last friday and then immediately sold the shares at a price of 479,150 euros -lrb- $ 584,563 -rrb- , a mandatory filing by the german-us auto giant revealed .
the day before , the shock announcement that daimlerchrysler chief executive juergen schrempp planned to quit by the end of this year had pushed the group 's share price up by more than 10 percent on the frankfurt stock exchange .
cordes ' future is still not decided . the manager , a close ally of schrempp , had been tipped to take the driving seat at daimlerchrysler in 2008 .

the southern german state of bavaria went into a state of uproar as rumors begin to circulate that european bureaucrats would ban low-neckline dresses in beer gardens to protect the waitresses from the sun . the bavarians can finally breathe a collective sigh of relief because now they know that nobody is going to mess with their beloved dirndl - the traditional bavarian dress that accentuates the upper part of the female body with a revealing neckline .
only yesterday , however , the dirndl as we know it , seemed to be on the brink of extinction , and proud bavarians ready to declare a cultural war on brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : proud to wear a dirndl : german starlet verona pooth née feldbusch during oktoberfest in munich after the european parliament passed a directive to protect employees from optical radiation , including sunlight , the bavarians started worrying that petty bureaucrats from brussels would start meddling into their private affairs , crippling the time-honored bavarian sense for fun and seriously limiting the freedom of expression of those friendly and well-muscled beer garden waitresses . state of shock a newspaper from munich described the eu initiative as the outright " cleavage ban . "
the mayor of munich , christian ude , warned of " european legal perfectionism " and threatened never to enter a beer garden again if he were not to be greeted by plunging necklines .

managers from the old school are making way for a new type of leader .
in many companies , the days when ceos had carte blanche do to whatever they wanted are coming to an end . last week , daimlerchrysler 's jürgen schrempp , ceo since 1995 , announced he was stepping down .
the news brought about a 10 percent rise in the company 's stock price - a clear sign that the stock market was n't unhappy about his leaving . with schrempp 's departure , daimlerchrysler is losing a head who frittered away billions of the company 's cash .
the first instance was in 1992 , when daimler-benz aerospace -lrb- dasa -rrb- bought the tattered dutch aircraft builder fokker to the tune of two billion euros -lrb- $ 2.4 billion -rrb- .
a costly merger with struggling chrysler came soon after , followed by the expensive adventure with mitsubishi . after all that , many were astounded when last spring schrempp 's contract was renewed for another four years .
but now he has to vacate his top-floor office before the end of the year , without receiving a golden handshake or continuing to draw a salary . the change at the top at daimlerchrysler shows that something fundamental is changing in germany .

he cut the shareholding ties with other german firms .
at schrempp 's departure , the bank took advantage of the sharp increase in the carmaker 's stock price and sold shares for 1.4 billion euros . the shoes of the traditional germany inc. owners are now being filled by a fleet of international financial investors such as insurance companies , pension funds and investment managers whose primary concern is profit .

the new law helped create more transparency and ensures that stockholders can finally ascertain whether or not a board is being compensated according to its performance . all in all , times are tougher these days for german managers .

the news brought about a 10 percent rise in the company 's stock price - a clear sign that the stock market was n't unhappy about his leaving . with schrempp 's departure , daimlerchrysler is losing a head who frittered away billions of the company 's cash .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 02.08.2005 opinion : generational change in the board room großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : out with the old , in with the new - zetsche -lrb- l -rrb- replaces schrempp -lrb- r -rrb- something 's going on in german board rooms .
managers from the old school are making way for a new type of leader .
in many companies , the days when ceos had carte blanche do to whatever they wanted are coming to an end . last week , daimlerchrysler 's jürgen schrempp , ceo since 1995 , announced he was stepping down .
the news brought about a 10 percent rise in the company 's stock price - a clear sign that the stock market was n't unhappy about his leaving . with schrempp 's departure , daimlerchrysler is losing a head who frittered away billions of the company 's cash .
the first instance was in 1992 , when daimler-benz aerospace -lrb- dasa -rrb- bought the tattered dutch aircraft builder fokker to the tune of two billion euros -lrb- $ 2.4 billion -rrb- .
a costly merger with struggling chrysler came soon after , followed by the expensive adventure with mitsubishi . after all that , many were astounded when last spring schrempp 's contract was renewed for another four years .
but now he has to vacate his top-floor office before the end of the year , without receiving a golden handshake or continuing to draw a salary . the change at the top at daimlerchrysler shows that something fundamental is changing in germany .
the foundations of the country 's traditional management culture have begun to crack .
management mistakes now come with consequences . new owners , new ways that 's due in large part to the new owners of german companies .
in the past , the german corporate landscape was characterized by extensive cross holdings .
there was even a term for it - germany , inc .
the most notorious was the munich-based financial triangle between munich re , allianz and the hypovereinsbank .
but after hypovereinsbank was bought by italy 's unicredito , that three-way was broken up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another example was the stake that deutsche bank had in daimlerchrysler .
the frankfurt bank traditionally filled the position of supervisory board chief at the stuttgart-based automaker .
but this interconnection between two corporate giants came to an end when josef ackermann , a swiss , took the reins at deutsche bank .
he cut the shareholding ties with other german firms .
at schrempp 's departure , the bank took advantage of the sharp increase in the carmaker 's stock price and sold shares for 1.4 billion euros . the shoes of the traditional germany inc. owners are now being filled by a fleet of international financial investors such as insurance companies , pension funds and investment managers whose primary concern is profit .
showy ceos like ulrich schumacher , the head of chip manufacturer infineon , who showed up for his company 's ipo in a race car , are unwelcome in the sober world of investing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when managers do manage to squander away billions of euros , today 's owners are much quicker to pull in the leash than the old germany inc. boards were .
the bosses these days ca n't rely as much as they once did on their good old boys networks .
this was apparent in the case of werner seifert -lrb- photo -rrb- , who was forced to step down as head of the germany stock exchange , deutsche börse , largely because his planned takeover of the london exchange displeased tci , a hedge fund and large shareholder . lawmakers get tougher but it 's not just the new owners who have increased the pressure , lawmakers are also taking a new look at boardroom activities .
this year , the government forced companies for the first time to make board members ' salaries public .
the new law helped create more transparency and ensures that stockholders can finally ascertain whether or not a board is being compensated according to its performance . all in all , times are tougher these days for german managers .
there is more public accountability and more pressure from stockholders .
that is a good thing , since when managers waste billions on ill-advised ventures , no one - neither owners nor employees - benefits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new daimlerchrysler head , dieter zetsche , has learned this lesson .
he has presented himself as a man of the people and has n't shied away form getting in line with the floor workers in the company cafeteria .
it 's a small thing , but one which shows he is taking a new approach . higher-ups who are n't afraid to rub shoulders with blue-collar workers generally do n't lose their grounding .
if the companies of germany inc. get more of his type in the head offices , germans should be pleased . johannes beck -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new face of daimlerchrysler stock markets reacted positively thursday to the news that jürgen schrempp is standing down after a decade in the top spot , and there are high hopes for his successor , dieter zetsche as well .
-lrb- july 29 , 2005 -rrb- unicredito swallows hvb supervisory boards of hypovereinsbank and unicredito agreed to a takeover sunday .
unicredito plans to offer more than 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 18 billion -rrb- in a stock swap in the biggest cross-border banking merger in europe .
-lrb- june 12 , 2005 -rrb- schrempp : exit planned long ago daimlerchrysler ceo jürgen schrempp has responded to speculation about his unexpected resignation on thursday , saying he himself decided to leave the top post at the world 's fifth biggest carmaker .
-lrb- july 30 , 2005 -rrb- feedback do you agree that increased public accountability and transparency among top management levels in german companies is a good thing ?

the chancellor , who was accepting a peace prize from a german charity foundation , said the european union was ready to offer major economic incentives if tehran made significant efforts at resolving what he called a " difficult and highly sensitive " situation .
but he warned that iran would be making a mistake if it doubted the west 's firm resolve to prevent tehran from acquiring a nuclear weapon .
iran told the un nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency , on monday that it intended to resume uranium ore conversion , the precursor to enrichment in the nuclear fuel cycle .
the move would violate a deal with the so-called eu-3 - france , britain and germany - under which tehran agreed to suspend its nuclear activities in return for trade and security benefits .
the united states , which also fears iran wants to use its nuclear program to build atomic weapons , has backed the eu 's diplomatic efforts . dw-world.de opinion : much ado about nothing in iran iranian technicians are expected to remove the un seals to a nuclear power plant .
the eu is unhappy but dw 's mideast expert peter philipp does n't think that the move should change negotiation strategies .

the chancellor , who was accepting a peace prize from a german charity foundation , said the european union was ready to offer major economic incentives if tehran made significant efforts at resolving what he called a " difficult and highly sensitive " situation .
but he warned that iran would be making a mistake if it doubted the west 's firm resolve to prevent tehran from acquiring a nuclear weapon .
iran told the un nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency , on monday that it intended to resume uranium ore conversion , the precursor to enrichment in the nuclear fuel cycle .
the move would violate a deal with the so-called eu-3 - france , britain and germany - under which tehran agreed to suspend its nuclear activities in return for trade and security benefits .
the united states , which also fears iran wants to use its nuclear program to build atomic weapons , has backed the eu 's diplomatic efforts . dw-world.de opinion : much ado about nothing in iran iranian technicians are expected to remove the un seals to a nuclear power plant .
the eu is unhappy but dw 's mideast expert peter philipp does n't think that the move should change negotiation strategies .

" germany weighs in german chancellor gerhard schröder told iran that the west would not be divided in its opposition to tehran building an atomic bomb .
schröder said the iranian government could not pit european countries against each other over the issue and urged iran not to make any " unilateral arrangements " during its ongoing negotiations with germany and its eu partners britain and france . he said in berlin that the european union was ready to offer major economic incentives if tehran made significant efforts at resolving what he called a " difficult and highly sensitive " situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea logo for their parts , the french and us governments said , after the iaea meeting , the issue could be taken to the un security council where sanctions could be imposed on tehran as punishment . " we therefore call upon iran not to resume suspended activities or take other unilateral steps and to confirm without delay it full commitment to the paris agreement , " the european ministers said in their letter . french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy told reporters after a cabinet meeting chaired by president jacques chirac that the iranian decision might spark " a major international crisis . " november agreement under the paris agreement struck in november last year , iran agreed to suspend its nuclear activities in exchange for trade and nuclear co-operation incentives from the european union . but tehran on monday told the iaea it planned imminently to resume uranium ore conversion , the first step in the cycle to producing fuel for nuclear reactors . " the decision to resume suspended activities at isfahan would , if carried out , breach both the paris agreement and the iaea board of governors ' resolution of 29 november 2004 , " the eu letter said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali agha mohammadi " it would also further heighten international concern about the real objective of iran 's nuclear program . "
iran 's main nuclear negotiator , ali agha mohammadi -lrb- photo -rrb- , said in tehran that " for us , the question is closed . " he stressed however that " the resumption is in no way a hostile act towards the europeans and we regard the europeans as our partners .
we do not want a confrontation with the europeans .
the path to negotiations remains open . " bomb plans ? the united states fears iran intends to use its nuclear program to build the atomic bomb despite tehran 's insistence that it is pursuing only energy options . us president george w. bush has mildly endorsed the eu initiative to find a peaceful resolution , but also previously stated that " all options are on the table " to ensure iran does not build a nuclear arsenal . his spokesman , scott mcclellan , said of iranian authorities : " if they 're not going to abide by their agreement and obligations , then we would have to look to the security council . " french prime minister dominique de villepin also said iran must comply with the paris agreement or face un security council retribution . " iran must honour the commitments it has made .
these commitments are commitments suspending all activity , conversion , treatment and enrichment of uranium , " he told europe 1 radio . if tehran refuses , " the international community will be forced to draw conclusions .
and the security council will be called on if iran refuses to comply .

" you can take it for granted that a future government led by a christian democrat chancellor , would aspire to keep these good relations intact or improve them wherever needed , " she said . but merkel has been very critical of the way the german government under gerhard schröder has approached transatlantic relations . " i do n't understand why previously excellent relations with the united states had to worsen to the extent known to all of us just because of our good ties with other nations , " merkel said . friendship , but no servitude bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder won the 2002 re-election greatly thanks to his opposition to the us invasion of iraq chancellor schröder , on his part , made it clear that for him friendship did not equal total obedience . " it 's been our firm conviction that friendship with another nation does not rule out being of a different opinion once in a while and does not rule out pursuing another foreign policy , if need be , " schröder said .
" it 's never been our idea to say yes to everything that comes our way , and we 're not planning to change this in future either . " merkel keeps stressing that loyalty in the transatlantic alliance is a great virtue .
and she does n't want to leave anything to chance , should she become germany 's next chancellor after september 's likely election . gaining control of foreign policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will friedbert pflüger become angela merekl 's security advisor ?
in order to gain more direct influence on important foreign policy issues , she 's planning to have a security advisor at her side in the chancellery .
cdu foreign policy spokesman friedbert pflüger is being viewed as the most likely candidate for this post . there had also been talk about angela merkel wanting to install a separate ministry for european affairs , but the latest reports say these plans are now off the table . either way , merkel 's plans are going to hurt the opposition liberal democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- as the cdu 's likely junior partner would claim the post of foreign minister .
it stands to reason that both a ministry for european affairs and a security advisor in the chancellery would leave the foreign ministry with considerably less power and influence . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel 's envoy lauds meeting with bush the cdu 's wolfgang schäuble went to the us to lay out the basis of his party 's foreign policy in the case of a conservative election victory and got a welcome surprise - 45 minutes with the man himself , president bush .

while conservative challenger angela merkel is too busy to appear in two tv debates , media-savvy chancellor schröder is even eager to go for a duel with himself .
the debate about the debate is heating up . chancellor schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- failed to reach an agreement saturday on the number of televised debates that the chancellor candidates would participate in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : broadcaster would like to see two tv debates citing a short campaign and a very busy schedule , cdu candidate angela merkel and a favorite to become germany 's next and first female chancellor has so far agreed on only one tv debate with her political rival .
schröder 's camp , on the other hand , is still pushing for two . the final decision regarding the format and number of debates will have to be made this week to give the broadcasters enough time to organize and schedule the events . a new meeting with german public and private broadcasters will take place on wednesday . schröder an experienced hand schröder 's spokesperson , bela anda , said monday it would be " strange " if angela merkel did not meet the expectations of the population . " i wonder if they 're trying to hide something , " said anda . according to the government spokesperson , two tv duels have become a national and regional standard .

the televised discussions saw schröder using his slick debating skills to boost his poll ratings and stage a comeback by outshining stoiber .
14,9 million viewers watched the first debate , and 15,2 tuned in to the second debate , including seven million viewers who had not seen the first one . some merkel allies fear that schröder could use the same tactic to narrow the poll lead of their candidate , an unassuming former scientist who often looks awkward on television .
schröder is also said to want to introduce more bite by scrapping some of the restrictions on speaking time . one or none willi hausmann , the cdu negotiator , said that it was up to schröder to decide whether there would be " one tv duel , or none at all . " " two duels are not negotiable for us , " he said . merkel 's spokesperson , eva christiansen , stressed that the tv debate was only one in a series of campaign events . " the duel with the chancellor is one format , but the election campaign has many other forms , " she said . a compromise ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maybe she does n't like the make-up : angela merkel preparing for a tv appearance the two tv debates in 2002 lasted 60 minutes each , but the government spokesman did not rule out the possibility that schröder would agree on one , significantly longer , discussion with merkel . he also said , however , that in the case no compromise was reached , schröder would be willing to discuss his reform plans alone , without merkel as an interlocutor . schröder , who appeared sunday night as a guest at the popular political talk-show " sabine christiansen , " promised a " well-mannered , fair and , by all means , hard though respectful interaction " with his opponent during the campaign .

while conservative challenger angela merkel is too busy to appear in two tv debates , media-savvy chancellor schröder is even eager to go for a duel with himself .
the debate about the debate is heating up . chancellor schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- failed to reach an agreement saturday on the number of televised debates that the chancellor candidates would participate in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : broadcaster would like to see two tv debates citing a short campaign and a very busy schedule , cdu candidate angela merkel and a favorite to become germany 's next and first female chancellor has so far agreed on only one tv debate with her political rival .
schröder 's camp , on the other hand , is still pushing for two . the final decision regarding the format and number of debates will have to be made this week to give the broadcasters enough time to organize and schedule the events . a new meeting with german public and private broadcasters will take place on wednesday . schröder an experienced hand schröder 's spokesperson , bela anda , said monday it would be " strange " if angela merkel did not meet the expectations of the population . " i wonder if they 're trying to hide something , " said anda . according to the government spokesperson , two tv duels have become a national and regional standard .
they have been requested by both public and private broadcasters , as well as the general public . however , television face-offs between the main chancellor candidates are relatively new in germany as opposed to the us .

" you can take it for granted that a future government led by a christian democrat chancellor , would aspire to keep these good relations intact or improve them wherever needed , " she said . but merkel has been very critical of the way the german government under gerhard schröder has approached transatlantic relations . " i do n't understand why previously excellent relations with the united states had to worsen to the extent known to all of us just because of our good ties with other nations , " merkel said . friendship , but no servitude bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder won the 2002 re-election greatly thanks to his opposition to the us invasion of iraq chancellor schröder , on his part , made it clear that for him friendship did not equal total obedience . " it 's been our firm conviction that friendship with another nation does not rule out being of a different opinion once in a while and does not rule out pursuing another foreign policy , if need be , " schröder said .
" it 's never been our idea to say yes to everything that comes our way , and we 're not planning to change this in future either . " merkel keeps stressing that loyalty in the transatlantic alliance is a great virtue .

in order to gain more direct influence on important foreign policy issues , she 's planning to have a security advisor at her side in the chancellery .
cdu foreign policy spokesman friedbert pflüger is being viewed as the most likely candidate for this post . there had also been talk about angela merkel wanting to install a separate ministry for european affairs , but the latest reports say these plans are now off the table . either way , merkel 's plans are going to hurt the opposition liberal democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- as the cdu 's likely junior partner would claim the post of foreign minister .
it stands to reason that both a ministry for european affairs and a security advisor in the chancellery would leave the foreign ministry with considerably less power and influence . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel 's envoy lauds meeting with bush the cdu 's wolfgang schäuble went to the us to lay out the basis of his party 's foreign policy in the case of a conservative election victory and got a welcome surprise - 45 minutes with the man himself , president bush .

oil and gas are scarce resources .

energy should increasingly come from solar , wind , hydro , biomass and geothermal generating plants .
the goal for 2020 is to produce a full quarter of the present energy supply , heating demand , fuel consumption , and goods of the petrochemical industry , respectively , from renewable energies and renewable primary products .
the coal subsidies should be reduced and completely eliminated by 2012 .
greenhouse gas emissions should be cut by 40 percent of their 1990 levels by 2020 ; the eu stipulates only a 30 percent reduction .
the greens clearly have the longest resume with legislation for environmental and consumer protection . fdp the free democratic party wants to slash subsidies , whether for hard coal power plants or for renewable energies .
the european electricity and gas markets should be more fully liberalized .
market regulation should only be oriented to increasing competitiveness , demands the fdp .

schröder 's camp , on the other hand , is still pushing for two . the final decision regarding the format and number of debates will have to be made this week to give the broadcasters enough time to organize and schedule the events . a new meeting with german public and private broadcasters will take place on wednesday . schröder an experienced hand schröder 's spokesperson , bela anda , said monday it would be " strange " if angela merkel did not meet the expectations of the population . " i wonder if they 're trying to hide something , " said anda . according to the government spokesperson , two tv duels have become a national and regional standard .
they have been requested by both public and private broadcasters , as well as the general public . however , television face-offs between the main chancellor candidates are relatively new in germany as opposed to the us .
germans were treated to their first taste of the event during campaigning for the last federal elections in 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is what the debate looked like in 2002 then , the media-savvy schröder appeared in two such events with his opponent at the time , edmund stoiber of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
the televised discussions saw schröder using his slick debating skills to boost his poll ratings and stage a comeback by outshining stoiber .
14,9 million viewers watched the first debate , and 15,2 tuned in to the second debate , including seven million viewers who had not seen the first one . some merkel allies fear that schröder could use the same tactic to narrow the poll lead of their candidate , an unassuming former scientist who often looks awkward on television .
schröder is also said to want to introduce more bite by scrapping some of the restrictions on speaking time . one or none willi hausmann , the cdu negotiator , said that it was up to schröder to decide whether there would be " one tv duel , or none at all . " " two duels are not negotiable for us , " he said . merkel 's spokesperson , eva christiansen , stressed that the tv debate was only one in a series of campaign events . " the duel with the chancellor is one format , but the election campaign has many other forms , " she said . a compromise ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maybe she does n't like the make-up : angela merkel preparing for a tv appearance the two tv debates in 2002 lasted 60 minutes each , but the government spokesman did not rule out the possibility that schröder would agree on one , significantly longer , discussion with merkel . he also said , however , that in the case no compromise was reached , schröder would be willing to discuss his reform plans alone , without merkel as an interlocutor . schröder , who appeared sunday night as a guest at the popular political talk-show " sabine christiansen , " promised a " well-mannered , fair and , by all means , hard though respectful interaction " with his opponent during the campaign . " should i make a faux pas , which i hope i not to , i wo n't be afraid to apologize , " schröder said . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans to tune in for first candidate debate millions of germans will tune into the country 's first-ever televised debate between chancellor candidates this sunday .
for both candidates there is much to win - and lose .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : political parties : on the campaign trail color of money and not of trees conservatives unveil election platform liberals becoming neo-liberal ?
spd presents election manifesto election 2005 -pipe- 02.08.2005 social justice or economic folly ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the redistribution of wealth is central to the left party 's plank the new hard-left grouping in germany , the left party , is sending tremors across the political landscape .
but , the party 's economic program has industry groups and economists shaking their heads , and worrying . it calls itself the left party , die linkspartei in german , and it 's making an already unusual election campaign even stranger .
made up of the successors to east germany 's communist party , the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , and disaffected left-wingers who split off from the social democrats , the election alternative for jobs and social justice , the left party has attracted surprising support with its message of wealth redistribution , bigger government and offers of more for everyone , except the capitalists . one and a half months before possible early elections in september , the new party is polling 12 percent nationwide .
in eastern germany , it has the support of a stunning 33 percent of the population , according to a poll conducted last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gregor gysi " we need a new culture , " gregor gysi , the former charismatic leader of the pds who is now heading the left party campaign , said in an interview .
" we need wage increases .
we have to see social costs as something positive , and taxes have to be fair . " that means , the well-off should pay more of them , according to the economic platform that the party has released .
it says its suggestions will restore balance and justice to a german economy which has been thrown out of kilter by seven years of neo-liberal policies and which is structured to benefit only the rich . " those who earn the most , they are given tax relief , and that ’ s not right , " said bernd ihme , a policy spokesman for the left party .
" we want to make clear that it 's possible through redistribution to change how money is spent and whom it benefits . " bigger government the list of changes the party wants to make to germany 's tax and welfare system is long .
first on the agenda is the scrapping of the unpopular hartz iv labor and welfare reforms , which were instrumental in triggering the formation of the party in the first place . bildunterschrift : not happy with hartz iv the reforms , which were put in place by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government , were meant to tackle unemployment , spur job creation and ease the strain on germany 's severely burdened state coffers .
but to the left party , which balked at the cuts in welfare payments for the long-term jobless , the reforms are nothing more than " legally decreed poverty . " the party 's economic ideas include raising corporate taxes , which schröder had lowered , shortening the work week , establishing a minimum wage of 1,400 euros -lrb- $ 1,708 -rrb- a month , bringing back a tax on stock market transactions , raising inheritance and gift taxes and reintroducing a wealth tax . the party would increase welfare payments and government subsidies , financing it all with what it says are the 65 billion euros it would take in through the new taxes . roll back reforms all in all , it would overturn most of the reforms that schröder 's social democratic-green coalition put into place over the past seven years .
it is also the stuff that gives economists and business leaders nightmares , since they say it has no place in the world of 21st century economics . " we live in a globalized world , " said winfried fuest , an analyst at the cologne institute for business research .
" with those kinds of suggestions put into place , we would no longer be competitive .
it ’ s a backwards-looking policy that economically is completely mistaken . " bildunterschrift : " we 're hiring for .. " says the sign , but there 's nothing underneath to complete the sentence . they say increasing the tax burden on corporations would weaken domestic and foreign investment in germany and make an already expensive labor force even pricier .
that could increase the number of firms who move production abroad because of lower wage costs and dissuade new or foreign firms from setting up shop in germany .
that , in turn , would increase unemployment and drive up the costs of germany ’ s already expensive welfare system . " we need growth , that is what will bring us jobs , " said rene hagemann-miksits , spokesperson for the bdi industry association .
" and it 's very clear that the -lrb- left party -rrb- program will do nothing to provide that . " his group has released a statement detailing the left party 's plans , concluding by saying " such a program would be fatal if it ever were realized as economic policy . " same old neo-liberal story ? but for the left party 's ihme , such talk is merely political posturing by groups interested more in defending their own interests than looking after the common welfare of the population . " those are standard arguments that we 've heard for years , " he said .
" if you lower non-wage costs , then jobs will be created .
well , we 've had two legislative periods to try that , and it has n't happened . "
now is the time to do something new , he added . he admits that the program , no matter how well the party does in the sept .
18 vote , will likely not be put into practice 100 percent .
but that it could help influence the debate and help shift economic policy from its current less-regulated course . according to financial analyst fuest , it 's already done that .
according to him , the success of the party in opinion polls has already made the bigger parties nervous and they are already backing away from some of the previous pro-reform stances they had .
the spd added a wealth tax to its party platform , bowing to the strong political wind .
even the conservative cdu , which is largely expected to come out on top in september , has toned down talk of bitter , but necessary medicine for germany . " the cdu has become very cautious when it comes to announcing further painful reforms , " he said .
" they ’ re just not saying much these days .

spd presents election manifesto election 2005 -pipe- 02.08.2005 social justice or economic folly ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the redistribution of wealth is central to the left party 's plank the new hard-left grouping in germany , the left party , is sending tremors across the political landscape .
but , the party 's economic program has industry groups and economists shaking their heads , and worrying . it calls itself the left party , die linkspartei in german , and it 's making an already unusual election campaign even stranger .
made up of the successors to east germany 's communist party , the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , and disaffected left-wingers who split off from the social democrats , the election alternative for jobs and social justice , the left party has attracted surprising support with its message of wealth redistribution , bigger government and offers of more for everyone , except the capitalists . one and a half months before possible early elections in september , the new party is polling 12 percent nationwide .
in eastern germany , it has the support of a stunning 33 percent of the population , according to a poll conducted last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gregor gysi " we need a new culture , " gregor gysi , the former charismatic leader of the pds who is now heading the left party campaign , said in an interview .
" we need wage increases .
we have to see social costs as something positive , and taxes have to be fair . " that means , the well-off should pay more of them , according to the economic platform that the party has released .
it says its suggestions will restore balance and justice to a german economy which has been thrown out of kilter by seven years of neo-liberal policies and which is structured to benefit only the rich . " those who earn the most , they are given tax relief , and that ’ s not right , " said bernd ihme , a policy spokesman for the left party .
" we want to make clear that it 's possible through redistribution to change how money is spent and whom it benefits . " bigger government the list of changes the party wants to make to germany 's tax and welfare system is long .
first on the agenda is the scrapping of the unpopular hartz iv labor and welfare reforms , which were instrumental in triggering the formation of the party in the first place . bildunterschrift : not happy with hartz iv the reforms , which were put in place by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government , were meant to tackle unemployment , spur job creation and ease the strain on germany 's severely burdened state coffers .
but to the left party , which balked at the cuts in welfare payments for the long-term jobless , the reforms are nothing more than " legally decreed poverty . " the party 's economic ideas include raising corporate taxes , which schröder had lowered , shortening the work week , establishing a minimum wage of 1,400 euros -lrb- $ 1,708 -rrb- a month , bringing back a tax on stock market transactions , raising inheritance and gift taxes and reintroducing a wealth tax . the party would increase welfare payments and government subsidies , financing it all with what it says are the 65 billion euros it would take in through the new taxes . roll back reforms all in all , it would overturn most of the reforms that schröder 's social democratic-green coalition put into place over the past seven years .
it is also the stuff that gives economists and business leaders nightmares , since they say it has no place in the world of 21st century economics . " we live in a globalized world , " said winfried fuest , an analyst at the cologne institute for business research .
" with those kinds of suggestions put into place , we would no longer be competitive .
it ’ s a backwards-looking policy that economically is completely mistaken . " bildunterschrift : " we 're hiring for .. " says the sign , but there 's nothing underneath to complete the sentence . they say increasing the tax burden on corporations would weaken domestic and foreign investment in germany and make an already expensive labor force even pricier .
that could increase the number of firms who move production abroad because of lower wage costs and dissuade new or foreign firms from setting up shop in germany .
that , in turn , would increase unemployment and drive up the costs of germany ’ s already expensive welfare system . " we need growth , that is what will bring us jobs , " said rene hagemann-miksits , spokesperson for the bdi industry association .
" and it 's very clear that the -lrb- left party -rrb- program will do nothing to provide that . " his group has released a statement detailing the left party 's plans , concluding by saying " such a program would be fatal if it ever were realized as economic policy . " same old neo-liberal story ? but for the left party 's ihme , such talk is merely political posturing by groups interested more in defending their own interests than looking after the common welfare of the population . " those are standard arguments that we 've heard for years , " he said .
" if you lower non-wage costs , then jobs will be created .
well , we 've had two legislative periods to try that , and it has n't happened . "
now is the time to do something new , he added . he admits that the program , no matter how well the party does in the sept .
18 vote , will likely not be put into practice 100 percent .
but that it could help influence the debate and help shift economic policy from its current less-regulated course . according to financial analyst fuest , it 's already done that .
according to him , the success of the party in opinion polls has already made the bigger parties nervous and they are already backing away from some of the previous pro-reform stances they had .
the spd added a wealth tax to its party platform , bowing to the strong political wind .
even the conservative cdu , which is largely expected to come out on top in september , has toned down talk of bitter , but necessary medicine for germany . " the cdu has become very cautious when it comes to announcing further painful reforms , " he said .
" they ’ re just not saying much these days . " kyle james , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de goodbye pds , hello " left party " after much back and forth , germany 's reform communist pds party on sunday voted in favor of joining a new leftist alliance , and agreed to change their name , as expected , to the left party .
-lrb- july 17 , 2005 -rrb- left party puts rivals on offensive the newly formed " left party " is already gaining ground in the opinion polls - at the cost of the conservative opposition .
although the leftists do n't want to rule , they will take important votes .
-lrb- july 20 , 2005 -rrb- high-speed election campaign gets going with federal polls now almost sure to take place , germany 's politicians face their shortest ever election campaign .
the winner may seem certain , but experts say the campaign will prove to be the most exciting to date .

on monday , 1,400 doctors took to the streets in two states to kick off the weeklong action . the pain threshold for young doctors in german hospitals has been reached .
on monday in the states of baden-württemberg and hesse , over 1,400 physicians hung up their stethoscopes on the office door and hit the streets to protest poor working conditions .
the banners the doctors carried sent a clear signal to hospitals , particularly state-run facilities , around the country : " better pay for better work " and " england pays twice as much . "
on the first day of weeklong protests that will culminate on friday in berlin with a " national day of protest , " leaders from the marburger bund doctors ' union are looking to raise the awareness of the plight of german doctors compared to their peers abroad .
overtime without compensation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : physicians of frankfurt 's university hospital protest against their working conditions .
the banner reads " money away , doctor away . "
in a country where many laborers receive extra compensation for working overtime , at night or under dangerous conditions , the doctors seem to have a point .
the marburger bund said that some 146,000 hospital doctors perform 50 million hours of overtime each year , most of them without extra compensation , and that germany trailed far behind comparable nations in physicians ' salaries .
the chairman of the union , frank ulrich montgomery , said the budget cuts at university clinics were equal to " state-supported robbery of wages . "
the doctors say they have been forced to bear the brunt of budget cutbacks at public health institutions , seeing their christmas and vacation bonuses slashed while working hours increase .
" as long as french , british and american colleagues earn two or three times as much , nothing will stop the flight of doctors abroad and the shortage of physicians , " said montgomery . particularly disturbing to the union was the grave discrepancy between young assistant doctors and head physicians .
27-year-olds fresh out of college begin with a take-home pay of around 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,000 -rrb- per month .
their superiors , frequently with managerial duties , earn up to 12 times that amount .
the system is at fault bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overtime is frequently left unpaid in german hospitals while the younger physicians have taken to the streets demanding fairer work schedules and more pay , others say it is the system that doctors created for themselves that is at fault .
" the union leaders ca n't come up with a better idea than to demand more pay , " criticized kurt lauterbach .
the health care economist points out that the two-tier health care system , where little money can be earned with public health plan patients and a lot with private patients , leads to young doctors receiving poor wages .
" this system is unjust and must be revamped , " lauterbach declared .
this must also be done in the interest of german patients .
young doctors are taking their abilities to other countries where they know the rewards are greater .
according to the latest figures from the doctors ' union , around 6,000 positions remain unfilled at german hospitals .
the same number are registered abroad .
one area where all parties concerned agree , is the amount of time that german physicians spend mired in medical bureaucratic procedures .

on monday , 1,400 doctors took to the streets in two states to kick off the weeklong action . the pain threshold for young doctors in german hospitals has been reached .
on monday in the states of baden-württemberg and hesse , over 1,400 physicians hung up their stethoscopes on the office door and hit the streets to protest poor working conditions .
the banners the doctors carried sent a clear signal to hospitals , particularly state-run facilities , around the country : " better pay for better work " and " england pays twice as much . "
on the first day of weeklong protests that will culminate on friday in berlin with a " national day of protest , " leaders from the marburger bund doctors ' union are looking to raise the awareness of the plight of german doctors compared to their peers abroad .
overtime without compensation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : physicians of frankfurt 's university hospital protest against their working conditions .
the banner reads " money away , doctor away . "
in a country where many laborers receive extra compensation for working overtime , at night or under dangerous conditions , the doctors seem to have a point .
the marburger bund said that some 146,000 hospital doctors perform 50 million hours of overtime each year , most of them without extra compensation , and that germany trailed far behind comparable nations in physicians ' salaries .
the chairman of the union , frank ulrich montgomery , said the budget cuts at university clinics were equal to " state-supported robbery of wages . "
the doctors say they have been forced to bear the brunt of budget cutbacks at public health institutions , seeing their christmas and vacation bonuses slashed while working hours increase .
" as long as french , british and american colleagues earn two or three times as much , nothing will stop the flight of doctors abroad and the shortage of physicians , " said montgomery . particularly disturbing to the union was the grave discrepancy between young assistant doctors and head physicians .
27-year-olds fresh out of college begin with a take-home pay of around 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,000 -rrb- per month .
their superiors , frequently with managerial duties , earn up to 12 times that amount .
the system is at fault bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overtime is frequently left unpaid in german hospitals while the younger physicians have taken to the streets demanding fairer work schedules and more pay , others say it is the system that doctors created for themselves that is at fault .
" the union leaders ca n't come up with a better idea than to demand more pay , " criticized kurt lauterbach .
the health care economist points out that the two-tier health care system , where little money can be earned with public health plan patients and a lot with private patients , leads to young doctors receiving poor wages .
" this system is unjust and must be revamped , " lauterbach declared .
this must also be done in the interest of german patients .
young doctors are taking their abilities to other countries where they know the rewards are greater .
according to the latest figures from the doctors ' union , around 6,000 positions remain unfilled at german hospitals .
the same number are registered abroad .
one area where all parties concerned agree , is the amount of time that german physicians spend mired in medical bureaucratic procedures .
according to christian democratic social affairs expert andreas strom , this costs them up to 30 percent of their work time . dw staff / afp -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de doctors defect to blissful britain germany 's health system is a troubled soul .

" you can take it for granted that a future government led by a christian democrat chancellor , would aspire to keep these good relations intact or improve them wherever needed , " she said . but merkel has been very critical of the way the german government under gerhard schröder has approached transatlantic relations . " i do n't understand why previously excellent relations with the united states had to worsen to the extent known to all of us just because of our good ties with other nations , " merkel said . friendship , but no servitude bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder won the 2002 re-election greatly thanks to his opposition to the us invasion of iraq chancellor schröder , on his part , made it clear that for him friendship did not equal total obedience . " it 's been our firm conviction that friendship with another nation does not rule out being of a different opinion once in a while and does not rule out pursuing another foreign policy , if need be , " schröder said .
" it 's never been our idea to say yes to everything that comes our way , and we 're not planning to change this in future either . " merkel keeps stressing that loyalty in the transatlantic alliance is a great virtue .

in order to gain more direct influence on important foreign policy issues , she 's planning to have a security advisor at her side in the chancellery .
cdu foreign policy spokesman friedbert pflüger is being viewed as the most likely candidate for this post . there had also been talk about angela merkel wanting to install a separate ministry for european affairs , but the latest reports say these plans are now off the table . either way , merkel 's plans are going to hurt the opposition liberal democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- as the cdu 's likely junior partner would claim the post of foreign minister .
it stands to reason that both a ministry for european affairs and a security advisor in the chancellery would leave the foreign ministry with considerably less power and influence . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel 's envoy lauds meeting with bush the cdu 's wolfgang schäuble went to the us to lay out the basis of his party 's foreign policy in the case of a conservative election victory and got a welcome surprise - 45 minutes with the man himself , president bush .

well , you 're not alone .
here , dw-world offers an easy guide to some of the technical terms which may feature in the coming action . offsides : when the player with the ball on the attacking team passes the ball to a teammate closer to the goal line than the opposing team .
in other words , there is no defending player between the guy who receives the pass and the goalie .
if the teammate is level or slightly behind the defending player , it is not offside .
new rules also state that a player can be offside at the point when he receives the ball .
complicated , but true .
offsides is also the most basic element of any sort of " women do n't understand football " joke .
free kick : a kick that is awarded by the referee after a foul .
the kicks can be either direct , or indirect .
a direct kick is awarded for particularly serious fouls , like a hard tackle , tripping , or a hand ball .
the direct kick means a ball can be kicked directly into the goal .
an indirect kick needs to touch another player before going into the goal .
lesser fouls like tripping , or a high kick near an opponent 's head typically earn indirect free kicks .
penalty kick : when a defender or a goalie fouls an opponent in their own penalty box .
the referee then awards a penalty kick , which is taken from a spot 12 yards from the goal line in the penalty box .
anyone on the team that has taken the foul can take the penalty kick , which pits the attacker against the goalie .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese for " football " throw-in : a throw-in is awarded when the opposing team causes the ball to go out of bounds over one of the sidelines .
the player throwing the ball must do so with both hands , over his head and with both feet firmly on or inside the sideline .
a goal may not be scored on a throw-in , unless it touches another player .
corner kick : a corner is awarded when the ball goes out of bounds behind the end line and was last touched by the defending team .
the attacking team kicks it inbounds from either one of the corner arcs .
the defending team needs to be at least 10 yards away from the corner arcs .
cross : when philipp lahm smacks a beautifully struck ball from the wings right onto the foot of his striker , and defensive players are left paralyzed in their positions , that 's a cross .
penalty box : measures 18 yards from the goal line and 44 yards wide .
while in the penalty box , the goalie may touch the ball with his hands .
the goalie has six seconds after he has picked up the ball to either throw or kick it out of the penalty box .
in matches where one team desperately needs a goal , the penalty area can play host to some of soccer 's more theatrical performances as players look for a penalty kick .
favourites include " being shot by a sniper " and " olympic freestyle diver " .
bildunterschrift : that 'll be a goal then ...
goal : the goal measures 8 yards wide and 8 feet tall .
this is oliver kahn 's domain .
a goal counts when the ball has completely crossed the goal line .
goal kick : when the ball crosses the end line -lrb- goal line -rrb- and was last touched by the attacking team .
the defending team can set the ball up anywhere within their goal box and kick it out .
the ball must exit the penalty box before it can be touched by either team .
regulation time : each half lasts 45 minutes .
the clock ticks without stopping throughout the entire half .
at the end , stoppage time is often awarded if the referee has taken note of stoppages in play due to injury or incident .
substitutes : a list of possible substitutes must be handed to the referee before the game .
one team can only make a total of three substitutes plus the goalkeeper in each game .
this includes overtime , when the players are huffing around on their last legs , about to pass out .
technical area : the technical area extends 1 meter -lrb- 1 yard -rrb- on either side of the designated seated area and extends forward up to a distance of 1 meter from the touch line .
this is the area in which the coach is allowed to pace nervously , bellow instructions , shout abuse , issue instructions to players and jig with joy .
the technical area also acts as a protective shield for match officials who are more often than not the target of manager 's ire .
if the coach / manager strays from the area in an attempt to harangue referee or lineman , he can be cautioned and , in extreme situations , " sent off " to watch the rest of the match from the stands or on television in the changing room .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : referees : the men in black , or now more often than not in green , yellow or red , who have final say on player conduct during the game .
with the referee are two assistants , who patrol the sidelines and call offsides , which team gets a corner kick or throw-in and notify the head referee of substitutions .
foul : an illegal action intended to sway advantage to one 's team .
this could range from the felling of an opposing player in an attacking situation to a deliberate hand ball which prevents the opposition gaining possession .
a professional foul - one which is deemed to be premeditated or physically dangerous - can result in an instant dismissal .
others can be dealt with at the referee 's discretion .
stoppage time : time added at the end of regulation time for penalties , injuries , substitutions , or when players whine about a foul or any sort of injustice done to them .
typically around 3 minutes .
yellow card : one of two cards that can be pulled by the referee on a player for fouls ranging from unsporting behavior , to trash-talking the ref , delaying the restart of play , etc .

well , you 're not alone .
here , dw-world offers an easy guide to some of the technical terms which may feature in the coming action . offsides : when the player with the ball on the attacking team passes the ball to a teammate closer to the goal line than the opposing team .
in other words , there is no defending player between the guy who receives the pass and the goalie .
if the teammate is level or slightly behind the defending player , it is not offside .
new rules also state that a player can be offside at the point when he receives the ball .
complicated , but true .
offsides is also the most basic element of any sort of " women do n't understand football " joke .
free kick : a kick that is awarded by the referee after a foul .
the kicks can be either direct , or indirect .
a direct kick is awarded for particularly serious fouls , like a hard tackle , tripping , or a hand ball .
the direct kick means a ball can be kicked directly into the goal .
an indirect kick needs to touch another player before going into the goal .
lesser fouls like tripping , or a high kick near an opponent 's head typically earn indirect free kicks .
penalty kick : when a defender or a goalie fouls an opponent in their own penalty box .
the referee then awards a penalty kick , which is taken from a spot 12 yards from the goal line in the penalty box .
anyone on the team that has taken the foul can take the penalty kick , which pits the attacker against the goalie .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese for " football " throw-in : a throw-in is awarded when the opposing team causes the ball to go out of bounds over one of the sidelines .
the player throwing the ball must do so with both hands , over his head and with both feet firmly on or inside the sideline .
a goal may not be scored on a throw-in , unless it touches another player .
corner kick : a corner is awarded when the ball goes out of bounds behind the end line and was last touched by the defending team .
the attacking team kicks it inbounds from either one of the corner arcs .
the defending team needs to be at least 10 yards away from the corner arcs .
cross : when philipp lahm smacks a beautifully struck ball from the wings right onto the foot of his striker , and defensive players are left paralyzed in their positions , that 's a cross .
penalty box : measures 18 yards from the goal line and 44 yards wide .
while in the penalty box , the goalie may touch the ball with his hands .
the goalie has six seconds after he has picked up the ball to either throw or kick it out of the penalty box .
in matches where one team desperately needs a goal , the penalty area can play host to some of soccer 's more theatrical performances as players look for a penalty kick .
favourites include " being shot by a sniper " and " olympic freestyle diver " .
bildunterschrift : that 'll be a goal then ...
goal : the goal measures 8 yards wide and 8 feet tall .
this is oliver kahn 's domain .
a goal counts when the ball has completely crossed the goal line .
goal kick : when the ball crosses the end line -lrb- goal line -rrb- and was last touched by the attacking team .
the defending team can set the ball up anywhere within their goal box and kick it out .
the ball must exit the penalty box before it can be touched by either team .
regulation time : each half lasts 45 minutes .
the clock ticks without stopping throughout the entire half .
at the end , stoppage time is often awarded if the referee has taken note of stoppages in play due to injury or incident .
substitutes : a list of possible substitutes must be handed to the referee before the game .
one team can only make a total of three substitutes plus the goalkeeper in each game .
this includes overtime , when the players are huffing around on their last legs , about to pass out .
technical area : the technical area extends 1 meter -lrb- 1 yard -rrb- on either side of the designated seated area and extends forward up to a distance of 1 meter from the touch line .
this is the area in which the coach is allowed to pace nervously , bellow instructions , shout abuse , issue instructions to players and jig with joy .
the technical area also acts as a protective shield for match officials who are more often than not the target of manager 's ire .
if the coach / manager strays from the area in an attempt to harangue referee or lineman , he can be cautioned and , in extreme situations , " sent off " to watch the rest of the match from the stands or on television in the changing room .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : referees : the men in black , or now more often than not in green , yellow or red , who have final say on player conduct during the game .
with the referee are two assistants , who patrol the sidelines and call offsides , which team gets a corner kick or throw-in and notify the head referee of substitutions .
foul : an illegal action intended to sway advantage to one 's team .
this could range from the felling of an opposing player in an attacking situation to a deliberate hand ball which prevents the opposition gaining possession .
a professional foul - one which is deemed to be premeditated or physically dangerous - can result in an instant dismissal .
others can be dealt with at the referee 's discretion .
stoppage time : time added at the end of regulation time for penalties , injuries , substitutions , or when players whine about a foul or any sort of injustice done to them .
typically around 3 minutes .
yellow card : one of two cards that can be pulled by the referee on a player for fouls ranging from unsporting behavior , to trash-talking the ref , delaying the restart of play , etc .
a direct or indirect kick is always awarded .
two yellow cards in one game equal a red card and the player is immediately sent off the field and has to miss the next match .
red card : awarded by a referee when a foul has been particularly brutal , or the player spits , hits , curses , etc at another player or the referee .

well , you 're not alone .
here , dw-world offers an easy guide to some of the technical terms which may feature in the coming action . offsides : when the player with the ball on the attacking team passes the ball to a teammate closer to the goal line than the opposing team .
in other words , there is no defending player between the guy who receives the pass and the goalie .
if the teammate is level or slightly behind the defending player , it is not offside .
new rules also state that a player can be offside at the point when he receives the ball .
complicated , but true .
offsides is also the most basic element of any sort of " women do n't understand football " joke .
free kick : a kick that is awarded by the referee after a foul .
the kicks can be either direct , or indirect .
a direct kick is awarded for particularly serious fouls , like a hard tackle , tripping , or a hand ball .
the direct kick means a ball can be kicked directly into the goal .
an indirect kick needs to touch another player before going into the goal .
lesser fouls like tripping , or a high kick near an opponent 's head typically earn indirect free kicks .
penalty kick : when a defender or a goalie fouls an opponent in their own penalty box .
the referee then awards a penalty kick , which is taken from a spot 12 yards from the goal line in the penalty box .
anyone on the team that has taken the foul can take the penalty kick , which pits the attacker against the goalie .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese for " football " throw-in : a throw-in is awarded when the opposing team causes the ball to go out of bounds over one of the sidelines .
the player throwing the ball must do so with both hands , over his head and with both feet firmly on or inside the sideline .
a goal may not be scored on a throw-in , unless it touches another player .
corner kick : a corner is awarded when the ball goes out of bounds behind the end line and was last touched by the defending team .
the attacking team kicks it inbounds from either one of the corner arcs .
the defending team needs to be at least 10 yards away from the corner arcs .
cross : when philipp lahm smacks a beautifully struck ball from the wings right onto the foot of his striker , and defensive players are left paralyzed in their positions , that 's a cross .
penalty box : measures 18 yards from the goal line and 44 yards wide .
while in the penalty box , the goalie may touch the ball with his hands .
the goalie has six seconds after he has picked up the ball to either throw or kick it out of the penalty box .
in matches where one team desperately needs a goal , the penalty area can play host to some of soccer 's more theatrical performances as players look for a penalty kick .
favourites include " being shot by a sniper " and " olympic freestyle diver " .
bildunterschrift : that 'll be a goal then ...
goal : the goal measures 8 yards wide and 8 feet tall .
this is oliver kahn 's domain .
a goal counts when the ball has completely crossed the goal line .
goal kick : when the ball crosses the end line -lrb- goal line -rrb- and was last touched by the attacking team .
the defending team can set the ball up anywhere within their goal box and kick it out .
the ball must exit the penalty box before it can be touched by either team .
regulation time : each half lasts 45 minutes .
the clock ticks without stopping throughout the entire half .
at the end , stoppage time is often awarded if the referee has taken note of stoppages in play due to injury or incident .
substitutes : a list of possible substitutes must be handed to the referee before the game .
one team can only make a total of three substitutes plus the goalkeeper in each game .
this includes overtime , when the players are huffing around on their last legs , about to pass out .
technical area : the technical area extends 1 meter -lrb- 1 yard -rrb- on either side of the designated seated area and extends forward up to a distance of 1 meter from the touch line .
this is the area in which the coach is allowed to pace nervously , bellow instructions , shout abuse , issue instructions to players and jig with joy .
the technical area also acts as a protective shield for match officials who are more often than not the target of manager 's ire .
if the coach / manager strays from the area in an attempt to harangue referee or lineman , he can be cautioned and , in extreme situations , " sent off " to watch the rest of the match from the stands or on television in the changing room .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : referees : the men in black , or now more often than not in green , yellow or red , who have final say on player conduct during the game .
with the referee are two assistants , who patrol the sidelines and call offsides , which team gets a corner kick or throw-in and notify the head referee of substitutions .
foul : an illegal action intended to sway advantage to one 's team .
this could range from the felling of an opposing player in an attacking situation to a deliberate hand ball which prevents the opposition gaining possession .
a professional foul - one which is deemed to be premeditated or physically dangerous - can result in an instant dismissal .
others can be dealt with at the referee 's discretion .
stoppage time : time added at the end of regulation time for penalties , injuries , substitutions , or when players whine about a foul or any sort of injustice done to them .
typically around 3 minutes .
yellow card : one of two cards that can be pulled by the referee on a player for fouls ranging from unsporting behavior , to trash-talking the ref , delaying the restart of play , etc .
a direct or indirect kick is always awarded .
two yellow cards in one game equal a red card and the player is immediately sent off the field and has to miss the next match .
red card : awarded by a referee when a foul has been particularly brutal , or the player spits , hits , curses , etc at another player or the referee .

spd presents election manifesto election 2005 -pipe- 02.08.2005 social justice or economic folly ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the redistribution of wealth is central to the left party 's plank the new hard-left grouping in germany , the left party , is sending tremors across the political landscape .
but , the party 's economic program has industry groups and economists shaking their heads , and worrying . it calls itself the left party , die linkspartei in german , and it 's making an already unusual election campaign even stranger .
made up of the successors to east germany 's communist party , the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , and disaffected left-wingers who split off from the social democrats , the election alternative for jobs and social justice , the left party has attracted surprising support with its message of wealth redistribution , bigger government and offers of more for everyone , except the capitalists . one and a half months before possible early elections in september , the new party is polling 12 percent nationwide .
in eastern germany , it has the support of a stunning 33 percent of the population , according to a poll conducted last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gregor gysi " we need a new culture , " gregor gysi , the former charismatic leader of the pds who is now heading the left party campaign , said in an interview .
" we need wage increases .
we have to see social costs as something positive , and taxes have to be fair . " that means , the well-off should pay more of them , according to the economic platform that the party has released .
it says its suggestions will restore balance and justice to a german economy which has been thrown out of kilter by seven years of neo-liberal policies and which is structured to benefit only the rich . " those who earn the most , they are given tax relief , and that ’ s not right , " said bernd ihme , a policy spokesman for the left party .
" we want to make clear that it 's possible through redistribution to change how money is spent and whom it benefits . " bigger government the list of changes the party wants to make to germany 's tax and welfare system is long .
first on the agenda is the scrapping of the unpopular hartz iv labor and welfare reforms , which were instrumental in triggering the formation of the party in the first place . bildunterschrift : not happy with hartz iv the reforms , which were put in place by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government , were meant to tackle unemployment , spur job creation and ease the strain on germany 's severely burdened state coffers .
but to the left party , which balked at the cuts in welfare payments for the long-term jobless , the reforms are nothing more than " legally decreed poverty . " the party 's economic ideas include raising corporate taxes , which schröder had lowered , shortening the work week , establishing a minimum wage of 1,400 euros -lrb- $ 1,708 -rrb- a month , bringing back a tax on stock market transactions , raising inheritance and gift taxes and reintroducing a wealth tax . the party would increase welfare payments and government subsidies , financing it all with what it says are the 65 billion euros it would take in through the new taxes . roll back reforms all in all , it would overturn most of the reforms that schröder 's social democratic-green coalition put into place over the past seven years .
it is also the stuff that gives economists and business leaders nightmares , since they say it has no place in the world of 21st century economics . " we live in a globalized world , " said winfried fuest , an analyst at the cologne institute for business research .
" with those kinds of suggestions put into place , we would no longer be competitive .
it ’ s a backwards-looking policy that economically is completely mistaken . " bildunterschrift : " we 're hiring for .. " says the sign , but there 's nothing underneath to complete the sentence . they say increasing the tax burden on corporations would weaken domestic and foreign investment in germany and make an already expensive labor force even pricier .
that could increase the number of firms who move production abroad because of lower wage costs and dissuade new or foreign firms from setting up shop in germany .
that , in turn , would increase unemployment and drive up the costs of germany ’ s already expensive welfare system . " we need growth , that is what will bring us jobs , " said rene hagemann-miksits , spokesperson for the bdi industry association .
" and it 's very clear that the -lrb- left party -rrb- program will do nothing to provide that . " his group has released a statement detailing the left party 's plans , concluding by saying " such a program would be fatal if it ever were realized as economic policy . " same old neo-liberal story ? but for the left party 's ihme , such talk is merely political posturing by groups interested more in defending their own interests than looking after the common welfare of the population . " those are standard arguments that we 've heard for years , " he said .
" if you lower non-wage costs , then jobs will be created .
well , we 've had two legislative periods to try that , and it has n't happened . "
now is the time to do something new , he added . he admits that the program , no matter how well the party does in the sept .
18 vote , will likely not be put into practice 100 percent .
but that it could help influence the debate and help shift economic policy from its current less-regulated course . according to financial analyst fuest , it 's already done that .
according to him , the success of the party in opinion polls has already made the bigger parties nervous and they are already backing away from some of the previous pro-reform stances they had .
the spd added a wealth tax to its party platform , bowing to the strong political wind .
even the conservative cdu , which is largely expected to come out on top in september , has toned down talk of bitter , but necessary medicine for germany . " the cdu has become very cautious when it comes to announcing further painful reforms , " he said .

" she says she ca n't remember how they were killed because she drank heavily when the contractions began , " prosecutor annette bargenda said at a news conference .
the mother is suspected of giving birth to each of the infants and then killing them one by one between 1988 and 2004 . the woman told police that in every instance , she had given birth to the children without any assistance or other people being there .
the father of the children , who divorced the woman earlier this year , did n't know that she was pregnant , the woman claims .
the couple also have three children aged 18 , 19 and 20 . the ex-husband , who was not named , is a professional who spent long periods away from home on business .
he is said to be horrified by the news . babies already buried when woman sobered up in at least seven cases , the woman " knows she put a covering over each child .
she said she woke or sobered up only after the children were already buried , " bargenda said .
some of the remains were first stored on her balcony before being moved to the garden and shed , she added . a police spokesman said earlier tuesday that the woman had admitted killing some of the children , but the spokesman later said that was incorrect . german prosecutors said monday the bodies of the nine newborn babies were discovered in a shed the woman used for storage . " we are assuming there are at least nine corpses , " said michael neff of the frankfurt / oder state prosecutor 's office .
he did not comment on a possible motive . local politicians reacted with shock to the discovery and asked how it was possible that the disappearance of the babies over a period of some 16 years had not come to light earlier . crime leaves officials stunned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jörg schönbohm " we are faced with a crime whose scope , in my memory , we have never seen in the history of the federal republic " since 1945 , said brandenburg state interior minister jörg schönbohm .
" we must ask ourselves how this unbelievable crime remained hidden all these years . " it 's a question directed at relatives , neighbors , doctors and the authorities , " he added . the state prosecutor 's office in the city said the find in the town of brieskow-finkenheerd , 10 kilometers -lrb- six miles -rrb- south of frankfurt in a depressed region of former east germany , was made on sunday . remains found in plant pots , buckets , aquarium " when someone went to clean up the lot , he found human bones in an aquarium , " state prosecutor ulrich scherding told news channel n24 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outside view of the house in brieskow-finkenheerd where police discovered the remains of the nine newborn babies authorities added that other bodies were hidden in flower boxes and pots in the shed and in buckets buried under sand and earth .
they were to be taken for autopsy .
each of the infants appeared to have been killed immediately after birth . some 40 police officers with eight sniffer dogs were combing the area for other corpses . the mayor of brieskow-finkenheerd , ralf theuer , said he had not known the suspect but heard from neighbors that she tended to keep to herself . unprecedented infanticide in germany the vice-president of the association of german psychologists , uwe wetter , said that such cases , while extremely rare , often stem from social isolation combined with extreme symptoms of post-partum depression . in october 2003 , a 38-year-old woman from czerniejow , poland admitted to drowning five of her children after their births .

while conservative challenger angela merkel is too busy to appear in two tv debates , media-savvy chancellor schröder is even eager to go for a duel with himself .
the debate about the debate is heating up . chancellor schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- failed to reach an agreement saturday on the number of televised debates that the chancellor candidates would participate in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : broadcaster would like to see two tv debates citing a short campaign and a very busy schedule , cdu candidate angela merkel and a favorite to become germany 's next and first female chancellor has so far agreed on only one tv debate with her political rival .

on monday , 1,400 doctors took to the streets in two states to kick off the weeklong action . the pain threshold for young doctors in german hospitals has been reached .
on monday in the states of baden-württemberg and hesse , over 1,400 physicians hung up their stethoscopes on the office door and hit the streets to protest poor working conditions .
the banners the doctors carried sent a clear signal to hospitals , particularly state-run facilities , around the country : " better pay for better work " and " england pays twice as much . "
on the first day of weeklong protests that will culminate on friday in berlin with a " national day of protest , " leaders from the marburger bund doctors ' union are looking to raise the awareness of the plight of german doctors compared to their peers abroad .
overtime without compensation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : physicians of frankfurt 's university hospital protest against their working conditions .
the banner reads " money away , doctor away . "
in a country where many laborers receive extra compensation for working overtime , at night or under dangerous conditions , the doctors seem to have a point .
the marburger bund said that some 146,000 hospital doctors perform 50 million hours of overtime each year , most of them without extra compensation , and that germany trailed far behind comparable nations in physicians ' salaries .
the chairman of the union , frank ulrich montgomery , said the budget cuts at university clinics were equal to " state-supported robbery of wages . "
the doctors say they have been forced to bear the brunt of budget cutbacks at public health institutions , seeing their christmas and vacation bonuses slashed while working hours increase .
" as long as french , british and american colleagues earn two or three times as much , nothing will stop the flight of doctors abroad and the shortage of physicians , " said montgomery . particularly disturbing to the union was the grave discrepancy between young assistant doctors and head physicians .
27-year-olds fresh out of college begin with a take-home pay of around 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,000 -rrb- per month .
their superiors , frequently with managerial duties , earn up to 12 times that amount .

" the union leaders ca n't come up with a better idea than to demand more pay , " criticized kurt lauterbach .
the health care economist points out that the two-tier health care system , where little money can be earned with public health plan patients and a lot with private patients , leads to young doctors receiving poor wages .
" this system is unjust and must be revamped , " lauterbach declared .
this must also be done in the interest of german patients .
young doctors are taking their abilities to other countries where they know the rewards are greater .
according to the latest figures from the doctors ' union , around 6,000 positions remain unfilled at german hospitals .
the same number are registered abroad .
one area where all parties concerned agree , is the amount of time that german physicians spend mired in medical bureaucratic procedures .

on monday in the states of baden-württemberg and hesse , over 1,400 physicians hung up their stethoscopes on the office door and hit the streets to protest poor working conditions .
the banners the doctors carried sent a clear signal to hospitals , particularly state-run facilities , around the country : " better pay for better work " and " england pays twice as much . "
on the first day of weeklong protests that will culminate on friday in berlin with a " national day of protest , " leaders from the marburger bund doctors ' union are looking to raise the awareness of the plight of german doctors compared to their peers abroad .
overtime without compensation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : physicians of frankfurt 's university hospital protest against their working conditions .
the banner reads " money away , doctor away . "
in a country where many laborers receive extra compensation for working overtime , at night or under dangerous conditions , the doctors seem to have a point .
the marburger bund said that some 146,000 hospital doctors perform 50 million hours of overtime each year , most of them without extra compensation , and that germany trailed far behind comparable nations in physicians ' salaries .
the chairman of the union , frank ulrich montgomery , said the budget cuts at university clinics were equal to " state-supported robbery of wages . "
the doctors say they have been forced to bear the brunt of budget cutbacks at public health institutions , seeing their christmas and vacation bonuses slashed while working hours increase .
" as long as french , british and american colleagues earn two or three times as much , nothing will stop the flight of doctors abroad and the shortage of physicians , " said montgomery . particularly disturbing to the union was the grave discrepancy between young assistant doctors and head physicians .
27-year-olds fresh out of college begin with a take-home pay of around 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,000 -rrb- per month .
their superiors , frequently with managerial duties , earn up to 12 times that amount .

" the union leaders ca n't come up with a better idea than to demand more pay , " criticized kurt lauterbach .
the health care economist points out that the two-tier health care system , where little money can be earned with public health plan patients and a lot with private patients , leads to young doctors receiving poor wages .
" this system is unjust and must be revamped , " lauterbach declared .
this must also be done in the interest of german patients .
young doctors are taking their abilities to other countries where they know the rewards are greater .
according to the latest figures from the doctors ' union , around 6,000 positions remain unfilled at german hospitals .
the same number are registered abroad .
one area where all parties concerned agree , is the amount of time that german physicians spend mired in medical bureaucratic procedures .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.08.2005 german doctors go on strike großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " overtime is unhealthy " german doctors have begun nationwide protests against long working hours and pay cuts .
on monday , 1,400 doctors took to the streets in two states to kick off the weeklong action . the pain threshold for young doctors in german hospitals has been reached .
on monday in the states of baden-württemberg and hesse , over 1,400 physicians hung up their stethoscopes on the office door and hit the streets to protest poor working conditions .
the banners the doctors carried sent a clear signal to hospitals , particularly state-run facilities , around the country : " better pay for better work " and " england pays twice as much . "
on the first day of weeklong protests that will culminate on friday in berlin with a " national day of protest , " leaders from the marburger bund doctors ' union are looking to raise the awareness of the plight of german doctors compared to their peers abroad .
overtime without compensation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : physicians of frankfurt 's university hospital protest against their working conditions .
the banner reads " money away , doctor away . "
in a country where many laborers receive extra compensation for working overtime , at night or under dangerous conditions , the doctors seem to have a point .
the marburger bund said that some 146,000 hospital doctors perform 50 million hours of overtime each year , most of them without extra compensation , and that germany trailed far behind comparable nations in physicians ' salaries .
the chairman of the union , frank ulrich montgomery , said the budget cuts at university clinics were equal to " state-supported robbery of wages . "
the doctors say they have been forced to bear the brunt of budget cutbacks at public health institutions , seeing their christmas and vacation bonuses slashed while working hours increase .
" as long as french , british and american colleagues earn two or three times as much , nothing will stop the flight of doctors abroad and the shortage of physicians , " said montgomery . particularly disturbing to the union was the grave discrepancy between young assistant doctors and head physicians .
27-year-olds fresh out of college begin with a take-home pay of around 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,000 -rrb- per month .
their superiors , frequently with managerial duties , earn up to 12 times that amount .
the system is at fault bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overtime is frequently left unpaid in german hospitals while the younger physicians have taken to the streets demanding fairer work schedules and more pay , others say it is the system that doctors created for themselves that is at fault .
" the union leaders ca n't come up with a better idea than to demand more pay , " criticized kurt lauterbach .
the health care economist points out that the two-tier health care system , where little money can be earned with public health plan patients and a lot with private patients , leads to young doctors receiving poor wages .
" this system is unjust and must be revamped , " lauterbach declared .
this must also be done in the interest of german patients .
young doctors are taking their abilities to other countries where they know the rewards are greater .
according to the latest figures from the doctors ' union , around 6,000 positions remain unfilled at german hospitals .
the same number are registered abroad .
one area where all parties concerned agree , is the amount of time that german physicians spend mired in medical bureaucratic procedures .
according to christian democratic social affairs expert andreas strom , this costs them up to 30 percent of their work time . dw staff / afp -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de doctors defect to blissful britain germany 's health system is a troubled soul .

oil and gas are scarce resources .
politicians have vastly different ideas when it comes to meeting growing energy demand . spd the spd plans to invest 20 billion euros -lrb- $ 24.5 billion -rrb- in renewable energy by 2010 with the goal of making germany the global market leader in the solar and wind power industries .
the party remains committed to the agreed on subsidies for phasing out coal production as well as nuclear energy .
the energy supply should come from climate-friendly ' clean coal ' plants , natural gas , biomass , and a mix of various renewable energy sources . cdu / csu the cdu and csu envision an energy supply from a diverse array of sources : oil , coal , gas , nuclear as well as biomass , hydro , wind , and solar energy .
regenerative energies should make up at least 12.5 percent of the energy supply , but should receive fewer subsidies than in the past .
the german nuclear power plants should be allowed to continue operation longer than currently intended . the greens the greens want to disembark from the nuclear age and move away from crude oil .
energy should increasingly come from solar , wind , hydro , biomass and geothermal generating plants .
the goal for 2020 is to produce a full quarter of the present energy supply , heating demand , fuel consumption , and goods of the petrochemical industry , respectively , from renewable energies and renewable primary products .
the coal subsidies should be reduced and completely eliminated by 2012 .
greenhouse gas emissions should be cut by 40 percent of their 1990 levels by 2020 ; the eu stipulates only a 30 percent reduction .
the greens clearly have the longest resume with legislation for environmental and consumer protection . fdp the free democratic party wants to slash subsidies , whether for hard coal power plants or for renewable energies .
the european electricity and gas markets should be more fully liberalized .
market regulation should only be oriented to increasing competitiveness , demands the fdp .
as with the christian union , the party is bent on atomic energy . the left party the left party is calling for a " rapid departure from nuclear energy . "

" those who earn the most , they are given tax relief , and that ’ s not right , " said bernd ihme , a policy spokesman for the left party .
" we want to make clear that it 's possible through redistribution to change how money is spent and whom it benefits . " bigger government the list of changes the party wants to make to germany 's tax and welfare system is long .
first on the agenda is the scrapping of the unpopular hartz iv labor and welfare reforms , which were instrumental in triggering the formation of the party in the first place . bildunterschrift : not happy with hartz iv the reforms , which were put in place by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government , were meant to tackle unemployment , spur job creation and ease the strain on germany 's severely burdened state coffers .
but to the left party , which balked at the cuts in welfare payments for the long-term jobless , the reforms are nothing more than " legally decreed poverty . " the party 's economic ideas include raising corporate taxes , which schröder had lowered , shortening the work week , establishing a minimum wage of 1,400 euros -lrb- $ 1,708 -rrb- a month , bringing back a tax on stock market transactions , raising inheritance and gift taxes and reintroducing a wealth tax . the party would increase welfare payments and government subsidies , financing it all with what it says are the 65 billion euros it would take in through the new taxes . roll back reforms all in all , it would overturn most of the reforms that schröder 's social democratic-green coalition put into place over the past seven years .
it is also the stuff that gives economists and business leaders nightmares , since they say it has no place in the world of 21st century economics . " we live in a globalized world , " said winfried fuest , an analyst at the cologne institute for business research .
" with those kinds of suggestions put into place , we would no longer be competitive .
it ’ s a backwards-looking policy that economically is completely mistaken . " bildunterschrift : " we 're hiring for .. " says the sign , but there 's nothing underneath to complete the sentence . they say increasing the tax burden on corporations would weaken domestic and foreign investment in germany and make an already expensive labor force even pricier .
that could increase the number of firms who move production abroad because of lower wage costs and dissuade new or foreign firms from setting up shop in germany .
that , in turn , would increase unemployment and drive up the costs of germany ’ s already expensive welfare system . " we need growth , that is what will bring us jobs , " said rene hagemann-miksits , spokesperson for the bdi industry association .
" and it 's very clear that the -lrb- left party -rrb- program will do nothing to provide that . " his group has released a statement detailing the left party 's plans , concluding by saying " such a program would be fatal if it ever were realized as economic policy . " same old neo-liberal story ? but for the left party 's ihme , such talk is merely political posturing by groups interested more in defending their own interests than looking after the common welfare of the population . " those are standard arguments that we 've heard for years , " he said .
" if you lower non-wage costs , then jobs will be created .
well , we 've had two legislative periods to try that , and it has n't happened . "
now is the time to do something new , he added . he admits that the program , no matter how well the party does in the sept .
18 vote , will likely not be put into practice 100 percent .
but that it could help influence the debate and help shift economic policy from its current less-regulated course . according to financial analyst fuest , it 's already done that .
according to him , the success of the party in opinion polls has already made the bigger parties nervous and they are already backing away from some of the previous pro-reform stances they had .
the spd added a wealth tax to its party platform , bowing to the strong political wind .
even the conservative cdu , which is largely expected to come out on top in september , has toned down talk of bitter , but necessary medicine for germany . " the cdu has become very cautious when it comes to announcing further painful reforms , " he said .

the southern german state of bavaria went into a state of uproar as rumors begin to circulate that european bureaucrats would ban low-neckline dresses in beer gardens to protect the waitresses from the sun . the bavarians can finally breathe a collective sigh of relief because now they know that nobody is going to mess with their beloved dirndl - the traditional bavarian dress that accentuates the upper part of the female body with a revealing neckline .
only yesterday , however , the dirndl as we know it , seemed to be on the brink of extinction , and proud bavarians ready to declare a cultural war on brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : proud to wear a dirndl : german starlet verona pooth née feldbusch during oktoberfest in munich after the european parliament passed a directive to protect employees from optical radiation , including sunlight , the bavarians started worrying that petty bureaucrats from brussels would start meddling into their private affairs , crippling the time-honored bavarian sense for fun and seriously limiting the freedom of expression of those friendly and well-muscled beer garden waitresses . state of shock a newspaper from munich described the eu initiative as the outright " cleavage ban . "
the mayor of munich , christian ude , warned of " european legal perfectionism " and threatened never to enter a beer garden again if he were not to be greeted by plunging necklines . " the dirndl is an integral part of bavarian culture and joy of living - a culture that many are jealous of , " said frank-ulrich john , the spokesperson for the bavarian association of hotels and inns . " i have spoken with many servers , and i have never heard that a sunburn in the cleavage area has been a problem , " john said . munich is no brussels according to john , eu citizens are more mature than eu bureaucrats think . " i could imagine a buttoned-up waitress with a sunshade , but only in brussels , " john added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the beer garden is a bavarian social institution of utmost importance the eu representative in bavaria , paul-joachim kubosch , however , assured the beer garden fans that there was no need for the neckline scare , since the european directive on optical radiation would only concern high-risk professions , which does not include beer garden servers . so it seems that the dirndl is safe , after all , and , along with it , the bavarian sense of friendliness and cheerful openness to the world . which is probably a good enough reason to hit the first beer garden and celebrate . beer , anyone ? dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " click here for a selection of best stories from dw-world 's " and finally ...

made up of the successors to east germany 's communist party , the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , and disaffected left-wingers who split off from the social democrats , the election alternative for jobs and social justice , the left party has attracted surprising support with its message of wealth redistribution , bigger government and offers of more for everyone , except the capitalists . one and a half months before possible early elections in september , the new party is polling 12 percent nationwide .
in eastern germany , it has the support of a stunning 33 percent of the population , according to a poll conducted last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gregor gysi " we need a new culture , " gregor gysi , the former charismatic leader of the pds who is now heading the left party campaign , said in an interview .
" we need wage increases .
we have to see social costs as something positive , and taxes have to be fair . " that means , the well-off should pay more of them , according to the economic platform that the party has released .
it says its suggestions will restore balance and justice to a german economy which has been thrown out of kilter by seven years of neo-liberal policies and which is structured to benefit only the rich . " those who earn the most , they are given tax relief , and that ’ s not right , " said bernd ihme , a policy spokesman for the left party .
" we want to make clear that it 's possible through redistribution to change how money is spent and whom it benefits . " bigger government the list of changes the party wants to make to germany 's tax and welfare system is long .
first on the agenda is the scrapping of the unpopular hartz iv labor and welfare reforms , which were instrumental in triggering the formation of the party in the first place . bildunterschrift : not happy with hartz iv the reforms , which were put in place by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government , were meant to tackle unemployment , spur job creation and ease the strain on germany 's severely burdened state coffers .
but to the left party , which balked at the cuts in welfare payments for the long-term jobless , the reforms are nothing more than " legally decreed poverty . " the party 's economic ideas include raising corporate taxes , which schröder had lowered , shortening the work week , establishing a minimum wage of 1,400 euros -lrb- $ 1,708 -rrb- a month , bringing back a tax on stock market transactions , raising inheritance and gift taxes and reintroducing a wealth tax . the party would increase welfare payments and government subsidies , financing it all with what it says are the 65 billion euros it would take in through the new taxes . roll back reforms all in all , it would overturn most of the reforms that schröder 's social democratic-green coalition put into place over the past seven years .
it is also the stuff that gives economists and business leaders nightmares , since they say it has no place in the world of 21st century economics . " we live in a globalized world , " said winfried fuest , an analyst at the cologne institute for business research .
" with those kinds of suggestions put into place , we would no longer be competitive .
it ’ s a backwards-looking policy that economically is completely mistaken . " bildunterschrift : " we 're hiring for .. " says the sign , but there 's nothing underneath to complete the sentence . they say increasing the tax burden on corporations would weaken domestic and foreign investment in germany and make an already expensive labor force even pricier .
that could increase the number of firms who move production abroad because of lower wage costs and dissuade new or foreign firms from setting up shop in germany .
that , in turn , would increase unemployment and drive up the costs of germany ’ s already expensive welfare system . " we need growth , that is what will bring us jobs , " said rene hagemann-miksits , spokesperson for the bdi industry association .
" and it 's very clear that the -lrb- left party -rrb- program will do nothing to provide that . " his group has released a statement detailing the left party 's plans , concluding by saying " such a program would be fatal if it ever were realized as economic policy . " same old neo-liberal story ? but for the left party 's ihme , such talk is merely political posturing by groups interested more in defending their own interests than looking after the common welfare of the population . " those are standard arguments that we 've heard for years , " he said .
" if you lower non-wage costs , then jobs will be created .
well , we 've had two legislative periods to try that , and it has n't happened . "
now is the time to do something new , he added . he admits that the program , no matter how well the party does in the sept .
18 vote , will likely not be put into practice 100 percent .
but that it could help influence the debate and help shift economic policy from its current less-regulated course . according to financial analyst fuest , it 's already done that .
according to him , the success of the party in opinion polls has already made the bigger parties nervous and they are already backing away from some of the previous pro-reform stances they had .
the spd added a wealth tax to its party platform , bowing to the strong political wind .
even the conservative cdu , which is largely expected to come out on top in september , has toned down talk of bitter , but necessary medicine for germany . " the cdu has become very cautious when it comes to announcing further painful reforms , " he said .
" they ’ re just not saying much these days .

while conservative challenger angela merkel is too busy to appear in two tv debates , media-savvy chancellor schröder is even eager to go for a duel with himself .
the debate about the debate is heating up . chancellor schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- failed to reach an agreement saturday on the number of televised debates that the chancellor candidates would participate in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : broadcaster would like to see two tv debates citing a short campaign and a very busy schedule , cdu candidate angela merkel and a favorite to become germany 's next and first female chancellor has so far agreed on only one tv debate with her political rival .
schröder 's camp , on the other hand , is still pushing for two . the final decision regarding the format and number of debates will have to be made this week to give the broadcasters enough time to organize and schedule the events . a new meeting with german public and private broadcasters will take place on wednesday . schröder an experienced hand schröder 's spokesperson , bela anda , said monday it would be " strange " if angela merkel did not meet the expectations of the population .

while conservative challenger angela merkel is too busy to appear in two tv debates , media-savvy chancellor schröder is even eager to go for a duel with himself .
the debate about the debate is heating up . chancellor schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- failed to reach an agreement saturday on the number of televised debates that the chancellor candidates would participate in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : broadcaster would like to see two tv debates citing a short campaign and a very busy schedule , cdu candidate angela merkel and a favorite to become germany 's next and first female chancellor has so far agreed on only one tv debate with her political rival .
schröder 's camp , on the other hand , is still pushing for two . the final decision regarding the format and number of debates will have to be made this week to give the broadcasters enough time to organize and schedule the events . a new meeting with german public and private broadcasters will take place on wednesday . schröder an experienced hand schröder 's spokesperson , bela anda , said monday it would be " strange " if angela merkel did not meet the expectations of the population .

they have been requested by both public and private broadcasters , as well as the general public . however , television face-offs between the main chancellor candidates are relatively new in germany as opposed to the us .

the televised discussions saw schröder using his slick debating skills to boost his poll ratings and stage a comeback by outshining stoiber .
14,9 million viewers watched the first debate , and 15,2 tuned in to the second debate , including seven million viewers who had not seen the first one . some merkel allies fear that schröder could use the same tactic to narrow the poll lead of their candidate , an unassuming former scientist who often looks awkward on television .

" she says she ca n't remember how they were killed because she drank heavily when the contractions began , " prosecutor annette bargenda said at a news conference .
the mother is suspected of giving birth to each of the infants and then killing them one by one between 1988 and 2004 . the woman told police that in every instance , she had given birth to the children without any assistance or other people being there .
the father of the children , who divorced the woman earlier this year , did n't know that she was pregnant , the woman claims .
the couple also have three children aged 18 , 19 and 20 . the ex-husband , who was not named , is a professional who spent long periods away from home on business .

" you can take it for granted that a future government led by a christian democrat chancellor , would aspire to keep these good relations intact or improve them wherever needed , " she said . but merkel has been very critical of the way the german government under gerhard schröder has approached transatlantic relations . " i do n't understand why previously excellent relations with the united states had to worsen to the extent known to all of us just because of our good ties with other nations , " merkel said . friendship , but no servitude bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder won the 2002 re-election greatly thanks to his opposition to the us invasion of iraq chancellor schröder , on his part , made it clear that for him friendship did not equal total obedience .

cdu foreign policy spokesman friedbert pflüger is being viewed as the most likely candidate for this post . there had also been talk about angela merkel wanting to install a separate ministry for european affairs , but the latest reports say these plans are now off the table . either way , merkel 's plans are going to hurt the opposition liberal democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- as the cdu 's likely junior partner would claim the post of foreign minister .
it stands to reason that both a ministry for european affairs and a security advisor in the chancellery would leave the foreign ministry with considerably less power and influence . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel 's envoy lauds meeting with bush the cdu 's wolfgang schäuble went to the us to lay out the basis of his party 's foreign policy in the case of a conservative election victory and got a welcome surprise - 45 minutes with the man himself , president bush .

spd presents election manifesto election 2005 -pipe- 02.08.2005 social justice or economic folly ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the redistribution of wealth is central to the left party 's plank the new hard-left grouping in germany , the left party , is sending tremors across the political landscape .
but , the party 's economic program has industry groups and economists shaking their heads , and worrying . it calls itself the left party , die linkspartei in german , and it 's making an already unusual election campaign even stranger .
made up of the successors to east germany 's communist party , the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , and disaffected left-wingers who split off from the social democrats , the election alternative for jobs and social justice , the left party has attracted surprising support with its message of wealth redistribution , bigger government and offers of more for everyone , except the capitalists . one and a half months before possible early elections in september , the new party is polling 12 percent nationwide .
in eastern germany , it has the support of a stunning 33 percent of the population , according to a poll conducted last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gregor gysi " we need a new culture , " gregor gysi , the former charismatic leader of the pds who is now heading the left party campaign , said in an interview .
" we need wage increases .
we have to see social costs as something positive , and taxes have to be fair . " that means , the well-off should pay more of them , according to the economic platform that the party has released .
it says its suggestions will restore balance and justice to a german economy which has been thrown out of kilter by seven years of neo-liberal policies and which is structured to benefit only the rich . " those who earn the most , they are given tax relief , and that ’ s not right , " said bernd ihme , a policy spokesman for the left party .
" we want to make clear that it 's possible through redistribution to change how money is spent and whom it benefits . " bigger government the list of changes the party wants to make to germany 's tax and welfare system is long .
first on the agenda is the scrapping of the unpopular hartz iv labor and welfare reforms , which were instrumental in triggering the formation of the party in the first place . bildunterschrift : not happy with hartz iv the reforms , which were put in place by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government , were meant to tackle unemployment , spur job creation and ease the strain on germany 's severely burdened state coffers .
but to the left party , which balked at the cuts in welfare payments for the long-term jobless , the reforms are nothing more than " legally decreed poverty . " the party 's economic ideas include raising corporate taxes , which schröder had lowered , shortening the work week , establishing a minimum wage of 1,400 euros -lrb- $ 1,708 -rrb- a month , bringing back a tax on stock market transactions , raising inheritance and gift taxes and reintroducing a wealth tax . the party would increase welfare payments and government subsidies , financing it all with what it says are the 65 billion euros it would take in through the new taxes . roll back reforms all in all , it would overturn most of the reforms that schröder 's social democratic-green coalition put into place over the past seven years .
it is also the stuff that gives economists and business leaders nightmares , since they say it has no place in the world of 21st century economics . " we live in a globalized world , " said winfried fuest , an analyst at the cologne institute for business research .
" with those kinds of suggestions put into place , we would no longer be competitive .
it ’ s a backwards-looking policy that economically is completely mistaken . " bildunterschrift : " we 're hiring for .. " says the sign , but there 's nothing underneath to complete the sentence . they say increasing the tax burden on corporations would weaken domestic and foreign investment in germany and make an already expensive labor force even pricier .
that could increase the number of firms who move production abroad because of lower wage costs and dissuade new or foreign firms from setting up shop in germany .
that , in turn , would increase unemployment and drive up the costs of germany ’ s already expensive welfare system . " we need growth , that is what will bring us jobs , " said rene hagemann-miksits , spokesperson for the bdi industry association .
" and it 's very clear that the -lrb- left party -rrb- program will do nothing to provide that . " his group has released a statement detailing the left party 's plans , concluding by saying " such a program would be fatal if it ever were realized as economic policy . " same old neo-liberal story ? but for the left party 's ihme , such talk is merely political posturing by groups interested more in defending their own interests than looking after the common welfare of the population . " those are standard arguments that we 've heard for years , " he said .
" if you lower non-wage costs , then jobs will be created .
well , we 've had two legislative periods to try that , and it has n't happened . "
now is the time to do something new , he added . he admits that the program , no matter how well the party does in the sept .
18 vote , will likely not be put into practice 100 percent .
but that it could help influence the debate and help shift economic policy from its current less-regulated course . according to financial analyst fuest , it 's already done that .
according to him , the success of the party in opinion polls has already made the bigger parties nervous and they are already backing away from some of the previous pro-reform stances they had .
the spd added a wealth tax to its party platform , bowing to the strong political wind .
even the conservative cdu , which is largely expected to come out on top in september , has toned down talk of bitter , but necessary medicine for germany . " the cdu has become very cautious when it comes to announcing further painful reforms , " he said .
" they ’ re just not saying much these days .

on monday , 1,400 doctors took to the streets in two states to kick off the weeklong action . the pain threshold for young doctors in german hospitals has been reached .
on monday in the states of baden-württemberg and hesse , over 1,400 physicians hung up their stethoscopes on the office door and hit the streets to protest poor working conditions .
the banners the doctors carried sent a clear signal to hospitals , particularly state-run facilities , around the country : " better pay for better work " and " england pays twice as much . "
on the first day of weeklong protests that will culminate on friday in berlin with a " national day of protest , " leaders from the marburger bund doctors ' union are looking to raise the awareness of the plight of german doctors compared to their peers abroad .
overtime without compensation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : physicians of frankfurt 's university hospital protest against their working conditions .
the banner reads " money away , doctor away . "
in a country where many laborers receive extra compensation for working overtime , at night or under dangerous conditions , the doctors seem to have a point .
the marburger bund said that some 146,000 hospital doctors perform 50 million hours of overtime each year , most of them without extra compensation , and that germany trailed far behind comparable nations in physicians ' salaries .
the chairman of the union , frank ulrich montgomery , said the budget cuts at university clinics were equal to " state-supported robbery of wages . "
the doctors say they have been forced to bear the brunt of budget cutbacks at public health institutions , seeing their christmas and vacation bonuses slashed while working hours increase .
" as long as french , british and american colleagues earn two or three times as much , nothing will stop the flight of doctors abroad and the shortage of physicians , " said montgomery . particularly disturbing to the union was the grave discrepancy between young assistant doctors and head physicians .
27-year-olds fresh out of college begin with a take-home pay of around 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,000 -rrb- per month .
their superiors , frequently with managerial duties , earn up to 12 times that amount .
the system is at fault bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overtime is frequently left unpaid in german hospitals while the younger physicians have taken to the streets demanding fairer work schedules and more pay , others say it is the system that doctors created for themselves that is at fault .
" the union leaders ca n't come up with a better idea than to demand more pay , " criticized kurt lauterbach .
the health care economist points out that the two-tier health care system , where little money can be earned with public health plan patients and a lot with private patients , leads to young doctors receiving poor wages .
" this system is unjust and must be revamped , " lauterbach declared .
this must also be done in the interest of german patients .
young doctors are taking their abilities to other countries where they know the rewards are greater .
according to the latest figures from the doctors ' union , around 6,000 positions remain unfilled at german hospitals .
the same number are registered abroad .
one area where all parties concerned agree , is the amount of time that german physicians spend mired in medical bureaucratic procedures .

on monday , 1,400 doctors took to the streets in two states to kick off the weeklong action . the pain threshold for young doctors in german hospitals has been reached .
on monday in the states of baden-württemberg and hesse , over 1,400 physicians hung up their stethoscopes on the office door and hit the streets to protest poor working conditions .
the banners the doctors carried sent a clear signal to hospitals , particularly state-run facilities , around the country : " better pay for better work " and " england pays twice as much . "

the marburger bund said that some 146,000 hospital doctors perform 50 million hours of overtime each year , most of them without extra compensation , and that germany trailed far behind comparable nations in physicians ' salaries .

economy set to dominate german election the world according to merkel germany 's long road to multiculturalism election 2005 -pipe- 02.08.2005 energy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carrying conventional or renewable energy ?
oil and gas are scarce resources .
politicians have vastly different ideas when it comes to meeting growing energy demand . spd the spd plans to invest 20 billion euros -lrb- $ 24.5 billion -rrb- in renewable energy by 2010 with the goal of making germany the global market leader in the solar and wind power industries .
the party remains committed to the agreed on subsidies for phasing out coal production as well as nuclear energy .
the energy supply should come from climate-friendly ' clean coal ' plants , natural gas , biomass , and a mix of various renewable energy sources . cdu / csu the cdu and csu envision an energy supply from a diverse array of sources : oil , coal , gas , nuclear as well as biomass , hydro , wind , and solar energy .
regenerative energies should make up at least 12.5 percent of the energy supply , but should receive fewer subsidies than in the past .
the german nuclear power plants should be allowed to continue operation longer than currently intended . the greens the greens want to disembark from the nuclear age and move away from crude oil .
energy should increasingly come from solar , wind , hydro , biomass and geothermal generating plants .
the goal for 2020 is to produce a full quarter of the present energy supply , heating demand , fuel consumption , and goods of the petrochemical industry , respectively , from renewable energies and renewable primary products .
the coal subsidies should be reduced and completely eliminated by 2012 .
greenhouse gas emissions should be cut by 40 percent of their 1990 levels by 2020 ; the eu stipulates only a 30 percent reduction .
the greens clearly have the longest resume with legislation for environmental and consumer protection . fdp the free democratic party wants to slash subsidies , whether for hard coal power plants or for renewable energies .
the european electricity and gas markets should be more fully liberalized .
market regulation should only be oriented to increasing competitiveness , demands the fdp .
as with the christian union , the party is bent on atomic energy . the left party the left party is calling for a " rapid departure from nuclear energy . "
by 2050 the left party wants to see germany 's entire energy supply coming from renewables . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a rebirth for german nuclear energy ?
the prospect of victory by germany 's conservative opposition in an early general election has shaken up the country 's energy sector .
the nuclear power industry is hoping to slow the planned phase out atomic energy .

the southern german state of bavaria went into a state of uproar as rumors begin to circulate that european bureaucrats would ban low-neckline dresses in beer gardens to protect the waitresses from the sun . the bavarians can finally breathe a collective sigh of relief because now they know that nobody is going to mess with their beloved dirndl - the traditional bavarian dress that accentuates the upper part of the female body with a revealing neckline .

"
the mayor of munich , christian ude , warned of " european legal perfectionism " and threatened never to enter a beer garden again if he were not to be greeted by plunging necklines . " the dirndl is an integral part of bavarian culture and joy of living - a culture that many are jealous of , " said frank-ulrich john , the spokesperson for the bavarian association of hotels and inns . " i have spoken with many servers , and i have never heard that a sunburn in the cleavage area has been a problem , " john said . munich is no brussels according to john , eu citizens are more mature than eu bureaucrats think . " i could imagine a buttoned-up waitress with a sunshade , but only in brussels , " john added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the beer garden is a bavarian social institution of utmost importance the eu representative in bavaria , paul-joachim kubosch , however , assured the beer garden fans that there was no need for the neckline scare , since the european directive on optical radiation would only concern high-risk professions , which does not include beer garden servers . so it seems that the dirndl is safe , after all , and , along with it , the bavarian sense of friendliness and cheerful openness to the world . which is probably a good enough reason to hit the first beer garden and celebrate . beer , anyone ? dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " click here for a selection of best stories from dw-world 's " and finally ...

" you can take it for granted that a future government led by a christian democrat chancellor , would aspire to keep these good relations intact or improve them wherever needed , " she said . but merkel has been very critical of the way the german government under gerhard schröder has approached transatlantic relations . " i do n't understand why previously excellent relations with the united states had to worsen to the extent known to all of us just because of our good ties with other nations , " merkel said . friendship , but no servitude bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder won the 2002 re-election greatly thanks to his opposition to the us invasion of iraq chancellor schröder , on his part , made it clear that for him friendship did not equal total obedience .

" it 's never been our idea to say yes to everything that comes our way , and we 're not planning to change this in future either . " merkel keeps stressing that loyalty in the transatlantic alliance is a great virtue .

in order to gain more direct influence on important foreign policy issues , she 's planning to have a security advisor at her side in the chancellery .
cdu foreign policy spokesman friedbert pflüger is being viewed as the most likely candidate for this post . there had also been talk about angela merkel wanting to install a separate ministry for european affairs , but the latest reports say these plans are now off the table . either way , merkel 's plans are going to hurt the opposition liberal democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- as the cdu 's likely junior partner would claim the post of foreign minister .
it stands to reason that both a ministry for european affairs and a security advisor in the chancellery would leave the foreign ministry with considerably less power and influence . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel 's envoy lauds meeting with bush the cdu 's wolfgang schäuble went to the us to lay out the basis of his party 's foreign policy in the case of a conservative election victory and got a welcome surprise - 45 minutes with the man himself , president bush .

spd presents election manifesto election 2005 -pipe- 02.08.2005 social justice or economic folly ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the redistribution of wealth is central to the left party 's plank the new hard-left grouping in germany , the left party , is sending tremors across the political landscape .
but , the party 's economic program has industry groups and economists shaking their heads , and worrying . it calls itself the left party , die linkspartei in german , and it 's making an already unusual election campaign even stranger .
made up of the successors to east germany 's communist party , the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , and disaffected left-wingers who split off from the social democrats , the election alternative for jobs and social justice , the left party has attracted surprising support with its message of wealth redistribution , bigger government and offers of more for everyone , except the capitalists . one and a half months before possible early elections in september , the new party is polling 12 percent nationwide .
in eastern germany , it has the support of a stunning 33 percent of the population , according to a poll conducted last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gregor gysi " we need a new culture , " gregor gysi , the former charismatic leader of the pds who is now heading the left party campaign , said in an interview .
" we need wage increases .
we have to see social costs as something positive , and taxes have to be fair . " that means , the well-off should pay more of them , according to the economic platform that the party has released .
it says its suggestions will restore balance and justice to a german economy which has been thrown out of kilter by seven years of neo-liberal policies and which is structured to benefit only the rich . " those who earn the most , they are given tax relief , and that ’ s not right , " said bernd ihme , a policy spokesman for the left party .
" we want to make clear that it 's possible through redistribution to change how money is spent and whom it benefits . " bigger government the list of changes the party wants to make to germany 's tax and welfare system is long .
first on the agenda is the scrapping of the unpopular hartz iv labor and welfare reforms , which were instrumental in triggering the formation of the party in the first place . bildunterschrift : not happy with hartz iv the reforms , which were put in place by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government , were meant to tackle unemployment , spur job creation and ease the strain on germany 's severely burdened state coffers .
but to the left party , which balked at the cuts in welfare payments for the long-term jobless , the reforms are nothing more than " legally decreed poverty . " the party 's economic ideas include raising corporate taxes , which schröder had lowered , shortening the work week , establishing a minimum wage of 1,400 euros -lrb- $ 1,708 -rrb- a month , bringing back a tax on stock market transactions , raising inheritance and gift taxes and reintroducing a wealth tax . the party would increase welfare payments and government subsidies , financing it all with what it says are the 65 billion euros it would take in through the new taxes . roll back reforms all in all , it would overturn most of the reforms that schröder 's social democratic-green coalition put into place over the past seven years .
it is also the stuff that gives economists and business leaders nightmares , since they say it has no place in the world of 21st century economics . " we live in a globalized world , " said winfried fuest , an analyst at the cologne institute for business research .
" with those kinds of suggestions put into place , we would no longer be competitive .
it ’ s a backwards-looking policy that economically is completely mistaken . " bildunterschrift : " we 're hiring for .. " says the sign , but there 's nothing underneath to complete the sentence . they say increasing the tax burden on corporations would weaken domestic and foreign investment in germany and make an already expensive labor force even pricier .
that could increase the number of firms who move production abroad because of lower wage costs and dissuade new or foreign firms from setting up shop in germany .
that , in turn , would increase unemployment and drive up the costs of germany ’ s already expensive welfare system . " we need growth , that is what will bring us jobs , " said rene hagemann-miksits , spokesperson for the bdi industry association .
" and it 's very clear that the -lrb- left party -rrb- program will do nothing to provide that . " his group has released a statement detailing the left party 's plans , concluding by saying " such a program would be fatal if it ever were realized as economic policy . " same old neo-liberal story ? but for the left party 's ihme , such talk is merely political posturing by groups interested more in defending their own interests than looking after the common welfare of the population . " those are standard arguments that we 've heard for years , " he said .
" if you lower non-wage costs , then jobs will be created .
well , we 've had two legislative periods to try that , and it has n't happened . "
now is the time to do something new , he added . he admits that the program , no matter how well the party does in the sept .
18 vote , will likely not be put into practice 100 percent .
but that it could help influence the debate and help shift economic policy from its current less-regulated course . according to financial analyst fuest , it 's already done that .
according to him , the success of the party in opinion polls has already made the bigger parties nervous and they are already backing away from some of the previous pro-reform stances they had .
the spd added a wealth tax to its party platform , bowing to the strong political wind .
even the conservative cdu , which is largely expected to come out on top in september , has toned down talk of bitter , but necessary medicine for germany . " the cdu has become very cautious when it comes to announcing further painful reforms , " he said .
" they ’ re just not saying much these days .

well , you 're not alone .
here , dw-world offers an easy guide to some of the technical terms which may feature in the coming action . offsides : when the player with the ball on the attacking team passes the ball to a teammate closer to the goal line than the opposing team .
in other words , there is no defending player between the guy who receives the pass and the goalie .
if the teammate is level or slightly behind the defending player , it is not offside .
new rules also state that a player can be offside at the point when he receives the ball .
complicated , but true .
offsides is also the most basic element of any sort of " women do n't understand football " joke .
free kick : a kick that is awarded by the referee after a foul .
the kicks can be either direct , or indirect .
a direct kick is awarded for particularly serious fouls , like a hard tackle , tripping , or a hand ball .
the direct kick means a ball can be kicked directly into the goal .
an indirect kick needs to touch another player before going into the goal .
lesser fouls like tripping , or a high kick near an opponent 's head typically earn indirect free kicks .
penalty kick : when a defender or a goalie fouls an opponent in their own penalty box .
the referee then awards a penalty kick , which is taken from a spot 12 yards from the goal line in the penalty box .
anyone on the team that has taken the foul can take the penalty kick , which pits the attacker against the goalie .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese for " football " throw-in : a throw-in is awarded when the opposing team causes the ball to go out of bounds over one of the sidelines .
the player throwing the ball must do so with both hands , over his head and with both feet firmly on or inside the sideline .
a goal may not be scored on a throw-in , unless it touches another player .
corner kick : a corner is awarded when the ball goes out of bounds behind the end line and was last touched by the defending team .
the attacking team kicks it inbounds from either one of the corner arcs .
the defending team needs to be at least 10 yards away from the corner arcs .
cross : when philipp lahm smacks a beautifully struck ball from the wings right onto the foot of his striker , and defensive players are left paralyzed in their positions , that 's a cross .
penalty box : measures 18 yards from the goal line and 44 yards wide .
while in the penalty box , the goalie may touch the ball with his hands .
the goalie has six seconds after he has picked up the ball to either throw or kick it out of the penalty box .
in matches where one team desperately needs a goal , the penalty area can play host to some of soccer 's more theatrical performances as players look for a penalty kick .
favourites include " being shot by a sniper " and " olympic freestyle diver " .
bildunterschrift : that 'll be a goal then ...
goal : the goal measures 8 yards wide and 8 feet tall .
this is oliver kahn 's domain .
a goal counts when the ball has completely crossed the goal line .
goal kick : when the ball crosses the end line -lrb- goal line -rrb- and was last touched by the attacking team .
the defending team can set the ball up anywhere within their goal box and kick it out .
the ball must exit the penalty box before it can be touched by either team .
regulation time : each half lasts 45 minutes .
the clock ticks without stopping throughout the entire half .
at the end , stoppage time is often awarded if the referee has taken note of stoppages in play due to injury or incident .
substitutes : a list of possible substitutes must be handed to the referee before the game .
one team can only make a total of three substitutes plus the goalkeeper in each game .
this includes overtime , when the players are huffing around on their last legs , about to pass out .
technical area : the technical area extends 1 meter -lrb- 1 yard -rrb- on either side of the designated seated area and extends forward up to a distance of 1 meter from the touch line .
this is the area in which the coach is allowed to pace nervously , bellow instructions , shout abuse , issue instructions to players and jig with joy .
the technical area also acts as a protective shield for match officials who are more often than not the target of manager 's ire .
if the coach / manager strays from the area in an attempt to harangue referee or lineman , he can be cautioned and , in extreme situations , " sent off " to watch the rest of the match from the stands or on television in the changing room .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : referees : the men in black , or now more often than not in green , yellow or red , who have final say on player conduct during the game .
with the referee are two assistants , who patrol the sidelines and call offsides , which team gets a corner kick or throw-in and notify the head referee of substitutions .
foul : an illegal action intended to sway advantage to one 's team .
this could range from the felling of an opposing player in an attacking situation to a deliberate hand ball which prevents the opposition gaining possession .
a professional foul - one which is deemed to be premeditated or physically dangerous - can result in an instant dismissal .
others can be dealt with at the referee 's discretion .
stoppage time : time added at the end of regulation time for penalties , injuries , substitutions , or when players whine about a foul or any sort of injustice done to them .
typically around 3 minutes .
yellow card : one of two cards that can be pulled by the referee on a player for fouls ranging from unsporting behavior , to trash-talking the ref , delaying the restart of play , etc .
a direct or indirect kick is always awarded .
two yellow cards in one game equal a red card and the player is immediately sent off the field and has to miss the next match .
red card : awarded by a referee when a foul has been particularly brutal , or the player spits , hits , curses , etc at another player or the referee .
the player carded is immediately sent off and , depending on the severity of the foul , can be suspended for one or many games at the discretion of the dfb disciplinary panel . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic audios and videos on the topic fans ' most hated soccer rules .

well , you 're not alone .
here , dw-world offers an easy guide to some of the technical terms which may feature in the coming action . offsides : when the player with the ball on the attacking team passes the ball to a teammate closer to the goal line than the opposing team .
in other words , there is no defending player between the guy who receives the pass and the goalie .
if the teammate is level or slightly behind the defending player , it is not offside .
new rules also state that a player can be offside at the point when he receives the ball .
complicated , but true .
offsides is also the most basic element of any sort of " women do n't understand football " joke .
free kick : a kick that is awarded by the referee after a foul .
the kicks can be either direct , or indirect .
a direct kick is awarded for particularly serious fouls , like a hard tackle , tripping , or a hand ball .
the direct kick means a ball can be kicked directly into the goal .
an indirect kick needs to touch another player before going into the goal .
lesser fouls like tripping , or a high kick near an opponent 's head typically earn indirect free kicks .
penalty kick : when a defender or a goalie fouls an opponent in their own penalty box .
the referee then awards a penalty kick , which is taken from a spot 12 yards from the goal line in the penalty box .
anyone on the team that has taken the foul can take the penalty kick , which pits the attacker against the goalie .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese for " football " throw-in : a throw-in is awarded when the opposing team causes the ball to go out of bounds over one of the sidelines .
the player throwing the ball must do so with both hands , over his head and with both feet firmly on or inside the sideline .
a goal may not be scored on a throw-in , unless it touches another player .
corner kick : a corner is awarded when the ball goes out of bounds behind the end line and was last touched by the defending team .
the attacking team kicks it inbounds from either one of the corner arcs .
the defending team needs to be at least 10 yards away from the corner arcs .
cross : when philipp lahm smacks a beautifully struck ball from the wings right onto the foot of his striker , and defensive players are left paralyzed in their positions , that 's a cross .
penalty box : measures 18 yards from the goal line and 44 yards wide .
while in the penalty box , the goalie may touch the ball with his hands .
the goalie has six seconds after he has picked up the ball to either throw or kick it out of the penalty box .
in matches where one team desperately needs a goal , the penalty area can play host to some of soccer 's more theatrical performances as players look for a penalty kick .
favourites include " being shot by a sniper " and " olympic freestyle diver " .
bildunterschrift : that 'll be a goal then ...
goal : the goal measures 8 yards wide and 8 feet tall .
this is oliver kahn 's domain .
a goal counts when the ball has completely crossed the goal line .
goal kick : when the ball crosses the end line -lrb- goal line -rrb- and was last touched by the attacking team .
the defending team can set the ball up anywhere within their goal box and kick it out .
the ball must exit the penalty box before it can be touched by either team .
regulation time : each half lasts 45 minutes .
the clock ticks without stopping throughout the entire half .
at the end , stoppage time is often awarded if the referee has taken note of stoppages in play due to injury or incident .
substitutes : a list of possible substitutes must be handed to the referee before the game .
one team can only make a total of three substitutes plus the goalkeeper in each game .
this includes overtime , when the players are huffing around on their last legs , about to pass out .
technical area : the technical area extends 1 meter -lrb- 1 yard -rrb- on either side of the designated seated area and extends forward up to a distance of 1 meter from the touch line .
this is the area in which the coach is allowed to pace nervously , bellow instructions , shout abuse , issue instructions to players and jig with joy .
the technical area also acts as a protective shield for match officials who are more often than not the target of manager 's ire .

well , you 're not alone .
here , dw-world offers an easy guide to some of the technical terms which may feature in the coming action . offsides : when the player with the ball on the attacking team passes the ball to a teammate closer to the goal line than the opposing team .
in other words , there is no defending player between the guy who receives the pass and the goalie .
if the teammate is level or slightly behind the defending player , it is not offside .
new rules also state that a player can be offside at the point when he receives the ball .
complicated , but true .
offsides is also the most basic element of any sort of " women do n't understand football " joke .
free kick : a kick that is awarded by the referee after a foul .
the kicks can be either direct , or indirect .
a direct kick is awarded for particularly serious fouls , like a hard tackle , tripping , or a hand ball .
the direct kick means a ball can be kicked directly into the goal .
an indirect kick needs to touch another player before going into the goal .
lesser fouls like tripping , or a high kick near an opponent 's head typically earn indirect free kicks .
penalty kick : when a defender or a goalie fouls an opponent in their own penalty box .
the referee then awards a penalty kick , which is taken from a spot 12 yards from the goal line in the penalty box .
anyone on the team that has taken the foul can take the penalty kick , which pits the attacker against the goalie .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese for " football " throw-in : a throw-in is awarded when the opposing team causes the ball to go out of bounds over one of the sidelines .
the player throwing the ball must do so with both hands , over his head and with both feet firmly on or inside the sideline .
a goal may not be scored on a throw-in , unless it touches another player .
corner kick : a corner is awarded when the ball goes out of bounds behind the end line and was last touched by the defending team .
the attacking team kicks it inbounds from either one of the corner arcs .
the defending team needs to be at least 10 yards away from the corner arcs .
cross : when philipp lahm smacks a beautifully struck ball from the wings right onto the foot of his striker , and defensive players are left paralyzed in their positions , that 's a cross .
penalty box : measures 18 yards from the goal line and 44 yards wide .
while in the penalty box , the goalie may touch the ball with his hands .
the goalie has six seconds after he has picked up the ball to either throw or kick it out of the penalty box .
in matches where one team desperately needs a goal , the penalty area can play host to some of soccer 's more theatrical performances as players look for a penalty kick .
favourites include " being shot by a sniper " and " olympic freestyle diver " .
bildunterschrift : that 'll be a goal then ...
goal : the goal measures 8 yards wide and 8 feet tall .
this is oliver kahn 's domain .
a goal counts when the ball has completely crossed the goal line .
goal kick : when the ball crosses the end line -lrb- goal line -rrb- and was last touched by the attacking team .
the defending team can set the ball up anywhere within their goal box and kick it out .
the ball must exit the penalty box before it can be touched by either team .
regulation time : each half lasts 45 minutes .
the clock ticks without stopping throughout the entire half .
at the end , stoppage time is often awarded if the referee has taken note of stoppages in play due to injury or incident .
substitutes : a list of possible substitutes must be handed to the referee before the game .
one team can only make a total of three substitutes plus the goalkeeper in each game .
this includes overtime , when the players are huffing around on their last legs , about to pass out .
technical area : the technical area extends 1 meter -lrb- 1 yard -rrb- on either side of the designated seated area and extends forward up to a distance of 1 meter from the touch line .
this is the area in which the coach is allowed to pace nervously , bellow instructions , shout abuse , issue instructions to players and jig with joy .
the technical area also acts as a protective shield for match officials who are more often than not the target of manager 's ire .

well , you 're not alone .
here , dw-world offers an easy guide to some of the technical terms which may feature in the coming action . offsides : when the player with the ball on the attacking team passes the ball to a teammate closer to the goal line than the opposing team .
in other words , there is no defending player between the guy who receives the pass and the goalie .
if the teammate is level or slightly behind the defending player , it is not offside .
new rules also state that a player can be offside at the point when he receives the ball .
complicated , but true .
offsides is also the most basic element of any sort of " women do n't understand football " joke .
free kick : a kick that is awarded by the referee after a foul .
the kicks can be either direct , or indirect .
a direct kick is awarded for particularly serious fouls , like a hard tackle , tripping , or a hand ball .
the direct kick means a ball can be kicked directly into the goal .
an indirect kick needs to touch another player before going into the goal .
lesser fouls like tripping , or a high kick near an opponent 's head typically earn indirect free kicks .
penalty kick : when a defender or a goalie fouls an opponent in their own penalty box .
the referee then awards a penalty kick , which is taken from a spot 12 yards from the goal line in the penalty box .
anyone on the team that has taken the foul can take the penalty kick , which pits the attacker against the goalie .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese for " football " throw-in : a throw-in is awarded when the opposing team causes the ball to go out of bounds over one of the sidelines .
the player throwing the ball must do so with both hands , over his head and with both feet firmly on or inside the sideline .
a goal may not be scored on a throw-in , unless it touches another player .
corner kick : a corner is awarded when the ball goes out of bounds behind the end line and was last touched by the defending team .
the attacking team kicks it inbounds from either one of the corner arcs .
the defending team needs to be at least 10 yards away from the corner arcs .
cross : when philipp lahm smacks a beautifully struck ball from the wings right onto the foot of his striker , and defensive players are left paralyzed in their positions , that 's a cross .
penalty box : measures 18 yards from the goal line and 44 yards wide .
while in the penalty box , the goalie may touch the ball with his hands .
the goalie has six seconds after he has picked up the ball to either throw or kick it out of the penalty box .
in matches where one team desperately needs a goal , the penalty area can play host to some of soccer 's more theatrical performances as players look for a penalty kick .
favourites include " being shot by a sniper " and " olympic freestyle diver " .
bildunterschrift : that 'll be a goal then ...
goal : the goal measures 8 yards wide and 8 feet tall .
this is oliver kahn 's domain .
a goal counts when the ball has completely crossed the goal line .
goal kick : when the ball crosses the end line -lrb- goal line -rrb- and was last touched by the attacking team .
the defending team can set the ball up anywhere within their goal box and kick it out .
the ball must exit the penalty box before it can be touched by either team .
regulation time : each half lasts 45 minutes .
the clock ticks without stopping throughout the entire half .
at the end , stoppage time is often awarded if the referee has taken note of stoppages in play due to injury or incident .
substitutes : a list of possible substitutes must be handed to the referee before the game .
one team can only make a total of three substitutes plus the goalkeeper in each game .
this includes overtime , when the players are huffing around on their last legs , about to pass out .
technical area : the technical area extends 1 meter -lrb- 1 yard -rrb- on either side of the designated seated area and extends forward up to a distance of 1 meter from the touch line .
this is the area in which the coach is allowed to pace nervously , bellow instructions , shout abuse , issue instructions to players and jig with joy .
the technical area also acts as a protective shield for match officials who are more often than not the target of manager 's ire .
if the coach / manager strays from the area in an attempt to harangue referee or lineman , he can be cautioned and , in extreme situations , " sent off " to watch the rest of the match from the stands or on television in the changing room .

well , you 're not alone .
here , dw-world offers an easy guide to some of the technical terms which may feature in the coming action . offsides : when the player with the ball on the attacking team passes the ball to a teammate closer to the goal line than the opposing team .
in other words , there is no defending player between the guy who receives the pass and the goalie .
if the teammate is level or slightly behind the defending player , it is not offside .
new rules also state that a player can be offside at the point when he receives the ball .
complicated , but true .
offsides is also the most basic element of any sort of " women do n't understand football " joke .
free kick : a kick that is awarded by the referee after a foul .
the kicks can be either direct , or indirect .
a direct kick is awarded for particularly serious fouls , like a hard tackle , tripping , or a hand ball .
the direct kick means a ball can be kicked directly into the goal .
an indirect kick needs to touch another player before going into the goal .
lesser fouls like tripping , or a high kick near an opponent 's head typically earn indirect free kicks .
penalty kick : when a defender or a goalie fouls an opponent in their own penalty box .
the referee then awards a penalty kick , which is taken from a spot 12 yards from the goal line in the penalty box .
anyone on the team that has taken the foul can take the penalty kick , which pits the attacker against the goalie .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese for " football " throw-in : a throw-in is awarded when the opposing team causes the ball to go out of bounds over one of the sidelines .
the player throwing the ball must do so with both hands , over his head and with both feet firmly on or inside the sideline .
a goal may not be scored on a throw-in , unless it touches another player .
corner kick : a corner is awarded when the ball goes out of bounds behind the end line and was last touched by the defending team .
the attacking team kicks it inbounds from either one of the corner arcs .
the defending team needs to be at least 10 yards away from the corner arcs .
cross : when philipp lahm smacks a beautifully struck ball from the wings right onto the foot of his striker , and defensive players are left paralyzed in their positions , that 's a cross .
penalty box : measures 18 yards from the goal line and 44 yards wide .
while in the penalty box , the goalie may touch the ball with his hands .
the goalie has six seconds after he has picked up the ball to either throw or kick it out of the penalty box .
in matches where one team desperately needs a goal , the penalty area can play host to some of soccer 's more theatrical performances as players look for a penalty kick .
favourites include " being shot by a sniper " and " olympic freestyle diver " .
bildunterschrift : that 'll be a goal then ...
goal : the goal measures 8 yards wide and 8 feet tall .
this is oliver kahn 's domain .
a goal counts when the ball has completely crossed the goal line .
goal kick : when the ball crosses the end line -lrb- goal line -rrb- and was last touched by the attacking team .
the defending team can set the ball up anywhere within their goal box and kick it out .
the ball must exit the penalty box before it can be touched by either team .
regulation time : each half lasts 45 minutes .
the clock ticks without stopping throughout the entire half .
at the end , stoppage time is often awarded if the referee has taken note of stoppages in play due to injury or incident .
substitutes : a list of possible substitutes must be handed to the referee before the game .
one team can only make a total of three substitutes plus the goalkeeper in each game .
this includes overtime , when the players are huffing around on their last legs , about to pass out .
technical area : the technical area extends 1 meter -lrb- 1 yard -rrb- on either side of the designated seated area and extends forward up to a distance of 1 meter from the touch line .
this is the area in which the coach is allowed to pace nervously , bellow instructions , shout abuse , issue instructions to players and jig with joy .
the technical area also acts as a protective shield for match officials who are more often than not the target of manager 's ire .
if the coach / manager strays from the area in an attempt to harangue referee or lineman , he can be cautioned and , in extreme situations , " sent off " to watch the rest of the match from the stands or on television in the changing room .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : referees : the men in black , or now more often than not in green , yellow or red , who have final say on player conduct during the game .
with the referee are two assistants , who patrol the sidelines and call offsides , which team gets a corner kick or throw-in and notify the head referee of substitutions .
foul : an illegal action intended to sway advantage to one 's team .
this could range from the felling of an opposing player in an attacking situation to a deliberate hand ball which prevents the opposition gaining possession .
a professional foul - one which is deemed to be premeditated or physically dangerous - can result in an instant dismissal .
others can be dealt with at the referee 's discretion .
stoppage time : time added at the end of regulation time for penalties , injuries , substitutions , or when players whine about a foul or any sort of injustice done to them .
typically around 3 minutes .
yellow card : one of two cards that can be pulled by the referee on a player for fouls ranging from unsporting behavior , to trash-talking the ref , delaying the restart of play , etc .
a direct or indirect kick is always awarded .
two yellow cards in one game equal a red card and the player is immediately sent off the field and has to miss the next match .
red card : awarded by a referee when a foul has been particularly brutal , or the player spits , hits , curses , etc at another player or the referee .
the player carded is immediately sent off and , depending on the severity of the foul , can be suspended for one or many games at the discretion of the dfb disciplinary panel . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic audios and videos on the topic fans ' most hated soccer rules .

the doyen of jet set journalists , he was born in cairo , egypt , in 1925 , the son of a professional soldier .
he returned to the uk with his mother at the age of three following his father 's death , settling in hampstead , north london , and attending a nearby public school .
following in his father 's footsteps , he joined the british army as it advanced through italy at the end of world war ii - a period of his life he revisited in the channel 4 series whicker 's war .
" i lost a lot of friends , " he told the observer in 2004 .
" but you never think you might die .
you think you 're invulnerable .
that 's how you get through it . "
however , it was his stint as the editor of the british army newspaper that whetted his appetite for a future in journalism .
television icon the newspaper job was followed by a post as war correspondent in korea and as a reporter in the canal zone , egypt .
returning to london , he was lured from fleet street to the bbc in 1957 where he became a correspondent for the flagship current affairs show , tonight .
but it was whicker 's world that made him a television icon .
whicker 's world married travel and social commentary the show made the name whicker forever synonymous with a dapper british gent : bespectacled , moustachioed and , more often than not , immaculately dressed in a blazer and tie .
part travelogue , part social commentary , whicker 's world ran for more than three decades , becoming one of the most powerful brands in british broadcasting .
whicker 's natural ease with high society led to exclusive interviews with reclusive billionaire john paul getty and the sultan of brunei , among others .
he also introduced a world of armchair travellers to the mudmen of papua new guinea and the alaskan wilderness .
consummate charmer his outlandish adventures inspired a legendary monty python sketch about whicker island , a mythical place populated by alan look-alikes awaiting that " inevitable interview " .
his trademark nasal drawl , raised eyebrows and regular appearances on tv commercials sparked further accolades - not to mention the foundation of the alan whicker appreciation society .
whicker gained exclusive access to billionaire john paul getty a former judge on miss world , whicker remains a consummate charmer .
when asked what he would take to a desert island , he replied : " two blondes , two brunettes and two redheads . "
but whicker is also a serious journalist , and his interviews with the latin american dictators stroessner of paraguay and " papa doc " duvalier of haiti continue to be acclaimed by contemporary journalists .
credited with bringing interview techniques like walking to camera and cutaways to television , whicker has also been at the forefront of ground-breaking documentaries on us gun culture and plastic surgery .
the author of five books , he retired from full-time broadcasting in 1998 but has made a comeback of sorts recently in adverts for an internet travel booking firm .
whicker , who lives in jersey with his girlfriend of more than 30 years , valerie kleeman , was made a cbe in the new year honours .

it is on the edge of the city centre , before you come to the break made by the river irwell and the tracks through victoria station .
and on the edge of the area laid waste by the ira bomb of june 1996 .
" after the bomb we stood in the nave and the dust was an inch thick , " says the sub-dean , canon paul denby .
all the great windows on the south side had been destroyed , and some of the others .
now , both the area and the cathedral have risen again from the dust .
paul denby says he loves to leave the porch of the fifteenth-century building to be greeted by a typical english view - harvey nicks .
the bbc news website spent a day watching the business of faith and business of life meet .
1430 bst the tuesday afternoon rain is pounding down outside .
the nave - the widest cathedral nave in britain - is well filled .
the townswomen 's guild are putting on a summer concert .
they have raised thousands of pounds for tsunami victims , and during the concert the cheque is handed to the representative of save the children .
downstairs in the cathedral 's booth centre , a computer class is in progress for the clients - homeless or recently homeless , for the most part .
the atmosphere is cheerful and relaxed .
it is out of the rain and there is no pressure .
it 's all about " getting their self-esteem back up , " says centre worker kevin newell .
" people with problems look to their home and family - some of them have lost all that . "
in other words , they too are on the edge .
1600 bst vergers derrick may and ioan isaac-meurug are rearranging the chairs in the nave - a two-hour job or more for a major reorganisation .
the vergers are like " a platoon of godly bodyguards " says ex-soldier ioan .
on the pavements outside , skateboarders are sometimes a menace .
the approach of a verger in a black cassock will sometimes disperse them .
but the life of the streets touches the cathedral on every side .
" cleaning out one drain , " says ioan , " i found 16 needles . " 1630 bst the choir return , soaked , from a rehearsal for a concert at bridgewater hall , and soon they are wearing their red cassocks and rehearsing with organist and choirmaster chris stokes o god , make speed to save us .
o lord , make haste to help us .
the words of the prayer book , sung by the choir , seem to take off and fly into the depths of the old building .
the children in the choir , aged from eight to 13 , study at chetham 's school next door to the cathedral - some travel from as far as glossop , 15 miles away .
" they 're a great bunch , " says chris stokes .
they have to become expert in a huge range of music , but " they chomp through repertoire like mad . "
during term time they rarely get a day off - and , says chris stokes , " we look terribly carefully " for signs that any chorister is getting over tired .
1730 bst evensong ioan isaac-meurug , holding a staff of office , leads in the dean , ken riley , and the choir , now in white surplices .
choral evensong , says the order of service , " is one of the jewels that the church of england has contributed to the crown of christian worship . "
just eight members of the public make up the congregation - there are 14 boys and girls and six men in the choir , directed by chris stokes .
manchester cathedral if there were no congregation at all , the service would still go on - performing the required services each day is officially part of the opus dei -lrb- work of god -rrb- which a cathedral must carry out .
lighten our darkness , we beseech thee , o lord , and by thy great mercy defend us from all perils and dangers of this night - the dean prays .
all wisdom cometh from the lord sings the choir in the anthem which follows .
no day in the cathedral is quite like another , and after evensong the dean has to formally receive a bundle of the building 's archives , which have been sitting in ely cathedral for 340 years .
as he hands over the papers to cathedral archivist chris hunwick , he thanks the ely authorities " for their diligence in finding these documents belonging to manchester , which had obviously got lost in the post . "
the adults present enjoy the joke .
the boys and girls of the choir look on tolerantly .
after evensong , the gates are locked ; this is not bellringing night and there is no special service or concert .
at night , in the shadows of the old walls , small groups sit and drink .
but the bridgewater hall concert lies before the choir , and they will not be finished till after ten .
0745 bst rush-hour manchester roars and bustles , but deep inside the cathedral the work of god goes on quietly .
manchester cathedral the cathedral lies at the centre of a diocese of 2.8m people it became a collegiate church in 1421 and a cathedral in 1847 it was devastated by a german bomb in 1940 and by an ira bomb in 1996 last december , 30,000 attended services there are 15 full-time staff , as many part-timers and numerous volunteer workers escorted by head verger geoffrey robinson , canon paul denby celebrates matins .
he reads the psalm for the day - thanks be to the lord , for he hath shewed me marvellous great kindness in a strong city .
holy communion follows straight on , as paul denby moves to the high altar .
he prays for the g8 leaders , for the olympic candidate cities , for the chaplains of the manchester royal infirmary , for the diocese of rochester and the church in nigeria , and for a long list of people who are sick .
he and geoffrey robinson take the sacrament of bread and wine themselves , and serve it to the one other worshipper present .
solicitor david brindle is not at all put off by being a congregation of one , though he says there are often more .
0930 bst the booth centre opens again .
today there is an advice session -lrb- arranging identity papers is a common task -rrb- and sandwiches , hot drinks , fresh fruit and toiletries are available .
later there will be craftwork , and in the afternoon , crown green bowling .
and the drinking garden is open .
sixty per cent of those using the centre are street drinkers - which is tough in manchester , because street drinking is illegal .
the pub garden by the cathedral has sturdy little gates on it marked ' point of no return ' .
but you can drink in the award-winning cathedral garden , built and maintained by the clients of the booth centre themselves .
some of the visitors will not venture past the door of the centre itself but will go into the garden to drink - and the staff can get to know them and see if any look as if they need help .
1030 bst a trickle of visitors enter the cathedral .
there is plenty to see : the saxon sculpture of an angel , the carved " misericord " choir seats , and the pock-marked stones of the old tower , where a 19th-century redecoration scheme nearly brought the whole building down .
the lady whose task it is to welcome visitors points proudly to the selection of guides in different languages - french , spanish , german , italian , chinese , japanese - " it was either that or me going to night school , " she says .
1245 bst the turning of the leaves ten immaculately blazered old soldiers file into the chapel of the manchester regiment for the fortnightly ceremony of the books of remembrance .
each steps up to a book , bows and turns a page - so that each list of names of the fallen gets its turn on public view .
then they listen to a reading about the regiment 's 1914-18 pals ' battalions - the groups of friends who joined up together .
twenty-one battalions of them came from manchester , salford and oldham and over half died .
1310 holy communion taking the service , canon albert radcliffe notes that today is the feast of st john fisher and st thomas more .
two catholic reformation martyrs .
why ?
the church of england is a broad and tolerant church , he says .
in honouring these two who died for their beliefs , " we show we are stronger , bigger and broader than sectarian divisions . "
the youngest worshipper , richard mackintosh , is temping at the co-op nearby .
" i think it 's important to have a place where people come and receive the sacrament , " he says .
" it gives people a sense of continuity with christians in the past . "
" we welcome everybody , " says canon paul denby .
that is a constant theme .
staff at the booth centre say the same ; chris stokes says it about the choir .
of nearly 3,000 pupils on school visits last year , half were muslim , says cathedral education officer joanna booth .
" some said they did n't know they were allowed in . "
in fact everyone is allowed in - particularly if they are near the ' point of no return ' .

they have raised thousands of pounds for tsunami victims , and during the concert the cheque is handed to the representative of save the children .
computer class in the booth centre downstairs in the cathedral 's booth centre , a computer class is in progress for the clients - homeless or recently homeless , for the most part .
the atmosphere is cheerful and relaxed .
it is out of the rain and there is no pressure .
it 's all about " getting their self-esteem back up , " says centre worker kevin newell .
" people with problems look to their home and family - some of them have lost all that . "
in other words , they too are on the edge .
1600 bst vergers derrick may and ioan isaac-meurug are rearranging the chairs in the nave - a two-hour job or more for a major reorganisation .
the vergers are like " a platoon of godly bodyguards " says ex-soldier ioan .
on the pavements outside , skateboarders are sometimes a menace .
the approach of a verger in a black cassock will sometimes disperse them .
but the life of the streets touches the cathedral on every side .
" cleaning out one drain , " says ioan , " i found 16 needles . " 1630 bst the choir return , soaked , from a rehearsal for a concert at bridgewater hall , and soon they are wearing their red cassocks and rehearsing with organist and choirmaster chris stokes o god , make speed to save us .
o lord , make haste to help us .
the words of the prayer book , sung by the choir , seem to take off and fly into the depths of the old building .
the choir rehearses with organist-choirmaster chris stokes the children in the choir , aged from eight to 13 , study at chetham 's school next door to the cathedral - some travel from as far as glossop , 15 miles away .
" they 're a great bunch , " says chris stokes .
they have to become expert in a huge range of music , but " they chomp through repertoire like mad . "
during term time they rarely get a day off - and , says chris stokes , " we look terribly carefully " for signs that any chorister is getting over tired .
1730 bst evensong ioan isaac-meurug , holding a staff of office , leads in the dean , ken riley , and the choir , now in white surplices .
choral evensong , says the order of service , " is one of the jewels that the church of england has contributed to the crown of christian worship . "
just eight members of the public make up the congregation - there are 14 boys and girls and six men in the choir , directed by chris stokes .
manchester cathedral manchester cathedral in pictures if there were no congregation at all , the service would still go on - performing the required services each day is officially part of the opus dei -lrb- work of god -rrb- which a cathedral must carry out .
lighten our darkness , we beseech thee , o lord , and by thy great mercy defend us from all perils and dangers of this night - the dean prays .
all wisdom cometh from the lord sings the choir in the anthem which follows .
no day in the cathedral is quite like another , and after evensong the dean has to formally receive a bundle of the building 's archives , which have been sitting in ely cathedral for 340 years .
as he hands over the papers to cathedral archivist chris hunwick , he thanks the ely authorities " for their diligence in finding these documents belonging to manchester , which had obviously got lost in the post . "
the adults present enjoy the joke .
the boys and girls of the choir look on tolerantly .
after evensong , the gates are locked ; this is not bellringing night and there is no special service or concert .
at night , in the shadows of the old walls , small groups sit and drink .
but the bridgewater hall concert lies before the choir , and they will not be finished till after ten .
0745 bst rush-hour manchester roars and bustles , but deep inside the cathedral the work of god goes on quietly .
manchester cathedral the cathedral lies at the centre of a diocese of 2.8m people it became a collegiate church in 1421 and a cathedral in 1847 it was devastated by a german bomb in 1940 and by an ira bomb in 1996 last december , 30,000 attended services there are 15 full-time staff , as many part-timers and numerous volunteer workers escorted by head verger geoffrey robinson , canon paul denby celebrates matins .
he reads the psalm for the day - thanks be to the lord , for he hath shewed me marvellous great kindness in a strong city .
holy communion follows straight on , as paul denby moves to the high altar .
he prays for the g8 leaders , for the olympic candidate cities , for the chaplains of the manchester royal infirmary , for the diocese of rochester and the church in nigeria , and for a long list of people who are sick .
he and geoffrey robinson take the sacrament of bread and wine themselves , and serve it to the one other worshipper present .
solicitor david brindle is not at all put off by being a congregation of one , though he says there are often more .
0930 bst the booth centre opens again .
today there is an advice session -lrb- arranging identity papers is a common task -rrb- and sandwiches , hot drinks , fresh fruit and toiletries are available .
later there will be craftwork , and in the afternoon , crown green bowling .
booth centre worker kevin newell in the centre 's ' drinking garden ' and the drinking garden is open .
sixty per cent of those using the centre are street drinkers - which is tough in manchester , because street drinking is illegal .
the pub garden by the cathedral has sturdy little gates on it marked ' point of no return ' .
but you can drink in the award-winning cathedral garden , built and maintained by the clients of the booth centre themselves .
some of the visitors will not venture past the door of the centre itself but will go into the garden to drink - and the staff can get to know them and see if any look as if they need help .
1030 bst a trickle of visitors enter the cathedral .
there is plenty to see : the saxon sculpture of an angel , the carved " misericord " choir seats , and the pock-marked stones of the old tower , where a 19th-century redecoration scheme nearly brought the whole building down .
the lady whose task it is to welcome visitors points proudly to the selection of guides in different languages - french , spanish , german , italian , chinese , japanese - " it was either that or me going to night school , " she says .
1245 bst the turning of the leaves ten immaculately blazered old soldiers file into the chapel of the manchester regiment for the fortnightly ceremony of the books of remembrance .
turning of the leaves in the manchester regiment chapel each steps up to a book , bows and turns a page - so that each list of names of the fallen gets its turn on public view .
then they listen to a reading about the regiment 's 1914-18 pals ' battalions - the groups of friends who joined up together .
twenty-one battalions of them came from manchester , salford and oldham and over half died .
1310 holy communion taking the service , canon albert radcliffe notes that today is the feast of st john fisher and st thomas more .
two catholic reformation martyrs .
why ?
the church of england is a broad and tolerant church , he says .
in honouring these two who died for their beliefs , " we show we are stronger , bigger and broader than sectarian divisions . "
the youngest worshipper , richard mackintosh , is temping at the co-op nearby .
" i think it 's important to have a place where people come and receive the sacrament , " he says .
" it gives people a sense of continuity with christians in the past . "
" we welcome everybody , " says canon paul denby .
that is a constant theme .
staff at the booth centre say the same ; chris stokes says it about the choir .
of nearly 3,000 pupils on school visits last year , half were muslim , says cathedral education officer joanna booth .
" some said they did n't know they were allowed in . "
in fact everyone is allowed in - particularly if they are near the ' point of no return ' .
