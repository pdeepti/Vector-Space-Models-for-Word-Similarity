the bloc is passing the buck on to brazil and at the same time , trying to bring poor countries to its side . the european union is frustrated .
it makes concessions , opens up it markets , but is still called responsible for the fact that global trade negotiations are sluggish and accused of rowing against the tide in the run-up to the wto trade conference in hong kong from december 13 to 18 . " we are offering to reduce subsidies that distort trade by 70 percent , " said eu trade commissioner peter mandelson , referring to an offer the eu made on october 28 .
" we can do that thanks to reforms that have already been decided and put into place . " he says there is no reason to doubt the motives , or behavior , of the eu , and that the bloc 's accommodation in trade matters has not been appreciated by its trading partners . the blame game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union commissioner for trade peter mandelson mandelson 's critique is aimed fairly squarely at the group of developing nations , the so-called g-20 , and especially at the group 's mouthpiece , brazil . the brazilians have been at odds with the eu for years over agricultural policy .
indeed , it was the complaint they filed with the wto that forced the eu to reform its highly subsidized sugar industry .
but now brazil is arguing the eu suggestions do n't go far enough to improve market access for top brazilian exports like beef . " how can they think that they do n't see a decided advantage when we we 're willing to lower our highest tariff rate by 60 percent ? " asked the deputy departmental head of the eu agricultural section , flavio coturini . the eu offer in the agricultural sector for the hong kong conference consists of three parts : 1 . to completely abolish eu export subsidies . 2 . to reduce other rated subsidies by 70 percent , especially those seen as distorting free trade . 3 . to reduce agricultural tariffs by as much as 60 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beef is a leading brazilian export however , some eight percent of products should be exempt from this reduction .
brussels would like to protect its so-called " sensitive goods " from foreign competitors .
beef falls within this category , which angers the south americans , since they see a potentially large market for their beef in europe . hard fronts there wo n't be any further concessions , according to the eu commission , the bloc 's executive body .
in exchange for their agricultural largess , the eu calls for concessions by other countries in the areas of services and industrial goods . " there must be real economic gains , new streams of commerce , " said david o 'sullivan , the eu 's director-general for trade .
" we think our suggestions provide that .
we expect similar concessions from our negotiating partners .
and to be honest , what the brazilians have offered us regarding non-agricultural goods does n't really provide better market access for the products that we are interested in . " but brazil and its foreign minister celso amorim are still playing poker , saying that before they comply with eu demands , the bloc needs to offer a more attractive agricultural deal . " there will be no counter offers , " said an irritated mandelson .
" there are no possible deals during these negotiations if the only topic is market access in the agricultural sector .
that is the problem . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world trade organization 's director-general french pascal lamy the state of negotiations in the run-up to hong kong is not great .
the working paper put forward by the wto director pascal lamy is vague and inconcrete .
analysts say many of these issues should have been settled over two years ago .
but conflicting demands have lead to a stalemate . the eu wants to break out of its isolation and is trying to bring the poorest countries over to its side by means of a development package .
but poor countries would actually gain very little from improved eu market access , since they are already allowed to export most of their goods to the bloc without paying duty . opportunity lost ? peter mandelson is now trying to increase pressure on brazil to keep the wto talks from ending in failure . " that would ruin a huge economic opportunity , " he said , " it would also be very harmful to the wto and could turn back the clock on global multilateralism . " " i believe that europe carries a greater responsibility than others do to bring this round -lrb- of talks -rrb- forward and that is what we 're going to do . " while he is not counting on a breakthrough in hong kong , he says it is crucial to codify what has already been accomplished .

the bloc is passing the buck on to brazil and at the same time , trying to bring poor countries to its side . the european union is frustrated .
it makes concessions , opens up it markets , but is still called responsible for the fact that global trade negotiations are sluggish and accused of rowing against the tide in the run-up to the wto trade conference in hong kong from december 13 to 18 . " we are offering to reduce subsidies that distort trade by 70 percent , " said eu trade commissioner peter mandelson , referring to an offer the eu made on october 28 .
" we can do that thanks to reforms that have already been decided and put into place . " he says there is no reason to doubt the motives , or behavior , of the eu , and that the bloc 's accommodation in trade matters has not been appreciated by its trading partners . the blame game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union commissioner for trade peter mandelson mandelson 's critique is aimed fairly squarely at the group of developing nations , the so-called g-20 , and especially at the group 's mouthpiece , brazil . the brazilians have been at odds with the eu for years over agricultural policy .
indeed , it was the complaint they filed with the wto that forced the eu to reform its highly subsidized sugar industry .
but now brazil is arguing the eu suggestions do n't go far enough to improve market access for top brazilian exports like beef . " how can they think that they do n't see a decided advantage when we we 're willing to lower our highest tariff rate by 60 percent ? " asked the deputy departmental head of the eu agricultural section , flavio coturini . the eu offer in the agricultural sector for the hong kong conference consists of three parts : 1 . to completely abolish eu export subsidies . 2 . to reduce other rated subsidies by 70 percent , especially those seen as distorting free trade . 3 . to reduce agricultural tariffs by as much as 60 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beef is a leading brazilian export however , some eight percent of products should be exempt from this reduction .
brussels would like to protect its so-called " sensitive goods " from foreign competitors .
beef falls within this category , which angers the south americans , since they see a potentially large market for their beef in europe . hard fronts there wo n't be any further concessions , according to the eu commission , the bloc 's executive body .
in exchange for their agricultural largess , the eu calls for concessions by other countries in the areas of services and industrial goods . " there must be real economic gains , new streams of commerce , " said david o 'sullivan , the eu 's director-general for trade .
" we think our suggestions provide that .
we expect similar concessions from our negotiating partners .
and to be honest , what the brazilians have offered us regarding non-agricultural goods does n't really provide better market access for the products that we are interested in . " but brazil and its foreign minister celso amorim are still playing poker , saying that before they comply with eu demands , the bloc needs to offer a more attractive agricultural deal . " there will be no counter offers , " said an irritated mandelson .
" there are no possible deals during these negotiations if the only topic is market access in the agricultural sector .
that is the problem . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world trade organization 's director-general french pascal lamy the state of negotiations in the run-up to hong kong is not great .
the working paper put forward by the wto director pascal lamy is vague and inconcrete .
analysts say many of these issues should have been settled over two years ago .
but conflicting demands have lead to a stalemate . the eu wants to break out of its isolation and is trying to bring the poorest countries over to its side by means of a development package .
but poor countries would actually gain very little from improved eu market access , since they are already allowed to export most of their goods to the bloc without paying duty . opportunity lost ? peter mandelson is now trying to increase pressure on brazil to keep the wto talks from ending in failure . " that would ruin a huge economic opportunity , " he said , " it would also be very harmful to the wto and could turn back the clock on global multilateralism . " " i believe that europe carries a greater responsibility than others do to bring this round -lrb- of talks -rrb- forward and that is what we 're going to do .

it 's up to those governments and their citizens to decide if they wish to work with us to prevent terrorist attacks in their own country or other countries .
they have a sovereign right to make that choice . " rice did , however , talk about allegations that the cia touched down at european airports while transporting terrorist suspects to third countries for interrogation , a practice known as rendition . " renditions take terrorists out of action , they save lives " rice said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.12.2005 rice aides slam comment that us made " mistake " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's some disagreement about who was admitting exactly to what after angela merkel said tuesday that the us admitted it erred in detaining a german national , rice 's aides challenged her comments , saying they were n't sure " what was in -lrb- merkel 's -rrb- head " when she said what she did . speaking to the press after a meeting with us secretary of state condoleezza rice in berlin tuesday , merkel said she had discussed the case of khaled el-masri , a lebanese-born german national who was reportedly abducted by cia operatives and held in afghanistan for several months . " the american administration has admitted that this man was erroneously taken , " merkel told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el-masri says he was kept in afghanistan for five months but senior us officials , who are travelling with rice on her european tour , disagreed with merkel 's interpretation .
after the news conference , they met with the chancellor 's aides and asked for a explanation , saying rice had not actually admitted to a us mistake over masri . " we are not quite sure what was in her head , " a senior us administration official told reuters . he said while the bush administration had informed germany about masri 's detention and release , he did not say it was an error on the us government 's part . the official went on to say that the german chancellor might have been drawing on media reports rather than any dialog with the us administration when she concluded that washington had admitted to a mistake . masri was released last year after five months in an afghan jail after the united states realized it " no longer had evidence or intelligence to justify his continued detention , " the official said , but declined to respond when asked if the us had ever had evidence to hold him . he did acknowledge that masri was originally detained because of a suspicion that he had a false passport and had the same name as a militant leader .
the passport turned out to be genuine , the official added . the case caused an uproar in germany after recent news reports that former interior minister otto schily had been informed about the wrongful abduction by the then us ambassador in germany . reports about secret cia flights to transport terror suspects across german air space and to us air bases in germany have also strained relations in the last weeks .
the us is also facing criticism for allegedly operating secret cia prisons in eastern europe . rice : a case for the courts saying that masri 's case was a matter for litigation , rice declined to comment on it , but did say that the us was ready to correct its mistakes , which could have led merkel to make the comments she did . " any policy will result in errors , " she said .
" when mistakes are made , we work very hard to rectify them .
i believe that this will be handled in the proper courts , here in germany and if necessary in american courts as well . " rice also reiterated her view that her government could not reveal details about us intelligence agencies . " we have to have intelligence that can be effective , " she said .
" without good intelligence , you can simply not protect innocent civilians from the kind of attacks that we 've witnessed around the globe . " merkel sees intensified relationship rice added that washington was adhering to national and international laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said rice 's statement is a good basis for intelligence cooperation " the us does not condone torture , " she said .
" it is against us law to commit torture and it 's also against the us ' international obligations .
the president has made it very clear that us personnel will operate within us law and international obligations . " merkel said that she was glad rice had reiterated the us administration 's commitment to international laws . " it was important for me that the secretary of state repeated this , that the united states sticks to its international obligations , " she said , adding that she was looking forward to continuing to build an " intensified relationship between our two countries " during her upcoming visit to washington in january . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : us closes secret cia prisons ahead of rice visit the us has reportedly shut down two secret cia prisons in poland and romania just ahead of us secretary of state rice 's visit to europe .

" the american administration has admitted that this man was erroneously taken , " merkel told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el-masri says he was kept in afghanistan for five months but senior us officials , who are travelling with rice on her european tour , disagreed with merkel 's interpretation .
after the news conference , they met with the chancellor 's aides and asked for a explanation , saying rice had not actually admitted to a us mistake over masri . " we are not quite sure what was in her head , " a senior us administration official told reuters . he said while the bush administration had informed germany about masri 's detention and release , he did not say it was an error on the us government 's part . the official went on to say that the german chancellor might have been drawing on media reports rather than any dialog with the us administration when she concluded that washington had admitted to a mistake . masri was released last year after five months in an afghan jail after the united states realized it " no longer had evidence or intelligence to justify his continued detention , " the official said , but declined to respond when asked if the us had ever had evidence to hold him . he did acknowledge that masri was originally detained because of a suspicion that he had a false passport and had the same name as a militant leader .
the passport turned out to be genuine , the official added . the case caused an uproar in germany after recent news reports that former interior minister otto schily had been informed about the wrongful abduction by the then us ambassador in germany . reports about secret cia flights to transport terror suspects across german air space and to us air bases in germany have also strained relations in the last weeks .
the us is also facing criticism for allegedly operating secret cia prisons in eastern europe . rice : a case for the courts saying that masri 's case was a matter for litigation , rice declined to comment on it , but did say that the us was ready to correct its mistakes , which could have led merkel to make the comments she did . " any policy will result in errors , " she said .
" when mistakes are made , we work very hard to rectify them .
i believe that this will be handled in the proper courts , here in germany and if necessary in american courts as well . " rice also reiterated her view that her government could not reveal details about us intelligence agencies . " we have to have intelligence that can be effective , " she said .
" without good intelligence , you can simply not protect innocent civilians from the kind of attacks that we 've witnessed around the globe . " merkel sees intensified relationship rice added that washington was adhering to national and international laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said rice 's statement is a good basis for intelligence cooperation " the us does not condone torture , " she said .
" it is against us law to commit torture and it 's also against the us ' international obligations .
the president has made it very clear that us personnel will operate within us law and international obligations . " merkel said that she was glad rice had reiterated the us administration 's commitment to international laws . " it was important for me that the secretary of state repeated this , that the united states sticks to its international obligations , " she said , adding that she was looking forward to continuing to build an " intensified relationship between our two countries " during her upcoming visit to washington in january . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : us closes secret cia prisons ahead of rice visit the us has reportedly shut down two secret cia prisons in poland and romania just ahead of us secretary of state rice 's visit to europe .

europe should n't be satisfied with half-hearted answers , says dw 's klaus dahmann . if condoleezza rice is to be believed , then the united states preserves the world from the evil of terror , and america is a country that adheres to human rights in everything it does . transporting prisoners from one country to another where torture may be applied as a means to help along investigations - no , that 's not something the united states does or ever did do .

that the cia has used torture there has not only been confirmed by victims and human rights organizations such as amnesty international , but also former members of the us intelligence service . it 's clear that the torture allegations are not just a domestic american issue - and not only so since european governments have come under suspicion of knowing about this . europe 's criticism of guantanamo and other prisons used by the us government to interrogate terrorists and terror suspects has been too quiet in the past .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.12.2005 opinion : europe needs to pressure us on cia scandal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is guantanamo proof that europe needs to keep watching the us ?
allegations of secret cia prisons and flights across europe overshadow us secretary of state condoleezza rice 's visit .
europe should n't be satisfied with half-hearted answers , says dw 's klaus dahmann . if condoleezza rice is to be believed , then the united states preserves the world from the evil of terror , and america is a country that adheres to human rights in everything it does . transporting prisoners from one country to another where torture may be applied as a means to help along investigations - no , that 's not something the united states does or ever did do .
the united states does n't use air space nor the airports of other countries to transport prisoners to torture cellars . if you believe rice , that is . then all speculations about secret cia prisons in poland and romania have been " misunderstandings . "
the us only takes care of the " first and oldest duty of every government " - protecting its people . too quiet for too long ? europe can not and should not be satisfied with these answers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cia prison in kosovo ?
firstly , the american secretary of state still has n't answered the central question : does or did the cia maintain secret prisons in european countries ? secondly , a lawless place already exists in the form of guantanamo .
that the cia has used torture there has not only been confirmed by victims and human rights organizations such as amnesty international , but also former members of the us intelligence service . it 's clear that the torture allegations are not just a domestic american issue - and not only so since european governments have come under suspicion of knowing about this . europe 's criticism of guantanamo and other prisons used by the us government to interrogate terrorists and terror suspects has been too quiet in the past .
european politicians too quickly retracted to the standpoint that the us government is obligated by its country 's constitution to uphold democratic principles and the rule of law . upholding democracy 's highest values bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice and merkel at a news conference tuesday no one can accept that exactly these values are trampled on to defend democratic societies and values in the fight against terror .
german chancellor angela merkel was right to emphasize this on tuesday . torture methods of any kind have to remain banned from the repertoire of the military and the intelligence community - even if you risk failure in preventing a planned terrorist attack because of it .
the violation of human rights can not be weighed against even worse human rights violations that could potentially be prevented this way . the german government has to stand up for its values , despite its commitment to a trans-atlantic partnership and the fight against terrorism .
and that 's why it not only has to uncover the alleged cognizance of the previous government regarding cia activities , but it also must put pressure on the us government until washington offers full disclosure . paying lip service is not enough . klaus dahmann -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rice aides slam comment that us made " mistake " german chancellor angela merkel said tuesday that the us government admitted that a german national had been wrongfully abducted after cia officials believed him to be a terror suspect .

meanwhile , the federal government is fighting an eu ban on tobacco advertising . some 37 percent of germans smoke , one of the highest levels in the european union .
among women smokers , germany is at the very top .
according to health experts , one of the reasons for this is the fact that many of the country 's most renowned public health experts long played down the damaging effects of lighting up - often because they were in the pay of large tobacco concerns . the study , published in the american journal of public health , says many experts worked hand in hand since the 1970 's with firms such as r.j. reynolds and philip morris to " manipulate and skew " the mounting evidence that smoking could be deadly , largely because they received research money from the cigarette manufacturers . the leading author of the study , berlin researcher thilo grüning , cites the example of one of german medicine 's biggest names , fritz kemper , long-time professor at the university of münster , talented toxicologist , and member of germany 's top medical committees .
in 2002 , he received the große verdienstkreuz , one of germany 's highest civilian honors . but grüning also found that kemper was a key scientific ally to big tobacco .
in one year , according to internal documents the study examined , he received $ 20,000 dollars from r.j. reynolds , the maker of camel cigarettes , for informing the multinational about the activities of german scientists and politicians in the area of tobacco . influence on study results after the united states , germany was one of the most important bases for the tobacco lobby .

for example , franz adlkofer , a leading german tobacco researcher , assured his colleagues in the us that one study about nicotine as a carcinogenic would be " hidden , " another studied would " guaranteed not be published . " martina pötschke-langer , head of the center for tobacco control at the world health organization in heidelberg , told the newsmagazine der spiegel that the roll of leading german health experts in covering up the harmful effects of tobacco was " shocking . " " presumably many fewer people would die today from tobacco if medical professionals would have taken the results they found on the consequences of smoking seriously , " she said . so for , only one german research institute , the cancer research center in heidelberg , passed an ethical code banning it from accepting funding from the tobacco industry .
that was just at the beginning of november - this year . germany fights eu ban meanwhile , the tobacco industry continues to enjoy something of a comfortable position in germany as the new government continues to fight against an eu ban on all tobacco advertising that the predecessor government under gerhard schröder began .
the government will make its position clear when the case is argued before the european court of justice on tuesday . since july , newspaper , radio and internet sites across the eu are prohibitted from advertising tobacco products .
however , the ban is being effectively ignored by many countries , including germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : r1 cigarette advertisement billboard , germany , photo 2000/10/5 a spokesman for the government said the case is not about the health effects of smoking , but whether the eu has the right to pass a ban against national advertising that does not cross international borders .
according to berlin , the eu 's jurisdiction does not extend to domestic advertising . but david byrne , a former eu health commissioner , says germany in particular is in need of stricter rules on tobacco ads . " in germany , 37 percent of the population smokes and there are lax regulations on tobacco advertising , " he said .
" in sweden there are stronger laws and only 19 percent of the population smokes . " the german newspaper and magazine publishing associations are also opposed to the ban , saying they fear that the advertising ban could lead to similar bans in other industries .

the chancellor said rice had admitted during their meeting that the united states had made a mistake in masri 's case . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice and merkel in berlin tuesday " we talked about this one case which , of course , was accepted as a mistake by the us administration , " merkel told reporters .
" i 'm glad that rice told me that mistakes would be corrected . " there has been widespread condemnation in europe of reports of secret cia prisons , known as " black sites , " used to interrogate and allegedly torture terror suspects after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks on the united states . the agency also allegedly used airports across europe to transport the suspects . us officials have consistently refused to confirm the existence of the covert prisons or flights while defending the us right to adopt tough anti-terrorism tactics . detained and drugged masri , an unemployed car salesman , told a press conference via satellite link he was detained on dec .
31 , 2003 as he was heading on a bus to macedonia for a holiday following a dispute with his wife . he alleged that when the bus reached the serbia-macedonia border , guards confiscated his passport and detained him on suspicion he was linked to the al qaeda terror network . masri said he was drugged before being put on a plane to afghanistan where he was held at a secret cia prison and interrogated for several months .
he said he was held incommunicado long after his innocence was established . he was flown to albania in may 2004 and released without being charged . " extraordinary rendition " the aclu said masri 's abduction and treatment was the direct result of a cia policy known as " extraordinary rendition , " which allows the agency to arrest terrorism suspects and transfer them to other countries for interrogation without going through formal extradition proceedings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cia plane allegedly used to transport terror suspects " kidnapping a foreign national for the purpose of detaining and interrogating him outside the law is contrary to american values , " said anthony romero , executive director of the aclu .
" our government has acted as if it is above the law , " he said , adding that there was a " climate of impunity " in the practices of the us administration . the suit names former cia director george tenet and three companies that owned and operated the airlines used to transport masri . masri seeks damages but romero said the former detainee wanted most of all a " simple acknowledgement " of the wrong done against him and an apology . rice on monday struck a defiant tone before heading on a four-nation european tour , stressing that the us did not engage in torture and defending the right to transfer prisoners around the world for interrogation . masri was reportedly arrested in a case of mistaken identity as after september 11 , the cia had listed a khaled el-masri as a suspect with ties to osama bin laden .
that masri is believed to still be at large . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : europe needs to pressure us on cia scandal allegations of secret cia prisons and flights across europe overshadow us secretary of state condoleezza rice 's visit .

11 , 2001 attacks on the united states . the agency also allegedly used airports across europe to transport the suspects . us officials have consistently refused to confirm the existence of the covert prisons or flights while defending the us right to adopt tough anti-terrorism tactics . detained and drugged masri , an unemployed car salesman , told a press conference via satellite link he was detained on dec .
31 , 2003 as he was heading on a bus to macedonia for a holiday following a dispute with his wife . he alleged that when the bus reached the serbia-macedonia border , guards confiscated his passport and detained him on suspicion he was linked to the al qaeda terror network . masri said he was drugged before being put on a plane to afghanistan where he was held at a secret cia prison and interrogated for several months .
he said he was held incommunicado long after his innocence was established . he was flown to albania in may 2004 and released without being charged . " extraordinary rendition " the aclu said masri 's abduction and treatment was the direct result of a cia policy known as " extraordinary rendition , " which allows the agency to arrest terrorism suspects and transfer them to other countries for interrogation without going through formal extradition proceedings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cia plane allegedly used to transport terror suspects " kidnapping a foreign national for the purpose of detaining and interrogating him outside the law is contrary to american values , " said anthony romero , executive director of the aclu .
" our government has acted as if it is above the law , " he said , adding that there was a " climate of impunity " in the practices of the us administration . the suit names former cia director george tenet and three companies that owned and operated the airlines used to transport masri . masri seeks damages but romero said the former detainee wanted most of all a " simple acknowledgement " of the wrong done against him and an apology . rice on monday struck a defiant tone before heading on a four-nation european tour , stressing that the us did not engage in torture and defending the right to transfer prisoners around the world for interrogation . masri was reportedly arrested in a case of mistaken identity as after september 11 , the cia had listed a khaled el-masri as a suspect with ties to osama bin laden .
that masri is believed to still be at large . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : europe needs to pressure us on cia scandal allegations of secret cia prisons and flights across europe overshadow us secretary of state condoleezza rice 's visit .

" the american administration has admitted that this man was erroneously taken , " merkel told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el-masri says he was kept in afghanistan for five months but senior us officials , who are travelling with rice on her european tour , disagreed with merkel 's interpretation .
after the news conference , they met with the chancellor 's aides and asked for a explanation , saying rice had not actually admitted to a us mistake over masri . " we are not quite sure what was in her head , " a senior us administration official told reuters . he said while the bush administration had informed germany about masri 's detention and release , he did not say it was an error on the us government 's part . the official went on to say that the german chancellor might have been drawing on media reports rather than any dialog with the us administration when she concluded that washington had admitted to a mistake . masri was released last year after five months in an afghan jail after the united states realized it " no longer had evidence or intelligence to justify his continued detention , " the official said , but declined to respond when asked if the us had ever had evidence to hold him . he did acknowledge that masri was originally detained because of a suspicion that he had a false passport and had the same name as a militant leader .
the passport turned out to be genuine , the official added . the case caused an uproar in germany after recent news reports that former interior minister otto schily had been informed about the wrongful abduction by the then us ambassador in germany . reports about secret cia flights to transport terror suspects across german air space and to us air bases in germany have also strained relations in the last weeks .
the us is also facing criticism for allegedly operating secret cia prisons in eastern europe . rice : a case for the courts saying that masri 's case was a matter for litigation , rice declined to comment on it , but did say that the us was ready to correct its mistakes , which could have led merkel to make the comments she did . " any policy will result in errors , " she said .
" when mistakes are made , we work very hard to rectify them .

meanwhile , the federal government is fighting an eu ban on tobacco advertising . some 37 percent of germans smoke , one of the highest levels in the european union .
among women smokers , germany is at the very top .
according to health experts , one of the reasons for this is the fact that many of the country 's most renowned public health experts long played down the damaging effects of lighting up - often because they were in the pay of large tobacco concerns . the study , published in the american journal of public health , says many experts worked hand in hand since the 1970 's with firms such as r.j. reynolds and philip morris to " manipulate and skew " the mounting evidence that smoking could be deadly , largely because they received research money from the cigarette manufacturers . the leading author of the study , berlin researcher thilo grüning , cites the example of one of german medicine 's biggest names , fritz kemper , long-time professor at the university of münster , talented toxicologist , and member of germany 's top medical committees .

the chancellor said rice had admitted during their meeting that the united states had made a mistake in masri 's case . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice and merkel in berlin tuesday " we talked about this one case which , of course , was accepted as a mistake by the us administration , " merkel told reporters .
" i 'm glad that rice told me that mistakes would be corrected . " there has been widespread condemnation in europe of reports of secret cia prisons , known as " black sites , " used to interrogate and allegedly torture terror suspects after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks on the united states . the agency also allegedly used airports across europe to transport the suspects . us officials have consistently refused to confirm the existence of the covert prisons or flights while defending the us right to adopt tough anti-terrorism tactics . detained and drugged masri , an unemployed car salesman , told a press conference via satellite link he was detained on dec .
31 , 2003 as he was heading on a bus to macedonia for a holiday following a dispute with his wife . he alleged that when the bus reached the serbia-macedonia border , guards confiscated his passport and detained him on suspicion he was linked to the al qaeda terror network . masri said he was drugged before being put on a plane to afghanistan where he was held at a secret cia prison and interrogated for several months .
he said he was held incommunicado long after his innocence was established . he was flown to albania in may 2004 and released without being charged . " extraordinary rendition " the aclu said masri 's abduction and treatment was the direct result of a cia policy known as " extraordinary rendition , " which allows the agency to arrest terrorism suspects and transfer them to other countries for interrogation without going through formal extradition proceedings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cia plane allegedly used to transport terror suspects " kidnapping a foreign national for the purpose of detaining and interrogating him outside the law is contrary to american values , " said anthony romero , executive director of the aclu .
" our government has acted as if it is above the law , " he said , adding that there was a " climate of impunity " in the practices of the us administration . the suit names former cia director george tenet and three companies that owned and operated the airlines used to transport masri . masri seeks damages but romero said the former detainee wanted most of all a " simple acknowledgement " of the wrong done against him and an apology . rice on monday struck a defiant tone before heading on a four-nation european tour , stressing that the us did not engage in torture and defending the right to transfer prisoners around the world for interrogation . masri was reportedly arrested in a case of mistaken identity as after september 11 , the cia had listed a khaled el-masri as a suspect with ties to osama bin laden .
that masri is believed to still be at large . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : europe needs to pressure us on cia scandal allegations of secret cia prisons and flights across europe overshadow us secretary of state condoleezza rice 's visit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.12.2005 rice aides slam comment that us made " mistake " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's some disagreement about who was admitting exactly to what after angela merkel said tuesday that the us admitted it erred in detaining a german national , rice 's aides challenged her comments , saying they were n't sure " what was in -lrb- merkel 's -rrb- head " when she said what she did . speaking to the press after a meeting with us secretary of state condoleezza rice in berlin tuesday , merkel said she had discussed the case of khaled el-masri , a lebanese-born german national who was reportedly abducted by cia operatives and held in afghanistan for several months . " the american administration has admitted that this man was erroneously taken , " merkel told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el-masri says he was kept in afghanistan for five months but senior us officials , who are travelling with rice on her european tour , disagreed with merkel 's interpretation .
after the news conference , they met with the chancellor 's aides and asked for a explanation , saying rice had not actually admitted to a us mistake over masri . " we are not quite sure what was in her head , " a senior us administration official told reuters . he said while the bush administration had informed germany about masri 's detention and release , he did not say it was an error on the us government 's part . the official went on to say that the german chancellor might have been drawing on media reports rather than any dialog with the us administration when she concluded that washington had admitted to a mistake . masri was released last year after five months in an afghan jail after the united states realized it " no longer had evidence or intelligence to justify his continued detention , " the official said , but declined to respond when asked if the us had ever had evidence to hold him . he did acknowledge that masri was originally detained because of a suspicion that he had a false passport and had the same name as a militant leader .
the passport turned out to be genuine , the official added . the case caused an uproar in germany after recent news reports that former interior minister otto schily had been informed about the wrongful abduction by the then us ambassador in germany . reports about secret cia flights to transport terror suspects across german air space and to us air bases in germany have also strained relations in the last weeks .
the us is also facing criticism for allegedly operating secret cia prisons in eastern europe . rice : a case for the courts saying that masri 's case was a matter for litigation , rice declined to comment on it , but did say that the us was ready to correct its mistakes , which could have led merkel to make the comments she did . " any policy will result in errors , " she said .
" when mistakes are made , we work very hard to rectify them .
i believe that this will be handled in the proper courts , here in germany and if necessary in american courts as well . " rice also reiterated her view that her government could not reveal details about us intelligence agencies . " we have to have intelligence that can be effective , " she said .
" without good intelligence , you can simply not protect innocent civilians from the kind of attacks that we 've witnessed around the globe . " merkel sees intensified relationship rice added that washington was adhering to national and international laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said rice 's statement is a good basis for intelligence cooperation " the us does not condone torture , " she said .
" it is against us law to commit torture and it 's also against the us ' international obligations .
the president has made it very clear that us personnel will operate within us law and international obligations . " merkel said that she was glad rice had reiterated the us administration 's commitment to international laws . " it was important for me that the secretary of state repeated this , that the united states sticks to its international obligations , " she said , adding that she was looking forward to continuing to build an " intensified relationship between our two countries " during her upcoming visit to washington in january . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : us closes secret cia prisons ahead of rice visit the us has reportedly shut down two secret cia prisons in poland and romania just ahead of us secretary of state rice 's visit to europe .

she 's not informing german chancellor merkel directly and instead made remarks before her departure to berlin when the european union and the european council asked for information .
" the statement turned out as expected , " the paper continued , saying that rice merely confirmed the existence of such flights .
" rice of course denies that terror suspects are moved to places where they can be tortured .
believe it if you want to .
at the very least , there 's guantanamo , where suspects have been kept without seeing lawyers or a judge for years . " berlin 's der tagesspiegel said that germans and europeans should look at the basis of the conflict : " how are terrorists meant to be treated ?
like common criminals , prisoners of war or something else ? " it asked .
the paper continued that europe should weigh the options carefully and reconsider its stance of moral superiority .
" morals are one thing , fighting terrorism another .
is the geneva convention our only guideline when attacks are to be prevented ?
the us government has deserved to be criticized , but to climb the high horse and benefit from these methods is hypocritical . " several members of germany 's former red-green government should start blushing if reports about their knowledge of the illegal abduction of a german national prove to be true , commented the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung in essen .
" signs are mounting that european governments had some knowledge of human rights abuses , but did n't want to look to carefully , " the paper wrote .
" us president bush consciously ignores international law .
it 's possible that several eu states became compliant accomplices , including berlin . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secretary of state condoleezza rice london 's the independent meanwhile said that rice has been " a rare star in a bush administration that has otherwise stumbled from one mess to another .
the reason is not merely her style and dazzling fashion sense .
european governments have been impressed by her efforts to restore the role of diplomacy in american policy-making , and to re-establish the primacy of the state department -lrb- as opposed to the pentagon and the vice-president 's office -rrb- in that process . "
while putting her predecessor , colin powell , to shame over making progress in the middle east , her current trip to europe proves to be a special challenge , the paper wrote .
her european partners are deeply worried about cia flights through german airspace , among other things .
the test will be not only what rice has to say about the allegations , but how she will do it , commented the daily .
relations between europe and the us are in a sensible phase , it continued : a lack of tact would be disastrous for both sides .

and he was not optimistic about the prospects for a quick solution : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : working around the clock " it can take days , weeks , possibly even months , " he said .
" this is why it is crucial that we get in contact with the kidnappers as soon as possible .
being in touch does not necessarily mean that we will also have an agreement ensuring osthoff 's release .
up to now we do n't even have a sign that the hostage is still alive .
the more time passes the more difficult the situation gets . " motives unclear susanne osthoff was seized on november 25 .
in a video released last tuesday , the kidnappers threatened to kill her unless germany stopped training iraqi police . " this is one of the most difficult situations a government can find itself in , " said bosbach .
" the hostage 's life must be saved , but we can not give in to political demands . " his statements backed up the position taken by chancellor angela merkel in an interview on public broadcaster zdf sunday .
merkel stressed that berlin would do everything in its power to save osthoff 's life , but reiterated the government 's refusal to give in to political blackmail . " fortunately , there is broad social consensus on this issue and across the political spectrum , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a video of osthoff was released shortly after her capture german press reports say the deadline attached to the demand expired on friday , but this has not been confirmed .
it is not clear either whether the first kidnapping of a german national in iraq is in fact politically motivated or could be solved by paying ransom to the kidnappers . in order to protect the hostage , the german government is unwilling to speculate either about the motives behind the kidnapping or the identity of the kidnappers . " we are concerned that making this sort of information public would jeopardize out efforts , " said ruprecht polenz , head of the bundestag 's foreign relations committee . family concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pleading for the hostage 's release the family of the victim are also renewing their calls for her release .
osthoff 's mother on monday issued another emotional plea to return her daughter to safety .
in an interview with a german newspaper she said that her daughter was " more iraqi than german . " osthoff is a trained archeologist who has been doing aid work in iraq for several years .
the 43 year old convert to islam was married to an arab and speaks fluent arabic . in osthoff ’ s home village of glonn near munich , people have been gathering for vigils .
candles have been lit at the entrance to the city hall right beneath a photo of osthoff .
the residents of the small bavarian village are simply shocked , says the mayor martin esterl .
he met susanne osthoff during the iraq war in 2003 when she was about to set off for her first humanitarian trip to iraq . " i personally was very impressed by her , " he said .
" i got to know her as a woman who is strong-willed , who knows exactly what she wants and who is very committed to her mission of helping the iraqi people .
susanne osthoff seemed determined to pursue her goal without compromise . " muslim solidarity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nadeem elyas condemned the kidnapping meanwhile , the president of germany ’ s muslim community , nadeem elyas , said he had written a letter to the 57-nation organization of the islamic conference , asking leaders who are due to meet later this week in saudi arabia to launch an initiative for osthoff 's release . i would consider every possible means of saving her life , " he said , and called on muslim leaders around the world to speak out against abuse of islam 's peaceful teachings . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel issues emergency appeal for german hostage in iraq german chancellor angela merkel issued a joint appeal with other leading figures sunday for the release of a german archaeologist abducted in iraq as the reported deadline for meeting the kidnappers ' demands passed .

a un climate conference in montreal says the strategy is costly . against a background of melting polar caps , rising sea levels and natural disasters , international experts are meeting in montreal this week to discuss new targets for curbs on greenhouse gases . the figures are daunting .
according to the german institute for economic research , natural disasters will incur around $ 200 billion worth of damage over the next few decades . insurance company münchner rück , meanwhile , has calculated that financial damages wrought by storms , floods and earthquakes have increased ten-fold in the last 50 years . mutual concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new orleans the business community is beginning to wake up to the broader repercussions of environmental devastation .
ecological concerns are business concerns - but , as many have pointed out in montreal , business concerns are also ecological concerns . " environmental protection has to begin with industry , " said axel michaelowa , a climate researcher at the hamburg world economy institute .
" the main emitters of greenhouse gases are steel refineries and power companies , and it 's time they started developing affordable ways of reducing emissions . " some companies are already taking the initiative - including the world 's largest company , us giant general electric . " we 've seen this threat coming and it 's time to act , " said ceo jeffrey immelt - not least motivated by the fact that these days , global financial markets also keep a close eye on companies ' environmental strategies . government targets michaelowa is quick to point out that these strategies need careful monitoring - and should n't be left to individual companies to fine-tune at their own discretion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the clean development mechanism supports clean energy projects in poorer nations " the state needs to set out clear frameworks , " he said , pointing out that experience in germany and japan has showed that self-determining targets can have disappointing results .
" targets for curbing emissions need to be decided by governments , " he stressed . otherwise , he explained , companies simply postpone the issue .
" environmental damage seems like a very distant concern to most companies , " he said , emphasizing that long-term thinking is key to solving the problem . " ideally , we would have a 10 or 15-year plan , " he said .
" most big companies ' investments have a life-span of 10 to 30 years .
the talks in montreal have to spell out that climate protection goes beyond 2012 , when the first phase of the kyoto protocol runs out . " the benefits the international energy agency , meanwhile , has calculated that the energy sector will require an investment of $ 16 billion over the next 25 years . but the german economy may well end up enjoying a piece of the pie . # b # " there are a number of german companies in the field of renewables and energy efficient technology that could profit from the growing demand on the world market , " said michaelowa .
" the kyoto protocol 's ' clean development mechanism ' funds environmental protection projects in developing countries , so there 's a vast export potential . " ultimately , said michaelowa , the environmental protection market is similar to the internet boom of the early 1990s , and businesses with major growth potential are currently proliferating .

a un climate conference in montreal says the strategy is costly . against a background of melting polar caps , rising sea levels and natural disasters , international experts are meeting in montreal this week to discuss new targets for curbs on greenhouse gases . the figures are daunting .
according to the german institute for economic research , natural disasters will incur around $ 200 billion worth of damage over the next few decades . insurance company münchner rück , meanwhile , has calculated that financial damages wrought by storms , floods and earthquakes have increased ten-fold in the last 50 years . mutual concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new orleans the business community is beginning to wake up to the broader repercussions of environmental devastation .
ecological concerns are business concerns - but , as many have pointed out in montreal , business concerns are also ecological concerns . " environmental protection has to begin with industry , " said axel michaelowa , a climate researcher at the hamburg world economy institute .
" the main emitters of greenhouse gases are steel refineries and power companies , and it 's time they started developing affordable ways of reducing emissions . " some companies are already taking the initiative - including the world 's largest company , us giant general electric . " we 've seen this threat coming and it 's time to act , " said ceo jeffrey immelt - not least motivated by the fact that these days , global financial markets also keep a close eye on companies ' environmental strategies . government targets michaelowa is quick to point out that these strategies need careful monitoring - and should n't be left to individual companies to fine-tune at their own discretion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the clean development mechanism supports clean energy projects in poorer nations " the state needs to set out clear frameworks , " he said , pointing out that experience in germany and japan has showed that self-determining targets can have disappointing results .
" targets for curbing emissions need to be decided by governments , " he stressed . otherwise , he explained , companies simply postpone the issue .
" environmental damage seems like a very distant concern to most companies , " he said , emphasizing that long-term thinking is key to solving the problem . " ideally , we would have a 10 or 15-year plan , " he said .
" most big companies ' investments have a life-span of 10 to 30 years .
the talks in montreal have to spell out that climate protection goes beyond 2012 , when the first phase of the kyoto protocol runs out . " the benefits the international energy agency , meanwhile , has calculated that the energy sector will require an investment of $ 16 billion over the next 25 years . but the german economy may well end up enjoying a piece of the pie . # b # " there are a number of german companies in the field of renewables and energy efficient technology that could profit from the growing demand on the world market , " said michaelowa .
" the kyoto protocol 's ' clean development mechanism ' funds environmental protection projects in developing countries , so there 's a vast export potential . " ultimately , said michaelowa , the environmental protection market is similar to the internet boom of the early 1990s , and businesses with major growth potential are currently proliferating .

the bloc is passing the buck on to brazil and at the same time , trying to bring poor countries to its side . the european union is frustrated .
it makes concessions , opens up it markets , but is still called responsible for the fact that global trade negotiations are sluggish and accused of rowing against the tide in the run-up to the wto trade conference in hong kong from december 13 to 18 . " we are offering to reduce subsidies that distort trade by 70 percent , " said eu trade commissioner peter mandelson , referring to an offer the eu made on october 28 .
" we can do that thanks to reforms that have already been decided and put into place . " he says there is no reason to doubt the motives , or behavior , of the eu , and that the bloc 's accommodation in trade matters has not been appreciated by its trading partners . the blame game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union commissioner for trade peter mandelson mandelson 's critique is aimed fairly squarely at the group of developing nations , the so-called g-20 , and especially at the group 's mouthpiece , brazil . the brazilians have been at odds with the eu for years over agricultural policy .
indeed , it was the complaint they filed with the wto that forced the eu to reform its highly subsidized sugar industry .
but now brazil is arguing the eu suggestions do n't go far enough to improve market access for top brazilian exports like beef . " how can they think that they do n't see a decided advantage when we we 're willing to lower our highest tariff rate by 60 percent ? " asked the deputy departmental head of the eu agricultural section , flavio coturini . the eu offer in the agricultural sector for the hong kong conference consists of three parts : 1 . to completely abolish eu export subsidies . 2 . to reduce other rated subsidies by 70 percent , especially those seen as distorting free trade . 3 . to reduce agricultural tariffs by as much as 60 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beef is a leading brazilian export however , some eight percent of products should be exempt from this reduction .
brussels would like to protect its so-called " sensitive goods " from foreign competitors .
beef falls within this category , which angers the south americans , since they see a potentially large market for their beef in europe . hard fronts there wo n't be any further concessions , according to the eu commission , the bloc 's executive body .
in exchange for their agricultural largess , the eu calls for concessions by other countries in the areas of services and industrial goods . " there must be real economic gains , new streams of commerce , " said david o 'sullivan , the eu 's director-general for trade .
" we think our suggestions provide that .
we expect similar concessions from our negotiating partners .
and to be honest , what the brazilians have offered us regarding non-agricultural goods does n't really provide better market access for the products that we are interested in . " but brazil and its foreign minister celso amorim are still playing poker , saying that before they comply with eu demands , the bloc needs to offer a more attractive agricultural deal . " there will be no counter offers , " said an irritated mandelson .
" there are no possible deals during these negotiations if the only topic is market access in the agricultural sector .
that is the problem . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world trade organization 's director-general french pascal lamy the state of negotiations in the run-up to hong kong is not great .
the working paper put forward by the wto director pascal lamy is vague and inconcrete .
analysts say many of these issues should have been settled over two years ago .
but conflicting demands have lead to a stalemate . the eu wants to break out of its isolation and is trying to bring the poorest countries over to its side by means of a development package .
but poor countries would actually gain very little from improved eu market access , since they are already allowed to export most of their goods to the bloc without paying duty . opportunity lost ? peter mandelson is now trying to increase pressure on brazil to keep the wto talks from ending in failure . " that would ruin a huge economic opportunity , " he said , " it would also be very harmful to the wto and could turn back the clock on global multilateralism . " " i believe that europe carries a greater responsibility than others do to bring this round -lrb- of talks -rrb- forward and that is what we 're going to do . " while he is not counting on a breakthrough in hong kong , he says it is crucial to codify what has already been accomplished .

" how can they think that they do n't see a decided advantage when we we 're willing to lower our highest tariff rate by 60 percent ?

beef falls within this category , which angers the south americans , since they see a potentially large market for their beef in europe . hard fronts there wo n't be any further concessions , according to the eu commission , the bloc 's executive body .
in exchange for their agricultural largess , the eu calls for concessions by other countries in the areas of services and industrial goods . " there must be real economic gains , new streams of commerce , " said david o 'sullivan , the eu 's director-general for trade .
" we think our suggestions provide that .
we expect similar concessions from our negotiating partners .

allegations of secret cia prisons and flights across europe overshadow us secretary of state condoleezza rice 's visit .
europe should n't be satisfied with half-hearted answers , says dw 's klaus dahmann . if condoleezza rice is to be believed , then the united states preserves the world from the evil of terror , and america is a country that adheres to human rights in everything it does . transporting prisoners from one country to another where torture may be applied as a means to help along investigations - no , that 's not something the united states does or ever did do .
the united states does n't use air space nor the airports of other countries to transport prisoners to torture cellars . if you believe rice , that is . then all speculations about secret cia prisons in poland and romania have been " misunderstandings . "
the us only takes care of the " first and oldest duty of every government " - protecting its people . too quiet for too long ? europe can not and should not be satisfied with these answers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cia prison in kosovo ?
firstly , the american secretary of state still has n't answered the central question : does or did the cia maintain secret prisons in european countries ? secondly , a lawless place already exists in the form of guantanamo .
that the cia has used torture there has not only been confirmed by victims and human rights organizations such as amnesty international , but also former members of the us intelligence service . it 's clear that the torture allegations are not just a domestic american issue - and not only so since european governments have come under suspicion of knowing about this . europe 's criticism of guantanamo and other prisons used by the us government to interrogate terrorists and terror suspects has been too quiet in the past .
european politicians too quickly retracted to the standpoint that the us government is obligated by its country 's constitution to uphold democratic principles and the rule of law . upholding democracy 's highest values bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice and merkel at a news conference tuesday no one can accept that exactly these values are trampled on to defend democratic societies and values in the fight against terror .
german chancellor angela merkel was right to emphasize this on tuesday . torture methods of any kind have to remain banned from the repertoire of the military and the intelligence community - even if you risk failure in preventing a planned terrorist attack because of it .
the violation of human rights can not be weighed against even worse human rights violations that could potentially be prevented this way . the german government has to stand up for its values , despite its commitment to a trans-atlantic partnership and the fight against terrorism .
and that 's why it not only has to uncover the alleged cognizance of the previous government regarding cia activities , but it also must put pressure on the us government until washington offers full disclosure . paying lip service is not enough . klaus dahmann -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rice aides slam comment that us made " mistake " german chancellor angela merkel said tuesday that the us government admitted that a german national had been wrongfully abducted after cia officials believed him to be a terror suspect .

" the american administration has admitted that this man was erroneously taken , " merkel told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el-masri says he was kept in afghanistan for five months but senior us officials , who are travelling with rice on her european tour , disagreed with merkel 's interpretation .
after the news conference , they met with the chancellor 's aides and asked for a explanation , saying rice had not actually admitted to a us mistake over masri . " we are not quite sure what was in her head , " a senior us administration official told reuters . he said while the bush administration had informed germany about masri 's detention and release , he did not say it was an error on the us government 's part . the official went on to say that the german chancellor might have been drawing on media reports rather than any dialog with the us administration when she concluded that washington had admitted to a mistake . masri was released last year after five months in an afghan jail after the united states realized it " no longer had evidence or intelligence to justify his continued detention , " the official said , but declined to respond when asked if the us had ever had evidence to hold him . he did acknowledge that masri was originally detained because of a suspicion that he had a false passport and had the same name as a militant leader .
the passport turned out to be genuine , the official added . the case caused an uproar in germany after recent news reports that former interior minister otto schily had been informed about the wrongful abduction by the then us ambassador in germany . reports about secret cia flights to transport terror suspects across german air space and to us air bases in germany have also strained relations in the last weeks .
the us is also facing criticism for allegedly operating secret cia prisons in eastern europe . rice : a case for the courts saying that masri 's case was a matter for litigation , rice declined to comment on it , but did say that the us was ready to correct its mistakes , which could have led merkel to make the comments she did . " any policy will result in errors , " she said .
" when mistakes are made , we work very hard to rectify them .
i believe that this will be handled in the proper courts , here in germany and if necessary in american courts as well . " rice also reiterated her view that her government could not reveal details about us intelligence agencies . " we have to have intelligence that can be effective , " she said .
" without good intelligence , you can simply not protect innocent civilians from the kind of attacks that we 've witnessed around the globe . " merkel sees intensified relationship rice added that washington was adhering to national and international laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said rice 's statement is a good basis for intelligence cooperation " the us does not condone torture , " she said .
" it is against us law to commit torture and it 's also against the us ' international obligations .
the president has made it very clear that us personnel will operate within us law and international obligations . " merkel said that she was glad rice had reiterated the us administration 's commitment to international laws .

" the american administration has admitted that this man was erroneously taken , " merkel told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el-masri says he was kept in afghanistan for five months but senior us officials , who are travelling with rice on her european tour , disagreed with merkel 's interpretation .
after the news conference , they met with the chancellor 's aides and asked for a explanation , saying rice had not actually admitted to a us mistake over masri . " we are not quite sure what was in her head , " a senior us administration official told reuters . he said while the bush administration had informed germany about masri 's detention and release , he did not say it was an error on the us government 's part . the official went on to say that the german chancellor might have been drawing on media reports rather than any dialog with the us administration when she concluded that washington had admitted to a mistake . masri was released last year after five months in an afghan jail after the united states realized it " no longer had evidence or intelligence to justify his continued detention , " the official said , but declined to respond when asked if the us had ever had evidence to hold him . he did acknowledge that masri was originally detained because of a suspicion that he had a false passport and had the same name as a militant leader .
the passport turned out to be genuine , the official added . the case caused an uproar in germany after recent news reports that former interior minister otto schily had been informed about the wrongful abduction by the then us ambassador in germany . reports about secret cia flights to transport terror suspects across german air space and to us air bases in germany have also strained relations in the last weeks .
the us is also facing criticism for allegedly operating secret cia prisons in eastern europe . rice : a case for the courts saying that masri 's case was a matter for litigation , rice declined to comment on it , but did say that the us was ready to correct its mistakes , which could have led merkel to make the comments she did . " any policy will result in errors , " she said .
" when mistakes are made , we work very hard to rectify them .
i believe that this will be handled in the proper courts , here in germany and if necessary in american courts as well . " rice also reiterated her view that her government could not reveal details about us intelligence agencies . " we have to have intelligence that can be effective , " she said .
" without good intelligence , you can simply not protect innocent civilians from the kind of attacks that we 've witnessed around the globe . " merkel sees intensified relationship rice added that washington was adhering to national and international laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said rice 's statement is a good basis for intelligence cooperation " the us does not condone torture , " she said .
" it is against us law to commit torture and it 's also against the us ' international obligations .
the president has made it very clear that us personnel will operate within us law and international obligations . " merkel said that she was glad rice had reiterated the us administration 's commitment to international laws . " it was important for me that the secretary of state repeated this , that the united states sticks to its international obligations , " she said , adding that she was looking forward to continuing to build an " intensified relationship between our two countries " during her upcoming visit to washington in january . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : us closes secret cia prisons ahead of rice visit the us has reportedly shut down two secret cia prisons in poland and romania just ahead of us secretary of state rice 's visit to europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany still lighting up much of europe bans smoking ; germany keeps puffing away germany : european smoker 's paradise germany gets eu slap on the wrist over tobacco laws tobacco companies see clouds in germany germany -pipe- 06.12.2005 germany 's close ties to big tobacco großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has the eu 's highest percentage of female smokers top german researchers have been paid off by the tobacco industry to play down the health effects of smoking , a study says .
meanwhile , the federal government is fighting an eu ban on tobacco advertising . some 37 percent of germans smoke , one of the highest levels in the european union .
among women smokers , germany is at the very top .
according to health experts , one of the reasons for this is the fact that many of the country 's most renowned public health experts long played down the damaging effects of lighting up - often because they were in the pay of large tobacco concerns . the study , published in the american journal of public health , says many experts worked hand in hand since the 1970 's with firms such as r.j. reynolds and philip morris to " manipulate and skew " the mounting evidence that smoking could be deadly , largely because they received research money from the cigarette manufacturers . the leading author of the study , berlin researcher thilo grüning , cites the example of one of german medicine 's biggest names , fritz kemper , long-time professor at the university of münster , talented toxicologist , and member of germany 's top medical committees .
in 2002 , he received the große verdienstkreuz , one of germany 's highest civilian honors . but grüning also found that kemper was a key scientific ally to big tobacco .
in one year , according to internal documents the study examined , he received $ 20,000 dollars from r.j. reynolds , the maker of camel cigarettes , for informing the multinational about the activities of german scientists and politicians in the area of tobacco . influence on study results after the united states , germany was one of the most important bases for the tobacco lobby .
as early as 1975 , the cigarette industry association vdc founded a " research council on smoking and health . "
but the committee turned out to be less than independent and due to the purse strings attached to the millions going to the committee , the tobacco industry had " a significant influence " on the results the panel of top health experts released . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking rates in germany are higher than they should be , experts say if investigations into the effects of tobacco smoking did not fit the desires of the industry , results were often played down .
for example , franz adlkofer , a leading german tobacco researcher , assured his colleagues in the us that one study about nicotine as a carcinogenic would be " hidden , " another studied would " guaranteed not be published . " martina pötschke-langer , head of the center for tobacco control at the world health organization in heidelberg , told the newsmagazine der spiegel that the roll of leading german health experts in covering up the harmful effects of tobacco was " shocking . " " presumably many fewer people would die today from tobacco if medical professionals would have taken the results they found on the consequences of smoking seriously , " she said . so for , only one german research institute , the cancer research center in heidelberg , passed an ethical code banning it from accepting funding from the tobacco industry .
that was just at the beginning of november - this year . germany fights eu ban meanwhile , the tobacco industry continues to enjoy something of a comfortable position in germany as the new government continues to fight against an eu ban on all tobacco advertising that the predecessor government under gerhard schröder began .
the government will make its position clear when the case is argued before the european court of justice on tuesday . since july , newspaper , radio and internet sites across the eu are prohibitted from advertising tobacco products .
however , the ban is being effectively ignored by many countries , including germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : r1 cigarette advertisement billboard , germany , photo 2000/10/5 a spokesman for the government said the case is not about the health effects of smoking , but whether the eu has the right to pass a ban against national advertising that does not cross international borders .
according to berlin , the eu 's jurisdiction does not extend to domestic advertising . but david byrne , a former eu health commissioner , says germany in particular is in need of stricter rules on tobacco ads . " in germany , 37 percent of the population smokes and there are lax regulations on tobacco advertising , " he said .
" in sweden there are stronger laws and only 19 percent of the population smokes . " the german newspaper and magazine publishing associations are also opposed to the ban , saying they fear that the advertising ban could lead to similar bans in other industries .
it is the second time the german government has gone before the eu 's highest court to argue against the ban .
a decision is expected in 2006 . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tobacco companies see clouds in germany politicians want next year 's world cup smoke-free .

meanwhile , the federal government is fighting an eu ban on tobacco advertising . some 37 percent of germans smoke , one of the highest levels in the european union .
among women smokers , germany is at the very top .
according to health experts , one of the reasons for this is the fact that many of the country 's most renowned public health experts long played down the damaging effects of lighting up - often because they were in the pay of large tobacco concerns . the study , published in the american journal of public health , says many experts worked hand in hand since the 1970 's with firms such as r.j. reynolds and philip morris to " manipulate and skew " the mounting evidence that smoking could be deadly , largely because they received research money from the cigarette manufacturers . the leading author of the study , berlin researcher thilo grüning , cites the example of one of german medicine 's biggest names , fritz kemper , long-time professor at the university of münster , talented toxicologist , and member of germany 's top medical committees .
in 2002 , he received the große verdienstkreuz , one of germany 's highest civilian honors . but grüning also found that kemper was a key scientific ally to big tobacco .
in one year , according to internal documents the study examined , he received $ 20,000 dollars from r.j. reynolds , the maker of camel cigarettes , for informing the multinational about the activities of german scientists and politicians in the area of tobacco . influence on study results after the united states , germany was one of the most important bases for the tobacco lobby .
as early as 1975 , the cigarette industry association vdc founded a " research council on smoking and health . "
but the committee turned out to be less than independent and due to the purse strings attached to the millions going to the committee , the tobacco industry had " a significant influence " on the results the panel of top health experts released . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking rates in germany are higher than they should be , experts say if investigations into the effects of tobacco smoking did not fit the desires of the industry , results were often played down .
for example , franz adlkofer , a leading german tobacco researcher , assured his colleagues in the us that one study about nicotine as a carcinogenic would be " hidden , " another studied would " guaranteed not be published . " martina pötschke-langer , head of the center for tobacco control at the world health organization in heidelberg , told the newsmagazine der spiegel that the roll of leading german health experts in covering up the harmful effects of tobacco was " shocking . " " presumably many fewer people would die today from tobacco if medical professionals would have taken the results they found on the consequences of smoking seriously , " she said . so for , only one german research institute , the cancer research center in heidelberg , passed an ethical code banning it from accepting funding from the tobacco industry .
that was just at the beginning of november - this year . germany fights eu ban meanwhile , the tobacco industry continues to enjoy something of a comfortable position in germany as the new government continues to fight against an eu ban on all tobacco advertising that the predecessor government under gerhard schröder began .
the government will make its position clear when the case is argued before the european court of justice on tuesday . since july , newspaper , radio and internet sites across the eu are prohibitted from advertising tobacco products .
however , the ban is being effectively ignored by many countries , including germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : r1 cigarette advertisement billboard , germany , photo 2000/10/5 a spokesman for the government said the case is not about the health effects of smoking , but whether the eu has the right to pass a ban against national advertising that does not cross international borders .
according to berlin , the eu 's jurisdiction does not extend to domestic advertising . but david byrne , a former eu health commissioner , says germany in particular is in need of stricter rules on tobacco ads . " in germany , 37 percent of the population smokes and there are lax regulations on tobacco advertising , " he said .
" in sweden there are stronger laws and only 19 percent of the population smokes . " the german newspaper and magazine publishing associations are also opposed to the ban , saying they fear that the advertising ban could lead to similar bans in other industries .
it is the second time the german government has gone before the eu 's highest court to argue against the ban .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany still lighting up much of europe bans smoking ; germany keeps puffing away germany : european smoker 's paradise germany gets eu slap on the wrist over tobacco laws tobacco companies see clouds in germany germany -pipe- 06.12.2005 germany 's close ties to big tobacco großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has the eu 's highest percentage of female smokers top german researchers have been paid off by the tobacco industry to play down the health effects of smoking , a study says .
meanwhile , the federal government is fighting an eu ban on tobacco advertising . some 37 percent of germans smoke , one of the highest levels in the european union .
among women smokers , germany is at the very top .
according to health experts , one of the reasons for this is the fact that many of the country 's most renowned public health experts long played down the damaging effects of lighting up - often because they were in the pay of large tobacco concerns . the study , published in the american journal of public health , says many experts worked hand in hand since the 1970 's with firms such as r.j. reynolds and philip morris to " manipulate and skew " the mounting evidence that smoking could be deadly , largely because they received research money from the cigarette manufacturers . the leading author of the study , berlin researcher thilo grüning , cites the example of one of german medicine 's biggest names , fritz kemper , long-time professor at the university of münster , talented toxicologist , and member of germany 's top medical committees .
in 2002 , he received the große verdienstkreuz , one of germany 's highest civilian honors . but grüning also found that kemper was a key scientific ally to big tobacco .
in one year , according to internal documents the study examined , he received $ 20,000 dollars from r.j. reynolds , the maker of camel cigarettes , for informing the multinational about the activities of german scientists and politicians in the area of tobacco . influence on study results after the united states , germany was one of the most important bases for the tobacco lobby .
as early as 1975 , the cigarette industry association vdc founded a " research council on smoking and health . "
but the committee turned out to be less than independent and due to the purse strings attached to the millions going to the committee , the tobacco industry had " a significant influence " on the results the panel of top health experts released . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking rates in germany are higher than they should be , experts say if investigations into the effects of tobacco smoking did not fit the desires of the industry , results were often played down .
for example , franz adlkofer , a leading german tobacco researcher , assured his colleagues in the us that one study about nicotine as a carcinogenic would be " hidden , " another studied would " guaranteed not be published . " martina pötschke-langer , head of the center for tobacco control at the world health organization in heidelberg , told the newsmagazine der spiegel that the roll of leading german health experts in covering up the harmful effects of tobacco was " shocking . " " presumably many fewer people would die today from tobacco if medical professionals would have taken the results they found on the consequences of smoking seriously , " she said . so for , only one german research institute , the cancer research center in heidelberg , passed an ethical code banning it from accepting funding from the tobacco industry .
that was just at the beginning of november - this year . germany fights eu ban meanwhile , the tobacco industry continues to enjoy something of a comfortable position in germany as the new government continues to fight against an eu ban on all tobacco advertising that the predecessor government under gerhard schröder began .
the government will make its position clear when the case is argued before the european court of justice on tuesday . since july , newspaper , radio and internet sites across the eu are prohibitted from advertising tobacco products .
however , the ban is being effectively ignored by many countries , including germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : r1 cigarette advertisement billboard , germany , photo 2000/10/5 a spokesman for the government said the case is not about the health effects of smoking , but whether the eu has the right to pass a ban against national advertising that does not cross international borders .

" the american administration has admitted that this man was erroneously taken , " merkel told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el-masri says he was kept in afghanistan for five months but senior us officials , who are travelling with rice on her european tour , disagreed with merkel 's interpretation .
after the news conference , they met with the chancellor 's aides and asked for a explanation , saying rice had not actually admitted to a us mistake over masri . " we are not quite sure what was in her head , " a senior us administration official told reuters . he said while the bush administration had informed germany about masri 's detention and release , he did not say it was an error on the us government 's part . the official went on to say that the german chancellor might have been drawing on media reports rather than any dialog with the us administration when she concluded that washington had admitted to a mistake . masri was released last year after five months in an afghan jail after the united states realized it " no longer had evidence or intelligence to justify his continued detention , " the official said , but declined to respond when asked if the us had ever had evidence to hold him . he did acknowledge that masri was originally detained because of a suspicion that he had a false passport and had the same name as a militant leader .
the passport turned out to be genuine , the official added . the case caused an uproar in germany after recent news reports that former interior minister otto schily had been informed about the wrongful abduction by the then us ambassador in germany . reports about secret cia flights to transport terror suspects across german air space and to us air bases in germany have also strained relations in the last weeks .
the us is also facing criticism for allegedly operating secret cia prisons in eastern europe . rice : a case for the courts saying that masri 's case was a matter for litigation , rice declined to comment on it , but did say that the us was ready to correct its mistakes , which could have led merkel to make the comments she did . " any policy will result in errors , " she said .
" when mistakes are made , we work very hard to rectify them .
i believe that this will be handled in the proper courts , here in germany and if necessary in american courts as well . " rice also reiterated her view that her government could not reveal details about us intelligence agencies . " we have to have intelligence that can be effective , " she said .
" without good intelligence , you can simply not protect innocent civilians from the kind of attacks that we 've witnessed around the globe . " merkel sees intensified relationship rice added that washington was adhering to national and international laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said rice 's statement is a good basis for intelligence cooperation " the us does not condone torture , " she said .
" it is against us law to commit torture and it 's also against the us ' international obligations .
the president has made it very clear that us personnel will operate within us law and international obligations . " merkel said that she was glad rice had reiterated the us administration 's commitment to international laws .

" the american administration has admitted that this man was erroneously taken , " merkel told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el-masri says he was kept in afghanistan for five months but senior us officials , who are travelling with rice on her european tour , disagreed with merkel 's interpretation .
after the news conference , they met with the chancellor 's aides and asked for a explanation , saying rice had not actually admitted to a us mistake over masri . " we are not quite sure what was in her head , " a senior us administration official told reuters . he said while the bush administration had informed germany about masri 's detention and release , he did not say it was an error on the us government 's part . the official went on to say that the german chancellor might have been drawing on media reports rather than any dialog with the us administration when she concluded that washington had admitted to a mistake . masri was released last year after five months in an afghan jail after the united states realized it " no longer had evidence or intelligence to justify his continued detention , " the official said , but declined to respond when asked if the us had ever had evidence to hold him . he did acknowledge that masri was originally detained because of a suspicion that he had a false passport and had the same name as a militant leader .
the passport turned out to be genuine , the official added . the case caused an uproar in germany after recent news reports that former interior minister otto schily had been informed about the wrongful abduction by the then us ambassador in germany . reports about secret cia flights to transport terror suspects across german air space and to us air bases in germany have also strained relations in the last weeks .

" when mistakes are made , we work very hard to rectify them .
i believe that this will be handled in the proper courts , here in germany and if necessary in american courts as well . " rice also reiterated her view that her government could not reveal details about us intelligence agencies . " we have to have intelligence that can be effective , " she said .
" without good intelligence , you can simply not protect innocent civilians from the kind of attacks that we 've witnessed around the globe . " merkel sees intensified relationship rice added that washington was adhering to national and international laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said rice 's statement is a good basis for intelligence cooperation " the us does not condone torture , " she said .
" it is against us law to commit torture and it 's also against the us ' international obligations .
the president has made it very clear that us personnel will operate within us law and international obligations . " merkel said that she was glad rice had reiterated the us administration 's commitment to international laws .

she 's not informing german chancellor merkel directly and instead made remarks before her departure to berlin when the european union and the european council asked for information .
" the statement turned out as expected , " the paper continued , saying that rice merely confirmed the existence of such flights .
" rice of course denies that terror suspects are moved to places where they can be tortured .
believe it if you want to .
at the very least , there 's guantanamo , where suspects have been kept without seeing lawyers or a judge for years . " berlin 's der tagesspiegel said that germans and europeans should look at the basis of the conflict : " how are terrorists meant to be treated ?

meanwhile , the federal government is fighting an eu ban on tobacco advertising . some 37 percent of germans smoke , one of the highest levels in the european union .
among women smokers , germany is at the very top .
according to health experts , one of the reasons for this is the fact that many of the country 's most renowned public health experts long played down the damaging effects of lighting up - often because they were in the pay of large tobacco concerns . the study , published in the american journal of public health , says many experts worked hand in hand since the 1970 's with firms such as r.j. reynolds and philip morris to " manipulate and skew " the mounting evidence that smoking could be deadly , largely because they received research money from the cigarette manufacturers . the leading author of the study , berlin researcher thilo grüning , cites the example of one of german medicine 's biggest names , fritz kemper , long-time professor at the university of münster , talented toxicologist , and member of germany 's top medical committees .
in 2002 , he received the große verdienstkreuz , one of germany 's highest civilian honors . but grüning also found that kemper was a key scientific ally to big tobacco .
in one year , according to internal documents the study examined , he received $ 20,000 dollars from r.j. reynolds , the maker of camel cigarettes , for informing the multinational about the activities of german scientists and politicians in the area of tobacco . influence on study results after the united states , germany was one of the most important bases for the tobacco lobby .
as early as 1975 , the cigarette industry association vdc founded a " research council on smoking and health . "
but the committee turned out to be less than independent and due to the purse strings attached to the millions going to the committee , the tobacco industry had " a significant influence " on the results the panel of top health experts released . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking rates in germany are higher than they should be , experts say if investigations into the effects of tobacco smoking did not fit the desires of the industry , results were often played down .
for example , franz adlkofer , a leading german tobacco researcher , assured his colleagues in the us that one study about nicotine as a carcinogenic would be " hidden , " another studied would " guaranteed not be published . " martina pötschke-langer , head of the center for tobacco control at the world health organization in heidelberg , told the newsmagazine der spiegel that the roll of leading german health experts in covering up the harmful effects of tobacco was " shocking . " " presumably many fewer people would die today from tobacco if medical professionals would have taken the results they found on the consequences of smoking seriously , " she said . so for , only one german research institute , the cancer research center in heidelberg , passed an ethical code banning it from accepting funding from the tobacco industry .
that was just at the beginning of november - this year . germany fights eu ban meanwhile , the tobacco industry continues to enjoy something of a comfortable position in germany as the new government continues to fight against an eu ban on all tobacco advertising that the predecessor government under gerhard schröder began .
the government will make its position clear when the case is argued before the european court of justice on tuesday . since july , newspaper , radio and internet sites across the eu are prohibitted from advertising tobacco products .
however , the ban is being effectively ignored by many countries , including germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : r1 cigarette advertisement billboard , germany , photo 2000/10/5 a spokesman for the government said the case is not about the health effects of smoking , but whether the eu has the right to pass a ban against national advertising that does not cross international borders .
according to berlin , the eu 's jurisdiction does not extend to domestic advertising . but david byrne , a former eu health commissioner , says germany in particular is in need of stricter rules on tobacco ads . " in germany , 37 percent of the population smokes and there are lax regulations on tobacco advertising , " he said .
" in sweden there are stronger laws and only 19 percent of the population smokes . " the german newspaper and magazine publishing associations are also opposed to the ban , saying they fear that the advertising ban could lead to similar bans in other industries .

the chancellor said rice had admitted during their meeting that the united states had made a mistake in masri 's case . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice and merkel in berlin tuesday " we talked about this one case which , of course , was accepted as a mistake by the us administration , " merkel told reporters .
" i 'm glad that rice told me that mistakes would be corrected . " there has been widespread condemnation in europe of reports of secret cia prisons , known as " black sites , " used to interrogate and allegedly torture terror suspects after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks on the united states . the agency also allegedly used airports across europe to transport the suspects . us officials have consistently refused to confirm the existence of the covert prisons or flights while defending the us right to adopt tough anti-terrorism tactics . detained and drugged masri , an unemployed car salesman , told a press conference via satellite link he was detained on dec .
31 , 2003 as he was heading on a bus to macedonia for a holiday following a dispute with his wife . he alleged that when the bus reached the serbia-macedonia border , guards confiscated his passport and detained him on suspicion he was linked to the al qaeda terror network . masri said he was drugged before being put on a plane to afghanistan where he was held at a secret cia prison and interrogated for several months .
he said he was held incommunicado long after his innocence was established . he was flown to albania in may 2004 and released without being charged . " extraordinary rendition " the aclu said masri 's abduction and treatment was the direct result of a cia policy known as " extraordinary rendition , " which allows the agency to arrest terrorism suspects and transfer them to other countries for interrogation without going through formal extradition proceedings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cia plane allegedly used to transport terror suspects " kidnapping a foreign national for the purpose of detaining and interrogating him outside the law is contrary to american values , " said anthony romero , executive director of the aclu .
" our government has acted as if it is above the law , " he said , adding that there was a " climate of impunity " in the practices of the us administration . the suit names former cia director george tenet and three companies that owned and operated the airlines used to transport masri . masri seeks damages but romero said the former detainee wanted most of all a " simple acknowledgement " of the wrong done against him and an apology . rice on monday struck a defiant tone before heading on a four-nation european tour , stressing that the us did not engage in torture and defending the right to transfer prisoners around the world for interrogation . masri was reportedly arrested in a case of mistaken identity as after september 11 , the cia had listed a khaled el-masri as a suspect with ties to osama bin laden .

meanwhile , the federal government is fighting an eu ban on tobacco advertising . some 37 percent of germans smoke , one of the highest levels in the european union .
among women smokers , germany is at the very top .
according to health experts , one of the reasons for this is the fact that many of the country 's most renowned public health experts long played down the damaging effects of lighting up - often because they were in the pay of large tobacco concerns . the study , published in the american journal of public health , says many experts worked hand in hand since the 1970 's with firms such as r.j. reynolds and philip morris to " manipulate and skew " the mounting evidence that smoking could be deadly , largely because they received research money from the cigarette manufacturers . the leading author of the study , berlin researcher thilo grüning , cites the example of one of german medicine 's biggest names , fritz kemper , long-time professor at the university of münster , talented toxicologist , and member of germany 's top medical committees .
in 2002 , he received the große verdienstkreuz , one of germany 's highest civilian honors . but grüning also found that kemper was a key scientific ally to big tobacco .
in one year , according to internal documents the study examined , he received $ 20,000 dollars from r.j. reynolds , the maker of camel cigarettes , for informing the multinational about the activities of german scientists and politicians in the area of tobacco . influence on study results after the united states , germany was one of the most important bases for the tobacco lobby .
as early as 1975 , the cigarette industry association vdc founded a " research council on smoking and health . "
but the committee turned out to be less than independent and due to the purse strings attached to the millions going to the committee , the tobacco industry had " a significant influence " on the results the panel of top health experts released . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking rates in germany are higher than they should be , experts say if investigations into the effects of tobacco smoking did not fit the desires of the industry , results were often played down .
for example , franz adlkofer , a leading german tobacco researcher , assured his colleagues in the us that one study about nicotine as a carcinogenic would be " hidden , " another studied would " guaranteed not be published . " martina pötschke-langer , head of the center for tobacco control at the world health organization in heidelberg , told the newsmagazine der spiegel that the roll of leading german health experts in covering up the harmful effects of tobacco was " shocking . " " presumably many fewer people would die today from tobacco if medical professionals would have taken the results they found on the consequences of smoking seriously , " she said . so for , only one german research institute , the cancer research center in heidelberg , passed an ethical code banning it from accepting funding from the tobacco industry .
that was just at the beginning of november - this year . germany fights eu ban meanwhile , the tobacco industry continues to enjoy something of a comfortable position in germany as the new government continues to fight against an eu ban on all tobacco advertising that the predecessor government under gerhard schröder began .
the government will make its position clear when the case is argued before the european court of justice on tuesday . since july , newspaper , radio and internet sites across the eu are prohibitted from advertising tobacco products .
however , the ban is being effectively ignored by many countries , including germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : r1 cigarette advertisement billboard , germany , photo 2000/10/5 a spokesman for the government said the case is not about the health effects of smoking , but whether the eu has the right to pass a ban against national advertising that does not cross international borders .
according to berlin , the eu 's jurisdiction does not extend to domestic advertising . but david byrne , a former eu health commissioner , says germany in particular is in need of stricter rules on tobacco ads . " in germany , 37 percent of the population smokes and there are lax regulations on tobacco advertising , " he said .
" in sweden there are stronger laws and only 19 percent of the population smokes . " the german newspaper and magazine publishing associations are also opposed to the ban , saying they fear that the advertising ban could lead to similar bans in other industries .
it is the second time the german government has gone before the eu 's highest court to argue against the ban .

allegations of secret cia prisons and flights across europe overshadow us secretary of state condoleezza rice 's visit .
europe should n't be satisfied with half-hearted answers , says dw 's klaus dahmann . if condoleezza rice is to be believed , then the united states preserves the world from the evil of terror , and america is a country that adheres to human rights in everything it does . transporting prisoners from one country to another where torture may be applied as a means to help along investigations - no , that 's not something the united states does or ever did do .
the united states does n't use air space nor the airports of other countries to transport prisoners to torture cellars . if you believe rice , that is . then all speculations about secret cia prisons in poland and romania have been " misunderstandings . "
the us only takes care of the " first and oldest duty of every government " - protecting its people . too quiet for too long ? europe can not and should not be satisfied with these answers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cia prison in kosovo ?
firstly , the american secretary of state still has n't answered the central question : does or did the cia maintain secret prisons in european countries ? secondly , a lawless place already exists in the form of guantanamo .
that the cia has used torture there has not only been confirmed by victims and human rights organizations such as amnesty international , but also former members of the us intelligence service . it 's clear that the torture allegations are not just a domestic american issue - and not only so since european governments have come under suspicion of knowing about this . europe 's criticism of guantanamo and other prisons used by the us government to interrogate terrorists and terror suspects has been too quiet in the past .
european politicians too quickly retracted to the standpoint that the us government is obligated by its country 's constitution to uphold democratic principles and the rule of law . upholding democracy 's highest values bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice and merkel at a news conference tuesday no one can accept that exactly these values are trampled on to defend democratic societies and values in the fight against terror .
german chancellor angela merkel was right to emphasize this on tuesday . torture methods of any kind have to remain banned from the repertoire of the military and the intelligence community - even if you risk failure in preventing a planned terrorist attack because of it .
the violation of human rights can not be weighed against even worse human rights violations that could potentially be prevented this way . the german government has to stand up for its values , despite its commitment to a trans-atlantic partnership and the fight against terrorism .
and that 's why it not only has to uncover the alleged cognizance of the previous government regarding cia activities , but it also must put pressure on the us government until washington offers full disclosure . paying lip service is not enough . klaus dahmann -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rice aides slam comment that us made " mistake " german chancellor angela merkel said tuesday that the us government admitted that a german national had been wrongfully abducted after cia officials believed him to be a terror suspect .

she 's not informing german chancellor merkel directly and instead made remarks before her departure to berlin when the european union and the european council asked for information .
" the statement turned out as expected , " the paper continued , saying that rice merely confirmed the existence of such flights .
" rice of course denies that terror suspects are moved to places where they can be tortured .
believe it if you want to .
at the very least , there 's guantanamo , where suspects have been kept without seeing lawyers or a judge for years . " berlin 's der tagesspiegel said that germans and europeans should look at the basis of the conflict : " how are terrorists meant to be treated ?
like common criminals , prisoners of war or something else ? " it asked .
the paper continued that europe should weigh the options carefully and reconsider its stance of moral superiority .
" morals are one thing , fighting terrorism another .
is the geneva convention our only guideline when attacks are to be prevented ?
the us government has deserved to be criticized , but to climb the high horse and benefit from these methods is hypocritical . " several members of germany 's former red-green government should start blushing if reports about their knowledge of the illegal abduction of a german national prove to be true , commented the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung in essen .
" signs are mounting that european governments had some knowledge of human rights abuses , but did n't want to look to carefully , " the paper wrote .
" us president bush consciously ignores international law .
it 's possible that several eu states became compliant accomplices , including berlin . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secretary of state condoleezza rice london 's the independent meanwhile said that rice has been " a rare star in a bush administration that has otherwise stumbled from one mess to another .
the reason is not merely her style and dazzling fashion sense .
european governments have been impressed by her efforts to restore the role of diplomacy in american policy-making , and to re-establish the primacy of the state department -lrb- as opposed to the pentagon and the vice-president 's office -rrb- in that process . "

allegations of secret cia prisons and flights across europe overshadow us secretary of state condoleezza rice 's visit .
europe should n't be satisfied with half-hearted answers , says dw 's klaus dahmann . if condoleezza rice is to be believed , then the united states preserves the world from the evil of terror , and america is a country that adheres to human rights in everything it does . transporting prisoners from one country to another where torture may be applied as a means to help along investigations - no , that 's not something the united states does or ever did do .
the united states does n't use air space nor the airports of other countries to transport prisoners to torture cellars . if you believe rice , that is . then all speculations about secret cia prisons in poland and romania have been " misunderstandings . "
the us only takes care of the " first and oldest duty of every government " - protecting its people . too quiet for too long ? europe can not and should not be satisfied with these answers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cia prison in kosovo ?
firstly , the american secretary of state still has n't answered the central question : does or did the cia maintain secret prisons in european countries ? secondly , a lawless place already exists in the form of guantanamo .
that the cia has used torture there has not only been confirmed by victims and human rights organizations such as amnesty international , but also former members of the us intelligence service . it 's clear that the torture allegations are not just a domestic american issue - and not only so since european governments have come under suspicion of knowing about this . europe 's criticism of guantanamo and other prisons used by the us government to interrogate terrorists and terror suspects has been too quiet in the past .
european politicians too quickly retracted to the standpoint that the us government is obligated by its country 's constitution to uphold democratic principles and the rule of law . upholding democracy 's highest values bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice and merkel at a news conference tuesday no one can accept that exactly these values are trampled on to defend democratic societies and values in the fight against terror .
german chancellor angela merkel was right to emphasize this on tuesday . torture methods of any kind have to remain banned from the repertoire of the military and the intelligence community - even if you risk failure in preventing a planned terrorist attack because of it .
the violation of human rights can not be weighed against even worse human rights violations that could potentially be prevented this way . the german government has to stand up for its values , despite its commitment to a trans-atlantic partnership and the fight against terrorism .
and that 's why it not only has to uncover the alleged cognizance of the previous government regarding cia activities , but it also must put pressure on the us government until washington offers full disclosure . paying lip service is not enough . klaus dahmann -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rice aides slam comment that us made " mistake " german chancellor angela merkel said tuesday that the us government admitted that a german national had been wrongfully abducted after cia officials believed him to be a terror suspect .

the former german government meanwhile has come under pressure in the affair . citing cia sources , us tv channel abc reported that the american intelligence service moved 11 alleged al qaeda operatives from eastern europe to a north african country , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a us air base in romania .
human rights watch said the cia set up secret prisons there cia officials declined to comment on the reports and the polish government said that it was not true .
romania meanwhile plans to open an investigation into the matter .
the country hopes to join the eu by 2007 and brussels has threatened that membership talks could be endangered should the allegations prove to be correct . who knew in berlin ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what did schily know ?
and when ?
officials of germany 's former government have also come under pressure in the affair .
initially , only former interior minister otto schily had been reportedly informed about the wrongful abduction of a german national by cia operatives . but süddeutsche zeitung newspaper reported tuesday that officials at the german chancellery and the foreign ministry also knew about the case of khaled el-masri , who had been abducted to afghanistan .
the man 's lawyer contacted the chancellery and foreign ministry for help and the chancellery promised to get involved in a letter , the paper reported . germany 's intelligence service , bnd , reportedly investigated the case as a result and came to the conclusion that el-masri had been abducted , according to süddeutsche zeitung . opposition calls for investigation opposition leader guido westerwelle of the free-market , liberal free democratic party said that the affairs could seriously damage us-german relations , adding that his party would call for a parliamentary inquiry if necessary to resolve the case . but dieter wiefelspütz , the social democratic party 's security expert in parliament , told deutschlandfunk public radio tuesday morning that people should wait with drawing conclusions before us officials had commented on the situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice and merkel are set to meet on tuesday us secretary of state condoleezza rice , who arrived in berlin late monday and is expected to hold talks with german chancellor angela merkel tuesday , has promised to reply to european concerns over reports that the cia used several european airports and secret jails to transport and detain terrorist suspects . rice : no one forced to work with us but rice , who will also visit romania , ukrain and brussels , also said that she would not comment on the alleged existence of secret cia prisons . " we can not discuss information that would compromise the success of intelligence , law-enforcement and military operations , " she said before leaving the us .
" we expect other nations share this view .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.12.2005 opinion : europe needs to pressure us on cia scandal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is guantanamo proof that europe needs to keep watching the us ?
allegations of secret cia prisons and flights across europe overshadow us secretary of state condoleezza rice 's visit .
europe should n't be satisfied with half-hearted answers , says dw 's klaus dahmann . if condoleezza rice is to be believed , then the united states preserves the world from the evil of terror , and america is a country that adheres to human rights in everything it does . transporting prisoners from one country to another where torture may be applied as a means to help along investigations - no , that 's not something the united states does or ever did do .
the united states does n't use air space nor the airports of other countries to transport prisoners to torture cellars . if you believe rice , that is . then all speculations about secret cia prisons in poland and romania have been " misunderstandings . "
the us only takes care of the " first and oldest duty of every government " - protecting its people . too quiet for too long ? europe can not and should not be satisfied with these answers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cia prison in kosovo ?
firstly , the american secretary of state still has n't answered the central question : does or did the cia maintain secret prisons in european countries ? secondly , a lawless place already exists in the form of guantanamo .
that the cia has used torture there has not only been confirmed by victims and human rights organizations such as amnesty international , but also former members of the us intelligence service . it 's clear that the torture allegations are not just a domestic american issue - and not only so since european governments have come under suspicion of knowing about this . europe 's criticism of guantanamo and other prisons used by the us government to interrogate terrorists and terror suspects has been too quiet in the past .
european politicians too quickly retracted to the standpoint that the us government is obligated by its country 's constitution to uphold democratic principles and the rule of law . upholding democracy 's highest values bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice and merkel at a news conference tuesday no one can accept that exactly these values are trampled on to defend democratic societies and values in the fight against terror .

and when ?
officials of germany 's former government have also come under pressure in the affair .
initially , only former interior minister otto schily had been reportedly informed about the wrongful abduction of a german national by cia operatives . but süddeutsche zeitung newspaper reported tuesday that officials at the german chancellery and the foreign ministry also knew about the case of khaled el-masri , who had been abducted to afghanistan .
the man 's lawyer contacted the chancellery and foreign ministry for help and the chancellery promised to get involved in a letter , the paper reported . germany 's intelligence service , bnd , reportedly investigated the case as a result and came to the conclusion that el-masri had been abducted , according to süddeutsche zeitung . opposition calls for investigation opposition leader guido westerwelle of the free-market , liberal free democratic party said that the affairs could seriously damage us-german relations , adding that his party would call for a parliamentary inquiry if necessary to resolve the case . but dieter wiefelspütz , the social democratic party 's security expert in parliament , told deutschlandfunk public radio tuesday morning that people should wait with drawing conclusions before us officials had commented on the situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice and merkel are set to meet on tuesday us secretary of state condoleezza rice , who arrived in berlin late monday and is expected to hold talks with german chancellor angela merkel tuesday , has promised to reply to european concerns over reports that the cia used several european airports and secret jails to transport and detain terrorist suspects . rice : no one forced to work with us but rice , who will also visit romania , ukrain and brussels , also said that she would not comment on the alleged existence of secret cia prisons . " we can not discuss information that would compromise the success of intelligence , law-enforcement and military operations , " she said before leaving the us .
" we expect other nations share this view .
it 's up to those governments and their citizens to decide if they wish to work with us to prevent terrorist attacks in their own country or other countries .
they have a sovereign right to make that choice . " rice did , however , talk about allegations that the cia touched down at european airports while transporting terrorist suspects to third countries for interrogation , a practice known as rendition .

the former german government meanwhile has come under pressure in the affair . citing cia sources , us tv channel abc reported that the american intelligence service moved 11 alleged al qaeda operatives from eastern europe to a north african country , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a us air base in romania .
human rights watch said the cia set up secret prisons there cia officials declined to comment on the reports and the polish government said that it was not true .
romania meanwhile plans to open an investigation into the matter .
the country hopes to join the eu by 2007 and brussels has threatened that membership talks could be endangered should the allegations prove to be correct . who knew in berlin ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what did schily know ?
and when ?
officials of germany 's former government have also come under pressure in the affair .
initially , only former interior minister otto schily had been reportedly informed about the wrongful abduction of a german national by cia operatives . but süddeutsche zeitung newspaper reported tuesday that officials at the german chancellery and the foreign ministry also knew about the case of khaled el-masri , who had been abducted to afghanistan .
the man 's lawyer contacted the chancellery and foreign ministry for help and the chancellery promised to get involved in a letter , the paper reported . germany 's intelligence service , bnd , reportedly investigated the case as a result and came to the conclusion that el-masri had been abducted , according to süddeutsche zeitung . opposition calls for investigation opposition leader guido westerwelle of the free-market , liberal free democratic party said that the affairs could seriously damage us-german relations , adding that his party would call for a parliamentary inquiry if necessary to resolve the case . but dieter wiefelspütz , the social democratic party 's security expert in parliament , told deutschlandfunk public radio tuesday morning that people should wait with drawing conclusions before us officials had commented on the situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice and merkel are set to meet on tuesday us secretary of state condoleezza rice , who arrived in berlin late monday and is expected to hold talks with german chancellor angela merkel tuesday , has promised to reply to european concerns over reports that the cia used several european airports and secret jails to transport and detain terrorist suspects . rice : no one forced to work with us but rice , who will also visit romania , ukrain and brussels , also said that she would not comment on the alleged existence of secret cia prisons . " we can not discuss information that would compromise the success of intelligence , law-enforcement and military operations , " she said before leaving the us .
" we expect other nations share this view .
it 's up to those governments and their citizens to decide if they wish to work with us to prevent terrorist attacks in their own country or other countries .
they have a sovereign right to make that choice . " rice did , however , talk about allegations that the cia touched down at european airports while transporting terrorist suspects to third countries for interrogation , a practice known as rendition . " renditions take terrorists out of action , they save lives " rice said .
" such renditions are permissible under international law .

the chancellor said rice had admitted during their meeting that the united states had made a mistake in masri 's case . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice and merkel in berlin tuesday " we talked about this one case which , of course , was accepted as a mistake by the us administration , " merkel told reporters .
" i 'm glad that rice told me that mistakes would be corrected . " there has been widespread condemnation in europe of reports of secret cia prisons , known as " black sites , " used to interrogate and allegedly torture terror suspects after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks on the united states . the agency also allegedly used airports across europe to transport the suspects . us officials have consistently refused to confirm the existence of the covert prisons or flights while defending the us right to adopt tough anti-terrorism tactics . detained and drugged masri , an unemployed car salesman , told a press conference via satellite link he was detained on dec .
31 , 2003 as he was heading on a bus to macedonia for a holiday following a dispute with his wife . he alleged that when the bus reached the serbia-macedonia border , guards confiscated his passport and detained him on suspicion he was linked to the al qaeda terror network . masri said he was drugged before being put on a plane to afghanistan where he was held at a secret cia prison and interrogated for several months .
he said he was held incommunicado long after his innocence was established . he was flown to albania in may 2004 and released without being charged . " extraordinary rendition " the aclu said masri 's abduction and treatment was the direct result of a cia policy known as " extraordinary rendition , " which allows the agency to arrest terrorism suspects and transfer them to other countries for interrogation without going through formal extradition proceedings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cia plane allegedly used to transport terror suspects " kidnapping a foreign national for the purpose of detaining and interrogating him outside the law is contrary to american values , " said anthony romero , executive director of the aclu .
" our government has acted as if it is above the law , " he said , adding that there was a " climate of impunity " in the practices of the us administration . the suit names former cia director george tenet and three companies that owned and operated the airlines used to transport masri . masri seeks damages but romero said the former detainee wanted most of all a " simple acknowledgement " of the wrong done against him and an apology . rice on monday struck a defiant tone before heading on a four-nation european tour , stressing that the us did not engage in torture and defending the right to transfer prisoners around the world for interrogation . masri was reportedly arrested in a case of mistaken identity as after september 11 , the cia had listed a khaled el-masri as a suspect with ties to osama bin laden .

the bloc is passing the buck on to brazil and at the same time , trying to bring poor countries to its side . the european union is frustrated .
it makes concessions , opens up it markets , but is still called responsible for the fact that global trade negotiations are sluggish and accused of rowing against the tide in the run-up to the wto trade conference in hong kong from december 13 to 18 . " we are offering to reduce subsidies that distort trade by 70 percent , " said eu trade commissioner peter mandelson , referring to an offer the eu made on october 28 .
" we can do that thanks to reforms that have already been decided and put into place . " he says there is no reason to doubt the motives , or behavior , of the eu , and that the bloc 's accommodation in trade matters has not been appreciated by its trading partners . the blame game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union commissioner for trade peter mandelson mandelson 's critique is aimed fairly squarely at the group of developing nations , the so-called g-20 , and especially at the group 's mouthpiece , brazil . the brazilians have been at odds with the eu for years over agricultural policy .
indeed , it was the complaint they filed with the wto that forced the eu to reform its highly subsidized sugar industry .
but now brazil is arguing the eu suggestions do n't go far enough to improve market access for top brazilian exports like beef . " how can they think that they do n't see a decided advantage when we we 're willing to lower our highest tariff rate by 60 percent ? " asked the deputy departmental head of the eu agricultural section , flavio coturini . the eu offer in the agricultural sector for the hong kong conference consists of three parts : 1 . to completely abolish eu export subsidies . 2 . to reduce other rated subsidies by 70 percent , especially those seen as distorting free trade . 3 . to reduce agricultural tariffs by as much as 60 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beef is a leading brazilian export however , some eight percent of products should be exempt from this reduction .
brussels would like to protect its so-called " sensitive goods " from foreign competitors .
beef falls within this category , which angers the south americans , since they see a potentially large market for their beef in europe . hard fronts there wo n't be any further concessions , according to the eu commission , the bloc 's executive body .
in exchange for their agricultural largess , the eu calls for concessions by other countries in the areas of services and industrial goods . " there must be real economic gains , new streams of commerce , " said david o 'sullivan , the eu 's director-general for trade .
" we think our suggestions provide that .
we expect similar concessions from our negotiating partners .
and to be honest , what the brazilians have offered us regarding non-agricultural goods does n't really provide better market access for the products that we are interested in . " but brazil and its foreign minister celso amorim are still playing poker , saying that before they comply with eu demands , the bloc needs to offer a more attractive agricultural deal . " there will be no counter offers , " said an irritated mandelson .
" there are no possible deals during these negotiations if the only topic is market access in the agricultural sector .
that is the problem . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world trade organization 's director-general french pascal lamy the state of negotiations in the run-up to hong kong is not great .
the working paper put forward by the wto director pascal lamy is vague and inconcrete .
analysts say many of these issues should have been settled over two years ago .
but conflicting demands have lead to a stalemate . the eu wants to break out of its isolation and is trying to bring the poorest countries over to its side by means of a development package .
but poor countries would actually gain very little from improved eu market access , since they are already allowed to export most of their goods to the bloc without paying duty . opportunity lost ? peter mandelson is now trying to increase pressure on brazil to keep the wto talks from ending in failure . " that would ruin a huge economic opportunity , " he said , " it would also be very harmful to the wto and could turn back the clock on global multilateralism . " " i believe that europe carries a greater responsibility than others do to bring this round -lrb- of talks -rrb- forward and that is what we 're going to do . " while he is not counting on a breakthrough in hong kong , he says it is crucial to codify what has already been accomplished .

in exchange for their agricultural largess , the eu calls for concessions by other countries in the areas of services and industrial goods . " there must be real economic gains , new streams of commerce , " said david o 'sullivan , the eu 's director-general for trade .
" we think our suggestions provide that .
we expect similar concessions from our negotiating partners .
and to be honest , what the brazilians have offered us regarding non-agricultural goods does n't really provide better market access for the products that we are interested in . " but brazil and its foreign minister celso amorim are still playing poker , saying that before they comply with eu demands , the bloc needs to offer a more attractive agricultural deal . " there will be no counter offers , " said an irritated mandelson .
" there are no possible deals during these negotiations if the only topic is market access in the agricultural sector .
that is the problem . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world trade organization 's director-general french pascal lamy the state of negotiations in the run-up to hong kong is not great .
the working paper put forward by the wto director pascal lamy is vague and inconcrete .
analysts say many of these issues should have been settled over two years ago .
but conflicting demands have lead to a stalemate . the eu wants to break out of its isolation and is trying to bring the poorest countries over to its side by means of a development package .
but poor countries would actually gain very little from improved eu market access , since they are already allowed to export most of their goods to the bloc without paying duty . opportunity lost ? peter mandelson is now trying to increase pressure on brazil to keep the wto talks from ending in failure . " that would ruin a huge economic opportunity , " he said , " it would also be very harmful to the wto and could turn back the clock on global multilateralism . " " i believe that europe carries a greater responsibility than others do to bring this round -lrb- of talks -rrb- forward and that is what we 're going to do . " while he is not counting on a breakthrough in hong kong , he says it is crucial to codify what has already been accomplished .

the chancellor said rice had admitted during their meeting that the united states had made a mistake in masri 's case . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice and merkel in berlin tuesday " we talked about this one case which , of course , was accepted as a mistake by the us administration , " merkel told reporters .
" i 'm glad that rice told me that mistakes would be corrected . " there has been widespread condemnation in europe of reports of secret cia prisons , known as " black sites , " used to interrogate and allegedly torture terror suspects after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks on the united states . the agency also allegedly used airports across europe to transport the suspects . us officials have consistently refused to confirm the existence of the covert prisons or flights while defending the us right to adopt tough anti-terrorism tactics . detained and drugged masri , an unemployed car salesman , told a press conference via satellite link he was detained on dec .
31 , 2003 as he was heading on a bus to macedonia for a holiday following a dispute with his wife . he alleged that when the bus reached the serbia-macedonia border , guards confiscated his passport and detained him on suspicion he was linked to the al qaeda terror network . masri said he was drugged before being put on a plane to afghanistan where he was held at a secret cia prison and interrogated for several months .
he said he was held incommunicado long after his innocence was established . he was flown to albania in may 2004 and released without being charged . " extraordinary rendition " the aclu said masri 's abduction and treatment was the direct result of a cia policy known as " extraordinary rendition , " which allows the agency to arrest terrorism suspects and transfer them to other countries for interrogation without going through formal extradition proceedings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cia plane allegedly used to transport terror suspects " kidnapping a foreign national for the purpose of detaining and interrogating him outside the law is contrary to american values , " said anthony romero , executive director of the aclu .
" our government has acted as if it is above the law , " he said , adding that there was a " climate of impunity " in the practices of the us administration . the suit names former cia director george tenet and three companies that owned and operated the airlines used to transport masri . masri seeks damages but romero said the former detainee wanted most of all a " simple acknowledgement " of the wrong done against him and an apology . rice on monday struck a defiant tone before heading on a four-nation european tour , stressing that the us did not engage in torture and defending the right to transfer prisoners around the world for interrogation . masri was reportedly arrested in a case of mistaken identity as after september 11 , the cia had listed a khaled el-masri as a suspect with ties to osama bin laden .
that masri is believed to still be at large . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : europe needs to pressure us on cia scandal allegations of secret cia prisons and flights across europe overshadow us secretary of state condoleezza rice 's visit .

collectively the family is worth $ 7.7 billion -lrb- 6.56 billion euros -rrb- . following the death of rudolf august 's father , rudolf oetker , in the verdun killing fields in 1916 , the family business was run by his mother ida and her second husband , richard kaselowsky .

allegations of secret cia prisons and flights across europe overshadow us secretary of state condoleezza rice 's visit .
europe should n't be satisfied with half-hearted answers , says dw 's klaus dahmann . if condoleezza rice is to be believed , then the united states preserves the world from the evil of terror , and america is a country that adheres to human rights in everything it does . transporting prisoners from one country to another where torture may be applied as a means to help along investigations - no , that 's not something the united states does or ever did do .
the united states does n't use air space nor the airports of other countries to transport prisoners to torture cellars . if you believe rice , that is . then all speculations about secret cia prisons in poland and romania have been " misunderstandings . "
the us only takes care of the " first and oldest duty of every government " - protecting its people . too quiet for too long ? europe can not and should not be satisfied with these answers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cia prison in kosovo ?
firstly , the american secretary of state still has n't answered the central question : does or did the cia maintain secret prisons in european countries ? secondly , a lawless place already exists in the form of guantanamo .
that the cia has used torture there has not only been confirmed by victims and human rights organizations such as amnesty international , but also former members of the us intelligence service . it 's clear that the torture allegations are not just a domestic american issue - and not only so since european governments have come under suspicion of knowing about this . europe 's criticism of guantanamo and other prisons used by the us government to interrogate terrorists and terror suspects has been too quiet in the past .
european politicians too quickly retracted to the standpoint that the us government is obligated by its country 's constitution to uphold democratic principles and the rule of law . upholding democracy 's highest values bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice and merkel at a news conference tuesday no one can accept that exactly these values are trampled on to defend democratic societies and values in the fight against terror .
german chancellor angela merkel was right to emphasize this on tuesday . torture methods of any kind have to remain banned from the repertoire of the military and the intelligence community - even if you risk failure in preventing a planned terrorist attack because of it .
the violation of human rights can not be weighed against even worse human rights violations that could potentially be prevented this way . the german government has to stand up for its values , despite its commitment to a trans-atlantic partnership and the fight against terrorism .
and that 's why it not only has to uncover the alleged cognizance of the previous government regarding cia activities , but it also must put pressure on the us government until washington offers full disclosure . paying lip service is not enough . klaus dahmann -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rice aides slam comment that us made " mistake " german chancellor angela merkel said tuesday that the us government admitted that a german national had been wrongfully abducted after cia officials believed him to be a terror suspect .

the former german government meanwhile has come under pressure in the affair . citing cia sources , us tv channel abc reported that the american intelligence service moved 11 alleged al qaeda operatives from eastern europe to a north african country , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a us air base in romania .
human rights watch said the cia set up secret prisons there cia officials declined to comment on the reports and the polish government said that it was not true .
romania meanwhile plans to open an investigation into the matter .
the country hopes to join the eu by 2007 and brussels has threatened that membership talks could be endangered should the allegations prove to be correct . who knew in berlin ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what did schily know ?
and when ?
officials of germany 's former government have also come under pressure in the affair .
initially , only former interior minister otto schily had been reportedly informed about the wrongful abduction of a german national by cia operatives . but süddeutsche zeitung newspaper reported tuesday that officials at the german chancellery and the foreign ministry also knew about the case of khaled el-masri , who had been abducted to afghanistan .
the man 's lawyer contacted the chancellery and foreign ministry for help and the chancellery promised to get involved in a letter , the paper reported . germany 's intelligence service , bnd , reportedly investigated the case as a result and came to the conclusion that el-masri had been abducted , according to süddeutsche zeitung . opposition calls for investigation opposition leader guido westerwelle of the free-market , liberal free democratic party said that the affairs could seriously damage us-german relations , adding that his party would call for a parliamentary inquiry if necessary to resolve the case . but dieter wiefelspütz , the social democratic party 's security expert in parliament , told deutschlandfunk public radio tuesday morning that people should wait with drawing conclusions before us officials had commented on the situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice and merkel are set to meet on tuesday us secretary of state condoleezza rice , who arrived in berlin late monday and is expected to hold talks with german chancellor angela merkel tuesday , has promised to reply to european concerns over reports that the cia used several european airports and secret jails to transport and detain terrorist suspects . rice : no one forced to work with us but rice , who will also visit romania , ukrain and brussels , also said that she would not comment on the alleged existence of secret cia prisons . " we can not discuss information that would compromise the success of intelligence , law-enforcement and military operations , " she said before leaving the us .
" we expect other nations share this view .
it 's up to those governments and their citizens to decide if they wish to work with us to prevent terrorist attacks in their own country or other countries .
they have a sovereign right to make that choice . " rice did , however , talk about allegations that the cia touched down at european airports while transporting terrorist suspects to third countries for interrogation , a practice known as rendition . " renditions take terrorists out of action , they save lives " rice said .

the country hopes to join the eu by 2007 and brussels has threatened that membership talks could be endangered should the allegations prove to be correct . who knew in berlin ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what did schily know ?
and when ?
officials of germany 's former government have also come under pressure in the affair .
initially , only former interior minister otto schily had been reportedly informed about the wrongful abduction of a german national by cia operatives . but süddeutsche zeitung newspaper reported tuesday that officials at the german chancellery and the foreign ministry also knew about the case of khaled el-masri , who had been abducted to afghanistan .
the man 's lawyer contacted the chancellery and foreign ministry for help and the chancellery promised to get involved in a letter , the paper reported . germany 's intelligence service , bnd , reportedly investigated the case as a result and came to the conclusion that el-masri had been abducted , according to süddeutsche zeitung . opposition calls for investigation opposition leader guido westerwelle of the free-market , liberal free democratic party said that the affairs could seriously damage us-german relations , adding that his party would call for a parliamentary inquiry if necessary to resolve the case . but dieter wiefelspütz , the social democratic party 's security expert in parliament , told deutschlandfunk public radio tuesday morning that people should wait with drawing conclusions before us officials had commented on the situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice and merkel are set to meet on tuesday us secretary of state condoleezza rice , who arrived in berlin late monday and is expected to hold talks with german chancellor angela merkel tuesday , has promised to reply to european concerns over reports that the cia used several european airports and secret jails to transport and detain terrorist suspects . rice : no one forced to work with us but rice , who will also visit romania , ukrain and brussels , also said that she would not comment on the alleged existence of secret cia prisons . " we can not discuss information that would compromise the success of intelligence , law-enforcement and military operations , " she said before leaving the us .
" we expect other nations share this view .
it 's up to those governments and their citizens to decide if they wish to work with us to prevent terrorist attacks in their own country or other countries .
they have a sovereign right to make that choice . " rice did , however , talk about allegations that the cia touched down at european airports while transporting terrorist suspects to third countries for interrogation , a practice known as rendition . " renditions take terrorists out of action , they save lives " rice said .
" such renditions are permissible under international law .

the chancellor said rice had admitted during their meeting that the united states had made a mistake in masri 's case . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice and merkel in berlin tuesday " we talked about this one case which , of course , was accepted as a mistake by the us administration , " merkel told reporters .
" i 'm glad that rice told me that mistakes would be corrected . " there has been widespread condemnation in europe of reports of secret cia prisons , known as " black sites , " used to interrogate and allegedly torture terror suspects after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks on the united states . the agency also allegedly used airports across europe to transport the suspects . us officials have consistently refused to confirm the existence of the covert prisons or flights while defending the us right to adopt tough anti-terrorism tactics . detained and drugged masri , an unemployed car salesman , told a press conference via satellite link he was detained on dec .

he said he was held incommunicado long after his innocence was established . he was flown to albania in may 2004 and released without being charged . " extraordinary rendition " the aclu said masri 's abduction and treatment was the direct result of a cia policy known as " extraordinary rendition , " which allows the agency to arrest terrorism suspects and transfer them to other countries for interrogation without going through formal extradition proceedings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cia plane allegedly used to transport terror suspects " kidnapping a foreign national for the purpose of detaining and interrogating him outside the law is contrary to american values , " said anthony romero , executive director of the aclu .
" our government has acted as if it is above the law , " he said , adding that there was a " climate of impunity " in the practices of the us administration . the suit names former cia director george tenet and three companies that owned and operated the airlines used to transport masri . masri seeks damages but romero said the former detainee wanted most of all a " simple acknowledgement " of the wrong done against him and an apology . rice on monday struck a defiant tone before heading on a four-nation european tour , stressing that the us did not engage in torture and defending the right to transfer prisoners around the world for interrogation . masri was reportedly arrested in a case of mistaken identity as after september 11 , the cia had listed a khaled el-masri as a suspect with ties to osama bin laden .

she 's not informing german chancellor merkel directly and instead made remarks before her departure to berlin when the european union and the european council asked for information .
" the statement turned out as expected , " the paper continued , saying that rice merely confirmed the existence of such flights .
" rice of course denies that terror suspects are moved to places where they can be tortured .
believe it if you want to .
at the very least , there 's guantanamo , where suspects have been kept without seeing lawyers or a judge for years . " berlin 's der tagesspiegel said that germans and europeans should look at the basis of the conflict : " how are terrorists meant to be treated ?
like common criminals , prisoners of war or something else ? " it asked .
the paper continued that europe should weigh the options carefully and reconsider its stance of moral superiority .
" morals are one thing , fighting terrorism another .
is the geneva convention our only guideline when attacks are to be prevented ?
the us government has deserved to be criticized , but to climb the high horse and benefit from these methods is hypocritical . " several members of germany 's former red-green government should start blushing if reports about their knowledge of the illegal abduction of a german national prove to be true , commented the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung in essen .
" signs are mounting that european governments had some knowledge of human rights abuses , but did n't want to look to carefully , " the paper wrote .
" us president bush consciously ignores international law .
it 's possible that several eu states became compliant accomplices , including berlin . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secretary of state condoleezza rice london 's the independent meanwhile said that rice has been " a rare star in a bush administration that has otherwise stumbled from one mess to another .
the reason is not merely her style and dazzling fashion sense .
european governments have been impressed by her efforts to restore the role of diplomacy in american policy-making , and to re-establish the primacy of the state department -lrb- as opposed to the pentagon and the vice-president 's office -rrb- in that process . "
while putting her predecessor , colin powell , to shame over making progress in the middle east , her current trip to europe proves to be a special challenge , the paper wrote .
her european partners are deeply worried about cia flights through german airspace , among other things .
the test will be not only what rice has to say about the allegations , but how she will do it , commented the daily .
relations between europe and the us are in a sensible phase , it continued : a lack of tact would be disastrous for both sides .
in moscow , kommersant daily reminded readers that bush had come to europe just a few months ago to emphasize that europe and the us could not afford to have differences of opinion in the fight against terror .
" the latest scandal has clarified that a basis for rapprochement between the us and europe has not been found yet , " it wrote .
" europe is not ready for the sacrifices bush demands in the fight against terror .
that 's why rice sounds like a lonely caller in the desert during her european visit . " and le monde in paris wrote that the affair puts german chancellor angela merkel in a difficult position .
" she wants to improve trans-atlantic ties , but reports about cia planes that have entered german air space or used bases in germany , make this more difficult , " said the daily . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : us closes secret cia prisons ahead of rice visit the us has reportedly shut down two secret cia prisons in poland and romania just ahead of us secretary of state rice 's visit to europe .

the former german government meanwhile has come under pressure in the affair . citing cia sources , us tv channel abc reported that the american intelligence service moved 11 alleged al qaeda operatives from eastern europe to a north african country , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a us air base in romania .
human rights watch said the cia set up secret prisons there cia officials declined to comment on the reports and the polish government said that it was not true .
romania meanwhile plans to open an investigation into the matter .
the country hopes to join the eu by 2007 and brussels has threatened that membership talks could be endangered should the allegations prove to be correct . who knew in berlin ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what did schily know ?
and when ?
officials of germany 's former government have also come under pressure in the affair .
initially , only former interior minister otto schily had been reportedly informed about the wrongful abduction of a german national by cia operatives . but süddeutsche zeitung newspaper reported tuesday that officials at the german chancellery and the foreign ministry also knew about the case of khaled el-masri , who had been abducted to afghanistan .
the man 's lawyer contacted the chancellery and foreign ministry for help and the chancellery promised to get involved in a letter , the paper reported . germany 's intelligence service , bnd , reportedly investigated the case as a result and came to the conclusion that el-masri had been abducted , according to süddeutsche zeitung . opposition calls for investigation opposition leader guido westerwelle of the free-market , liberal free democratic party said that the affairs could seriously damage us-german relations , adding that his party would call for a parliamentary inquiry if necessary to resolve the case . but dieter wiefelspütz , the social democratic party 's security expert in parliament , told deutschlandfunk public radio tuesday morning that people should wait with drawing conclusions before us officials had commented on the situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice and merkel are set to meet on tuesday us secretary of state condoleezza rice , who arrived in berlin late monday and is expected to hold talks with german chancellor angela merkel tuesday , has promised to reply to european concerns over reports that the cia used several european airports and secret jails to transport and detain terrorist suspects . rice : no one forced to work with us but rice , who will also visit romania , ukrain and brussels , also said that she would not comment on the alleged existence of secret cia prisons . " we can not discuss information that would compromise the success of intelligence , law-enforcement and military operations , " she said before leaving the us .
" we expect other nations share this view .
it 's up to those governments and their citizens to decide if they wish to work with us to prevent terrorist attacks in their own country or other countries .
they have a sovereign right to make that choice . " rice did , however , talk about allegations that the cia touched down at european airports while transporting terrorist suspects to third countries for interrogation , a practice known as rendition .

meanwhile , the federal government is fighting an eu ban on tobacco advertising . some 37 percent of germans smoke , one of the highest levels in the european union .
among women smokers , germany is at the very top .
according to health experts , one of the reasons for this is the fact that many of the country 's most renowned public health experts long played down the damaging effects of lighting up - often because they were in the pay of large tobacco concerns . the study , published in the american journal of public health , says many experts worked hand in hand since the 1970 's with firms such as r.j. reynolds and philip morris to " manipulate and skew " the mounting evidence that smoking could be deadly , largely because they received research money from the cigarette manufacturers . the leading author of the study , berlin researcher thilo grüning , cites the example of one of german medicine 's biggest names , fritz kemper , long-time professor at the university of münster , talented toxicologist , and member of germany 's top medical committees .
in 2002 , he received the große verdienstkreuz , one of germany 's highest civilian honors . but grüning also found that kemper was a key scientific ally to big tobacco .

" " presumably many fewer people would die today from tobacco if medical professionals would have taken the results they found on the consequences of smoking seriously , " she said . so for , only one german research institute , the cancer research center in heidelberg , passed an ethical code banning it from accepting funding from the tobacco industry .
that was just at the beginning of november - this year . germany fights eu ban meanwhile , the tobacco industry continues to enjoy something of a comfortable position in germany as the new government continues to fight against an eu ban on all tobacco advertising that the predecessor government under gerhard schröder began .
the government will make its position clear when the case is argued before the european court of justice on tuesday . since july , newspaper , radio and internet sites across the eu are prohibitted from advertising tobacco products .
however , the ban is being effectively ignored by many countries , including germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : r1 cigarette advertisement billboard , germany , photo 2000/10/5 a spokesman for the government said the case is not about the health effects of smoking , but whether the eu has the right to pass a ban against national advertising that does not cross international borders .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.12.2005 opinion : europe needs to pressure us on cia scandal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is guantanamo proof that europe needs to keep watching the us ?
allegations of secret cia prisons and flights across europe overshadow us secretary of state condoleezza rice 's visit .
europe should n't be satisfied with half-hearted answers , says dw 's klaus dahmann . if condoleezza rice is to be believed , then the united states preserves the world from the evil of terror , and america is a country that adheres to human rights in everything it does . transporting prisoners from one country to another where torture may be applied as a means to help along investigations - no , that 's not something the united states does or ever did do .
the united states does n't use air space nor the airports of other countries to transport prisoners to torture cellars . if you believe rice , that is . then all speculations about secret cia prisons in poland and romania have been " misunderstandings . "
the us only takes care of the " first and oldest duty of every government " - protecting its people . too quiet for too long ? europe can not and should not be satisfied with these answers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cia prison in kosovo ?
firstly , the american secretary of state still has n't answered the central question : does or did the cia maintain secret prisons in european countries ? secondly , a lawless place already exists in the form of guantanamo .
that the cia has used torture there has not only been confirmed by victims and human rights organizations such as amnesty international , but also former members of the us intelligence service . it 's clear that the torture allegations are not just a domestic american issue - and not only so since european governments have come under suspicion of knowing about this . europe 's criticism of guantanamo and other prisons used by the us government to interrogate terrorists and terror suspects has been too quiet in the past .
european politicians too quickly retracted to the standpoint that the us government is obligated by its country 's constitution to uphold democratic principles and the rule of law . upholding democracy 's highest values bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice and merkel at a news conference tuesday no one can accept that exactly these values are trampled on to defend democratic societies and values in the fight against terror .
german chancellor angela merkel was right to emphasize this on tuesday . torture methods of any kind have to remain banned from the repertoire of the military and the intelligence community - even if you risk failure in preventing a planned terrorist attack because of it .
the violation of human rights can not be weighed against even worse human rights violations that could potentially be prevented this way . the german government has to stand up for its values , despite its commitment to a trans-atlantic partnership and the fight against terrorism .
and that 's why it not only has to uncover the alleged cognizance of the previous government regarding cia activities , but it also must put pressure on the us government until washington offers full disclosure . paying lip service is not enough . klaus dahmann -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rice aides slam comment that us made " mistake " german chancellor angela merkel said tuesday that the us government admitted that a german national had been wrongfully abducted after cia officials believed him to be a terror suspect .

the chancellor said rice had admitted during their meeting that the united states had made a mistake in masri 's case . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice and merkel in berlin tuesday " we talked about this one case which , of course , was accepted as a mistake by the us administration , " merkel told reporters .
" i 'm glad that rice told me that mistakes would be corrected . " there has been widespread condemnation in europe of reports of secret cia prisons , known as " black sites , " used to interrogate and allegedly torture terror suspects after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks on the united states . the agency also allegedly used airports across europe to transport the suspects . us officials have consistently refused to confirm the existence of the covert prisons or flights while defending the us right to adopt tough anti-terrorism tactics . detained and drugged masri , an unemployed car salesman , told a press conference via satellite link he was detained on dec .
31 , 2003 as he was heading on a bus to macedonia for a holiday following a dispute with his wife . he alleged that when the bus reached the serbia-macedonia border , guards confiscated his passport and detained him on suspicion he was linked to the al qaeda terror network . masri said he was drugged before being put on a plane to afghanistan where he was held at a secret cia prison and interrogated for several months .
he said he was held incommunicado long after his innocence was established . he was flown to albania in may 2004 and released without being charged . " extraordinary rendition " the aclu said masri 's abduction and treatment was the direct result of a cia policy known as " extraordinary rendition , " which allows the agency to arrest terrorism suspects and transfer them to other countries for interrogation without going through formal extradition proceedings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cia plane allegedly used to transport terror suspects " kidnapping a foreign national for the purpose of detaining and interrogating him outside the law is contrary to american values , " said anthony romero , executive director of the aclu .
" our government has acted as if it is above the law , " he said , adding that there was a " climate of impunity " in the practices of the us administration . the suit names former cia director george tenet and three companies that owned and operated the airlines used to transport masri . masri seeks damages but romero said the former detainee wanted most of all a " simple acknowledgement " of the wrong done against him and an apology . rice on monday struck a defiant tone before heading on a four-nation european tour , stressing that the us did not engage in torture and defending the right to transfer prisoners around the world for interrogation . masri was reportedly arrested in a case of mistaken identity as after september 11 , the cia had listed a khaled el-masri as a suspect with ties to osama bin laden .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 06.12.2005 when the environment becomes a business concern großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prospects of cutting greenhouse gas emissions are n't good many companies continiue to bypass environmental concerns in improving their bottom line .
a un climate conference in montreal says the strategy is costly . against a background of melting polar caps , rising sea levels and natural disasters , international experts are meeting in montreal this week to discuss new targets for curbs on greenhouse gases . the figures are daunting .
according to the german institute for economic research , natural disasters will incur around $ 200 billion worth of damage over the next few decades . insurance company münchner rück , meanwhile , has calculated that financial damages wrought by storms , floods and earthquakes have increased ten-fold in the last 50 years . mutual concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new orleans the business community is beginning to wake up to the broader repercussions of environmental devastation .
ecological concerns are business concerns - but , as many have pointed out in montreal , business concerns are also ecological concerns . " environmental protection has to begin with industry , " said axel michaelowa , a climate researcher at the hamburg world economy institute .
" the main emitters of greenhouse gases are steel refineries and power companies , and it 's time they started developing affordable ways of reducing emissions . " some companies are already taking the initiative - including the world 's largest company , us giant general electric . " we 've seen this threat coming and it 's time to act , " said ceo jeffrey immelt - not least motivated by the fact that these days , global financial markets also keep a close eye on companies ' environmental strategies . government targets michaelowa is quick to point out that these strategies need careful monitoring - and should n't be left to individual companies to fine-tune at their own discretion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the clean development mechanism supports clean energy projects in poorer nations " the state needs to set out clear frameworks , " he said , pointing out that experience in germany and japan has showed that self-determining targets can have disappointing results .
" targets for curbing emissions need to be decided by governments , " he stressed . otherwise , he explained , companies simply postpone the issue .
" environmental damage seems like a very distant concern to most companies , " he said , emphasizing that long-term thinking is key to solving the problem . " ideally , we would have a 10 or 15-year plan , " he said .
" most big companies ' investments have a life-span of 10 to 30 years .
the talks in montreal have to spell out that climate protection goes beyond 2012 , when the first phase of the kyoto protocol runs out . " the benefits the international energy agency , meanwhile , has calculated that the energy sector will require an investment of $ 16 billion over the next 25 years . but the german economy may well end up enjoying a piece of the pie . # b # " there are a number of german companies in the field of renewables and energy efficient technology that could profit from the growing demand on the world market , " said michaelowa .
" the kyoto protocol 's ' clean development mechanism ' funds environmental protection projects in developing countries , so there 's a vast export potential . " ultimately , said michaelowa , the environmental protection market is similar to the internet boom of the early 1990s , and businesses with major growth potential are currently proliferating .

a un climate conference in montreal says the strategy is costly . against a background of melting polar caps , rising sea levels and natural disasters , international experts are meeting in montreal this week to discuss new targets for curbs on greenhouse gases . the figures are daunting .
according to the german institute for economic research , natural disasters will incur around $ 200 billion worth of damage over the next few decades . insurance company münchner rück , meanwhile , has calculated that financial damages wrought by storms , floods and earthquakes have increased ten-fold in the last 50 years . mutual concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new orleans the business community is beginning to wake up to the broader repercussions of environmental devastation .
ecological concerns are business concerns - but , as many have pointed out in montreal , business concerns are also ecological concerns . " environmental protection has to begin with industry , " said axel michaelowa , a climate researcher at the hamburg world economy institute .
" the main emitters of greenhouse gases are steel refineries and power companies , and it 's time they started developing affordable ways of reducing emissions . " some companies are already taking the initiative - including the world 's largest company , us giant general electric . " we 've seen this threat coming and it 's time to act , " said ceo jeffrey immelt - not least motivated by the fact that these days , global financial markets also keep a close eye on companies ' environmental strategies . government targets michaelowa is quick to point out that these strategies need careful monitoring - and should n't be left to individual companies to fine-tune at their own discretion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the clean development mechanism supports clean energy projects in poorer nations " the state needs to set out clear frameworks , " he said , pointing out that experience in germany and japan has showed that self-determining targets can have disappointing results .
" targets for curbing emissions need to be decided by governments , " he stressed . otherwise , he explained , companies simply postpone the issue .
" environmental damage seems like a very distant concern to most companies , " he said , emphasizing that long-term thinking is key to solving the problem . " ideally , we would have a 10 or 15-year plan , " he said .
" most big companies ' investments have a life-span of 10 to 30 years .
the talks in montreal have to spell out that climate protection goes beyond 2012 , when the first phase of the kyoto protocol runs out . " the benefits the international energy agency , meanwhile , has calculated that the energy sector will require an investment of $ 16 billion over the next 25 years . but the german economy may well end up enjoying a piece of the pie . # b # " there are a number of german companies in the field of renewables and energy efficient technology that could profit from the growing demand on the world market , " said michaelowa .
" the kyoto protocol 's ' clean development mechanism ' funds environmental protection projects in developing countries , so there 's a vast export potential . " ultimately , said michaelowa , the environmental protection market is similar to the internet boom of the early 1990s , and businesses with major growth potential are currently proliferating .

the bloc is passing the buck on to brazil and at the same time , trying to bring poor countries to its side . the european union is frustrated .
it makes concessions , opens up it markets , but is still called responsible for the fact that global trade negotiations are sluggish and accused of rowing against the tide in the run-up to the wto trade conference in hong kong from december 13 to 18 . " we are offering to reduce subsidies that distort trade by 70 percent , " said eu trade commissioner peter mandelson , referring to an offer the eu made on october 28 .
" we can do that thanks to reforms that have already been decided and put into place . " he says there is no reason to doubt the motives , or behavior , of the eu , and that the bloc 's accommodation in trade matters has not been appreciated by its trading partners . the blame game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union commissioner for trade peter mandelson mandelson 's critique is aimed fairly squarely at the group of developing nations , the so-called g-20 , and especially at the group 's mouthpiece , brazil . the brazilians have been at odds with the eu for years over agricultural policy .
indeed , it was the complaint they filed with the wto that forced the eu to reform its highly subsidized sugar industry .
but now brazil is arguing the eu suggestions do n't go far enough to improve market access for top brazilian exports like beef . " how can they think that they do n't see a decided advantage when we we 're willing to lower our highest tariff rate by 60 percent ? " asked the deputy departmental head of the eu agricultural section , flavio coturini . the eu offer in the agricultural sector for the hong kong conference consists of three parts : 1 . to completely abolish eu export subsidies . 2 . to reduce other rated subsidies by 70 percent , especially those seen as distorting free trade . 3 . to reduce agricultural tariffs by as much as 60 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beef is a leading brazilian export however , some eight percent of products should be exempt from this reduction .
brussels would like to protect its so-called " sensitive goods " from foreign competitors .
beef falls within this category , which angers the south americans , since they see a potentially large market for their beef in europe . hard fronts there wo n't be any further concessions , according to the eu commission , the bloc 's executive body .
in exchange for their agricultural largess , the eu calls for concessions by other countries in the areas of services and industrial goods . " there must be real economic gains , new streams of commerce , " said david o 'sullivan , the eu 's director-general for trade .
" we think our suggestions provide that .
we expect similar concessions from our negotiating partners .
and to be honest , what the brazilians have offered us regarding non-agricultural goods does n't really provide better market access for the products that we are interested in . " but brazil and its foreign minister celso amorim are still playing poker , saying that before they comply with eu demands , the bloc needs to offer a more attractive agricultural deal . " there will be no counter offers , " said an irritated mandelson .
" there are no possible deals during these negotiations if the only topic is market access in the agricultural sector .
that is the problem . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world trade organization 's director-general french pascal lamy the state of negotiations in the run-up to hong kong is not great .
the working paper put forward by the wto director pascal lamy is vague and inconcrete .
analysts say many of these issues should have been settled over two years ago .
but conflicting demands have lead to a stalemate . the eu wants to break out of its isolation and is trying to bring the poorest countries over to its side by means of a development package .
but poor countries would actually gain very little from improved eu market access , since they are already allowed to export most of their goods to the bloc without paying duty . opportunity lost ? peter mandelson is now trying to increase pressure on brazil to keep the wto talks from ending in failure . " that would ruin a huge economic opportunity , " he said , " it would also be very harmful to the wto and could turn back the clock on global multilateralism . " " i believe that europe carries a greater responsibility than others do to bring this round -lrb- of talks -rrb- forward and that is what we 're going to do .

" the american administration has admitted that this man was erroneously taken , " merkel told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el-masri says he was kept in afghanistan for five months but senior us officials , who are travelling with rice on her european tour , disagreed with merkel 's interpretation .
after the news conference , they met with the chancellor 's aides and asked for a explanation , saying rice had not actually admitted to a us mistake over masri . " we are not quite sure what was in her head , " a senior us administration official told reuters . he said while the bush administration had informed germany about masri 's detention and release , he did not say it was an error on the us government 's part . the official went on to say that the german chancellor might have been drawing on media reports rather than any dialog with the us administration when she concluded that washington had admitted to a mistake . masri was released last year after five months in an afghan jail after the united states realized it " no longer had evidence or intelligence to justify his continued detention , " the official said , but declined to respond when asked if the us had ever had evidence to hold him . he did acknowledge that masri was originally detained because of a suspicion that he had a false passport and had the same name as a militant leader .
the passport turned out to be genuine , the official added . the case caused an uproar in germany after recent news reports that former interior minister otto schily had been informed about the wrongful abduction by the then us ambassador in germany . reports about secret cia flights to transport terror suspects across german air space and to us air bases in germany have also strained relations in the last weeks .
the us is also facing criticism for allegedly operating secret cia prisons in eastern europe . rice : a case for the courts saying that masri 's case was a matter for litigation , rice declined to comment on it , but did say that the us was ready to correct its mistakes , which could have led merkel to make the comments she did . " any policy will result in errors , " she said .
" when mistakes are made , we work very hard to rectify them .
i believe that this will be handled in the proper courts , here in germany and if necessary in american courts as well . " rice also reiterated her view that her government could not reveal details about us intelligence agencies . " we have to have intelligence that can be effective , " she said .
" without good intelligence , you can simply not protect innocent civilians from the kind of attacks that we 've witnessed around the globe . " merkel sees intensified relationship rice added that washington was adhering to national and international laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said rice 's statement is a good basis for intelligence cooperation " the us does not condone torture , " she said .
" it is against us law to commit torture and it 's also against the us ' international obligations .
the president has made it very clear that us personnel will operate within us law and international obligations . " merkel said that she was glad rice had reiterated the us administration 's commitment to international laws . " it was important for me that the secretary of state repeated this , that the united states sticks to its international obligations , " she said , adding that she was looking forward to continuing to build an " intensified relationship between our two countries " during her upcoming visit to washington in january . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : us closes secret cia prisons ahead of rice visit the us has reportedly shut down two secret cia prisons in poland and romania just ahead of us secretary of state rice 's visit to europe .

the bloc is passing the buck on to brazil and at the same time , trying to bring poor countries to its side . the european union is frustrated .
it makes concessions , opens up it markets , but is still called responsible for the fact that global trade negotiations are sluggish and accused of rowing against the tide in the run-up to the wto trade conference in hong kong from december 13 to 18 . " we are offering to reduce subsidies that distort trade by 70 percent , " said eu trade commissioner peter mandelson , referring to an offer the eu made on october 28 .
" we can do that thanks to reforms that have already been decided and put into place . " he says there is no reason to doubt the motives , or behavior , of the eu , and that the bloc 's accommodation in trade matters has not been appreciated by its trading partners . the blame game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union commissioner for trade peter mandelson mandelson 's critique is aimed fairly squarely at the group of developing nations , the so-called g-20 , and especially at the group 's mouthpiece , brazil . the brazilians have been at odds with the eu for years over agricultural policy .
indeed , it was the complaint they filed with the wto that forced the eu to reform its highly subsidized sugar industry .
but now brazil is arguing the eu suggestions do n't go far enough to improve market access for top brazilian exports like beef . " how can they think that they do n't see a decided advantage when we we 're willing to lower our highest tariff rate by 60 percent ? " asked the deputy departmental head of the eu agricultural section , flavio coturini . the eu offer in the agricultural sector for the hong kong conference consists of three parts : 1 . to completely abolish eu export subsidies . 2 . to reduce other rated subsidies by 70 percent , especially those seen as distorting free trade . 3 . to reduce agricultural tariffs by as much as 60 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beef is a leading brazilian export however , some eight percent of products should be exempt from this reduction .
brussels would like to protect its so-called " sensitive goods " from foreign competitors .
beef falls within this category , which angers the south americans , since they see a potentially large market for their beef in europe . hard fronts there wo n't be any further concessions , according to the eu commission , the bloc 's executive body .
in exchange for their agricultural largess , the eu calls for concessions by other countries in the areas of services and industrial goods . " there must be real economic gains , new streams of commerce , " said david o 'sullivan , the eu 's director-general for trade .
" we think our suggestions provide that .
we expect similar concessions from our negotiating partners .
and to be honest , what the brazilians have offered us regarding non-agricultural goods does n't really provide better market access for the products that we are interested in . " but brazil and its foreign minister celso amorim are still playing poker , saying that before they comply with eu demands , the bloc needs to offer a more attractive agricultural deal . " there will be no counter offers , " said an irritated mandelson .
" there are no possible deals during these negotiations if the only topic is market access in the agricultural sector .
that is the problem . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world trade organization 's director-general french pascal lamy the state of negotiations in the run-up to hong kong is not great .
the working paper put forward by the wto director pascal lamy is vague and inconcrete .
analysts say many of these issues should have been settled over two years ago .
but conflicting demands have lead to a stalemate . the eu wants to break out of its isolation and is trying to bring the poorest countries over to its side by means of a development package .
but poor countries would actually gain very little from improved eu market access , since they are already allowed to export most of their goods to the bloc without paying duty . opportunity lost ? peter mandelson is now trying to increase pressure on brazil to keep the wto talks from ending in failure . " that would ruin a huge economic opportunity , " he said , " it would also be very harmful to the wto and could turn back the clock on global multilateralism . " " i believe that europe carries a greater responsibility than others do to bring this round -lrb- of talks -rrb- forward and that is what we 're going to do . " while he is not counting on a breakthrough in hong kong , he says it is crucial to codify what has already been accomplished .
perhaps the hoped-for breakthrough could then come at the next ministerial conference in the spring of 2006 . johannes beck -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sugar deal in the bag european union farm ministers have agreed to a sweeping reform of the sugar sector following a marathon three-day session of talks .

" we are offering to reduce subsidies that distort trade by 70 percent , " said eu trade commissioner peter mandelson , referring to an offer the eu made on october 28 .
" we can do that thanks to reforms that have already been decided and put into place . " he says there is no reason to doubt the motives , or behavior , of the eu , and that the bloc 's accommodation in trade matters has not been appreciated by its trading partners . the blame game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union commissioner for trade peter mandelson mandelson 's critique is aimed fairly squarely at the group of developing nations , the so-called g-20 , and especially at the group 's mouthpiece , brazil . the brazilians have been at odds with the eu for years over agricultural policy .
indeed , it was the complaint they filed with the wto that forced the eu to reform its highly subsidized sugar industry .
but now brazil is arguing the eu suggestions do n't go far enough to improve market access for top brazilian exports like beef . " how can they think that they do n't see a decided advantage when we we 're willing to lower our highest tariff rate by 60 percent ? " asked the deputy departmental head of the eu agricultural section , flavio coturini . the eu offer in the agricultural sector for the hong kong conference consists of three parts : 1 . to completely abolish eu export subsidies . 2 . to reduce other rated subsidies by 70 percent , especially those seen as distorting free trade . 3 . to reduce agricultural tariffs by as much as 60 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beef is a leading brazilian export however , some eight percent of products should be exempt from this reduction .
brussels would like to protect its so-called " sensitive goods " from foreign competitors .
beef falls within this category , which angers the south americans , since they see a potentially large market for their beef in europe . hard fronts there wo n't be any further concessions , according to the eu commission , the bloc 's executive body .
in exchange for their agricultural largess , the eu calls for concessions by other countries in the areas of services and industrial goods . " there must be real economic gains , new streams of commerce , " said david o 'sullivan , the eu 's director-general for trade .
" we think our suggestions provide that .
we expect similar concessions from our negotiating partners .
and to be honest , what the brazilians have offered us regarding non-agricultural goods does n't really provide better market access for the products that we are interested in . " but brazil and its foreign minister celso amorim are still playing poker , saying that before they comply with eu demands , the bloc needs to offer a more attractive agricultural deal . " there will be no counter offers , " said an irritated mandelson .
" there are no possible deals during these negotiations if the only topic is market access in the agricultural sector .
that is the problem . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world trade organization 's director-general french pascal lamy the state of negotiations in the run-up to hong kong is not great .
the working paper put forward by the wto director pascal lamy is vague and inconcrete .
analysts say many of these issues should have been settled over two years ago .
but conflicting demands have lead to a stalemate . the eu wants to break out of its isolation and is trying to bring the poorest countries over to its side by means of a development package .
but poor countries would actually gain very little from improved eu market access , since they are already allowed to export most of their goods to the bloc without paying duty . opportunity lost ? peter mandelson is now trying to increase pressure on brazil to keep the wto talks from ending in failure . " that would ruin a huge economic opportunity , " he said , " it would also be very harmful to the wto and could turn back the clock on global multilateralism . " " i believe that europe carries a greater responsibility than others do to bring this round -lrb- of talks -rrb- forward and that is what we 're going to do . " while he is not counting on a breakthrough in hong kong , he says it is crucial to codify what has already been accomplished .
perhaps the hoped-for breakthrough could then come at the next ministerial conference in the spring of 2006 . johannes beck -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sugar deal in the bag european union farm ministers have agreed to a sweeping reform of the sugar sector following a marathon three-day session of talks .

" the american administration has admitted that this man was erroneously taken , " merkel told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el-masri says he was kept in afghanistan for five months but senior us officials , who are travelling with rice on her european tour , disagreed with merkel 's interpretation .
after the news conference , they met with the chancellor 's aides and asked for a explanation , saying rice had not actually admitted to a us mistake over masri . " we are not quite sure what was in her head , " a senior us administration official told reuters . he said while the bush administration had informed germany about masri 's detention and release , he did not say it was an error on the us government 's part . the official went on to say that the german chancellor might have been drawing on media reports rather than any dialog with the us administration when she concluded that washington had admitted to a mistake . masri was released last year after five months in an afghan jail after the united states realized it " no longer had evidence or intelligence to justify his continued detention , " the official said , but declined to respond when asked if the us had ever had evidence to hold him . he did acknowledge that masri was originally detained because of a suspicion that he had a false passport and had the same name as a militant leader .
the passport turned out to be genuine , the official added . the case caused an uproar in germany after recent news reports that former interior minister otto schily had been informed about the wrongful abduction by the then us ambassador in germany . reports about secret cia flights to transport terror suspects across german air space and to us air bases in germany have also strained relations in the last weeks .
the us is also facing criticism for allegedly operating secret cia prisons in eastern europe . rice : a case for the courts saying that masri 's case was a matter for litigation , rice declined to comment on it , but did say that the us was ready to correct its mistakes , which could have led merkel to make the comments she did . " any policy will result in errors , " she said .
" when mistakes are made , we work very hard to rectify them .
i believe that this will be handled in the proper courts , here in germany and if necessary in american courts as well . " rice also reiterated her view that her government could not reveal details about us intelligence agencies . " we have to have intelligence that can be effective , " she said .
" without good intelligence , you can simply not protect innocent civilians from the kind of attacks that we 've witnessed around the globe . " merkel sees intensified relationship rice added that washington was adhering to national and international laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said rice 's statement is a good basis for intelligence cooperation " the us does not condone torture , " she said .
" it is against us law to commit torture and it 's also against the us ' international obligations .
the president has made it very clear that us personnel will operate within us law and international obligations . " merkel said that she was glad rice had reiterated the us administration 's commitment to international laws . " it was important for me that the secretary of state repeated this , that the united states sticks to its international obligations , " she said , adding that she was looking forward to continuing to build an " intensified relationship between our two countries " during her upcoming visit to washington in january . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : us closes secret cia prisons ahead of rice visit the us has reportedly shut down two secret cia prisons in poland and romania just ahead of us secretary of state rice 's visit to europe .

" the american administration has admitted that this man was erroneously taken , " merkel told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el-masri says he was kept in afghanistan for five months but senior us officials , who are travelling with rice on her european tour , disagreed with merkel 's interpretation .
after the news conference , they met with the chancellor 's aides and asked for a explanation , saying rice had not actually admitted to a us mistake over masri . " we are not quite sure what was in her head , " a senior us administration official told reuters . he said while the bush administration had informed germany about masri 's detention and release , he did not say it was an error on the us government 's part . the official went on to say that the german chancellor might have been drawing on media reports rather than any dialog with the us administration when she concluded that washington had admitted to a mistake . masri was released last year after five months in an afghan jail after the united states realized it " no longer had evidence or intelligence to justify his continued detention , " the official said , but declined to respond when asked if the us had ever had evidence to hold him . he did acknowledge that masri was originally detained because of a suspicion that he had a false passport and had the same name as a militant leader .
the passport turned out to be genuine , the official added . the case caused an uproar in germany after recent news reports that former interior minister otto schily had been informed about the wrongful abduction by the then us ambassador in germany . reports about secret cia flights to transport terror suspects across german air space and to us air bases in germany have also strained relations in the last weeks .
the us is also facing criticism for allegedly operating secret cia prisons in eastern europe . rice : a case for the courts saying that masri 's case was a matter for litigation , rice declined to comment on it , but did say that the us was ready to correct its mistakes , which could have led merkel to make the comments she did . " any policy will result in errors , " she said .
" when mistakes are made , we work very hard to rectify them .
i believe that this will be handled in the proper courts , here in germany and if necessary in american courts as well . " rice also reiterated her view that her government could not reveal details about us intelligence agencies . " we have to have intelligence that can be effective , " she said .
" without good intelligence , you can simply not protect innocent civilians from the kind of attacks that we 've witnessed around the globe . " merkel sees intensified relationship rice added that washington was adhering to national and international laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said rice 's statement is a good basis for intelligence cooperation " the us does not condone torture , " she said .
" it is against us law to commit torture and it 's also against the us ' international obligations .
the president has made it very clear that us personnel will operate within us law and international obligations . " merkel said that she was glad rice had reiterated the us administration 's commitment to international laws . " it was important for me that the secretary of state repeated this , that the united states sticks to its international obligations , " she said , adding that she was looking forward to continuing to build an " intensified relationship between our two countries " during her upcoming visit to washington in january . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : us closes secret cia prisons ahead of rice visit the us has reportedly shut down two secret cia prisons in poland and romania just ahead of us secretary of state rice 's visit to europe .

the bloc is passing the buck on to brazil and at the same time , trying to bring poor countries to its side . the european union is frustrated .
it makes concessions , opens up it markets , but is still called responsible for the fact that global trade negotiations are sluggish and accused of rowing against the tide in the run-up to the wto trade conference in hong kong from december 13 to 18 . " we are offering to reduce subsidies that distort trade by 70 percent , " said eu trade commissioner peter mandelson , referring to an offer the eu made on october 28 .
" we can do that thanks to reforms that have already been decided and put into place . " he says there is no reason to doubt the motives , or behavior , of the eu , and that the bloc 's accommodation in trade matters has not been appreciated by its trading partners . the blame game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union commissioner for trade peter mandelson mandelson 's critique is aimed fairly squarely at the group of developing nations , the so-called g-20 , and especially at the group 's mouthpiece , brazil . the brazilians have been at odds with the eu for years over agricultural policy .
indeed , it was the complaint they filed with the wto that forced the eu to reform its highly subsidized sugar industry .
but now brazil is arguing the eu suggestions do n't go far enough to improve market access for top brazilian exports like beef . " how can they think that they do n't see a decided advantage when we we 're willing to lower our highest tariff rate by 60 percent ? " asked the deputy departmental head of the eu agricultural section , flavio coturini . the eu offer in the agricultural sector for the hong kong conference consists of three parts : 1 . to completely abolish eu export subsidies . 2 . to reduce other rated subsidies by 70 percent , especially those seen as distorting free trade . 3 . to reduce agricultural tariffs by as much as 60 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beef is a leading brazilian export however , some eight percent of products should be exempt from this reduction .
brussels would like to protect its so-called " sensitive goods " from foreign competitors .
beef falls within this category , which angers the south americans , since they see a potentially large market for their beef in europe . hard fronts there wo n't be any further concessions , according to the eu commission , the bloc 's executive body .
in exchange for their agricultural largess , the eu calls for concessions by other countries in the areas of services and industrial goods . " there must be real economic gains , new streams of commerce , " said david o 'sullivan , the eu 's director-general for trade .
" we think our suggestions provide that .
we expect similar concessions from our negotiating partners .
and to be honest , what the brazilians have offered us regarding non-agricultural goods does n't really provide better market access for the products that we are interested in . " but brazil and its foreign minister celso amorim are still playing poker , saying that before they comply with eu demands , the bloc needs to offer a more attractive agricultural deal . " there will be no counter offers , " said an irritated mandelson .
" there are no possible deals during these negotiations if the only topic is market access in the agricultural sector .
that is the problem . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world trade organization 's director-general french pascal lamy the state of negotiations in the run-up to hong kong is not great .
the working paper put forward by the wto director pascal lamy is vague and inconcrete .
analysts say many of these issues should have been settled over two years ago .
but conflicting demands have lead to a stalemate . the eu wants to break out of its isolation and is trying to bring the poorest countries over to its side by means of a development package .
but poor countries would actually gain very little from improved eu market access , since they are already allowed to export most of their goods to the bloc without paying duty . opportunity lost ? peter mandelson is now trying to increase pressure on brazil to keep the wto talks from ending in failure . " that would ruin a huge economic opportunity , " he said , " it would also be very harmful to the wto and could turn back the clock on global multilateralism . " " i believe that europe carries a greater responsibility than others do to bring this round -lrb- of talks -rrb- forward and that is what we 're going to do . " while he is not counting on a breakthrough in hong kong , he says it is crucial to codify what has already been accomplished .
perhaps the hoped-for breakthrough could then come at the next ministerial conference in the spring of 2006 . johannes beck -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sugar deal in the bag european union farm ministers have agreed to a sweeping reform of the sugar sector following a marathon three-day session of talks .

the chancellor said rice had admitted during their meeting that the united states had made a mistake in masri 's case . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice and merkel in berlin tuesday " we talked about this one case which , of course , was accepted as a mistake by the us administration , " merkel told reporters .
" i 'm glad that rice told me that mistakes would be corrected . " there has been widespread condemnation in europe of reports of secret cia prisons , known as " black sites , " used to interrogate and allegedly torture terror suspects after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks on the united states . the agency also allegedly used airports across europe to transport the suspects . us officials have consistently refused to confirm the existence of the covert prisons or flights while defending the us right to adopt tough anti-terrorism tactics . detained and drugged masri , an unemployed car salesman , told a press conference via satellite link he was detained on dec .
31 , 2003 as he was heading on a bus to macedonia for a holiday following a dispute with his wife . he alleged that when the bus reached the serbia-macedonia border , guards confiscated his passport and detained him on suspicion he was linked to the al qaeda terror network . masri said he was drugged before being put on a plane to afghanistan where he was held at a secret cia prison and interrogated for several months .
he said he was held incommunicado long after his innocence was established . he was flown to albania in may 2004 and released without being charged .

" the american administration has admitted that this man was erroneously taken , " merkel told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el-masri says he was kept in afghanistan for five months but senior us officials , who are travelling with rice on her european tour , disagreed with merkel 's interpretation .
after the news conference , they met with the chancellor 's aides and asked for a explanation , saying rice had not actually admitted to a us mistake over masri . " we are not quite sure what was in her head , " a senior us administration official told reuters . he said while the bush administration had informed germany about masri 's detention and release , he did not say it was an error on the us government 's part . the official went on to say that the german chancellor might have been drawing on media reports rather than any dialog with the us administration when she concluded that washington had admitted to a mistake . masri was released last year after five months in an afghan jail after the united states realized it " no longer had evidence or intelligence to justify his continued detention , " the official said , but declined to respond when asked if the us had ever had evidence to hold him . he did acknowledge that masri was originally detained because of a suspicion that he had a false passport and had the same name as a militant leader .
the passport turned out to be genuine , the official added . the case caused an uproar in germany after recent news reports that former interior minister otto schily had been informed about the wrongful abduction by the then us ambassador in germany . reports about secret cia flights to transport terror suspects across german air space and to us air bases in germany have also strained relations in the last weeks .
the us is also facing criticism for allegedly operating secret cia prisons in eastern europe . rice : a case for the courts saying that masri 's case was a matter for litigation , rice declined to comment on it , but did say that the us was ready to correct its mistakes , which could have led merkel to make the comments she did . " any policy will result in errors , " she said .
" when mistakes are made , we work very hard to rectify them .
i believe that this will be handled in the proper courts , here in germany and if necessary in american courts as well . " rice also reiterated her view that her government could not reveal details about us intelligence agencies . " we have to have intelligence that can be effective , " she said .
" without good intelligence , you can simply not protect innocent civilians from the kind of attacks that we 've witnessed around the globe . " merkel sees intensified relationship rice added that washington was adhering to national and international laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said rice 's statement is a good basis for intelligence cooperation " the us does not condone torture , " she said .
" it is against us law to commit torture and it 's also against the us ' international obligations .
the president has made it very clear that us personnel will operate within us law and international obligations . " merkel said that she was glad rice had reiterated the us administration 's commitment to international laws . " it was important for me that the secretary of state repeated this , that the united states sticks to its international obligations , " she said , adding that she was looking forward to continuing to build an " intensified relationship between our two countries " during her upcoming visit to washington in january . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : us closes secret cia prisons ahead of rice visit the us has reportedly shut down two secret cia prisons in poland and romania just ahead of us secretary of state rice 's visit to europe .

the chancellor said rice had admitted during their meeting that the united states had made a mistake in masri 's case . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice and merkel in berlin tuesday " we talked about this one case which , of course , was accepted as a mistake by the us administration , " merkel told reporters .
" i 'm glad that rice told me that mistakes would be corrected . " there has been widespread condemnation in europe of reports of secret cia prisons , known as " black sites , " used to interrogate and allegedly torture terror suspects after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks on the united states . the agency also allegedly used airports across europe to transport the suspects . us officials have consistently refused to confirm the existence of the covert prisons or flights while defending the us right to adopt tough anti-terrorism tactics . detained and drugged masri , an unemployed car salesman , told a press conference via satellite link he was detained on dec .
31 , 2003 as he was heading on a bus to macedonia for a holiday following a dispute with his wife . he alleged that when the bus reached the serbia-macedonia border , guards confiscated his passport and detained him on suspicion he was linked to the al qaeda terror network . masri said he was drugged before being put on a plane to afghanistan where he was held at a secret cia prison and interrogated for several months .
he said he was held incommunicado long after his innocence was established . he was flown to albania in may 2004 and released without being charged . " extraordinary rendition " the aclu said masri 's abduction and treatment was the direct result of a cia policy known as " extraordinary rendition , " which allows the agency to arrest terrorism suspects and transfer them to other countries for interrogation without going through formal extradition proceedings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cia plane allegedly used to transport terror suspects " kidnapping a foreign national for the purpose of detaining and interrogating him outside the law is contrary to american values , " said anthony romero , executive director of the aclu .
" our government has acted as if it is above the law , " he said , adding that there was a " climate of impunity " in the practices of the us administration . the suit names former cia director george tenet and three companies that owned and operated the airlines used to transport masri . masri seeks damages but romero said the former detainee wanted most of all a " simple acknowledgement " of the wrong done against him and an apology . rice on monday struck a defiant tone before heading on a four-nation european tour , stressing that the us did not engage in torture and defending the right to transfer prisoners around the world for interrogation . masri was reportedly arrested in a case of mistaken identity as after september 11 , the cia had listed a khaled el-masri as a suspect with ties to osama bin laden .
that masri is believed to still be at large . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : europe needs to pressure us on cia scandal allegations of secret cia prisons and flights across europe overshadow us secretary of state condoleezza rice 's visit .

meanwhile , the federal government is fighting an eu ban on tobacco advertising . some 37 percent of germans smoke , one of the highest levels in the european union .
among women smokers , germany is at the very top .
according to health experts , one of the reasons for this is the fact that many of the country 's most renowned public health experts long played down the damaging effects of lighting up - often because they were in the pay of large tobacco concerns . the study , published in the american journal of public health , says many experts worked hand in hand since the 1970 's with firms such as r.j. reynolds and philip morris to " manipulate and skew " the mounting evidence that smoking could be deadly , largely because they received research money from the cigarette manufacturers . the leading author of the study , berlin researcher thilo grüning , cites the example of one of german medicine 's biggest names , fritz kemper , long-time professor at the university of münster , talented toxicologist , and member of germany 's top medical committees .
in 2002 , he received the große verdienstkreuz , one of germany 's highest civilian honors . but grüning also found that kemper was a key scientific ally to big tobacco .
in one year , according to internal documents the study examined , he received $ 20,000 dollars from r.j. reynolds , the maker of camel cigarettes , for informing the multinational about the activities of german scientists and politicians in the area of tobacco . influence on study results after the united states , germany was one of the most important bases for the tobacco lobby .
as early as 1975 , the cigarette industry association vdc founded a " research council on smoking and health . "
but the committee turned out to be less than independent and due to the purse strings attached to the millions going to the committee , the tobacco industry had " a significant influence " on the results the panel of top health experts released . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking rates in germany are higher than they should be , experts say if investigations into the effects of tobacco smoking did not fit the desires of the industry , results were often played down .
for example , franz adlkofer , a leading german tobacco researcher , assured his colleagues in the us that one study about nicotine as a carcinogenic would be " hidden , " another studied would " guaranteed not be published . " martina pötschke-langer , head of the center for tobacco control at the world health organization in heidelberg , told the newsmagazine der spiegel that the roll of leading german health experts in covering up the harmful effects of tobacco was " shocking . " " presumably many fewer people would die today from tobacco if medical professionals would have taken the results they found on the consequences of smoking seriously , " she said . so for , only one german research institute , the cancer research center in heidelberg , passed an ethical code banning it from accepting funding from the tobacco industry .
that was just at the beginning of november - this year . germany fights eu ban meanwhile , the tobacco industry continues to enjoy something of a comfortable position in germany as the new government continues to fight against an eu ban on all tobacco advertising that the predecessor government under gerhard schröder began .
the government will make its position clear when the case is argued before the european court of justice on tuesday . since july , newspaper , radio and internet sites across the eu are prohibitted from advertising tobacco products .
however , the ban is being effectively ignored by many countries , including germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : r1 cigarette advertisement billboard , germany , photo 2000/10/5 a spokesman for the government said the case is not about the health effects of smoking , but whether the eu has the right to pass a ban against national advertising that does not cross international borders .
according to berlin , the eu 's jurisdiction does not extend to domestic advertising . but david byrne , a former eu health commissioner , says germany in particular is in need of stricter rules on tobacco ads . " in germany , 37 percent of the population smokes and there are lax regulations on tobacco advertising , " he said .
" in sweden there are stronger laws and only 19 percent of the population smokes . " the german newspaper and magazine publishing associations are also opposed to the ban , saying they fear that the advertising ban could lead to similar bans in other industries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.12.2005 opinion : europe needs to pressure us on cia scandal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is guantanamo proof that europe needs to keep watching the us ?
allegations of secret cia prisons and flights across europe overshadow us secretary of state condoleezza rice 's visit .
europe should n't be satisfied with half-hearted answers , says dw 's klaus dahmann . if condoleezza rice is to be believed , then the united states preserves the world from the evil of terror , and america is a country that adheres to human rights in everything it does . transporting prisoners from one country to another where torture may be applied as a means to help along investigations - no , that 's not something the united states does or ever did do .
the united states does n't use air space nor the airports of other countries to transport prisoners to torture cellars . if you believe rice , that is . then all speculations about secret cia prisons in poland and romania have been " misunderstandings . "
the us only takes care of the " first and oldest duty of every government " - protecting its people . too quiet for too long ? europe can not and should not be satisfied with these answers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cia prison in kosovo ?
firstly , the american secretary of state still has n't answered the central question : does or did the cia maintain secret prisons in european countries ? secondly , a lawless place already exists in the form of guantanamo .
that the cia has used torture there has not only been confirmed by victims and human rights organizations such as amnesty international , but also former members of the us intelligence service . it 's clear that the torture allegations are not just a domestic american issue - and not only so since european governments have come under suspicion of knowing about this . europe 's criticism of guantanamo and other prisons used by the us government to interrogate terrorists and terror suspects has been too quiet in the past .
european politicians too quickly retracted to the standpoint that the us government is obligated by its country 's constitution to uphold democratic principles and the rule of law . upholding democracy 's highest values bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice and merkel at a news conference tuesday no one can accept that exactly these values are trampled on to defend democratic societies and values in the fight against terror .
german chancellor angela merkel was right to emphasize this on tuesday . torture methods of any kind have to remain banned from the repertoire of the military and the intelligence community - even if you risk failure in preventing a planned terrorist attack because of it .
the violation of human rights can not be weighed against even worse human rights violations that could potentially be prevented this way . the german government has to stand up for its values , despite its commitment to a trans-atlantic partnership and the fight against terrorism .
and that 's why it not only has to uncover the alleged cognizance of the previous government regarding cia activities , but it also must put pressure on the us government until washington offers full disclosure . paying lip service is not enough . klaus dahmann -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rice aides slam comment that us made " mistake " german chancellor angela merkel said tuesday that the us government admitted that a german national had been wrongfully abducted after cia officials believed him to be a terror suspect .

and he was not optimistic about the prospects for a quick solution : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : working around the clock " it can take days , weeks , possibly even months , " he said .
" this is why it is crucial that we get in contact with the kidnappers as soon as possible .
being in touch does not necessarily mean that we will also have an agreement ensuring osthoff 's release .
up to now we do n't even have a sign that the hostage is still alive .
the more time passes the more difficult the situation gets . " motives unclear susanne osthoff was seized on november 25 .
in a video released last tuesday , the kidnappers threatened to kill her unless germany stopped training iraqi police . " this is one of the most difficult situations a government can find itself in , " said bosbach .
" the hostage 's life must be saved , but we can not give in to political demands . " his statements backed up the position taken by chancellor angela merkel in an interview on public broadcaster zdf sunday .
merkel stressed that berlin would do everything in its power to save osthoff 's life , but reiterated the government 's refusal to give in to political blackmail . " fortunately , there is broad social consensus on this issue and across the political spectrum , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a video of osthoff was released shortly after her capture german press reports say the deadline attached to the demand expired on friday , but this has not been confirmed .
it is not clear either whether the first kidnapping of a german national in iraq is in fact politically motivated or could be solved by paying ransom to the kidnappers . in order to protect the hostage , the german government is unwilling to speculate either about the motives behind the kidnapping or the identity of the kidnappers . " we are concerned that making this sort of information public would jeopardize out efforts , " said ruprecht polenz , head of the bundestag 's foreign relations committee . family concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pleading for the hostage 's release the family of the victim are also renewing their calls for her release .
osthoff 's mother on monday issued another emotional plea to return her daughter to safety .
in an interview with a german newspaper she said that her daughter was " more iraqi than german . " osthoff is a trained archeologist who has been doing aid work in iraq for several years .
the 43 year old convert to islam was married to an arab and speaks fluent arabic . in osthoff ’ s home village of glonn near munich , people have been gathering for vigils .
candles have been lit at the entrance to the city hall right beneath a photo of osthoff .
the residents of the small bavarian village are simply shocked , says the mayor martin esterl .
he met susanne osthoff during the iraq war in 2003 when she was about to set off for her first humanitarian trip to iraq . " i personally was very impressed by her , " he said .
" i got to know her as a woman who is strong-willed , who knows exactly what she wants and who is very committed to her mission of helping the iraqi people .
susanne osthoff seemed determined to pursue her goal without compromise . " muslim solidarity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nadeem elyas condemned the kidnapping meanwhile , the president of germany ’ s muslim community , nadeem elyas , said he had written a letter to the 57-nation organization of the islamic conference , asking leaders who are due to meet later this week in saudi arabia to launch an initiative for osthoff 's release . i would consider every possible means of saving her life , " he said , and called on muslim leaders around the world to speak out against abuse of islam 's peaceful teachings . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel issues emergency appeal for german hostage in iraq german chancellor angela merkel issued a joint appeal with other leading figures sunday for the release of a german archaeologist abducted in iraq as the reported deadline for meeting the kidnappers ' demands passed .

and he was not optimistic about the prospects for a quick solution : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : working around the clock " it can take days , weeks , possibly even months , " he said .
" this is why it is crucial that we get in contact with the kidnappers as soon as possible .
being in touch does not necessarily mean that we will also have an agreement ensuring osthoff 's release .
up to now we do n't even have a sign that the hostage is still alive .
the more time passes the more difficult the situation gets . " motives unclear susanne osthoff was seized on november 25 .
in a video released last tuesday , the kidnappers threatened to kill her unless germany stopped training iraqi police . " this is one of the most difficult situations a government can find itself in , " said bosbach .
" the hostage 's life must be saved , but we can not give in to political demands . " his statements backed up the position taken by chancellor angela merkel in an interview on public broadcaster zdf sunday .
merkel stressed that berlin would do everything in its power to save osthoff 's life , but reiterated the government 's refusal to give in to political blackmail . " fortunately , there is broad social consensus on this issue and across the political spectrum , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a video of osthoff was released shortly after her capture german press reports say the deadline attached to the demand expired on friday , but this has not been confirmed .

allegations of secret cia prisons and flights across europe overshadow us secretary of state condoleezza rice 's visit .
europe should n't be satisfied with half-hearted answers , says dw 's klaus dahmann . if condoleezza rice is to be believed , then the united states preserves the world from the evil of terror , and america is a country that adheres to human rights in everything it does . transporting prisoners from one country to another where torture may be applied as a means to help along investigations - no , that 's not something the united states does or ever did do .
the united states does n't use air space nor the airports of other countries to transport prisoners to torture cellars . if you believe rice , that is . then all speculations about secret cia prisons in poland and romania have been " misunderstandings . "
the us only takes care of the " first and oldest duty of every government " - protecting its people . too quiet for too long ? europe can not and should not be satisfied with these answers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cia prison in kosovo ?
firstly , the american secretary of state still has n't answered the central question : does or did the cia maintain secret prisons in european countries ? secondly , a lawless place already exists in the form of guantanamo .
that the cia has used torture there has not only been confirmed by victims and human rights organizations such as amnesty international , but also former members of the us intelligence service . it 's clear that the torture allegations are not just a domestic american issue - and not only so since european governments have come under suspicion of knowing about this . europe 's criticism of guantanamo and other prisons used by the us government to interrogate terrorists and terror suspects has been too quiet in the past .
european politicians too quickly retracted to the standpoint that the us government is obligated by its country 's constitution to uphold democratic principles and the rule of law . upholding democracy 's highest values bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice and merkel at a news conference tuesday no one can accept that exactly these values are trampled on to defend democratic societies and values in the fight against terror .
german chancellor angela merkel was right to emphasize this on tuesday . torture methods of any kind have to remain banned from the repertoire of the military and the intelligence community - even if you risk failure in preventing a planned terrorist attack because of it .
the violation of human rights can not be weighed against even worse human rights violations that could potentially be prevented this way . the german government has to stand up for its values , despite its commitment to a trans-atlantic partnership and the fight against terrorism .
and that 's why it not only has to uncover the alleged cognizance of the previous government regarding cia activities , but it also must put pressure on the us government until washington offers full disclosure . paying lip service is not enough . klaus dahmann -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rice aides slam comment that us made " mistake " german chancellor angela merkel said tuesday that the us government admitted that a german national had been wrongfully abducted after cia officials believed him to be a terror suspect .

the united states does n't use air space nor the airports of other countries to transport prisoners to torture cellars . if you believe rice , that is . then all speculations about secret cia prisons in poland and romania have been " misunderstandings . "
the us only takes care of the " first and oldest duty of every government " - protecting its people . too quiet for too long ? europe can not and should not be satisfied with these answers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cia prison in kosovo ?
firstly , the american secretary of state still has n't answered the central question : does or did the cia maintain secret prisons in european countries ? secondly , a lawless place already exists in the form of guantanamo .
that the cia has used torture there has not only been confirmed by victims and human rights organizations such as amnesty international , but also former members of the us intelligence service . it 's clear that the torture allegations are not just a domestic american issue - and not only so since european governments have come under suspicion of knowing about this . europe 's criticism of guantanamo and other prisons used by the us government to interrogate terrorists and terror suspects has been too quiet in the past .
european politicians too quickly retracted to the standpoint that the us government is obligated by its country 's constitution to uphold democratic principles and the rule of law . upholding democracy 's highest values bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice and merkel at a news conference tuesday no one can accept that exactly these values are trampled on to defend democratic societies and values in the fight against terror .
german chancellor angela merkel was right to emphasize this on tuesday . torture methods of any kind have to remain banned from the repertoire of the military and the intelligence community - even if you risk failure in preventing a planned terrorist attack because of it .
the violation of human rights can not be weighed against even worse human rights violations that could potentially be prevented this way . the german government has to stand up for its values , despite its commitment to a trans-atlantic partnership and the fight against terrorism .
and that 's why it not only has to uncover the alleged cognizance of the previous government regarding cia activities , but it also must put pressure on the us government until washington offers full disclosure . paying lip service is not enough . klaus dahmann -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rice aides slam comment that us made " mistake " german chancellor angela merkel said tuesday that the us government admitted that a german national had been wrongfully abducted after cia officials believed him to be a terror suspect .

the former german government meanwhile has come under pressure in the affair . citing cia sources , us tv channel abc reported that the american intelligence service moved 11 alleged al qaeda operatives from eastern europe to a north african country , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a us air base in romania .
human rights watch said the cia set up secret prisons there cia officials declined to comment on the reports and the polish government said that it was not true .
romania meanwhile plans to open an investigation into the matter .
the country hopes to join the eu by 2007 and brussels has threatened that membership talks could be endangered should the allegations prove to be correct . who knew in berlin ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what did schily know ?
and when ?
officials of germany 's former government have also come under pressure in the affair .
initially , only former interior minister otto schily had been reportedly informed about the wrongful abduction of a german national by cia operatives . but süddeutsche zeitung newspaper reported tuesday that officials at the german chancellery and the foreign ministry also knew about the case of khaled el-masri , who had been abducted to afghanistan .
the man 's lawyer contacted the chancellery and foreign ministry for help and the chancellery promised to get involved in a letter , the paper reported . germany 's intelligence service , bnd , reportedly investigated the case as a result and came to the conclusion that el-masri had been abducted , according to süddeutsche zeitung . opposition calls for investigation opposition leader guido westerwelle of the free-market , liberal free democratic party said that the affairs could seriously damage us-german relations , adding that his party would call for a parliamentary inquiry if necessary to resolve the case . but dieter wiefelspütz , the social democratic party 's security expert in parliament , told deutschlandfunk public radio tuesday morning that people should wait with drawing conclusions before us officials had commented on the situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice and merkel are set to meet on tuesday us secretary of state condoleezza rice , who arrived in berlin late monday and is expected to hold talks with german chancellor angela merkel tuesday , has promised to reply to european concerns over reports that the cia used several european airports and secret jails to transport and detain terrorist suspects . rice : no one forced to work with us but rice , who will also visit romania , ukrain and brussels , also said that she would not comment on the alleged existence of secret cia prisons . " we can not discuss information that would compromise the success of intelligence , law-enforcement and military operations , " she said before leaving the us .
" we expect other nations share this view .
it 's up to those governments and their citizens to decide if they wish to work with us to prevent terrorist attacks in their own country or other countries .
they have a sovereign right to make that choice . " rice did , however , talk about allegations that the cia touched down at european airports while transporting terrorist suspects to third countries for interrogation , a practice known as rendition . " renditions take terrorists out of action , they save lives " rice said .

she 's not informing german chancellor merkel directly and instead made remarks before her departure to berlin when the european union and the european council asked for information .
" the statement turned out as expected , " the paper continued , saying that rice merely confirmed the existence of such flights .
" rice of course denies that terror suspects are moved to places where they can be tortured .
believe it if you want to .
at the very least , there 's guantanamo , where suspects have been kept without seeing lawyers or a judge for years . " berlin 's der tagesspiegel said that germans and europeans should look at the basis of the conflict : " how are terrorists meant to be treated ?
like common criminals , prisoners of war or something else ? " it asked .
the paper continued that europe should weigh the options carefully and reconsider its stance of moral superiority .
" morals are one thing , fighting terrorism another .
is the geneva convention our only guideline when attacks are to be prevented ?
the us government has deserved to be criticized , but to climb the high horse and benefit from these methods is hypocritical . " several members of germany 's former red-green government should start blushing if reports about their knowledge of the illegal abduction of a german national prove to be true , commented the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung in essen .
" signs are mounting that european governments had some knowledge of human rights abuses , but did n't want to look to carefully , " the paper wrote .
" us president bush consciously ignores international law .
it 's possible that several eu states became compliant accomplices , including berlin . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secretary of state condoleezza rice london 's the independent meanwhile said that rice has been " a rare star in a bush administration that has otherwise stumbled from one mess to another .
the reason is not merely her style and dazzling fashion sense .
european governments have been impressed by her efforts to restore the role of diplomacy in american policy-making , and to re-establish the primacy of the state department -lrb- as opposed to the pentagon and the vice-president 's office -rrb- in that process . "
while putting her predecessor , colin powell , to shame over making progress in the middle east , her current trip to europe proves to be a special challenge , the paper wrote .
her european partners are deeply worried about cia flights through german airspace , among other things .
the test will be not only what rice has to say about the allegations , but how she will do it , commented the daily .
relations between europe and the us are in a sensible phase , it continued : a lack of tact would be disastrous for both sides .
in moscow , kommersant daily reminded readers that bush had come to europe just a few months ago to emphasize that europe and the us could not afford to have differences of opinion in the fight against terror .
" the latest scandal has clarified that a basis for rapprochement between the us and europe has not been found yet , " it wrote .
" europe is not ready for the sacrifices bush demands in the fight against terror .
that 's why rice sounds like a lonely caller in the desert during her european visit . " and le monde in paris wrote that the affair puts german chancellor angela merkel in a difficult position .
" she wants to improve trans-atlantic ties , but reports about cia planes that have entered german air space or used bases in germany , make this more difficult , " said the daily . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : us closes secret cia prisons ahead of rice visit the us has reportedly shut down two secret cia prisons in poland and romania just ahead of us secretary of state rice 's visit to europe .

meanwhile , the federal government is fighting an eu ban on tobacco advertising . some 37 percent of germans smoke , one of the highest levels in the european union .
among women smokers , germany is at the very top .
according to health experts , one of the reasons for this is the fact that many of the country 's most renowned public health experts long played down the damaging effects of lighting up - often because they were in the pay of large tobacco concerns . the study , published in the american journal of public health , says many experts worked hand in hand since the 1970 's with firms such as r.j. reynolds and philip morris to " manipulate and skew " the mounting evidence that smoking could be deadly , largely because they received research money from the cigarette manufacturers . the leading author of the study , berlin researcher thilo grüning , cites the example of one of german medicine 's biggest names , fritz kemper , long-time professor at the university of münster , talented toxicologist , and member of germany 's top medical committees .
in 2002 , he received the große verdienstkreuz , one of germany 's highest civilian honors . but grüning also found that kemper was a key scientific ally to big tobacco .
in one year , according to internal documents the study examined , he received $ 20,000 dollars from r.j. reynolds , the maker of camel cigarettes , for informing the multinational about the activities of german scientists and politicians in the area of tobacco . influence on study results after the united states , germany was one of the most important bases for the tobacco lobby .
as early as 1975 , the cigarette industry association vdc founded a " research council on smoking and health . "

for example , franz adlkofer , a leading german tobacco researcher , assured his colleagues in the us that one study about nicotine as a carcinogenic would be " hidden , " another studied would " guaranteed not be published . " martina pötschke-langer , head of the center for tobacco control at the world health organization in heidelberg , told the newsmagazine der spiegel that the roll of leading german health experts in covering up the harmful effects of tobacco was " shocking . " " presumably many fewer people would die today from tobacco if medical professionals would have taken the results they found on the consequences of smoking seriously , " she said . so for , only one german research institute , the cancer research center in heidelberg , passed an ethical code banning it from accepting funding from the tobacco industry .
that was just at the beginning of november - this year . germany fights eu ban meanwhile , the tobacco industry continues to enjoy something of a comfortable position in germany as the new government continues to fight against an eu ban on all tobacco advertising that the predecessor government under gerhard schröder began .
the government will make its position clear when the case is argued before the european court of justice on tuesday . since july , newspaper , radio and internet sites across the eu are prohibitted from advertising tobacco products .
however , the ban is being effectively ignored by many countries , including germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : r1 cigarette advertisement billboard , germany , photo 2000/10/5 a spokesman for the government said the case is not about the health effects of smoking , but whether the eu has the right to pass a ban against national advertising that does not cross international borders .
according to berlin , the eu 's jurisdiction does not extend to domestic advertising . but david byrne , a former eu health commissioner , says germany in particular is in need of stricter rules on tobacco ads . " in germany , 37 percent of the population smokes and there are lax regulations on tobacco advertising , " he said .
" in sweden there are stronger laws and only 19 percent of the population smokes . " the german newspaper and magazine publishing associations are also opposed to the ban , saying they fear that the advertising ban could lead to similar bans in other industries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.12.2005 press review : compliant accomplices großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things are n't quite that cozy at the moment german and european papers viewed the allegations regarding secret cia flights and prisons as a test for us-eu relations and wrote that condoleezza rice has her work cut out for her as she visits europe this week . the südwest presse in ulm wrote that despite all the criticism surrounding alleged cia secret flights , rice is sticking to diplomatic rules .
she 's not informing german chancellor merkel directly and instead made remarks before her departure to berlin when the european union and the european council asked for information .
" the statement turned out as expected , " the paper continued , saying that rice merely confirmed the existence of such flights .
" rice of course denies that terror suspects are moved to places where they can be tortured .
believe it if you want to .
at the very least , there 's guantanamo , where suspects have been kept without seeing lawyers or a judge for years . " berlin 's der tagesspiegel said that germans and europeans should look at the basis of the conflict : " how are terrorists meant to be treated ?
like common criminals , prisoners of war or something else ? " it asked .
the paper continued that europe should weigh the options carefully and reconsider its stance of moral superiority .
" morals are one thing , fighting terrorism another .
is the geneva convention our only guideline when attacks are to be prevented ?
the us government has deserved to be criticized , but to climb the high horse and benefit from these methods is hypocritical . " several members of germany 's former red-green government should start blushing if reports about their knowledge of the illegal abduction of a german national prove to be true , commented the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung in essen .
" signs are mounting that european governments had some knowledge of human rights abuses , but did n't want to look to carefully , " the paper wrote .
" us president bush consciously ignores international law .
it 's possible that several eu states became compliant accomplices , including berlin . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secretary of state condoleezza rice london 's the independent meanwhile said that rice has been " a rare star in a bush administration that has otherwise stumbled from one mess to another .
the reason is not merely her style and dazzling fashion sense .
european governments have been impressed by her efforts to restore the role of diplomacy in american policy-making , and to re-establish the primacy of the state department -lrb- as opposed to the pentagon and the vice-president 's office -rrb- in that process . "
while putting her predecessor , colin powell , to shame over making progress in the middle east , her current trip to europe proves to be a special challenge , the paper wrote .
her european partners are deeply worried about cia flights through german airspace , among other things .
the test will be not only what rice has to say about the allegations , but how she will do it , commented the daily .
relations between europe and the us are in a sensible phase , it continued : a lack of tact would be disastrous for both sides .
in moscow , kommersant daily reminded readers that bush had come to europe just a few months ago to emphasize that europe and the us could not afford to have differences of opinion in the fight against terror .
" the latest scandal has clarified that a basis for rapprochement between the us and europe has not been found yet , " it wrote .
" europe is not ready for the sacrifices bush demands in the fight against terror .
that 's why rice sounds like a lonely caller in the desert during her european visit . " and le monde in paris wrote that the affair puts german chancellor angela merkel in a difficult position .
" she wants to improve trans-atlantic ties , but reports about cia planes that have entered german air space or used bases in germany , make this more difficult , " said the daily . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : us closes secret cia prisons ahead of rice visit the us has reportedly shut down two secret cia prisons in poland and romania just ahead of us secretary of state rice 's visit to europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.12.2005 opinion : europe needs to pressure us on cia scandal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is guantanamo proof that europe needs to keep watching the us ?
allegations of secret cia prisons and flights across europe overshadow us secretary of state condoleezza rice 's visit .
europe should n't be satisfied with half-hearted answers , says dw 's klaus dahmann . if condoleezza rice is to be believed , then the united states preserves the world from the evil of terror , and america is a country that adheres to human rights in everything it does . transporting prisoners from one country to another where torture may be applied as a means to help along investigations - no , that 's not something the united states does or ever did do .
the united states does n't use air space nor the airports of other countries to transport prisoners to torture cellars . if you believe rice , that is . then all speculations about secret cia prisons in poland and romania have been " misunderstandings . "
the us only takes care of the " first and oldest duty of every government " - protecting its people . too quiet for too long ? europe can not and should not be satisfied with these answers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cia prison in kosovo ?
firstly , the american secretary of state still has n't answered the central question : does or did the cia maintain secret prisons in european countries ? secondly , a lawless place already exists in the form of guantanamo .
that the cia has used torture there has not only been confirmed by victims and human rights organizations such as amnesty international , but also former members of the us intelligence service . it 's clear that the torture allegations are not just a domestic american issue - and not only so since european governments have come under suspicion of knowing about this . europe 's criticism of guantanamo and other prisons used by the us government to interrogate terrorists and terror suspects has been too quiet in the past .
european politicians too quickly retracted to the standpoint that the us government is obligated by its country 's constitution to uphold democratic principles and the rule of law . upholding democracy 's highest values bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice and merkel at a news conference tuesday no one can accept that exactly these values are trampled on to defend democratic societies and values in the fight against terror .
german chancellor angela merkel was right to emphasize this on tuesday . torture methods of any kind have to remain banned from the repertoire of the military and the intelligence community - even if you risk failure in preventing a planned terrorist attack because of it .
the violation of human rights can not be weighed against even worse human rights violations that could potentially be prevented this way . the german government has to stand up for its values , despite its commitment to a trans-atlantic partnership and the fight against terrorism .
and that 's why it not only has to uncover the alleged cognizance of the previous government regarding cia activities , but it also must put pressure on the us government until washington offers full disclosure . paying lip service is not enough . klaus dahmann -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rice aides slam comment that us made " mistake " german chancellor angela merkel said tuesday that the us government admitted that a german national had been wrongfully abducted after cia officials believed him to be a terror suspect .

collectively the family is worth $ 7.7 billion -lrb- 6.56 billion euros -rrb- . following the death of rudolf august 's father , rudolf oetker , in the verdun killing fields in 1916 , the family business was run by his mother ida and her second husband , richard kaselowsky .
after graduating from high school , the young rudolf august opted to do an apprenticeship in banking , but that only lasted until 1936 when he was conscripted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from baking powder to powdered jelly the oetker family business was founded in 1891 when rudolf august 's pharmacist grandfather , august oetker , started selling little packets of the then almost unheard of baking powder , under the name " bakin .

each package came with a tried and tested recipe , and before long , oetker senior was writing and selling bakery books and was such a success that he closed down his pharmacy in order to dedicate himself fully to his budding empire . the empire continued to expand even after oetker 's death .

after graduating from high school , the young rudolf august opted to do an apprenticeship in banking , but that only lasted until 1936 when he was conscripted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from baking powder to powdered jelly the oetker family business was founded in 1891 when rudolf august 's pharmacist grandfather , august oetker , started selling little packets of the then almost unheard of baking powder , under the name " bakin . "
each package came with a tried and tested recipe , and before long , oetker senior was writing and selling bakery books and was such a success that he closed down his pharmacy in order to dedicate himself fully to his budding empire . the empire continued to expand even after oetker 's death .
kaselowsky , who took over in 1918 , chartered the growing business into new territory by developing baking ingredients like vanilla sugar or introducing powdered pudding mix onto the market . from stre n gth to stre n gth then in 1944 , following the death of his mother , step father and two half-sisters , it was rudolf august who took over at the helm of the baking business .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.12.2005 rice aides slam comment that us made " mistake " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's some disagreement about who was admitting exactly to what after angela merkel said tuesday that the us admitted it erred in detaining a german national , rice 's aides challenged her comments , saying they were n't sure " what was in -lrb- merkel 's -rrb- head " when she said what she did . speaking to the press after a meeting with us secretary of state condoleezza rice in berlin tuesday , merkel said she had discussed the case of khaled el-masri , a lebanese-born german national who was reportedly abducted by cia operatives and held in afghanistan for several months . " the american administration has admitted that this man was erroneously taken , " merkel told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el-masri says he was kept in afghanistan for five months but senior us officials , who are travelling with rice on her european tour , disagreed with merkel 's interpretation .
after the news conference , they met with the chancellor 's aides and asked for a explanation , saying rice had not actually admitted to a us mistake over masri . " we are not quite sure what was in her head , " a senior us administration official told reuters . he said while the bush administration had informed germany about masri 's detention and release , he did not say it was an error on the us government 's part . the official went on to say that the german chancellor might have been drawing on media reports rather than any dialog with the us administration when she concluded that washington had admitted to a mistake . masri was released last year after five months in an afghan jail after the united states realized it " no longer had evidence or intelligence to justify his continued detention , " the official said , but declined to respond when asked if the us had ever had evidence to hold him . he did acknowledge that masri was originally detained because of a suspicion that he had a false passport and had the same name as a militant leader .
the passport turned out to be genuine , the official added . the case caused an uproar in germany after recent news reports that former interior minister otto schily had been informed about the wrongful abduction by the then us ambassador in germany . reports about secret cia flights to transport terror suspects across german air space and to us air bases in germany have also strained relations in the last weeks .
the us is also facing criticism for allegedly operating secret cia prisons in eastern europe . rice : a case for the courts saying that masri 's case was a matter for litigation , rice declined to comment on it , but did say that the us was ready to correct its mistakes , which could have led merkel to make the comments she did . " any policy will result in errors , " she said .
" when mistakes are made , we work very hard to rectify them .
i believe that this will be handled in the proper courts , here in germany and if necessary in american courts as well . " rice also reiterated her view that her government could not reveal details about us intelligence agencies . " we have to have intelligence that can be effective , " she said .
" without good intelligence , you can simply not protect innocent civilians from the kind of attacks that we 've witnessed around the globe . " merkel sees intensified relationship rice added that washington was adhering to national and international laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said rice 's statement is a good basis for intelligence cooperation " the us does not condone torture , " she said .
" it is against us law to commit torture and it 's also against the us ' international obligations .
the president has made it very clear that us personnel will operate within us law and international obligations . " merkel said that she was glad rice had reiterated the us administration 's commitment to international laws . " it was important for me that the secretary of state repeated this , that the united states sticks to its international obligations , " she said , adding that she was looking forward to continuing to build an " intensified relationship between our two countries " during her upcoming visit to washington in january . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : us closes secret cia prisons ahead of rice visit the us has reportedly shut down two secret cia prisons in poland and romania just ahead of us secretary of state rice 's visit to europe .

" the american administration has admitted that this man was erroneously taken , " merkel told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el-masri says he was kept in afghanistan for five months but senior us officials , who are travelling with rice on her european tour , disagreed with merkel 's interpretation .
after the news conference , they met with the chancellor 's aides and asked for a explanation , saying rice had not actually admitted to a us mistake over masri . " we are not quite sure what was in her head , " a senior us administration official told reuters . he said while the bush administration had informed germany about masri 's detention and release , he did not say it was an error on the us government 's part . the official went on to say that the german chancellor might have been drawing on media reports rather than any dialog with the us administration when she concluded that washington had admitted to a mistake . masri was released last year after five months in an afghan jail after the united states realized it " no longer had evidence or intelligence to justify his continued detention , " the official said , but declined to respond when asked if the us had ever had evidence to hold him . he did acknowledge that masri was originally detained because of a suspicion that he had a false passport and had the same name as a militant leader .
the passport turned out to be genuine , the official added . the case caused an uproar in germany after recent news reports that former interior minister otto schily had been informed about the wrongful abduction by the then us ambassador in germany . reports about secret cia flights to transport terror suspects across german air space and to us air bases in germany have also strained relations in the last weeks .
the us is also facing criticism for allegedly operating secret cia prisons in eastern europe . rice : a case for the courts saying that masri 's case was a matter for litigation , rice declined to comment on it , but did say that the us was ready to correct its mistakes , which could have led merkel to make the comments she did . " any policy will result in errors , " she said .
" when mistakes are made , we work very hard to rectify them .
i believe that this will be handled in the proper courts , here in germany and if necessary in american courts as well . " rice also reiterated her view that her government could not reveal details about us intelligence agencies . " we have to have intelligence that can be effective , " she said .
" without good intelligence , you can simply not protect innocent civilians from the kind of attacks that we 've witnessed around the globe . " merkel sees intensified relationship rice added that washington was adhering to national and international laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said rice 's statement is a good basis for intelligence cooperation " the us does not condone torture , " she said .
" it is against us law to commit torture and it 's also against the us ' international obligations .
the president has made it very clear that us personnel will operate within us law and international obligations . " merkel said that she was glad rice had reiterated the us administration 's commitment to international laws . " it was important for me that the secretary of state repeated this , that the united states sticks to its international obligations , " she said , adding that she was looking forward to continuing to build an " intensified relationship between our two countries " during her upcoming visit to washington in january . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : us closes secret cia prisons ahead of rice visit the us has reportedly shut down two secret cia prisons in poland and romania just ahead of us secretary of state rice 's visit to europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.12.2005 opinion : europe needs to pressure us on cia scandal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is guantanamo proof that europe needs to keep watching the us ?
allegations of secret cia prisons and flights across europe overshadow us secretary of state condoleezza rice 's visit .
europe should n't be satisfied with half-hearted answers , says dw 's klaus dahmann . if condoleezza rice is to be believed , then the united states preserves the world from the evil of terror , and america is a country that adheres to human rights in everything it does . transporting prisoners from one country to another where torture may be applied as a means to help along investigations - no , that 's not something the united states does or ever did do .
the united states does n't use air space nor the airports of other countries to transport prisoners to torture cellars . if you believe rice , that is . then all speculations about secret cia prisons in poland and romania have been " misunderstandings . "
the us only takes care of the " first and oldest duty of every government " - protecting its people . too quiet for too long ? europe can not and should not be satisfied with these answers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cia prison in kosovo ?
firstly , the american secretary of state still has n't answered the central question : does or did the cia maintain secret prisons in european countries ? secondly , a lawless place already exists in the form of guantanamo .
that the cia has used torture there has not only been confirmed by victims and human rights organizations such as amnesty international , but also former members of the us intelligence service . it 's clear that the torture allegations are not just a domestic american issue - and not only so since european governments have come under suspicion of knowing about this . europe 's criticism of guantanamo and other prisons used by the us government to interrogate terrorists and terror suspects has been too quiet in the past .
european politicians too quickly retracted to the standpoint that the us government is obligated by its country 's constitution to uphold democratic principles and the rule of law . upholding democracy 's highest values bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice and merkel at a news conference tuesday no one can accept that exactly these values are trampled on to defend democratic societies and values in the fight against terror .

meanwhile , the federal government is fighting an eu ban on tobacco advertising . some 37 percent of germans smoke , one of the highest levels in the european union .
among women smokers , germany is at the very top .
according to health experts , one of the reasons for this is the fact that many of the country 's most renowned public health experts long played down the damaging effects of lighting up - often because they were in the pay of large tobacco concerns . the study , published in the american journal of public health , says many experts worked hand in hand since the 1970 's with firms such as r.j. reynolds and philip morris to " manipulate and skew " the mounting evidence that smoking could be deadly , largely because they received research money from the cigarette manufacturers . the leading author of the study , berlin researcher thilo grüning , cites the example of one of german medicine 's biggest names , fritz kemper , long-time professor at the university of münster , talented toxicologist , and member of germany 's top medical committees .

" martina pötschke-langer , head of the center for tobacco control at the world health organization in heidelberg , told the newsmagazine der spiegel that the roll of leading german health experts in covering up the harmful effects of tobacco was " shocking .

" in germany , 37 percent of the population smokes and there are lax regulations on tobacco advertising , " he said .
" in sweden there are stronger laws and only 19 percent of the population smokes . " the german newspaper and magazine publishing associations are also opposed to the ban , saying they fear that the advertising ban could lead to similar bans in other industries .

for example , franz adlkofer , a leading german tobacco researcher , assured his colleagues in the us that one study about nicotine as a carcinogenic would be " hidden , " another studied would " guaranteed not be published . " martina pötschke-langer , head of the center for tobacco control at the world health organization in heidelberg , told the newsmagazine der spiegel that the roll of leading german health experts in covering up the harmful effects of tobacco was " shocking . " " presumably many fewer people would die today from tobacco if medical professionals would have taken the results they found on the consequences of smoking seriously , " she said . so for , only one german research institute , the cancer research center in heidelberg , passed an ethical code banning it from accepting funding from the tobacco industry .
that was just at the beginning of november - this year . germany fights eu ban meanwhile , the tobacco industry continues to enjoy something of a comfortable position in germany as the new government continues to fight against an eu ban on all tobacco advertising that the predecessor government under gerhard schröder began .

it makes concessions , opens up it markets , but is still called responsible for the fact that global trade negotiations are sluggish and accused of rowing against the tide in the run-up to the wto trade conference in hong kong from december 13 to 18 . " we are offering to reduce subsidies that distort trade by 70 percent , " said eu trade commissioner peter mandelson , referring to an offer the eu made on october 28 .
" we can do that thanks to reforms that have already been decided and put into place .

indeed , it was the complaint they filed with the wto that forced the eu to reform its highly subsidized sugar industry .
but now brazil is arguing the eu suggestions do n't go far enough to improve market access for top brazilian exports like beef . " how can they think that they do n't see a decided advantage when we we 're willing to lower our highest tariff rate by 60 percent ? " asked the deputy departmental head of the eu agricultural section , flavio coturini . the eu offer in the agricultural sector for the hong kong conference consists of three parts : 1 . to completely abolish eu export subsidies . 2 . to reduce other rated subsidies by 70 percent , especially those seen as distorting free trade . 3 . to reduce agricultural tariffs by as much as 60 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beef is a leading brazilian export however , some eight percent of products should be exempt from this reduction .

beef falls within this category , which angers the south americans , since they see a potentially large market for their beef in europe . hard fronts there wo n't be any further concessions , according to the eu commission , the bloc 's executive body .
in exchange for their agricultural largess , the eu calls for concessions by other countries in the areas of services and industrial goods . " there must be real economic gains , new streams of commerce , " said david o 'sullivan , the eu 's director-general for trade .
" we think our suggestions provide that .
we expect similar concessions from our negotiating partners .
and to be honest , what the brazilians have offered us regarding non-agricultural goods does n't really provide better market access for the products that we are interested in . " but brazil and its foreign minister celso amorim are still playing poker , saying that before they comply with eu demands , the bloc needs to offer a more attractive agricultural deal . " there will be no counter offers , " said an irritated mandelson .

that is the problem . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world trade organization 's director-general french pascal lamy the state of negotiations in the run-up to hong kong is not great .
the working paper put forward by the wto director pascal lamy is vague and inconcrete .
analysts say many of these issues should have been settled over two years ago .
but conflicting demands have lead to a stalemate . the eu wants to break out of its isolation and is trying to bring the poorest countries over to its side by means of a development package .
but poor countries would actually gain very little from improved eu market access , since they are already allowed to export most of their goods to the bloc without paying duty . opportunity lost ? peter mandelson is now trying to increase pressure on brazil to keep the wto talks from ending in failure . " that would ruin a huge economic opportunity , " he said , " it would also be very harmful to the wto and could turn back the clock on global multilateralism . " " i believe that europe carries a greater responsibility than others do to bring this round -lrb- of talks -rrb- forward and that is what we 're going to do .

the bloc is passing the buck on to brazil and at the same time , trying to bring poor countries to its side . the european union is frustrated .
it makes concessions , opens up it markets , but is still called responsible for the fact that global trade negotiations are sluggish and accused of rowing against the tide in the run-up to the wto trade conference in hong kong from december 13 to 18 . " we are offering to reduce subsidies that distort trade by 70 percent , " said eu trade commissioner peter mandelson , referring to an offer the eu made on october 28 .
" we can do that thanks to reforms that have already been decided and put into place . " he says there is no reason to doubt the motives , or behavior , of the eu , and that the bloc 's accommodation in trade matters has not been appreciated by its trading partners . the blame game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union commissioner for trade peter mandelson mandelson 's critique is aimed fairly squarely at the group of developing nations , the so-called g-20 , and especially at the group 's mouthpiece , brazil . the brazilians have been at odds with the eu for years over agricultural policy .
indeed , it was the complaint they filed with the wto that forced the eu to reform its highly subsidized sugar industry .
but now brazil is arguing the eu suggestions do n't go far enough to improve market access for top brazilian exports like beef . " how can they think that they do n't see a decided advantage when we we 're willing to lower our highest tariff rate by 60 percent ? " asked the deputy departmental head of the eu agricultural section , flavio coturini . the eu offer in the agricultural sector for the hong kong conference consists of three parts : 1 . to completely abolish eu export subsidies . 2 . to reduce other rated subsidies by 70 percent , especially those seen as distorting free trade . 3 . to reduce agricultural tariffs by as much as 60 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beef is a leading brazilian export however , some eight percent of products should be exempt from this reduction .
brussels would like to protect its so-called " sensitive goods " from foreign competitors .
beef falls within this category , which angers the south americans , since they see a potentially large market for their beef in europe . hard fronts there wo n't be any further concessions , according to the eu commission , the bloc 's executive body .
in exchange for their agricultural largess , the eu calls for concessions by other countries in the areas of services and industrial goods . " there must be real economic gains , new streams of commerce , " said david o 'sullivan , the eu 's director-general for trade .
" we think our suggestions provide that .
we expect similar concessions from our negotiating partners .
and to be honest , what the brazilians have offered us regarding non-agricultural goods does n't really provide better market access for the products that we are interested in . " but brazil and its foreign minister celso amorim are still playing poker , saying that before they comply with eu demands , the bloc needs to offer a more attractive agricultural deal . " there will be no counter offers , " said an irritated mandelson .
" there are no possible deals during these negotiations if the only topic is market access in the agricultural sector .
that is the problem . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world trade organization 's director-general french pascal lamy the state of negotiations in the run-up to hong kong is not great .
the working paper put forward by the wto director pascal lamy is vague and inconcrete .
analysts say many of these issues should have been settled over two years ago .
but conflicting demands have lead to a stalemate . the eu wants to break out of its isolation and is trying to bring the poorest countries over to its side by means of a development package .
but poor countries would actually gain very little from improved eu market access , since they are already allowed to export most of their goods to the bloc without paying duty . opportunity lost ? peter mandelson is now trying to increase pressure on brazil to keep the wto talks from ending in failure . " that would ruin a huge economic opportunity , " he said , " it would also be very harmful to the wto and could turn back the clock on global multilateralism . " " i believe that europe carries a greater responsibility than others do to bring this round -lrb- of talks -rrb- forward and that is what we 're going to do . " while he is not counting on a breakthrough in hong kong , he says it is crucial to codify what has already been accomplished .

after the news conference , they met with the chancellor 's aides and asked for a explanation , saying rice had not actually admitted to a us mistake over masri . " we are not quite sure what was in her head , " a senior us administration official told reuters . he said while the bush administration had informed germany about masri 's detention and release , he did not say it was an error on the us government 's part . the official went on to say that the german chancellor might have been drawing on media reports rather than any dialog with the us administration when she concluded that washington had admitted to a mistake . masri was released last year after five months in an afghan jail after the united states realized it " no longer had evidence or intelligence to justify his continued detention , " the official said , but declined to respond when asked if the us had ever had evidence to hold him . he did acknowledge that masri was originally detained because of a suspicion that he had a false passport and had the same name as a militant leader .
the passport turned out to be genuine , the official added . the case caused an uproar in germany after recent news reports that former interior minister otto schily had been informed about the wrongful abduction by the then us ambassador in germany . reports about secret cia flights to transport terror suspects across german air space and to us air bases in germany have also strained relations in the last weeks .
the us is also facing criticism for allegedly operating secret cia prisons in eastern europe . rice : a case for the courts saying that masri 's case was a matter for litigation , rice declined to comment on it , but did say that the us was ready to correct its mistakes , which could have led merkel to make the comments she did . " any policy will result in errors , " she said .
" when mistakes are made , we work very hard to rectify them .
i believe that this will be handled in the proper courts , here in germany and if necessary in american courts as well . " rice also reiterated her view that her government could not reveal details about us intelligence agencies . " we have to have intelligence that can be effective , " she said .
" without good intelligence , you can simply not protect innocent civilians from the kind of attacks that we 've witnessed around the globe . " merkel sees intensified relationship rice added that washington was adhering to national and international laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said rice 's statement is a good basis for intelligence cooperation " the us does not condone torture , " she said .
" it is against us law to commit torture and it 's also against the us ' international obligations .
the president has made it very clear that us personnel will operate within us law and international obligations . " merkel said that she was glad rice had reiterated the us administration 's commitment to international laws . " it was important for me that the secretary of state repeated this , that the united states sticks to its international obligations , " she said , adding that she was looking forward to continuing to build an " intensified relationship between our two countries " during her upcoming visit to washington in january . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : us closes secret cia prisons ahead of rice visit the us has reportedly shut down two secret cia prisons in poland and romania just ahead of us secretary of state rice 's visit to europe .

" the american administration has admitted that this man was erroneously taken , " merkel told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el-masri says he was kept in afghanistan for five months but senior us officials , who are travelling with rice on her european tour , disagreed with merkel 's interpretation .
after the news conference , they met with the chancellor 's aides and asked for a explanation , saying rice had not actually admitted to a us mistake over masri . " we are not quite sure what was in her head , " a senior us administration official told reuters . he said while the bush administration had informed germany about masri 's detention and release , he did not say it was an error on the us government 's part . the official went on to say that the german chancellor might have been drawing on media reports rather than any dialog with the us administration when she concluded that washington had admitted to a mistake . masri was released last year after five months in an afghan jail after the united states realized it " no longer had evidence or intelligence to justify his continued detention , " the official said , but declined to respond when asked if the us had ever had evidence to hold him . he did acknowledge that masri was originally detained because of a suspicion that he had a false passport and had the same name as a militant leader .
the passport turned out to be genuine , the official added . the case caused an uproar in germany after recent news reports that former interior minister otto schily had been informed about the wrongful abduction by the then us ambassador in germany . reports about secret cia flights to transport terror suspects across german air space and to us air bases in germany have also strained relations in the last weeks .
the us is also facing criticism for allegedly operating secret cia prisons in eastern europe . rice : a case for the courts saying that masri 's case was a matter for litigation , rice declined to comment on it , but did say that the us was ready to correct its mistakes , which could have led merkel to make the comments she did . " any policy will result in errors , " she said .
" when mistakes are made , we work very hard to rectify them .
i believe that this will be handled in the proper courts , here in germany and if necessary in american courts as well . " rice also reiterated her view that her government could not reveal details about us intelligence agencies . " we have to have intelligence that can be effective , " she said .
" without good intelligence , you can simply not protect innocent civilians from the kind of attacks that we 've witnessed around the globe . " merkel sees intensified relationship rice added that washington was adhering to national and international laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said rice 's statement is a good basis for intelligence cooperation " the us does not condone torture , " she said .
" it is against us law to commit torture and it 's also against the us ' international obligations .
the president has made it very clear that us personnel will operate within us law and international obligations . " merkel said that she was glad rice had reiterated the us administration 's commitment to international laws . " it was important for me that the secretary of state repeated this , that the united states sticks to its international obligations , " she said , adding that she was looking forward to continuing to build an " intensified relationship between our two countries " during her upcoming visit to washington in january . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : us closes secret cia prisons ahead of rice visit the us has reportedly shut down two secret cia prisons in poland and romania just ahead of us secretary of state rice 's visit to europe .

the former german government meanwhile has come under pressure in the affair . citing cia sources , us tv channel abc reported that the american intelligence service moved 11 alleged al qaeda operatives from eastern europe to a north african country , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a us air base in romania .
human rights watch said the cia set up secret prisons there cia officials declined to comment on the reports and the polish government said that it was not true .
romania meanwhile plans to open an investigation into the matter .
the country hopes to join the eu by 2007 and brussels has threatened that membership talks could be endangered should the allegations prove to be correct . who knew in berlin ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what did schily know ?
and when ?
officials of germany 's former government have also come under pressure in the affair .
initially , only former interior minister otto schily had been reportedly informed about the wrongful abduction of a german national by cia operatives . but süddeutsche zeitung newspaper reported tuesday that officials at the german chancellery and the foreign ministry also knew about the case of khaled el-masri , who had been abducted to afghanistan .
the man 's lawyer contacted the chancellery and foreign ministry for help and the chancellery promised to get involved in a letter , the paper reported . germany 's intelligence service , bnd , reportedly investigated the case as a result and came to the conclusion that el-masri had been abducted , according to süddeutsche zeitung . opposition calls for investigation opposition leader guido westerwelle of the free-market , liberal free democratic party said that the affairs could seriously damage us-german relations , adding that his party would call for a parliamentary inquiry if necessary to resolve the case . but dieter wiefelspütz , the social democratic party 's security expert in parliament , told deutschlandfunk public radio tuesday morning that people should wait with drawing conclusions before us officials had commented on the situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice and merkel are set to meet on tuesday us secretary of state condoleezza rice , who arrived in berlin late monday and is expected to hold talks with german chancellor angela merkel tuesday , has promised to reply to european concerns over reports that the cia used several european airports and secret jails to transport and detain terrorist suspects . rice : no one forced to work with us but rice , who will also visit romania , ukrain and brussels , also said that she would not comment on the alleged existence of secret cia prisons . " we can not discuss information that would compromise the success of intelligence , law-enforcement and military operations , " she said before leaving the us .
" we expect other nations share this view .
it 's up to those governments and their citizens to decide if they wish to work with us to prevent terrorist attacks in their own country or other countries .
they have a sovereign right to make that choice .

europe should n't be satisfied with half-hearted answers , says dw 's klaus dahmann . if condoleezza rice is to be believed , then the united states preserves the world from the evil of terror , and america is a country that adheres to human rights in everything it does . transporting prisoners from one country to another where torture may be applied as a means to help along investigations - no , that 's not something the united states does or ever did do .

firstly , the american secretary of state still has n't answered the central question : does or did the cia maintain secret prisons in european countries ? secondly , a lawless place already exists in the form of guantanamo .
that the cia has used torture there has not only been confirmed by victims and human rights organizations such as amnesty international , but also former members of the us intelligence service . it 's clear that the torture allegations are not just a domestic american issue - and not only so since european governments have come under suspicion of knowing about this . europe 's criticism of guantanamo and other prisons used by the us government to interrogate terrorists and terror suspects has been too quiet in the past .
european politicians too quickly retracted to the standpoint that the us government is obligated by its country 's constitution to uphold democratic principles and the rule of law . upholding democracy 's highest values bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice and merkel at a news conference tuesday no one can accept that exactly these values are trampled on to defend democratic societies and values in the fight against terror .
german chancellor angela merkel was right to emphasize this on tuesday . torture methods of any kind have to remain banned from the repertoire of the military and the intelligence community - even if you risk failure in preventing a planned terrorist attack because of it .
the violation of human rights can not be weighed against even worse human rights violations that could potentially be prevented this way . the german government has to stand up for its values , despite its commitment to a trans-atlantic partnership and the fight against terrorism .

allegations of secret cia prisons and flights across europe overshadow us secretary of state condoleezza rice 's visit .
europe should n't be satisfied with half-hearted answers , says dw 's klaus dahmann . if condoleezza rice is to be believed , then the united states preserves the world from the evil of terror , and america is a country that adheres to human rights in everything it does . transporting prisoners from one country to another where torture may be applied as a means to help along investigations - no , that 's not something the united states does or ever did do .
the united states does n't use air space nor the airports of other countries to transport prisoners to torture cellars . if you believe rice , that is . then all speculations about secret cia prisons in poland and romania have been " misunderstandings . "
the us only takes care of the " first and oldest duty of every government " - protecting its people . too quiet for too long ? europe can not and should not be satisfied with these answers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cia prison in kosovo ?
firstly , the american secretary of state still has n't answered the central question : does or did the cia maintain secret prisons in european countries ? secondly , a lawless place already exists in the form of guantanamo .
that the cia has used torture there has not only been confirmed by victims and human rights organizations such as amnesty international , but also former members of the us intelligence service . it 's clear that the torture allegations are not just a domestic american issue - and not only so since european governments have come under suspicion of knowing about this . europe 's criticism of guantanamo and other prisons used by the us government to interrogate terrorists and terror suspects has been too quiet in the past .
european politicians too quickly retracted to the standpoint that the us government is obligated by its country 's constitution to uphold democratic principles and the rule of law . upholding democracy 's highest values bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice and merkel at a news conference tuesday no one can accept that exactly these values are trampled on to defend democratic societies and values in the fight against terror .
german chancellor angela merkel was right to emphasize this on tuesday . torture methods of any kind have to remain banned from the repertoire of the military and the intelligence community - even if you risk failure in preventing a planned terrorist attack because of it .
the violation of human rights can not be weighed against even worse human rights violations that could potentially be prevented this way . the german government has to stand up for its values , despite its commitment to a trans-atlantic partnership and the fight against terrorism .
and that 's why it not only has to uncover the alleged cognizance of the previous government regarding cia activities , but it also must put pressure on the us government until washington offers full disclosure . paying lip service is not enough . klaus dahmann -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rice aides slam comment that us made " mistake " german chancellor angela merkel said tuesday that the us government admitted that a german national had been wrongfully abducted after cia officials believed him to be a terror suspect .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany still lighting up much of europe bans smoking ; germany keeps puffing away germany : european smoker 's paradise germany gets eu slap on the wrist over tobacco laws tobacco companies see clouds in germany germany -pipe- 06.12.2005 germany 's close ties to big tobacco großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has the eu 's highest percentage of female smokers top german researchers have been paid off by the tobacco industry to play down the health effects of smoking , a study says .
meanwhile , the federal government is fighting an eu ban on tobacco advertising . some 37 percent of germans smoke , one of the highest levels in the european union .
among women smokers , germany is at the very top .
according to health experts , one of the reasons for this is the fact that many of the country 's most renowned public health experts long played down the damaging effects of lighting up - often because they were in the pay of large tobacco concerns . the study , published in the american journal of public health , says many experts worked hand in hand since the 1970 's with firms such as r.j. reynolds and philip morris to " manipulate and skew " the mounting evidence that smoking could be deadly , largely because they received research money from the cigarette manufacturers . the leading author of the study , berlin researcher thilo grüning , cites the example of one of german medicine 's biggest names , fritz kemper , long-time professor at the university of münster , talented toxicologist , and member of germany 's top medical committees .
in 2002 , he received the große verdienstkreuz , one of germany 's highest civilian honors . but grüning also found that kemper was a key scientific ally to big tobacco .
in one year , according to internal documents the study examined , he received $ 20,000 dollars from r.j. reynolds , the maker of camel cigarettes , for informing the multinational about the activities of german scientists and politicians in the area of tobacco . influence on study results after the united states , germany was one of the most important bases for the tobacco lobby .
as early as 1975 , the cigarette industry association vdc founded a " research council on smoking and health . "
but the committee turned out to be less than independent and due to the purse strings attached to the millions going to the committee , the tobacco industry had " a significant influence " on the results the panel of top health experts released . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking rates in germany are higher than they should be , experts say if investigations into the effects of tobacco smoking did not fit the desires of the industry , results were often played down .
for example , franz adlkofer , a leading german tobacco researcher , assured his colleagues in the us that one study about nicotine as a carcinogenic would be " hidden , " another studied would " guaranteed not be published . " martina pötschke-langer , head of the center for tobacco control at the world health organization in heidelberg , told the newsmagazine der spiegel that the roll of leading german health experts in covering up the harmful effects of tobacco was " shocking . " " presumably many fewer people would die today from tobacco if medical professionals would have taken the results they found on the consequences of smoking seriously , " she said . so for , only one german research institute , the cancer research center in heidelberg , passed an ethical code banning it from accepting funding from the tobacco industry .
that was just at the beginning of november - this year . germany fights eu ban meanwhile , the tobacco industry continues to enjoy something of a comfortable position in germany as the new government continues to fight against an eu ban on all tobacco advertising that the predecessor government under gerhard schröder began .
the government will make its position clear when the case is argued before the european court of justice on tuesday . since july , newspaper , radio and internet sites across the eu are prohibitted from advertising tobacco products .
however , the ban is being effectively ignored by many countries , including germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : r1 cigarette advertisement billboard , germany , photo 2000/10/5 a spokesman for the government said the case is not about the health effects of smoking , but whether the eu has the right to pass a ban against national advertising that does not cross international borders .
according to berlin , the eu 's jurisdiction does not extend to domestic advertising . but david byrne , a former eu health commissioner , says germany in particular is in need of stricter rules on tobacco ads . " in germany , 37 percent of the population smokes and there are lax regulations on tobacco advertising , " he said .
" in sweden there are stronger laws and only 19 percent of the population smokes . " the german newspaper and magazine publishing associations are also opposed to the ban , saying they fear that the advertising ban could lead to similar bans in other industries .
it is the second time the german government has gone before the eu 's highest court to argue against the ban .
a decision is expected in 2006 . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tobacco companies see clouds in germany politicians want next year 's world cup smoke-free .

meanwhile , the federal government is fighting an eu ban on tobacco advertising . some 37 percent of germans smoke , one of the highest levels in the european union .
among women smokers , germany is at the very top .
according to health experts , one of the reasons for this is the fact that many of the country 's most renowned public health experts long played down the damaging effects of lighting up - often because they were in the pay of large tobacco concerns . the study , published in the american journal of public health , says many experts worked hand in hand since the 1970 's with firms such as r.j. reynolds and philip morris to " manipulate and skew " the mounting evidence that smoking could be deadly , largely because they received research money from the cigarette manufacturers . the leading author of the study , berlin researcher thilo grüning , cites the example of one of german medicine 's biggest names , fritz kemper , long-time professor at the university of münster , talented toxicologist , and member of germany 's top medical committees .
in 2002 , he received the große verdienstkreuz , one of germany 's highest civilian honors . but grüning also found that kemper was a key scientific ally to big tobacco .

" in germany , 37 percent of the population smokes and there are lax regulations on tobacco advertising , " he said .
" in sweden there are stronger laws and only 19 percent of the population smokes . " the german newspaper and magazine publishing associations are also opposed to the ban , saying they fear that the advertising ban could lead to similar bans in other industries .

according to health experts , one of the reasons for this is the fact that many of the country 's most renowned public health experts long played down the damaging effects of lighting up - often because they were in the pay of large tobacco concerns . the study , published in the american journal of public health , says many experts worked hand in hand since the 1970 's with firms such as r.j. reynolds and philip morris to " manipulate and skew " the mounting evidence that smoking could be deadly , largely because they received research money from the cigarette manufacturers . the leading author of the study , berlin researcher thilo grüning , cites the example of one of german medicine 's biggest names , fritz kemper , long-time professor at the university of münster , talented toxicologist , and member of germany 's top medical committees .
in 2002 , he received the große verdienstkreuz , one of germany 's highest civilian honors . but grüning also found that kemper was a key scientific ally to big tobacco .
in one year , according to internal documents the study examined , he received $ 20,000 dollars from r.j. reynolds , the maker of camel cigarettes , for informing the multinational about the activities of german scientists and politicians in the area of tobacco . influence on study results after the united states , germany was one of the most important bases for the tobacco lobby .
as early as 1975 , the cigarette industry association vdc founded a " research council on smoking and health . "
but the committee turned out to be less than independent and due to the purse strings attached to the millions going to the committee , the tobacco industry had " a significant influence " on the results the panel of top health experts released . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking rates in germany are higher than they should be , experts say if investigations into the effects of tobacco smoking did not fit the desires of the industry , results were often played down .
for example , franz adlkofer , a leading german tobacco researcher , assured his colleagues in the us that one study about nicotine as a carcinogenic would be " hidden , " another studied would " guaranteed not be published . " martina pötschke-langer , head of the center for tobacco control at the world health organization in heidelberg , told the newsmagazine der spiegel that the roll of leading german health experts in covering up the harmful effects of tobacco was " shocking . " " presumably many fewer people would die today from tobacco if medical professionals would have taken the results they found on the consequences of smoking seriously , " she said . so for , only one german research institute , the cancer research center in heidelberg , passed an ethical code banning it from accepting funding from the tobacco industry .
that was just at the beginning of november - this year . germany fights eu ban meanwhile , the tobacco industry continues to enjoy something of a comfortable position in germany as the new government continues to fight against an eu ban on all tobacco advertising that the predecessor government under gerhard schröder began .
the government will make its position clear when the case is argued before the european court of justice on tuesday . since july , newspaper , radio and internet sites across the eu are prohibitted from advertising tobacco products .
however , the ban is being effectively ignored by many countries , including germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : r1 cigarette advertisement billboard , germany , photo 2000/10/5 a spokesman for the government said the case is not about the health effects of smoking , but whether the eu has the right to pass a ban against national advertising that does not cross international borders .
according to berlin , the eu 's jurisdiction does not extend to domestic advertising . but david byrne , a former eu health commissioner , says germany in particular is in need of stricter rules on tobacco ads . " in germany , 37 percent of the population smokes and there are lax regulations on tobacco advertising , " he said .
" in sweden there are stronger laws and only 19 percent of the population smokes . " the german newspaper and magazine publishing associations are also opposed to the ban , saying they fear that the advertising ban could lead to similar bans in other industries .

a un climate conference in montreal says the strategy is costly . against a background of melting polar caps , rising sea levels and natural disasters , international experts are meeting in montreal this week to discuss new targets for curbs on greenhouse gases . the figures are daunting .
according to the german institute for economic research , natural disasters will incur around $ 200 billion worth of damage over the next few decades . insurance company münchner rück , meanwhile , has calculated that financial damages wrought by storms , floods and earthquakes have increased ten-fold in the last 50 years . mutual concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new orleans the business community is beginning to wake up to the broader repercussions of environmental devastation .
ecological concerns are business concerns - but , as many have pointed out in montreal , business concerns are also ecological concerns . " environmental protection has to begin with industry , " said axel michaelowa , a climate researcher at the hamburg world economy institute .
" the main emitters of greenhouse gases are steel refineries and power companies , and it 's time they started developing affordable ways of reducing emissions . " some companies are already taking the initiative - including the world 's largest company , us giant general electric . " we 've seen this threat coming and it 's time to act , " said ceo jeffrey immelt - not least motivated by the fact that these days , global financial markets also keep a close eye on companies ' environmental strategies . government targets michaelowa is quick to point out that these strategies need careful monitoring - and should n't be left to individual companies to fine-tune at their own discretion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the clean development mechanism supports clean energy projects in poorer nations " the state needs to set out clear frameworks , " he said , pointing out that experience in germany and japan has showed that self-determining targets can have disappointing results .
" targets for curbing emissions need to be decided by governments , " he stressed . otherwise , he explained , companies simply postpone the issue .
" environmental damage seems like a very distant concern to most companies , " he said , emphasizing that long-term thinking is key to solving the problem . " ideally , we would have a 10 or 15-year plan , " he said .
" most big companies ' investments have a life-span of 10 to 30 years .
the talks in montreal have to spell out that climate protection goes beyond 2012 , when the first phase of the kyoto protocol runs out . " the benefits the international energy agency , meanwhile , has calculated that the energy sector will require an investment of $ 16 billion over the next 25 years . but the german economy may well end up enjoying a piece of the pie . # b # " there are a number of german companies in the field of renewables and energy efficient technology that could profit from the growing demand on the world market , " said michaelowa .
" the kyoto protocol 's ' clean development mechanism ' funds environmental protection projects in developing countries , so there 's a vast export potential . " ultimately , said michaelowa , the environmental protection market is similar to the internet boom of the early 1990s , and businesses with major growth potential are currently proliferating .

dw-world 's look at germany 's richest people allows a peek into a world of money , power and influence accessible to a very few .

they are followed by an environmentally-friendly mail-order king and a 43-year old mother of three who owns a big chunk of bmw .

the bloc is passing the buck on to brazil and at the same time , trying to bring poor countries to its side . the european union is frustrated .
it makes concessions , opens up it markets , but is still called responsible for the fact that global trade negotiations are sluggish and accused of rowing against the tide in the run-up to the wto trade conference in hong kong from december 13 to 18 . " we are offering to reduce subsidies that distort trade by 70 percent , " said eu trade commissioner peter mandelson , referring to an offer the eu made on october 28 .
" we can do that thanks to reforms that have already been decided and put into place . " he says there is no reason to doubt the motives , or behavior , of the eu , and that the bloc 's accommodation in trade matters has not been appreciated by its trading partners . the blame game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union commissioner for trade peter mandelson mandelson 's critique is aimed fairly squarely at the group of developing nations , the so-called g-20 , and especially at the group 's mouthpiece , brazil . the brazilians have been at odds with the eu for years over agricultural policy .
indeed , it was the complaint they filed with the wto that forced the eu to reform its highly subsidized sugar industry .
but now brazil is arguing the eu suggestions do n't go far enough to improve market access for top brazilian exports like beef . " how can they think that they do n't see a decided advantage when we we 're willing to lower our highest tariff rate by 60 percent ? " asked the deputy departmental head of the eu agricultural section , flavio coturini . the eu offer in the agricultural sector for the hong kong conference consists of three parts : 1 . to completely abolish eu export subsidies . 2 . to reduce other rated subsidies by 70 percent , especially those seen as distorting free trade . 3 . to reduce agricultural tariffs by as much as 60 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beef is a leading brazilian export however , some eight percent of products should be exempt from this reduction .
brussels would like to protect its so-called " sensitive goods " from foreign competitors .
beef falls within this category , which angers the south americans , since they see a potentially large market for their beef in europe . hard fronts there wo n't be any further concessions , according to the eu commission , the bloc 's executive body .
in exchange for their agricultural largess , the eu calls for concessions by other countries in the areas of services and industrial goods . " there must be real economic gains , new streams of commerce , " said david o 'sullivan , the eu 's director-general for trade .
" we think our suggestions provide that .
we expect similar concessions from our negotiating partners .
and to be honest , what the brazilians have offered us regarding non-agricultural goods does n't really provide better market access for the products that we are interested in . " but brazil and its foreign minister celso amorim are still playing poker , saying that before they comply with eu demands , the bloc needs to offer a more attractive agricultural deal . " there will be no counter offers , " said an irritated mandelson .
" there are no possible deals during these negotiations if the only topic is market access in the agricultural sector .
that is the problem . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world trade organization 's director-general french pascal lamy the state of negotiations in the run-up to hong kong is not great .
the working paper put forward by the wto director pascal lamy is vague and inconcrete .
analysts say many of these issues should have been settled over two years ago .
but conflicting demands have lead to a stalemate . the eu wants to break out of its isolation and is trying to bring the poorest countries over to its side by means of a development package .
but poor countries would actually gain very little from improved eu market access , since they are already allowed to export most of their goods to the bloc without paying duty . opportunity lost ? peter mandelson is now trying to increase pressure on brazil to keep the wto talks from ending in failure . " that would ruin a huge economic opportunity , " he said , " it would also be very harmful to the wto and could turn back the clock on global multilateralism . " " i believe that europe carries a greater responsibility than others do to bring this round -lrb- of talks -rrb- forward and that is what we 're going to do . " while he is not counting on a breakthrough in hong kong , he says it is crucial to codify what has already been accomplished .

the bloc is passing the buck on to brazil and at the same time , trying to bring poor countries to its side . the european union is frustrated .
it makes concessions , opens up it markets , but is still called responsible for the fact that global trade negotiations are sluggish and accused of rowing against the tide in the run-up to the wto trade conference in hong kong from december 13 to 18 . " we are offering to reduce subsidies that distort trade by 70 percent , " said eu trade commissioner peter mandelson , referring to an offer the eu made on october 28 .
" we can do that thanks to reforms that have already been decided and put into place . " he says there is no reason to doubt the motives , or behavior , of the eu , and that the bloc 's accommodation in trade matters has not been appreciated by its trading partners . the blame game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union commissioner for trade peter mandelson mandelson 's critique is aimed fairly squarely at the group of developing nations , the so-called g-20 , and especially at the group 's mouthpiece , brazil . the brazilians have been at odds with the eu for years over agricultural policy .
indeed , it was the complaint they filed with the wto that forced the eu to reform its highly subsidized sugar industry .
but now brazil is arguing the eu suggestions do n't go far enough to improve market access for top brazilian exports like beef . " how can they think that they do n't see a decided advantage when we we 're willing to lower our highest tariff rate by 60 percent ? " asked the deputy departmental head of the eu agricultural section , flavio coturini . the eu offer in the agricultural sector for the hong kong conference consists of three parts : 1 . to completely abolish eu export subsidies . 2 . to reduce other rated subsidies by 70 percent , especially those seen as distorting free trade . 3 . to reduce agricultural tariffs by as much as 60 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beef is a leading brazilian export however , some eight percent of products should be exempt from this reduction .
brussels would like to protect its so-called " sensitive goods " from foreign competitors .
beef falls within this category , which angers the south americans , since they see a potentially large market for their beef in europe . hard fronts there wo n't be any further concessions , according to the eu commission , the bloc 's executive body .
in exchange for their agricultural largess , the eu calls for concessions by other countries in the areas of services and industrial goods . " there must be real economic gains , new streams of commerce , " said david o 'sullivan , the eu 's director-general for trade .
" we think our suggestions provide that .
we expect similar concessions from our negotiating partners .
and to be honest , what the brazilians have offered us regarding non-agricultural goods does n't really provide better market access for the products that we are interested in . " but brazil and its foreign minister celso amorim are still playing poker , saying that before they comply with eu demands , the bloc needs to offer a more attractive agricultural deal . " there will be no counter offers , " said an irritated mandelson .
" there are no possible deals during these negotiations if the only topic is market access in the agricultural sector .
that is the problem . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world trade organization 's director-general french pascal lamy the state of negotiations in the run-up to hong kong is not great .
the working paper put forward by the wto director pascal lamy is vague and inconcrete .
analysts say many of these issues should have been settled over two years ago .
but conflicting demands have lead to a stalemate . the eu wants to break out of its isolation and is trying to bring the poorest countries over to its side by means of a development package .
but poor countries would actually gain very little from improved eu market access , since they are already allowed to export most of their goods to the bloc without paying duty . opportunity lost ? peter mandelson is now trying to increase pressure on brazil to keep the wto talks from ending in failure . " that would ruin a huge economic opportunity , " he said , " it would also be very harmful to the wto and could turn back the clock on global multilateralism . " " i believe that europe carries a greater responsibility than others do to bring this round -lrb- of talks -rrb- forward and that is what we 're going to do . " while he is not counting on a breakthrough in hong kong , he says it is crucial to codify what has already been accomplished .

jean-pierre bibring has identified areas that were in contact with water just after the planet 's formation .
in one such region , known as marwth vallis , conditions could have been stable long enough for life to start .
prof bibring is pushing for europe 's exomars rover , an 580m-euro robotic vehicle , to be sent there in 2011 .
he said : " marwth vallis is a good site , too , because the altitude is close to zero .
" you have to have a site very low on mars for the parachutes to work . "
persistent water the scientist from the institute of space astrophysics , orsay , was speaking here at the fall meeting of the american geophysical union .
he made his remarks as europe 's space ministers gathered in germany to approve the exomars rover .
an official announcement signing off the project will be made on tuesday .
omega has mapped the clays at marwth vallis enlarge image exomars will carry a drill and a suite of instruments to study surface materials for evidence of past or present biology .
and when mission managers come to decide where to send the rover , they will be listening closely to prof bibring 's views .
he is the principal investigator on omega , an instrument on the mars express orbiter that is mapping the minerals in the red planet 's surface rocks .
it can see materials that were formed over long time periods in the presence of large amounts of liquid water .
what is fascinating is that these hydrated minerals - so called because they contain water in their crystalline structure - were produced in the first few hundred million years after the planet was created .
in other words , the rocks they make up are more than four billion years old .
benign for life crucially , these are not the sulphate minerals seen by the us mars rovers but a different class of hydrated minerals , known as phyllosilicates - more familiarly called clay minerals .
in bibring 's opinion , it is far more likely that exomars will find evidence of life laid down in these rocks than if it were to look at the sulphates documented by the us vehicles .
europe debates space goals " phyllosilicates trace the moment when liquid water was perennial and persistent - something not necessary to make sulphates .
to make clay minerals requires long-standing bodies of water and -lsb- for life to form -rsb- you need that - at least with the experience we have from earth . "
this puts marwth vallis and other clay locations - such as arabia terra , terra meridiani , syrtis major , and nili fossae - high on the list of possible exomars targets .
and it pushes down the list the sulphate locations such meridiani planum and gusev crater currently being inspected by the us mars rovers .
their sulphates were formed in acidic conditions - a challenging environment for any lifeform to evolve .
it is a point echoed last week by us rover scientist dr andrew knoll of harvard university .
he observed : " life that had evolved in other places or earlier times on mars , if any did , might adapt to meridiani conditions , but the kind of chemical reactions we think were important to giving rise to life on earth simply could not have happened at meridiani . "
jean-pierre bibring says the instruments on exomars should be equipped to look for large carbon molecules in amongst the clays of marwth vallis as a possible signature of past life .

what is fascinating is that these hydrated minerals - so called because they contain water in their crystalline structure - were produced in the first few hundred million years after the planet was created .
in other words , the rocks they make up are more than four billion years old .
benign for life crucially , these are not the sulphate minerals seen by the us mars rovers but a different class of hydrated minerals , known as phyllosilicates - more familiarly called clay minerals .
in bibring 's opinion , it is far more likely that exomars will find evidence of life laid down in these rocks than if it were to look at the sulphates documented by the us vehicles .
europe debates space goals " phyllosilicates trace the moment when liquid water was perennial and persistent - something not necessary to make sulphates .
to make clay minerals requires long-standing bodies of water and -lsb- for life to form -rsb- you need that - at least with the experience we have from earth . "
this puts marwth vallis and other clay locations - such as arabia terra , terra meridiani , syrtis major , and nili fossae - high on the list of possible exomars targets .
and it pushes down the list the sulphate locations such meridiani planum and gusev crater currently being inspected by the us mars rovers .
their sulphates were formed in acidic conditions - a challenging environment for any lifeform to evolve .
it is a point echoed last week by us rover scientist dr andrew knoll of harvard university .
he observed : " life that had evolved in other places or earlier times on mars , if any did , might adapt to meridiani conditions , but the kind of chemical reactions we think were important to giving rise to life on earth simply could not have happened at meridiani . "
jean-pierre bibring says the instruments on exomars should be equipped to look for large carbon molecules in amongst the clays of marwth vallis as a possible signature of past life .

he is only two weeks old .
his mother is 14 , and his father is also his grandfather .
he is one of the many victims suffering the consequences of sri lanka 's heavy reliance on sending maids to work abroad .
nearly 600,000 sri lankan women work as domestic servants in other countries .
it is a huge money earner , bringing in millions of dollar in foreign exchange .
but it can also fundamentally change the nature of the family unit .
' satisfy needs ' children left at home can be vulnerable to child abuse , incest and other exploitation .
" the mother leaves the children , sometimes with the father .
sometimes , when the father feels lonely , he will try and make use of the children to satisfy his needs , " warns neeta ariayaratna .
she works for a local ngo sarvodya , which runs a home for young unmarried mothers . "
" when i see the other children going to school i feel very sad , as i will not be able to go to school ever . "
karani , a rape victim karani is a shy 19-year-old .
she was left with her uncle 's family when her mother went overseas for work .
she was just 13 when her uncle raped her and left her pregnant .
she can not talk about the experience and says she just wants to forget what happened .
she says she is not angry but that it is hard to come to terms with her missed youth .
" when i see the other children going to school i feel very sad , as i will not be able to go to school ever . "
she now lives at the sarvodya home .
she has a six-year-old son .
when he was born , she could not bear to look at him .
abortion was not an option .
it is illegal in sri lanka , unless the mother 's life is in danger .
adoption would have caused too much emotional distress .
now she wants to raise him .
mothers going to work abroad do get some warning of the dangers they may be leaving behind .
the bureau of foreign employment gives them training on some of the skills they will need abroad as maids , such as how to use a blender and an iron .
they are wide eyed and eager - it is with these skills that they can escape from poverty .
but sandwiched between these classes is a small session on what could happen to their children while they are away .
they dutifully recite the suggestions given to them .
one is that their daughters should be left with their the mother-in-law , rather than with their husband .
but the students are searching for a dream , another way of life , and the teacher 's words seem to have little impact .
' state 's obligation ' the class here is a small acknowledgement from the government that there is a problem .
but the government should do more for the women , given that migrant workers are sri lanka 's highest earners of foreign exchange and most of the migrants are women , argues hiranthi wijemanne from the national child protection agency .
" a lot can be done and i was advocating for a long time that we give one per cent of what they earn .
that would be an enormous sum of money , because i think the state really has an obligation .
" i mean these women are really keeping the economy growing , so i think in return the least the state could do is to help these kids , make sure at least these children are not abused or exploited and given some opportunity to grow and develop like other children , " he says .
karani is now training to become a seamstress .
she ca n't go back to her village , her uncle still lives there .
not only has she lost her innocence , but the family has lost their home .
her mother irangani is bereft - the case is still dragging through the court system here .
" it is more than six years now .
the person who has done this crime is still free .
the punishment should be given to him but we are the people facing the problems .

he is only two weeks old .
his mother is 14 , and his father is also his grandfather .
he is one of the many victims suffering the consequences of sri lanka 's heavy reliance on sending maids to work abroad .
nearly 600,000 sri lankan women work as domestic servants in other countries .
it is a huge money earner , bringing in millions of dollar in foreign exchange .
but it can also fundamentally change the nature of the family unit .
' satisfy needs ' children left at home can be vulnerable to child abuse , incest and other exploitation .
" the mother leaves the children , sometimes with the father .
sometimes , when the father feels lonely , he will try and make use of the children to satisfy his needs , " warns neeta ariayaratna .
she works for a local ngo sarvodya , which runs a home for young unmarried mothers .
" when i see the other children going to school i feel very sad , as i will not be able to go to school ever .
karani , a rape victim karani is a shy 19-year-old .
she was left with her uncle 's family when her mother went overseas for work .
she was just 13 when her uncle raped her and left her pregnant .
she can not talk about the experience and says she just wants to forget what happened .
she says she is not angry but that it is hard to come to terms with her missed youth .
most of sri lanka 's migrant workers are women " when i see the other children going to school i feel very sad , as i will not be able to go to school ever . "
she now lives at the sarvodya home .
she has a six-year-old son .
when he was born , she could not bear to look at him .
abortion was not an option .
it is illegal in sri lanka , unless the mother 's life is in danger .
adoption would have caused too much emotional distress .
now she wants to raise him .
mothers going to work abroad do get some warning of the dangers they may be leaving behind .
the bureau of foreign employment gives them training on some of the skills they will need abroad as maids , such as how to use a blender and an iron .
they are wide eyed and eager - it is with these skills that they can escape from poverty .
but sandwiched between these classes is a small session on what could happen to their children while they are away .
they dutifully recite the suggestions given to them .
one is that their daughters should be left with their the mother-in-law , rather than with their husband .
but the students are searching for a dream , another way of life , and the teacher 's words seem to have little impact .
' state 's obligation ' the class here is a small acknowledgement from the government that there is a problem .
migrant workers are the country 's highest earners of foreign exchange .
but the government should do more for the women , given that migrant workers are sri lanka 's highest earners of foreign exchange and most of the migrants are women , argues hiranthi wijemanne from the national child protection agency .
" a lot can be done and i was advocating for a long time that we give one per cent of what they earn .
that would be an enormous sum of money , because i think the state really has an obligation .
" i mean these women are really keeping the economy growing , so i think in return the least the state could do is to help these kids , make sure at least these children are not abused or exploited and given some opportunity to grow and develop like other children , " he says .
karani is now training to become a seamstress .
she ca n't go back to her village , her uncle still lives there .
not only has she lost her innocence , but the family has lost their home .
her mother irangani is bereft - the case is still dragging through the court system here .
" it is more than six years now .
the person who has done this crime is still free .
the punishment should be given to him but we are the people facing the problems .
justice should be done . "
however , for these children , the grim reality is not justice , but isolation .
they are the legacy of economic necessity .
they are the hidden shame of sri lanka , outsiders in their village and outsiders in society .

bbc news -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- falconio 's body ' will be found ' bbc news / asia-pacific graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- tuesday , 6 december 2005 , 07:59 gmt falconio 's body ' will be found ' the parents of british backpacker peter falconio cried in court in darwin , australia , as the prosecutor said one day their son 's body would be found .
rex wild , summing up for the prosecution , rejected suggestions from the defence that mr falconio faked his own death in the australian outback .
instead , he said , mr falconio was " disappeared by bradley murdoch " .
mr murdoch denies murdering the briton and kidnapping and attacking his girlfriend , joanne lees , in july 2001 .
he is alleged to have shot dead mr falconio , 28 , from huddersfield , west yorkshire , after flagging down the couple 's camper van on a remote stretch of highway , 200 miles north of alice springs .
' cannabis trucker ' director of public prosecutions mr wild told the northern territory supreme court mr murdoch was a " big , strong man " with strong opinions .
he said he was an experienced truck driver who took amphetamines to stay alert whilst transporting cannabis from south to western australia . "
corruption , conspiracy , this innuendo running through the case , there is not one bit of evidence to support it " rex wild qc director of public prosecutions mr murdoch , he said , carried guns with him on journeys and cared more for his dog jack than he did for other people .
he also told the court there was no evidence to support defence claims mr murdoch , 47 , was framed .
if the police had wanted to fit him up they would have made the evidence stronger , he said .
mr wild said : " corruption , conspiracy , this innuendo running through the case , there is not one bit of evidence to support it .
" every time it 's been put in this case , it 's been denied . "
as there was no evidence of corruption , the claims could be disregarded , he added .
' shifting sands ' earlier , grant algie , defending , highlighted how the evidence of some prosecution witnesses had changed over the course of the four years since the attack .
he said the prosecution 's star witness ms lees had been confused about how she was forced into the rear of her attacker 's vehicle and that she had changed her description of the vehicle .
" is it good enough , when you are told to deliberate on a man for murder , to accept the shifting sands of the description of the man 's vehicle ? " he said .
" four years down the track , when my client 's on trial for murder , we hear , ' i 'm not sure , i ca n't be sure any more ' . "
closing the defence 's argument , he said : " guilty , members of the jury , is a verdict that carries with it a degree of absolute certainty .
" it says brad murdoch is a murderer .
he killed peter falconio and you are satisfied of that beyond a reasonable doubt . "
but not guilty , he told the jury , did not mean you thought joanne lees was a liar or that mr falconio was alive .
" it can simply mean that while something happened at barrow creek , you 're not sure what it was , " mr algie concluded .

a saline solution was injected into gianna 's mother 's womb , which doctors thought would kill the foetus within hours .
this time , most unusually , the procedure failed and gianna was born alive , thanks in part to a shocked nurse .
she was so taken aback by gianna 's live delivery that she summoned an ambulance to whisk her from the abortion clinic to the hospital .
she weighed only two pounds at birth and needed to stay in hospital for nearly three months .
in an ironic twist of fate the abortionist had to sign her birth certificate .
now american-born gianna , aged 28 , is in london to give her message against abortion .
unusual case pro-choice groups say that while hers is a distressing story it is unusual and that guidelines are in place in the uk to stop live births after abortions .
it says on my records that i was born after a saline abortion .
gianna jessen the legal limit for abortion in the uk is 24 weeks .
the only exceptions to this is where a woman 's life is in danger or if there is a real risk that the child , if born , would have a severe physical or mental disability .
in those cases , there is no legal time limit .
gianna , a committed christian , is opposed to abortion .
she has cerebral palsy as a direct result of the procedure carried out on her in the womb .
" the saline solution injected into the mother is to burn the baby , which gulps it in the womb , " she said .
" but after being literally burned alive for 18 hours i was delivered live .
" it says on my records that i was born after a saline abortion .
" i was not expected to be delivered live but fortunately for me the abortionist was not in the clinic when i arrived alive instead of dead .
" i was born about 6am and my ' birth ' was not expected until about 9am , when he would be arriving for his office hours .
" there were many witnesses to my entry into this world .
" my biological mother and other young girls at the clinic , who also awaited the death of their babies , were the first to greet me and i am told this was a hysterical moment . "
bleak outlook initially the prognosis for gianna , who comes from tennessee , was poor .
gianna defied the doctors to walk because of her cerebral palsy her foster mother was told that she was unlikely to ever crawl or walk .
she , however , was determined and eventually learned to sit , crawl and then stand .
she started to walk with leg braces and by the age of four was walking with the aid of a walker - now she walks without any assistance .
she refuses to let her cerebral palsy blight her life and is currently training for the london marathon .
but she says her determination can cause her problems .
i have a love of life and a joy of life .
gianna jessen " i am often misunderstood , which is often the most painful .
" my determination not to give up is often misunderstood as being over confident .
" but it is not that .
i am just determined not to give up .
i am just not a quitter .
" being almost murdered in the womb and then having to struggle from the moment i was delivered means i have a love of life and a joy of life . "
forgiveness gianna has never met her biological mother , but her adopted mother has and passed on gianna 's forgiveness .
her biological parents were both just 17 when gianna was born .
there is very clear guidance to make sure this sort of thing does not happen .
ann furedi she is in london this week to lend her voice to the anti-abortion group ' alive and kicking , ' who are campaigning to encourage reform of the abortion act aimed at reducing the annual number of abortions .
this week gianna will speak at a parliamentary meeting at the house of commons to tell her remarkable story .
and she hopes hearing her story will persuade others to consider the rights of the unborn child .
" what happened to me was all being done in the name of women 's rights , but the only one who cared about my rights was the nurse in the clinic , who got me the heck out of there .
" my mother was making a decision that was ' only hers to make ' , but i bear the scars of that .
citra abbott spokesperson for alive and kicking said : " gianna is bearing witness to the humanity of the unborn child and to the right to life of every human being .
" she is also a powerful witness to the rights of the disabled . "
rare cases ann furedi , chief executive of the british pregnancy advisory service , said it was important to remember that late abortions , like that of gianna 's mother , are uncommon .
" these stories are extremely distressing .
but the point we would always make is that these very late abortion at times when there is a potential for life are very few and far between .
" and there is very clear guidance to make sure this sort of thing does not happen . "
she added that cases like gianna 's were now less likely to happen because of advancing technology and tightened regulations , and that when a woman opted for a late abortion it was usually because the babies had a foetal abnormality .
" if women have a wanted pregnancy and go into labour prematurely they need to know that everything will be done to their babies , but if they need to have an abortion at this late stage then the intention will be that there is not live birth and the procedure should avoid a live birth . "

a saline solution was injected into gianna 's mother 's womb , which doctors thought would kill the foetus within hours .
this time , most unusually , the procedure failed and gianna was born alive , thanks in part to a shocked nurse .
she was so taken aback by gianna 's live delivery that she summoned an ambulance to whisk her from the abortion clinic to the hospital .
she weighed only two pounds at birth and needed to stay in hospital for nearly three months .
in an ironic twist of fate the abortionist had to sign her birth certificate .
now american-born gianna , aged 28 , is in london to give her message against abortion .
unusual case pro-choice groups say that while hers is a distressing story it is unusual and that guidelines are in place in the uk to stop live births after abortions .
it says on my records that i was born after a saline abortion .
gianna jessen the legal limit for abortion in the uk is 24 weeks .
the only exceptions to this is where a woman 's life is in danger or if there is a real risk that the child , if born , would have a severe physical or mental disability .
in those cases , there is no legal time limit .
gianna , a committed christian , is opposed to abortion .
she has cerebral palsy as a direct result of the procedure carried out on her in the womb .
" the saline solution injected into the mother is to burn the baby , which gulps it in the womb , " she said .
" but after being literally burned alive for 18 hours i was delivered live .
" it says on my records that i was born after a saline abortion .
" i was not expected to be delivered live but fortunately for me the abortionist was not in the clinic when i arrived alive instead of dead .
" i was born about 6am and my ' birth ' was not expected until about 9am , when he would be arriving for his office hours .
" there were many witnesses to my entry into this world .
" my biological mother and other young girls at the clinic , who also awaited the death of their babies , were the first to greet me and i am told this was a hysterical moment . "
bleak outlook initially the prognosis for gianna , who comes from tennessee , was poor .
gianna defied the doctors to walk because of her cerebral palsy her foster mother was told that she was unlikely to ever crawl or walk .
she , however , was determined and eventually learned to sit , crawl and then stand .
she started to walk with leg braces and by the age of four was walking with the aid of a walker - now she walks without any assistance .
she refuses to let her cerebral palsy blight her life and is currently training for the london marathon .
but she says her determination can cause her problems .
i have a love of life and a joy of life .
gianna jessen " i am often misunderstood , which is often the most painful .
" my determination not to give up is often misunderstood as being over confident .
" but it is not that .
i am just determined not to give up .
i am just not a quitter .
" being almost murdered in the womb and then having to struggle from the moment i was delivered means i have a love of life and a joy of life . "
forgiveness gianna has never met her biological mother , but her adopted mother has and passed on gianna 's forgiveness .
her biological parents were both just 17 when gianna was born .
there is very clear guidance to make sure this sort of thing does not happen .
ann furedi she is in london this week to lend her voice to the anti-abortion group ' alive and kicking , ' who are campaigning to encourage reform of the abortion act aimed at reducing the annual number of abortions .
this week gianna will speak at a parliamentary meeting at the house of commons to tell her remarkable story .
and she hopes hearing her story will persuade others to consider the rights of the unborn child .
" what happened to me was all being done in the name of women 's rights , but the only one who cared about my rights was the nurse in the clinic , who got me the heck out of there .
" my mother was making a decision that was ' only hers to make ' , but i bear the scars of that .
citra abbott spokesperson for alive and kicking said : " gianna is bearing witness to the humanity of the unborn child and to the right to life of every human being .
" she is also a powerful witness to the rights of the disabled . "
rare cases ann furedi , chief executive of the british pregnancy advisory service , said it was important to remember that late abortions , like that of gianna 's mother , are uncommon .
" these stories are extremely distressing .
but the point we would always make is that these very late abortion at times when there is a potential for life are very few and far between .
" and there is very clear guidance to make sure this sort of thing does not happen . "
she added that cases like gianna 's were now less likely to happen because of advancing technology and tightened regulations , and that when a woman opted for a late abortion it was usually because the babies had a foetal abnormality .
" if women have a wanted pregnancy and go into labour prematurely they need to know that everything will be done to their babies , but if they need to have an abortion at this late stage then the intention will be that there is not live birth and the procedure should avoid a live birth . "
