yet most were disappointed by the attention to detail or simply the lack of new data . berlin 's tagesspiegel commented that the importance of the televised debate , in part due to the four journalists who asked the questions , was over-dramatized .
the two " combatants , " as one inquisitor stated it , were not dead on the floor in the end .
both chancellor gerhard schröder and his challenger angela merkel made a few mistakes in the beginning , yet what was most important really was n't what they said , but the impression they made .
both had their moments but as they missed the mark at times - when schröder said he loves his wife or merkel commented that schröder once referred to teachers as a lot of " lazy bums " - and viewers were distracted from the real purpose .
not until the end did the debate become interesting .
the chancellor was more to the point , leaving merkel look " pale " over the issue of president bush 's us response to katrina .
schröder may have won , but seeing as that was expected , the victory did n't look so good .
germany 's largest tabloid , bild , tipped its hat to the two candidates : chancellor schröder knows that he can no longer win and thus defended his seven years in office ; merkel , the challenger , wants to reform germany and all the polls show she will be assuming the post as german chancellor .
" it was a debate of past versus future .
as of sunday evening we know this : there are not only elections on september 18 , there is also a choice between two true alternatives . "
bild noted that schröder and merkel are two notable politicians who have two very different paths planned for germany - the status quo to maintain societal equilibrium , or bigger reforms to prevent the country from dropping down into the third division .
angela merkel came over stronger than expected in the only one-one-one televised debate with gerhard schröder , wrote the leipziger volkszeitung .
but to two-thirds of the german people it was obvious entering the debate that the chancellor would look better .
schröder , however , faced a tough task , since the bar was set higher for him to start with ; only if his challenger had made grave mistakes , would she leave the set a loser .
but merkel stuck to central topics , like employment , budget , taxes and pensions , expressed herself competently and even made attacks on schröder , leaving little space for him to win points .
it was a familiar model : if the favorite only just barely wins , the presumed loser can feel victorious , the paper wrote .
bildunterschrift : the candidates and inquisitors : questions lacked punch , answers lacked new content the tv debate lacked excitement .
some murder mysteries are more thrilling than the verbal duel between angela merkel and gerhard schröder on sunday , wrote the südkurier from constance .
the four networks broadcasting the debate had built up the viewers ' expectations so much that people thought this would decide the election .
" baloney - we did n't find out anything new . "
the two stuck to their positions on the topics of the labor market , taxes and gasoline prices .
the chancellor had fun , almost to the point of arrogance .
on the other hand , people could tell that the debate was work for merkel , but she rubbed schröder 's nose in the failures of his government .
whoever was expecting a clear victory for schröder was disappointed .
two things stuck in the minds of the editors of the berliner zeitung : the downfall of german television and gerhard schröder 's declaration that he loved his wife .
the duel was no duel , the daily wrote .
it was even a low point in the history of german television , as four networks simultaneously broadcast the debate .
neither the candidates nor the television networks had a program .
the four journalists propagated the poor show by asking questions that any " school kid could have answered for the candidates by reading the newspapers . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 05.09.2005 german press says schröder won großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the media said the chancellor was more impressive in the debate newspaper editors were almost unanimous that chancellor schröder won sunday 's long-awaited debate against challenger angela merkel .
yet most were disappointed by the attention to detail or simply the lack of new data . berlin 's tagesspiegel commented that the importance of the televised debate , in part due to the four journalists who asked the questions , was over-dramatized .
the two " combatants , " as one inquisitor stated it , were not dead on the floor in the end .
both chancellor gerhard schröder and his challenger angela merkel made a few mistakes in the beginning , yet what was most important really was n't what they said , but the impression they made .
both had their moments but as they missed the mark at times - when schröder said he loves his wife or merkel commented that schröder once referred to teachers as a lot of " lazy bums " - and viewers were distracted from the real purpose .
not until the end did the debate become interesting .
the chancellor was more to the point , leaving merkel look " pale " over the issue of president bush 's us response to katrina .
schröder may have won , but seeing as that was expected , the victory did n't look so good .
germany 's largest tabloid , bild , tipped its hat to the two candidates : chancellor schröder knows that he can no longer win and thus defended his seven years in office ; merkel , the challenger , wants to reform germany and all the polls show she will be assuming the post as german chancellor .
" it was a debate of past versus future .
as of sunday evening we know this : there are not only elections on september 18 , there is also a choice between two true alternatives . "
bild noted that schröder and merkel are two notable politicians who have two very different paths planned for germany - the status quo to maintain societal equilibrium , or bigger reforms to prevent the country from dropping down into the third division .
angela merkel came over stronger than expected in the only one-one-one televised debate with gerhard schröder , wrote the leipziger volkszeitung .
but to two-thirds of the german people it was obvious entering the debate that the chancellor would look better .
schröder , however , faced a tough task , since the bar was set higher for him to start with ; only if his challenger had made grave mistakes , would she leave the set a loser .
but merkel stuck to central topics , like employment , budget , taxes and pensions , expressed herself competently and even made attacks on schröder , leaving little space for him to win points .
it was a familiar model : if the favorite only just barely wins , the presumed loser can feel victorious , the paper wrote .
bildunterschrift : the candidates and inquisitors : questions lacked punch , answers lacked new content the tv debate lacked excitement .
some murder mysteries are more thrilling than the verbal duel between angela merkel and gerhard schröder on sunday , wrote the südkurier from constance .
the four networks broadcasting the debate had built up the viewers ' expectations so much that people thought this would decide the election .
" baloney - we did n't find out anything new . "
the two stuck to their positions on the topics of the labor market , taxes and gasoline prices .
the chancellor had fun , almost to the point of arrogance .
on the other hand , people could tell that the debate was work for merkel , but she rubbed schröder 's nose in the failures of his government .
whoever was expecting a clear victory for schröder was disappointed .
two things stuck in the minds of the editors of the berliner zeitung : the downfall of german television and gerhard schröder 's declaration that he loved his wife .
the duel was no duel , the daily wrote .
it was even a low point in the history of german television , as four networks simultaneously broadcast the debate .
neither the candidates nor the television networks had a program .
the four journalists propagated the poor show by asking questions that any " school kid could have answered for the candidates by reading the newspapers . "
if the weakness of german politics lies in leaders talking about how they will get the country out of its troubles without explaining the causes and without naming the goals , then this debate was a demonstration of just that . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sparks fly in german election tv debate two weeks ahead of national elections , german chancellor gerhard schröder and his conservative challenger , angela merkel , met for a tv debate sunday .

the chancellor came across as a more trustworthy candidate , winning 39 percent of votes in this category against his challenger , who gained only 18 percent .
the tv viewers also clearly decided that the relaxed and confident schröder , who is known in germany as " media chancellor , " presented himself as a more likeable character . yet when it came to the single most important election issue - the question of the staggering unemployment rate in germany - the polls have shown that 35 percent of the viewers believed merkel was better fit to solve the problem of unemployment in germany .
only 10 percent of the viewers expressed their confidence in schröder 's competence on this point . it 's not over till it 's over bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it has been described as the " tv event of the year " according to political scientist thorsten faas from the university of duisburg , the viewers ' assessment of the debate could still change in the following days .
political commentaries and the mass media play an important part in shaping public opinion . " a candidate could read the phone book to their supporters and the supporters would still see their candidate as the winner , " said faas . the group of voters that is most likely to be influenced by the debate are the so-called undecided - those who started watching the debate without a clear preference for either of the two candidates . according to the polls , 56 percent of the undecided found chancellor schröder convincing , whereas only 19 percent of the undecided voters were convinced by merkel .
when asked whether the debate would help them make their decision , 46 percent of the undecided said ' yes , ' whereas 52 percent said ' no . ' claiming victory representatives from both parties tried to capitalize on the poll results and claim victory for themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : confident about schröder 's performance in the debate : spd party leader franz müntefering franz müntefering , chairman of schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , said the debate had shown that the conservative movement in germany expressed no interest in social justice . " there is a kind of social coldness around merkel , " müntefering said . " i believe it 's good that people see it that way , and that they can decide , who they want to vote for . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we 've won : cdu party general secretary volker kauder cdu secretary general volker kauder praised merkel for her performance . " angela merkel has won the debate .
people could see that here is someone who knows what she wants , and how she can bring her country forward , " kauder said . family affairs schröder 's supporters , however , seemed to have been somewhat baffled by schröder 's declaration of love for his wife in the midst of the debate . when asked if he had approved of a recent interview in which his wife , doris schröder-köpf , said merkel could n't understand the issues facing german families today because she was childless , the chancellor responded , not without pathos , that he loved his wife because she thought and lived what she said . schröder 's party colleague german interior minister otto schily said that the chancellor could have done without that comment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 05.09.2005 eu and china resolve textile dispute großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese textiles have been piling up at european ports the eu-chinese summit in beijing , boosted by the settlement of the dispute over import quotas for chinese textiles , kicked off to an optimistic start on monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fight is over : eu commission president jose manuel barroso -lrb- left -rrb- , british prime minister tony blair and chinese premier wien jiabao european commission president jose manuel barroso confirmed monday that a deal had been reached to settle a bilateral textile row with china that has left millions of chinese-made textiles blocked at european ports . " today , our trade commissioner -lrb- peter -rrb- mandelson and -lrb- chinese commerce -rrb- minister bo xilai ... made it possible to have an agreement for an equitable way to share the burden of unlicensed goods blocked in our ports , " he told a press conference . " once again , we have shown ... that it is possible when there is real good will to achieve the objectives and priorities to solve all issues between china and the european union , " barroso said . any deal between the eu and china must be accepted by all 25 eu member states . grueling talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade commissioner peter mandelson -lrb- right -rrb- , with the chinese minister of commerce bo xilai negotiations between mandelson and bo started in beijing on sunday , a day ahead of the eu-china summit , and continued through the night into monday .
at one point during the talks , bo stormed out of the meeting late sunday , but discussions apparently continued as lower-level officials shuffled messages back and forth . millions of chinese textile items including sweaters , pants , blouses , t-shirts , bras , and tons of flax yarn were impounded in european ports because they exceeded import quotas agreed to by both sides in june . the backlog stems from goods that were already in transit when the two sides reached an accord in june to limit imports of chinese textiles .
there was also a surge in orders immediately after that deal was announced . a logistical nightmare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the eu-chinese deal , fashion has won back its freedom calling the june agreement " robust , " barroso said that a sudden surge in orders and shipments had " frankly overwhelmed administrative arrangements . " releasing the blocked products should save european importers hundreds of millions of dollars in orders and other costly shipping and storage fees . china shipped more than 300 million sweaters to europe so far this year , compared to about 40 million last year . the surge in textiles started after a global multi-fiber textile quota system was abolished in line with world trade organization guidelines to liberalize the garment trade on jan .
1 . china has opposed efforts from the eu and the united states to block the surge of textiles as moves against free trade but wto guidelines allow for re-implementation of quotas on a limited basis if such sharp increases are deemed " destabilizing " to importing countries . bolstering eu-chinese relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's prime minister tony blair -lrb- left -rrb- greeted by china 's president hu jintao at the great hall of the people in beijing british prime minister tony blair , who is attending the eu-china summit as head of the rotating eu presidency , said monday that strong relations between the eu and china were " immensely important . " " the strategic partnership between china and the european union is of immense importance , not just in terms of trade and the economy , but also in terms of our cooperation in all the major political issues the world faces , " he said in a meeting with chinese president hu jintao . blair 's spokesman said that on top of the usual trade-focused agenda , global political and security issues had been added in the wake of the terrorist bombings in london which left 56 people dead in july .
human rights issues would also be discussed . despite disagreements on issues including europe 's embargo on arms sales to china and its refusal to grant beijing market economy status , hu agreed that building understanding was crucial . " regular meetings between china and the european union are good for enhancing our mutual understanding and are also good for mutual beneficial cooperation and moving forward our comprehensive strategic partnership , " he told blair . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de china wants eu to increase textile quotas beijing and brussels were set to begin trade negotiations over booming chinese textile exports with china expecting the eu to capitulate and increase import quotas , according to chinese sources on wednesday .

relaxed .
statesman-like .
gerhard schröder cut a strong figure in the election 's only one-on-one televised debate between the two candidates for chancellor .
but nobody really expected anything less from the man widely know as germany 's " media chancellor , " and though he did well , it would foolish to think his tv presence could single-handedly get him re-elected .
john kerry solidly beat us president george bush in three separate debates last year , but he still could n't defeat him at the polls when november rolled around .
that 's because bush is such a horrible speaker that he came through unscathed simply because no one imagined he 'd be able to string together a coherent argument .
merkel , similarly to bush , was playing a game of managing expectations .
she herself had set the bar low with several prominent gaffes on the campaign trail .
but on sunday she put in a respectable performance , showing none of her previous unsteadiness .
aside from looking a little uncomfortable at the start of the debate , merkel quickly gained her footing .
she was very pugnacious and did not shrink from repeatedly addressing and attacking schröder directly .
by not putting in a disastrous appearance , her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- can now be expected to hold onto their sizable lead in the polls over schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
schröder still upbeat for most of the debate , schröder seemed comfortable to take the high road , although he did repeatedly slam merkel 's intended finance minister , paul kirchhof .
arguably the best line of the contest was his jab that people would be turned into " guinea pigs " if kirchhof implemented his plans for a flat tax of 25 percent .
and you 've got to admire how the man can still come off as so confident despite trailing his opponent so badly .
maybe it 's just that he 's looking forward to spending more time on vacation in tuscany next year .
bildunterschrift : the biggest losers of the evening were clearly the debate moderators .
after merkel rejected having a second tv duel on the laughable grounds there was n't enough time before the sept .
18 election , germany 's four main networks were forced to work on last night 's contest together .
the broadcasters each sent a journalist - two from private and two from public stations - which proved to be an unwieldy formation for keeping the politicians on topic and under control .
often merkel and schröder would ignore a question in order to spend minutes attacking the last statement from the opponent .
with fewer moderators they might have been less shy about cutting the candidates off or being more aggressive with their questioning .
debating in parliament some german commentators have lamented that the televised debates are part of the " americanization " of german politics , where style trumps substance .
i 'm not sure i totally agree with that assessment , but one does have to question whether such contests are superfluous in a parliamentary democracy .
unlike america where presidential candidate otherwise never have to face each other directly , parliamentary leaders constantly debate one another in germany .
later this week , just days after sunday 's tv duel , both schröder and merkel will take to the floor of the bundestag for a bit of rhetorical thrust and parry .
schröder will have to remain in top form if he hopes to gain any momentum in the final two weeks of the campaign .
merkel , on the other hand , may have the bar set just a tad bit higher after her solid debate performance . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sparks fly in german election tv debate two weeks ahead of national elections , german chancellor gerhard schröder and his conservative challenger , angela merkel , met for a tv debate sunday .

relaxed .
statesman-like .
gerhard schröder cut a strong figure in the election 's only one-on-one televised debate between the two candidates for chancellor .
but nobody really expected anything less from the man widely know as germany 's " media chancellor , " and though he did well , it would foolish to think his tv presence could single-handedly get him re-elected .
john kerry solidly beat us president george bush in three separate debates last year , but he still could n't defeat him at the polls when november rolled around .
that 's because bush is such a horrible speaker that he came through unscathed simply because no one imagined he 'd be able to string together a coherent argument .
merkel , similarly to bush , was playing a game of managing expectations .
she herself had set the bar low with several prominent gaffes on the campaign trail .
but on sunday she put in a respectable performance , showing none of her previous unsteadiness .
aside from looking a little uncomfortable at the start of the debate , merkel quickly gained her footing .
she was very pugnacious and did not shrink from repeatedly addressing and attacking schröder directly .
by not putting in a disastrous appearance , her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- can now be expected to hold onto their sizable lead in the polls over schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
schröder still upbeat for most of the debate , schröder seemed comfortable to take the high road , although he did repeatedly slam merkel 's intended finance minister , paul kirchhof .
arguably the best line of the contest was his jab that people would be turned into " guinea pigs " if kirchhof implemented his plans for a flat tax of 25 percent .
and you 've got to admire how the man can still come off as so confident despite trailing his opponent so badly .
maybe it 's just that he 's looking forward to spending more time on vacation in tuscany next year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.09.2005 high fuel prices push alternative engines großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas prices in germany continue to rise in katrina 's wake record prices at gas stations caused in part by the devastating effects of hurricane katrina have knocked discussion in germany about alternative engines into high gear ahead of this month 's auto show . the goal of introducing cleaner , more fuel-efficient engines has , for many people , never been so desirable - mainly because the cost of filling their car 's gas tank has never been so high . in europe , gas prices are up more than 10 percent over last year and now seem to be climbing by the day as a result of the devastation hurricane katrina caused to the united states ' oil industry last week . in germany , the average price of fuel is currently hovering at around 1.46 euros -lrb- $ 1.83 -rrb- per liter of super . but environmental activists are pointing to the silver lining .
the higher gas prices mean that demand for more fuel-efficient cars with smaller engines should rise .
in the run up to the iaa international motor show in frankfurt -lrb- sept.15-25 -rrb- , car manufacturers are increasingly talking about alternative or hybrid engines ; cleaner diesel , biomass and hydrogen-power are the current buzzwords . getting aboard the hybrid train bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toyota motor corp. executives masatami takimoto , left , and hiroyuki watanabe pose with a model of the hybrid prius sedan .
when it comes to hybrid engines - a combination electrical and conventional combustion engine - german carmakers could find themselves playing catch-up for the next few years .
japanese manufacturer toyota has had great success with its prius hybrid in the us , and is now looking towards the growing market in china for even more profits .
the company is planning 10 new models with hybrid engines . sales of hybrids in europe have lagged far behind the us and japan , ferdinand düdenhoffer , director of the center for automotive research in gelsenkirchen told the süddeutsche zeitung .
" one reason for that is the strength of diesel engines , which are hardly present in the us and japanese car markets , " he said .
the other reason is the lack of hybrid models from european carmakers . europe 's largest carmaker , volkswagen , is reportedly looking for a partnership with porsche , which hopes to display its progress in hybrid technology at the iaa . however , scepticism towards hybrids remains in germany .
" the hybrid motor is a little bit overrated , " said automotive industry analyst willi diez .
" it does n't use that much less gas than the modern diesel engines that german manufacturers have been instrumental in developing and promoting . " even if demand for hybrids remains sluggish in europe , it will be essential for german carmakers to get up to speed with hybrid technology if they want a part of the market in north america and asia . " german producers have to act quickly now to regain lost ground , " diez said . hydrogen the fuel of the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists surround the new hydrogen-fuel powered bmw h2r car at the 2004 mondial de l 'automobile motor show in paris , thursday 23 september 2004 .
volkswagen is looking further afield for alternative engine concepts , betting on synthetically produced fuels from biomass for the medium-term .
in the long-term , however , german manufacturers are interested in the promise of hydrogen-powered cars , even if advancements in this area have been slower than anticipated . " we 'll almost certainly have to wait for about 20 years -lrb- for the first marketable hydrogen car -rrb- , " said a vw spokesperson .
in the meantime , the company is developing its hydrogen technology with its touran hymotion prototype - a car with an electric motor that draws its power from a fuel cell . mercedes has 180 patents pending in the area of fuel cell technology , and bmw is racing ahead with its h2r hydrogen-powered prototype . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de katrina could swamp german economy germany 's economy minister has said he fears hurricane katrina , which has devastated the southern us coast , could lead to a further rise in oil prices and dampen already weak domestic spending in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 05.09.2005 eu and china resolve textile dispute großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese textiles have been piling up at european ports the eu-chinese summit in beijing , boosted by the settlement of the dispute over import quotas for chinese textiles , kicked off to an optimistic start on monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fight is over : eu commission president jose manuel barroso -lrb- left -rrb- , british prime minister tony blair and chinese premier wien jiabao european commission president jose manuel barroso confirmed monday that a deal had been reached to settle a bilateral textile row with china that has left millions of chinese-made textiles blocked at european ports . " today , our trade commissioner -lrb- peter -rrb- mandelson and -lrb- chinese commerce -rrb- minister bo xilai ... made it possible to have an agreement for an equitable way to share the burden of unlicensed goods blocked in our ports , " he told a press conference . " once again , we have shown ... that it is possible when there is real good will to achieve the objectives and priorities to solve all issues between china and the european union , " barroso said . any deal between the eu and china must be accepted by all 25 eu member states . grueling talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade commissioner peter mandelson -lrb- right -rrb- , with the chinese minister of commerce bo xilai negotiations between mandelson and bo started in beijing on sunday , a day ahead of the eu-china summit , and continued through the night into monday .
at one point during the talks , bo stormed out of the meeting late sunday , but discussions apparently continued as lower-level officials shuffled messages back and forth . millions of chinese textile items including sweaters , pants , blouses , t-shirts , bras , and tons of flax yarn were impounded in european ports because they exceeded import quotas agreed to by both sides in june . the backlog stems from goods that were already in transit when the two sides reached an accord in june to limit imports of chinese textiles .
there was also a surge in orders immediately after that deal was announced . a logistical nightmare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the eu-chinese deal , fashion has won back its freedom calling the june agreement " robust , " barroso said that a sudden surge in orders and shipments had " frankly overwhelmed administrative arrangements . " releasing the blocked products should save european importers hundreds of millions of dollars in orders and other costly shipping and storage fees . china shipped more than 300 million sweaters to europe so far this year , compared to about 40 million last year . the surge in textiles started after a global multi-fiber textile quota system was abolished in line with world trade organization guidelines to liberalize the garment trade on jan .

" today , our trade commissioner -lrb- peter -rrb- mandelson and -lrb- chinese commerce -rrb- minister bo xilai ... made it possible to have an agreement for an equitable way to share the burden of unlicensed goods blocked in our ports , " he told a press conference . " once again , we have shown ... that it is possible when there is real good will to achieve the objectives and priorities to solve all issues between china and the european union , " barroso said . any deal between the eu and china must be accepted by all 25 eu member states . grueling talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade commissioner peter mandelson -lrb- right -rrb- , with the chinese minister of commerce bo xilai negotiations between mandelson and bo started in beijing on sunday , a day ahead of the eu-china summit , and continued through the night into monday .
at one point during the talks , bo stormed out of the meeting late sunday , but discussions apparently continued as lower-level officials shuffled messages back and forth . millions of chinese textile items including sweaters , pants , blouses , t-shirts , bras , and tons of flax yarn were impounded in european ports because they exceeded import quotas agreed to by both sides in june . the backlog stems from goods that were already in transit when the two sides reached an accord in june to limit imports of chinese textiles .
there was also a surge in orders immediately after that deal was announced . a logistical nightmare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the eu-chinese deal , fashion has won back its freedom calling the june agreement " robust , " barroso said that a sudden surge in orders and shipments had " frankly overwhelmed administrative arrangements . " releasing the blocked products should save european importers hundreds of millions of dollars in orders and other costly shipping and storage fees . china shipped more than 300 million sweaters to europe so far this year , compared to about 40 million last year . the surge in textiles started after a global multi-fiber textile quota system was abolished in line with world trade organization guidelines to liberalize the garment trade on jan .

the higher gas prices mean that demand for more fuel-efficient cars with smaller engines should rise .
in the run up to the iaa international motor show in frankfurt -lrb- sept.15-25 -rrb- , car manufacturers are increasingly talking about alternative or hybrid engines ; cleaner diesel , biomass and hydrogen-power are the current buzzwords . getting aboard the hybrid train bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toyota motor corp. executives masatami takimoto , left , and hiroyuki watanabe pose with a model of the hybrid prius sedan .
when it comes to hybrid engines - a combination electrical and conventional combustion engine - german carmakers could find themselves playing catch-up for the next few years .
japanese manufacturer toyota has had great success with its prius hybrid in the us , and is now looking towards the growing market in china for even more profits .
the company is planning 10 new models with hybrid engines . sales of hybrids in europe have lagged far behind the us and japan , ferdinand düdenhoffer , director of the center for automotive research in gelsenkirchen told the süddeutsche zeitung .
" one reason for that is the strength of diesel engines , which are hardly present in the us and japanese car markets , " he said .
the other reason is the lack of hybrid models from european carmakers . europe 's largest carmaker , volkswagen , is reportedly looking for a partnership with porsche , which hopes to display its progress in hybrid technology at the iaa . however , scepticism towards hybrids remains in germany .
" the hybrid motor is a little bit overrated , " said automotive industry analyst willi diez .
" it does n't use that much less gas than the modern diesel engines that german manufacturers have been instrumental in developing and promoting . " even if demand for hybrids remains sluggish in europe , it will be essential for german carmakers to get up to speed with hybrid technology if they want a part of the market in north america and asia . " german producers have to act quickly now to regain lost ground , " diez said . hydrogen the fuel of the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists surround the new hydrogen-fuel powered bmw h2r car at the 2004 mondial de l 'automobile motor show in paris , thursday 23 september 2004 .
volkswagen is looking further afield for alternative engine concepts , betting on synthetically produced fuels from biomass for the medium-term .
in the long-term , however , german manufacturers are interested in the promise of hydrogen-powered cars , even if advancements in this area have been slower than anticipated . " we 'll almost certainly have to wait for about 20 years -lrb- for the first marketable hydrogen car -rrb- , " said a vw spokesperson .
in the meantime , the company is developing its hydrogen technology with its touran hymotion prototype - a car with an electric motor that draws its power from a fuel cell . mercedes has 180 patents pending in the area of fuel cell technology , and bmw is racing ahead with its h2r hydrogen-powered prototype . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de katrina could swamp german economy germany 's economy minister has said he fears hurricane katrina , which has devastated the southern us coast , could lead to a further rise in oil prices and dampen already weak domestic spending in germany .

at one point during the talks , bo stormed out of the meeting late sunday , but discussions apparently continued as lower-level officials shuffled messages back and forth . millions of chinese textile items including sweaters , pants , blouses , t-shirts , bras , and tons of flax yarn were impounded in european ports because they exceeded import quotas agreed to by both sides in june . the backlog stems from goods that were already in transit when the two sides reached an accord in june to limit imports of chinese textiles .
there was also a surge in orders immediately after that deal was announced . a logistical nightmare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the eu-chinese deal , fashion has won back its freedom calling the june agreement " robust , " barroso said that a sudden surge in orders and shipments had " frankly overwhelmed administrative arrangements . " releasing the blocked products should save european importers hundreds of millions of dollars in orders and other costly shipping and storage fees . china shipped more than 300 million sweaters to europe so far this year , compared to about 40 million last year . the surge in textiles started after a global multi-fiber textile quota system was abolished in line with world trade organization guidelines to liberalize the garment trade on jan .
1 . china has opposed efforts from the eu and the united states to block the surge of textiles as moves against free trade but wto guidelines allow for re-implementation of quotas on a limited basis if such sharp increases are deemed " destabilizing " to importing countries . bolstering eu-chinese relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's prime minister tony blair -lrb- left -rrb- greeted by china 's president hu jintao at the great hall of the people in beijing british prime minister tony blair , who is attending the eu-china summit as head of the rotating eu presidency , said monday that strong relations between the eu and china were " immensely important . " " the strategic partnership between china and the european union is of immense importance , not just in terms of trade and the economy , but also in terms of our cooperation in all the major political issues the world faces , " he said in a meeting with chinese president hu jintao . blair 's spokesman said that on top of the usual trade-focused agenda , global political and security issues had been added in the wake of the terrorist bombings in london which left 56 people dead in july .
human rights issues would also be discussed . despite disagreements on issues including europe 's embargo on arms sales to china and its refusal to grant beijing market economy status , hu agreed that building understanding was crucial .

the higher gas prices mean that demand for more fuel-efficient cars with smaller engines should rise .

japanese manufacturer toyota has had great success with its prius hybrid in the us , and is now looking towards the growing market in china for even more profits .
the company is planning 10 new models with hybrid engines . sales of hybrids in europe have lagged far behind the us and japan , ferdinand düdenhoffer , director of the center for automotive research in gelsenkirchen told the süddeutsche zeitung .
" one reason for that is the strength of diesel engines , which are hardly present in the us and japanese car markets , " he said .
the other reason is the lack of hybrid models from european carmakers . europe 's largest carmaker , volkswagen , is reportedly looking for a partnership with porsche , which hopes to display its progress in hybrid technology at the iaa . however , scepticism towards hybrids remains in germany .
" the hybrid motor is a little bit overrated , " said automotive industry analyst willi diez .
" it does n't use that much less gas than the modern diesel engines that german manufacturers have been instrumental in developing and promoting . " even if demand for hybrids remains sluggish in europe , it will be essential for german carmakers to get up to speed with hybrid technology if they want a part of the market in north america and asia .

yet most were disappointed by the attention to detail or simply the lack of new data . berlin 's tagesspiegel commented that the importance of the televised debate , in part due to the four journalists who asked the questions , was over-dramatized .
the two " combatants , " as one inquisitor stated it , were not dead on the floor in the end .
both chancellor gerhard schröder and his challenger angela merkel made a few mistakes in the beginning , yet what was most important really was n't what they said , but the impression they made .
both had their moments but as they missed the mark at times - when schröder said he loves his wife or merkel commented that schröder once referred to teachers as a lot of " lazy bums " - and viewers were distracted from the real purpose .
not until the end did the debate become interesting .
the chancellor was more to the point , leaving merkel look " pale " over the issue of president bush 's us response to katrina .
schröder may have won , but seeing as that was expected , the victory did n't look so good .
germany 's largest tabloid , bild , tipped its hat to the two candidates : chancellor schröder knows that he can no longer win and thus defended his seven years in office ; merkel , the challenger , wants to reform germany and all the polls show she will be assuming the post as german chancellor .
" it was a debate of past versus future .
as of sunday evening we know this : there are not only elections on september 18 , there is also a choice between two true alternatives . "
bild noted that schröder and merkel are two notable politicians who have two very different paths planned for germany - the status quo to maintain societal equilibrium , or bigger reforms to prevent the country from dropping down into the third division .
angela merkel came over stronger than expected in the only one-one-one televised debate with gerhard schröder , wrote the leipziger volkszeitung .
but to two-thirds of the german people it was obvious entering the debate that the chancellor would look better .
schröder , however , faced a tough task , since the bar was set higher for him to start with ; only if his challenger had made grave mistakes , would she leave the set a loser .
but merkel stuck to central topics , like employment , budget , taxes and pensions , expressed herself competently and even made attacks on schröder , leaving little space for him to win points .

yet most were disappointed by the attention to detail or simply the lack of new data . berlin 's tagesspiegel commented that the importance of the televised debate , in part due to the four journalists who asked the questions , was over-dramatized .
the two " combatants , " as one inquisitor stated it , were not dead on the floor in the end .
both chancellor gerhard schröder and his challenger angela merkel made a few mistakes in the beginning , yet what was most important really was n't what they said , but the impression they made .
both had their moments but as they missed the mark at times - when schröder said he loves his wife or merkel commented that schröder once referred to teachers as a lot of " lazy bums " - and viewers were distracted from the real purpose .
not until the end did the debate become interesting .
the chancellor was more to the point , leaving merkel look " pale " over the issue of president bush 's us response to katrina .
schröder may have won , but seeing as that was expected , the victory did n't look so good .
germany 's largest tabloid , bild , tipped its hat to the two candidates : chancellor schröder knows that he can no longer win and thus defended his seven years in office ; merkel , the challenger , wants to reform germany and all the polls show she will be assuming the post as german chancellor .
" it was a debate of past versus future .
as of sunday evening we know this : there are not only elections on september 18 , there is also a choice between two true alternatives . "
bild noted that schröder and merkel are two notable politicians who have two very different paths planned for germany - the status quo to maintain societal equilibrium , or bigger reforms to prevent the country from dropping down into the third division .
angela merkel came over stronger than expected in the only one-one-one televised debate with gerhard schröder , wrote the leipziger volkszeitung .
but to two-thirds of the german people it was obvious entering the debate that the chancellor would look better .
schröder , however , faced a tough task , since the bar was set higher for him to start with ; only if his challenger had made grave mistakes , would she leave the set a loser .
but merkel stuck to central topics , like employment , budget , taxes and pensions , expressed herself competently and even made attacks on schröder , leaving little space for him to win points .
it was a familiar model : if the favorite only just barely wins , the presumed loser can feel victorious , the paper wrote .

interior minister otto schily and the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- are trying to get a grip on the violence . german soccer managed an ignominious double on saturday in bratislava .
on the pitch , the team around coach jürgen klinsmann embarrassed themselves by losing 2-0 to slovakia , currently the 45th ranked team in the world .
to pour salt in the wound of german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- officials and interior minister otto schily , who was present , german hooligans again ran amok off the pitch , albeit not to the extent they did at a friendly in slovenia in march .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenian police forces clash with german fans in march friendly in celje six people were injured and two were taken into custody after a troop of hooligans who had made the trip to bratislava did battle with slovakian police .
the dfb apologized for the behavior of the fans who during the match also screamed scandalous chants such as " foreigners out " and " we 've marched in again , " in reference to nazi germany 's occupation of then czechoslovakia .
" that does not give a good image of germans abroad , " commented dfb team manager oliver bierhoff .
the incident was especially discouraging to organizers since german police and the dfb had worked closely with slovak security officials before the match to prevent a repeat of the ugly riots in celje in march .
small allotment of tickets for germans the match between the two sides attracted little attention amongst soccer fans in slovakia .
only 9,000 viewers attended the game at sk slovan stadium , which holds over 30,000 .
the dfb had sold 560 tickets through the national fan club as a measure to control just who would accompany the squad .

" we do our best , but in another country it 's difficult to control the situation , " said bierhoff .
interior minister otto schily appeared vindicated in the comments he had made ahead of the match when he said that tighter police cooperation , which slovenian authorities had refused , would prevent any violence .
world cup security in question ?
in pure provocation towards the minister who has organized security measures so far in the run-up to the world cup next year , hooligans chanted " we all have stadium bans , " and " otto , we 're here anyway , " during the game .

yet , no matter which minister leads security measures in germany when the world cup kicks off in june 2006 , the dfb wants to see violent supporters prevented from carrying out their agenda at world cup cities .
it will be easier to control hooligans from getting to the stadiums , said dfb president theo zwanziger , but in public squares where games will be shown on large-screens , they must separated from peaceful soccer fans .

" today , our trade commissioner -lrb- peter -rrb- mandelson and -lrb- chinese commerce -rrb- minister bo xilai ... made it possible to have an agreement for an equitable way to share the burden of unlicensed goods blocked in our ports , " he told a press conference . " once again , we have shown ... that it is possible when there is real good will to achieve the objectives and priorities to solve all issues between china and the european union , " barroso said . any deal between the eu and china must be accepted by all 25 eu member states . grueling talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade commissioner peter mandelson -lrb- right -rrb- , with the chinese minister of commerce bo xilai negotiations between mandelson and bo started in beijing on sunday , a day ahead of the eu-china summit , and continued through the night into monday .
at one point during the talks , bo stormed out of the meeting late sunday , but discussions apparently continued as lower-level officials shuffled messages back and forth . millions of chinese textile items including sweaters , pants , blouses , t-shirts , bras , and tons of flax yarn were impounded in european ports because they exceeded import quotas agreed to by both sides in june . the backlog stems from goods that were already in transit when the two sides reached an accord in june to limit imports of chinese textiles .
there was also a surge in orders immediately after that deal was announced . a logistical nightmare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the eu-chinese deal , fashion has won back its freedom calling the june agreement " robust , " barroso said that a sudden surge in orders and shipments had " frankly overwhelmed administrative arrangements . " releasing the blocked products should save european importers hundreds of millions of dollars in orders and other costly shipping and storage fees . china shipped more than 300 million sweaters to europe so far this year , compared to about 40 million last year . the surge in textiles started after a global multi-fiber textile quota system was abolished in line with world trade organization guidelines to liberalize the garment trade on jan .
1 . china has opposed efforts from the eu and the united states to block the surge of textiles as moves against free trade but wto guidelines allow for re-implementation of quotas on a limited basis if such sharp increases are deemed " destabilizing " to importing countries . bolstering eu-chinese relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's prime minister tony blair -lrb- left -rrb- greeted by china 's president hu jintao at the great hall of the people in beijing british prime minister tony blair , who is attending the eu-china summit as head of the rotating eu presidency , said monday that strong relations between the eu and china were " immensely important . " " the strategic partnership between china and the european union is of immense importance , not just in terms of trade and the economy , but also in terms of our cooperation in all the major political issues the world faces , " he said in a meeting with chinese president hu jintao . blair 's spokesman said that on top of the usual trade-focused agenda , global political and security issues had been added in the wake of the terrorist bombings in london which left 56 people dead in july .
human rights issues would also be discussed . despite disagreements on issues including europe 's embargo on arms sales to china and its refusal to grant beijing market economy status , hu agreed that building understanding was crucial . " regular meetings between china and the european union are good for enhancing our mutual understanding and are also good for mutual beneficial cooperation and moving forward our comprehensive strategic partnership , " he told blair . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de china wants eu to increase textile quotas beijing and brussels were set to begin trade negotiations over booming chinese textile exports with china expecting the eu to capitulate and increase import quotas , according to chinese sources on wednesday .

the chancellor came across as a more trustworthy candidate , winning 39 percent of votes in this category against his challenger , who gained only 18 percent .
the tv viewers also clearly decided that the relaxed and confident schröder , who is known in germany as " media chancellor , " presented himself as a more likeable character . yet when it came to the single most important election issue - the question of the staggering unemployment rate in germany - the polls have shown that 35 percent of the viewers believed merkel was better fit to solve the problem of unemployment in germany .
only 10 percent of the viewers expressed their confidence in schröder 's competence on this point . it 's not over till it 's over bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it has been described as the " tv event of the year " according to political scientist thorsten faas from the university of duisburg , the viewers ' assessment of the debate could still change in the following days .
political commentaries and the mass media play an important part in shaping public opinion . " a candidate could read the phone book to their supporters and the supporters would still see their candidate as the winner , " said faas . the group of voters that is most likely to be influenced by the debate are the so-called undecided - those who started watching the debate without a clear preference for either of the two candidates . according to the polls , 56 percent of the undecided found chancellor schröder convincing , whereas only 19 percent of the undecided voters were convinced by merkel .
when asked whether the debate would help them make their decision , 46 percent of the undecided said ' yes , ' whereas 52 percent said ' no . ' claiming victory representatives from both parties tried to capitalize on the poll results and claim victory for themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : confident about schröder 's performance in the debate : spd party leader franz müntefering franz müntefering , chairman of schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , said the debate had shown that the conservative movement in germany expressed no interest in social justice . " there is a kind of social coldness around merkel , " müntefering said . " i believe it 's good that people see it that way , and that they can decide , who they want to vote for . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we 've won : cdu party general secretary volker kauder cdu secretary general volker kauder praised merkel for her performance . " angela merkel has won the debate .
people could see that here is someone who knows what she wants , and how she can bring her country forward , " kauder said . family affairs schröder 's supporters , however , seemed to have been somewhat baffled by schröder 's declaration of love for his wife in the midst of the debate . when asked if he had approved of a recent interview in which his wife , doris schröder-köpf , said merkel could n't understand the issues facing german families today because she was childless , the chancellor responded , not without pathos , that he loved his wife because she thought and lived what she said . schröder 's party colleague german interior minister otto schily said that the chancellor could have done without that comment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : election editorials : dw 's take opinion : dissolving the doubt opinion : greens must learn to let go the german fear of reform opinion : germany left behind europe -pipe- 05.09.2005 opinion : germany 's debatable impact großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder was expected to beat angela merkel german chancellor gerhard schröder may have won sunday 's televised debate with angela merkel , but the gaffe-prone leader of the conservative opposition might be the night 's real winner , says dw-world 's marc young . confident .
relaxed .
statesman-like .
gerhard schröder cut a strong figure in the election 's only one-on-one televised debate between the two candidates for chancellor .
but nobody really expected anything less from the man widely know as germany 's " media chancellor , " and though he did well , it would foolish to think his tv presence could single-handedly get him re-elected .
john kerry solidly beat us president george bush in three separate debates last year , but he still could n't defeat him at the polls when november rolled around .
that 's because bush is such a horrible speaker that he came through unscathed simply because no one imagined he 'd be able to string together a coherent argument .
merkel , similarly to bush , was playing a game of managing expectations .
she herself had set the bar low with several prominent gaffes on the campaign trail .
but on sunday she put in a respectable performance , showing none of her previous unsteadiness .
aside from looking a little uncomfortable at the start of the debate , merkel quickly gained her footing .
she was very pugnacious and did not shrink from repeatedly addressing and attacking schröder directly .
by not putting in a disastrous appearance , her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- can now be expected to hold onto their sizable lead in the polls over schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
schröder still upbeat for most of the debate , schröder seemed comfortable to take the high road , although he did repeatedly slam merkel 's intended finance minister , paul kirchhof .
arguably the best line of the contest was his jab that people would be turned into " guinea pigs " if kirchhof implemented his plans for a flat tax of 25 percent .
and you 've got to admire how the man can still come off as so confident despite trailing his opponent so badly .
maybe it 's just that he 's looking forward to spending more time on vacation in tuscany next year .
bildunterschrift : the biggest losers of the evening were clearly the debate moderators .
after merkel rejected having a second tv duel on the laughable grounds there was n't enough time before the sept .
18 election , germany 's four main networks were forced to work on last night 's contest together .
the broadcasters each sent a journalist - two from private and two from public stations - which proved to be an unwieldy formation for keeping the politicians on topic and under control .
often merkel and schröder would ignore a question in order to spend minutes attacking the last statement from the opponent .
with fewer moderators they might have been less shy about cutting the candidates off or being more aggressive with their questioning .
debating in parliament some german commentators have lamented that the televised debates are part of the " americanization " of german politics , where style trumps substance .
i 'm not sure i totally agree with that assessment , but one does have to question whether such contests are superfluous in a parliamentary democracy .
unlike america where presidential candidate otherwise never have to face each other directly , parliamentary leaders constantly debate one another in germany .
later this week , just days after sunday 's tv duel , both schröder and merkel will take to the floor of the bundestag for a bit of rhetorical thrust and parry .
schröder will have to remain in top form if he hopes to gain any momentum in the final two weeks of the campaign .
merkel , on the other hand , may have the bar set just a tad bit higher after her solid debate performance . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sparks fly in german election tv debate two weeks ahead of national elections , german chancellor gerhard schröder and his conservative challenger , angela merkel , met for a tv debate sunday .

relaxed .
statesman-like .
gerhard schröder cut a strong figure in the election 's only one-on-one televised debate between the two candidates for chancellor .
but nobody really expected anything less from the man widely know as germany 's " media chancellor , " and though he did well , it would foolish to think his tv presence could single-handedly get him re-elected .
john kerry solidly beat us president george bush in three separate debates last year , but he still could n't defeat him at the polls when november rolled around .
that 's because bush is such a horrible speaker that he came through unscathed simply because no one imagined he 'd be able to string together a coherent argument .
merkel , similarly to bush , was playing a game of managing expectations .
she herself had set the bar low with several prominent gaffes on the campaign trail .
but on sunday she put in a respectable performance , showing none of her previous unsteadiness .
aside from looking a little uncomfortable at the start of the debate , merkel quickly gained her footing .
she was very pugnacious and did not shrink from repeatedly addressing and attacking schröder directly .
by not putting in a disastrous appearance , her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- can now be expected to hold onto their sizable lead in the polls over schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
schröder still upbeat for most of the debate , schröder seemed comfortable to take the high road , although he did repeatedly slam merkel 's intended finance minister , paul kirchhof .
arguably the best line of the contest was his jab that people would be turned into " guinea pigs " if kirchhof implemented his plans for a flat tax of 25 percent .
and you 've got to admire how the man can still come off as so confident despite trailing his opponent so badly .
maybe it 's just that he 's looking forward to spending more time on vacation in tuscany next year .

18 election , germany 's four main networks were forced to work on last night 's contest together .
the broadcasters each sent a journalist - two from private and two from public stations - which proved to be an unwieldy formation for keeping the politicians on topic and under control .
often merkel and schröder would ignore a question in order to spend minutes attacking the last statement from the opponent .
with fewer moderators they might have been less shy about cutting the candidates off or being more aggressive with their questioning .
debating in parliament some german commentators have lamented that the televised debates are part of the " americanization " of german politics , where style trumps substance .
i 'm not sure i totally agree with that assessment , but one does have to question whether such contests are superfluous in a parliamentary democracy .
unlike america where presidential candidate otherwise never have to face each other directly , parliamentary leaders constantly debate one another in germany .
later this week , just days after sunday 's tv duel , both schröder and merkel will take to the floor of the bundestag for a bit of rhetorical thrust and parry .
schröder will have to remain in top form if he hopes to gain any momentum in the final two weeks of the campaign .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 05.09.2005 eu and china resolve textile dispute großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese textiles have been piling up at european ports the eu-chinese summit in beijing , boosted by the settlement of the dispute over import quotas for chinese textiles , kicked off to an optimistic start on monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fight is over : eu commission president jose manuel barroso -lrb- left -rrb- , british prime minister tony blair and chinese premier wien jiabao european commission president jose manuel barroso confirmed monday that a deal had been reached to settle a bilateral textile row with china that has left millions of chinese-made textiles blocked at european ports . " today , our trade commissioner -lrb- peter -rrb- mandelson and -lrb- chinese commerce -rrb- minister bo xilai ... made it possible to have an agreement for an equitable way to share the burden of unlicensed goods blocked in our ports , " he told a press conference . " once again , we have shown ... that it is possible when there is real good will to achieve the objectives and priorities to solve all issues between china and the european union , " barroso said . any deal between the eu and china must be accepted by all 25 eu member states . grueling talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade commissioner peter mandelson -lrb- right -rrb- , with the chinese minister of commerce bo xilai negotiations between mandelson and bo started in beijing on sunday , a day ahead of the eu-china summit , and continued through the night into monday .
at one point during the talks , bo stormed out of the meeting late sunday , but discussions apparently continued as lower-level officials shuffled messages back and forth . millions of chinese textile items including sweaters , pants , blouses , t-shirts , bras , and tons of flax yarn were impounded in european ports because they exceeded import quotas agreed to by both sides in june . the backlog stems from goods that were already in transit when the two sides reached an accord in june to limit imports of chinese textiles .

at one point during the talks , bo stormed out of the meeting late sunday , but discussions apparently continued as lower-level officials shuffled messages back and forth . millions of chinese textile items including sweaters , pants , blouses , t-shirts , bras , and tons of flax yarn were impounded in european ports because they exceeded import quotas agreed to by both sides in june . the backlog stems from goods that were already in transit when the two sides reached an accord in june to limit imports of chinese textiles .

" releasing the blocked products should save european importers hundreds of millions of dollars in orders and other costly shipping and storage fees . china shipped more than 300 million sweaters to europe so far this year , compared to about 40 million last year . the surge in textiles started after a global multi-fiber textile quota system was abolished in line with world trade organization guidelines to liberalize the garment trade on jan .

interior minister otto schily and the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- are trying to get a grip on the violence . german soccer managed an ignominious double on saturday in bratislava .
on the pitch , the team around coach jürgen klinsmann embarrassed themselves by losing 2-0 to slovakia , currently the 45th ranked team in the world .
to pour salt in the wound of german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- officials and interior minister otto schily , who was present , german hooligans again ran amok off the pitch , albeit not to the extent they did at a friendly in slovenia in march .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenian police forces clash with german fans in march friendly in celje six people were injured and two were taken into custody after a troop of hooligans who had made the trip to bratislava did battle with slovakian police .
the dfb apologized for the behavior of the fans who during the match also screamed scandalous chants such as " foreigners out " and " we 've marched in again , " in reference to nazi germany 's occupation of then czechoslovakia .
" that does not give a good image of germans abroad , " commented dfb team manager oliver bierhoff .
the incident was especially discouraging to organizers since german police and the dfb had worked closely with slovak security officials before the match to prevent a repeat of the ugly riots in celje in march .
small allotment of tickets for germans the match between the two sides attracted little attention amongst soccer fans in slovakia .
only 9,000 viewers attended the game at sk slovan stadium , which holds over 30,000 .
the dfb had sold 560 tickets through the national fan club as a measure to control just who would accompany the squad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior and sports minister otto schily -lrb- l -rrb- and german soccer legend and head of the organizing comitee for the world cup 2006 franz beckenbauer hooligans made the journey anyway and got their hands on tickets from slovak acquaintances .
" we do our best , but in another country it 's difficult to control the situation , " said bierhoff .
interior minister otto schily appeared vindicated in the comments he had made ahead of the match when he said that tighter police cooperation , which slovenian authorities had refused , would prevent any violence .
world cup security in question ?
in pure provocation towards the minister who has organized security measures so far in the run-up to the world cup next year , hooligans chanted " we all have stadium bans , " and " otto , we 're here anyway , " during the game .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dfb president theo zwanziger schily may be out of office should the social democrats do poorly in the sept .
18 general election .
yet , no matter which minister leads security measures in germany when the world cup kicks off in june 2006 , the dfb wants to see violent supporters prevented from carrying out their agenda at world cup cities .
it will be easier to control hooligans from getting to the stadiums , said dfb president theo zwanziger , but in public squares where games will be shown on large-screens , they must separated from peaceful soccer fans .
" we need a clear police presence , but it must n't be conspicuous .
it is supposed to be a peaceful party , " he said in german sports television dsf . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de klinsi 's boys belittled in bratislava jürgen klinsmann 's national squad put on a poor display of abilities saturday , suffering a humiliating 2-0 defeat against slovakia .

the chancellor came across as a more trustworthy candidate , winning 39 percent of votes in this category against his challenger , who gained only 18 percent .
the tv viewers also clearly decided that the relaxed and confident schröder , who is known in germany as " media chancellor , " presented himself as a more likeable character . yet when it came to the single most important election issue - the question of the staggering unemployment rate in germany - the polls have shown that 35 percent of the viewers believed merkel was better fit to solve the problem of unemployment in germany .
only 10 percent of the viewers expressed their confidence in schröder 's competence on this point . it 's not over till it 's over bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it has been described as the " tv event of the year " according to political scientist thorsten faas from the university of duisburg , the viewers ' assessment of the debate could still change in the following days .
political commentaries and the mass media play an important part in shaping public opinion . " a candidate could read the phone book to their supporters and the supporters would still see their candidate as the winner , " said faas . the group of voters that is most likely to be influenced by the debate are the so-called undecided - those who started watching the debate without a clear preference for either of the two candidates . according to the polls , 56 percent of the undecided found chancellor schröder convincing , whereas only 19 percent of the undecided voters were convinced by merkel .
when asked whether the debate would help them make their decision , 46 percent of the undecided said ' yes , ' whereas 52 percent said ' no .

the higher gas prices mean that demand for more fuel-efficient cars with smaller engines should rise .

japanese manufacturer toyota has had great success with its prius hybrid in the us , and is now looking towards the growing market in china for even more profits .
the company is planning 10 new models with hybrid engines . sales of hybrids in europe have lagged far behind the us and japan , ferdinand düdenhoffer , director of the center for automotive research in gelsenkirchen told the süddeutsche zeitung .
" one reason for that is the strength of diesel engines , which are hardly present in the us and japanese car markets , " he said .
the other reason is the lack of hybrid models from european carmakers . europe 's largest carmaker , volkswagen , is reportedly looking for a partnership with porsche , which hopes to display its progress in hybrid technology at the iaa . however , scepticism towards hybrids remains in germany .
" the hybrid motor is a little bit overrated , " said automotive industry analyst willi diez .
" it does n't use that much less gas than the modern diesel engines that german manufacturers have been instrumental in developing and promoting . " even if demand for hybrids remains sluggish in europe , it will be essential for german carmakers to get up to speed with hybrid technology if they want a part of the market in north america and asia . " german producers have to act quickly now to regain lost ground , " diez said . hydrogen the fuel of the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists surround the new hydrogen-fuel powered bmw h2r car at the 2004 mondial de l 'automobile motor show in paris , thursday 23 september 2004 .
volkswagen is looking further afield for alternative engine concepts , betting on synthetically produced fuels from biomass for the medium-term .
in the long-term , however , german manufacturers are interested in the promise of hydrogen-powered cars , even if advancements in this area have been slower than anticipated . " we 'll almost certainly have to wait for about 20 years -lrb- for the first marketable hydrogen car -rrb- , " said a vw spokesperson .
in the meantime , the company is developing its hydrogen technology with its touran hymotion prototype - a car with an electric motor that draws its power from a fuel cell . mercedes has 180 patents pending in the area of fuel cell technology , and bmw is racing ahead with its h2r hydrogen-powered prototype . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de katrina could swamp german economy germany 's economy minister has said he fears hurricane katrina , which has devastated the southern us coast , could lead to a further rise in oil prices and dampen already weak domestic spending in germany .

the chancellor came across as a more trustworthy candidate , winning 39 percent of votes in this category against his challenger , who gained only 18 percent .
the tv viewers also clearly decided that the relaxed and confident schröder , who is known in germany as " media chancellor , " presented himself as a more likeable character . yet when it came to the single most important election issue - the question of the staggering unemployment rate in germany - the polls have shown that 35 percent of the viewers believed merkel was better fit to solve the problem of unemployment in germany .
only 10 percent of the viewers expressed their confidence in schröder 's competence on this point . it 's not over till it 's over bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it has been described as the " tv event of the year " according to political scientist thorsten faas from the university of duisburg , the viewers ' assessment of the debate could still change in the following days .
political commentaries and the mass media play an important part in shaping public opinion . " a candidate could read the phone book to their supporters and the supporters would still see their candidate as the winner , " said faas . the group of voters that is most likely to be influenced by the debate are the so-called undecided - those who started watching the debate without a clear preference for either of the two candidates . according to the polls , 56 percent of the undecided found chancellor schröder convincing , whereas only 19 percent of the undecided voters were convinced by merkel .
when asked whether the debate would help them make their decision , 46 percent of the undecided said ' yes , ' whereas 52 percent said ' no . ' claiming victory representatives from both parties tried to capitalize on the poll results and claim victory for themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : confident about schröder 's performance in the debate : spd party leader franz müntefering franz müntefering , chairman of schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , said the debate had shown that the conservative movement in germany expressed no interest in social justice . " there is a kind of social coldness around merkel , " müntefering said . " i believe it 's good that people see it that way , and that they can decide , who they want to vote for . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we 've won : cdu party general secretary volker kauder cdu secretary general volker kauder praised merkel for her performance . " angela merkel has won the debate .
people could see that here is someone who knows what she wants , and how she can bring her country forward , " kauder said . family affairs schröder 's supporters , however , seemed to have been somewhat baffled by schröder 's declaration of love for his wife in the midst of the debate . when asked if he had approved of a recent interview in which his wife , doris schröder-köpf , said merkel could n't understand the issues facing german families today because she was childless , the chancellor responded , not without pathos , that he loved his wife because she thought and lived what she said . schröder 's party colleague german interior minister otto schily said that the chancellor could have done without that comment . " but everybody has their own style , " schily said . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sparks fly in german election tv debate two weeks ahead of national elections , german chancellor gerhard schröder and his conservative challenger , angela merkel , met for a tv debate sunday .

yet most were disappointed by the attention to detail or simply the lack of new data . berlin 's tagesspiegel commented that the importance of the televised debate , in part due to the four journalists who asked the questions , was over-dramatized .
the two " combatants , " as one inquisitor stated it , were not dead on the floor in the end .
both chancellor gerhard schröder and his challenger angela merkel made a few mistakes in the beginning , yet what was most important really was n't what they said , but the impression they made .
both had their moments but as they missed the mark at times - when schröder said he loves his wife or merkel commented that schröder once referred to teachers as a lot of " lazy bums " - and viewers were distracted from the real purpose .
not until the end did the debate become interesting .
the chancellor was more to the point , leaving merkel look " pale " over the issue of president bush 's us response to katrina .
schröder may have won , but seeing as that was expected , the victory did n't look so good .
germany 's largest tabloid , bild , tipped its hat to the two candidates : chancellor schröder knows that he can no longer win and thus defended his seven years in office ; merkel , the challenger , wants to reform germany and all the polls show she will be assuming the post as german chancellor .
" it was a debate of past versus future .
as of sunday evening we know this : there are not only elections on september 18 , there is also a choice between two true alternatives . "
bild noted that schröder and merkel are two notable politicians who have two very different paths planned for germany - the status quo to maintain societal equilibrium , or bigger reforms to prevent the country from dropping down into the third division .
angela merkel came over stronger than expected in the only one-one-one televised debate with gerhard schröder , wrote the leipziger volkszeitung .
but to two-thirds of the german people it was obvious entering the debate that the chancellor would look better .
schröder , however , faced a tough task , since the bar was set higher for him to start with ; only if his challenger had made grave mistakes , would she leave the set a loser .
but merkel stuck to central topics , like employment , budget , taxes and pensions , expressed herself competently and even made attacks on schröder , leaving little space for him to win points .
it was a familiar model : if the favorite only just barely wins , the presumed loser can feel victorious , the paper wrote .
bildunterschrift : the candidates and inquisitors : questions lacked punch , answers lacked new content the tv debate lacked excitement .
some murder mysteries are more thrilling than the verbal duel between angela merkel and gerhard schröder on sunday , wrote the südkurier from constance .
the four networks broadcasting the debate had built up the viewers ' expectations so much that people thought this would decide the election .
" baloney - we did n't find out anything new . "
the two stuck to their positions on the topics of the labor market , taxes and gasoline prices .
the chancellor had fun , almost to the point of arrogance .
on the other hand , people could tell that the debate was work for merkel , but she rubbed schröder 's nose in the failures of his government .
whoever was expecting a clear victory for schröder was disappointed .
two things stuck in the minds of the editors of the berliner zeitung : the downfall of german television and gerhard schröder 's declaration that he loved his wife .
the duel was no duel , the daily wrote .
it was even a low point in the history of german television , as four networks simultaneously broadcast the debate .
neither the candidates nor the television networks had a program .
the four journalists propagated the poor show by asking questions that any " school kid could have answered for the candidates by reading the newspapers . "

yet most were disappointed by the attention to detail or simply the lack of new data . berlin 's tagesspiegel commented that the importance of the televised debate , in part due to the four journalists who asked the questions , was over-dramatized .
the two " combatants , " as one inquisitor stated it , were not dead on the floor in the end .
both chancellor gerhard schröder and his challenger angela merkel made a few mistakes in the beginning , yet what was most important really was n't what they said , but the impression they made .
both had their moments but as they missed the mark at times - when schröder said he loves his wife or merkel commented that schröder once referred to teachers as a lot of " lazy bums " - and viewers were distracted from the real purpose .
not until the end did the debate become interesting .
the chancellor was more to the point , leaving merkel look " pale " over the issue of president bush 's us response to katrina .
schröder may have won , but seeing as that was expected , the victory did n't look so good .
germany 's largest tabloid , bild , tipped its hat to the two candidates : chancellor schröder knows that he can no longer win and thus defended his seven years in office ; merkel , the challenger , wants to reform germany and all the polls show she will be assuming the post as german chancellor .
" it was a debate of past versus future .
as of sunday evening we know this : there are not only elections on september 18 , there is also a choice between two true alternatives . "
bild noted that schröder and merkel are two notable politicians who have two very different paths planned for germany - the status quo to maintain societal equilibrium , or bigger reforms to prevent the country from dropping down into the third division .
angela merkel came over stronger than expected in the only one-one-one televised debate with gerhard schröder , wrote the leipziger volkszeitung .
but to two-thirds of the german people it was obvious entering the debate that the chancellor would look better .
schröder , however , faced a tough task , since the bar was set higher for him to start with ; only if his challenger had made grave mistakes , would she leave the set a loser .
but merkel stuck to central topics , like employment , budget , taxes and pensions , expressed herself competently and even made attacks on schröder , leaving little space for him to win points .
it was a familiar model : if the favorite only just barely wins , the presumed loser can feel victorious , the paper wrote .
bildunterschrift : the candidates and inquisitors : questions lacked punch , answers lacked new content the tv debate lacked excitement .
some murder mysteries are more thrilling than the verbal duel between angela merkel and gerhard schröder on sunday , wrote the südkurier from constance .
the four networks broadcasting the debate had built up the viewers ' expectations so much that people thought this would decide the election .
" baloney - we did n't find out anything new . "
the two stuck to their positions on the topics of the labor market , taxes and gasoline prices .
the chancellor had fun , almost to the point of arrogance .
on the other hand , people could tell that the debate was work for merkel , but she rubbed schröder 's nose in the failures of his government .
whoever was expecting a clear victory for schröder was disappointed .
two things stuck in the minds of the editors of the berliner zeitung : the downfall of german television and gerhard schröder 's declaration that he loved his wife .
the duel was no duel , the daily wrote .
it was even a low point in the history of german television , as four networks simultaneously broadcast the debate .
neither the candidates nor the television networks had a program .

the number of new car registrations , which are a key gauge of domestic demand in the sector , rose to 245,000 in august .
according to bernd gottschalf , president of the vda auto industry association , the explosion of gasoline prices has not put a dent in car-buying habits , although drivers are reacting to the high prices .
" they 're changing their driving habits , but they 're also buying modern , more fuel-efficient models .
that explains why the market has developed positively for the fifth month in a row , " he said .
in a significant development , especially in the face of poor consumer confidence in germany , the growth in domestic demand for new cars is now outpacing overseas demand for german-made cars .
export orders rose just 1 percent due to the strong euro , high raw material costs and fierce competition from low-wage countries . dw-world.de hurricane katrina causes jitters in europe hurricane katrina , currently pummelling the us , is sending shock waves over to europe too .
on monday , the storm caused oil prices to surge to record highs .

relaxed .
statesman-like .
gerhard schröder cut a strong figure in the election 's only one-on-one televised debate between the two candidates for chancellor .
but nobody really expected anything less from the man widely know as germany 's " media chancellor , " and though he did well , it would foolish to think his tv presence could single-handedly get him re-elected .
john kerry solidly beat us president george bush in three separate debates last year , but he still could n't defeat him at the polls when november rolled around .
that 's because bush is such a horrible speaker that he came through unscathed simply because no one imagined he 'd be able to string together a coherent argument .
merkel , similarly to bush , was playing a game of managing expectations .
she herself had set the bar low with several prominent gaffes on the campaign trail .
but on sunday she put in a respectable performance , showing none of her previous unsteadiness .
aside from looking a little uncomfortable at the start of the debate , merkel quickly gained her footing .
she was very pugnacious and did not shrink from repeatedly addressing and attacking schröder directly .
by not putting in a disastrous appearance , her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- can now be expected to hold onto their sizable lead in the polls over schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
schröder still upbeat for most of the debate , schröder seemed comfortable to take the high road , although he did repeatedly slam merkel 's intended finance minister , paul kirchhof .
arguably the best line of the contest was his jab that people would be turned into " guinea pigs " if kirchhof implemented his plans for a flat tax of 25 percent .
and you 've got to admire how the man can still come off as so confident despite trailing his opponent so badly .
maybe it 's just that he 's looking forward to spending more time on vacation in tuscany next year .
bildunterschrift : the biggest losers of the evening were clearly the debate moderators .
after merkel rejected having a second tv duel on the laughable grounds there was n't enough time before the sept .
18 election , germany 's four main networks were forced to work on last night 's contest together .
the broadcasters each sent a journalist - two from private and two from public stations - which proved to be an unwieldy formation for keeping the politicians on topic and under control .
often merkel and schröder would ignore a question in order to spend minutes attacking the last statement from the opponent .
with fewer moderators they might have been less shy about cutting the candidates off or being more aggressive with their questioning .
debating in parliament some german commentators have lamented that the televised debates are part of the " americanization " of german politics , where style trumps substance .
i 'm not sure i totally agree with that assessment , but one does have to question whether such contests are superfluous in a parliamentary democracy .
unlike america where presidential candidate otherwise never have to face each other directly , parliamentary leaders constantly debate one another in germany .
later this week , just days after sunday 's tv duel , both schröder and merkel will take to the floor of the bundestag for a bit of rhetorical thrust and parry .
schröder will have to remain in top form if he hopes to gain any momentum in the final two weeks of the campaign .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 05.09.2005 eu and china resolve textile dispute großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese textiles have been piling up at european ports the eu-chinese summit in beijing , boosted by the settlement of the dispute over import quotas for chinese textiles , kicked off to an optimistic start on monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fight is over : eu commission president jose manuel barroso -lrb- left -rrb- , british prime minister tony blair and chinese premier wien jiabao european commission president jose manuel barroso confirmed monday that a deal had been reached to settle a bilateral textile row with china that has left millions of chinese-made textiles blocked at european ports . " today , our trade commissioner -lrb- peter -rrb- mandelson and -lrb- chinese commerce -rrb- minister bo xilai ... made it possible to have an agreement for an equitable way to share the burden of unlicensed goods blocked in our ports , " he told a press conference . " once again , we have shown ... that it is possible when there is real good will to achieve the objectives and priorities to solve all issues between china and the european union , " barroso said . any deal between the eu and china must be accepted by all 25 eu member states . grueling talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade commissioner peter mandelson -lrb- right -rrb- , with the chinese minister of commerce bo xilai negotiations between mandelson and bo started in beijing on sunday , a day ahead of the eu-china summit , and continued through the night into monday .
at one point during the talks , bo stormed out of the meeting late sunday , but discussions apparently continued as lower-level officials shuffled messages back and forth . millions of chinese textile items including sweaters , pants , blouses , t-shirts , bras , and tons of flax yarn were impounded in european ports because they exceeded import quotas agreed to by both sides in june . the backlog stems from goods that were already in transit when the two sides reached an accord in june to limit imports of chinese textiles .
there was also a surge in orders immediately after that deal was announced . a logistical nightmare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the eu-chinese deal , fashion has won back its freedom calling the june agreement " robust , " barroso said that a sudden surge in orders and shipments had " frankly overwhelmed administrative arrangements . " releasing the blocked products should save european importers hundreds of millions of dollars in orders and other costly shipping and storage fees . china shipped more than 300 million sweaters to europe so far this year , compared to about 40 million last year . the surge in textiles started after a global multi-fiber textile quota system was abolished in line with world trade organization guidelines to liberalize the garment trade on jan .
1 . china has opposed efforts from the eu and the united states to block the surge of textiles as moves against free trade but wto guidelines allow for re-implementation of quotas on a limited basis if such sharp increases are deemed " destabilizing " to importing countries . bolstering eu-chinese relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's prime minister tony blair -lrb- left -rrb- greeted by china 's president hu jintao at the great hall of the people in beijing british prime minister tony blair , who is attending the eu-china summit as head of the rotating eu presidency , said monday that strong relations between the eu and china were " immensely important . " " the strategic partnership between china and the european union is of immense importance , not just in terms of trade and the economy , but also in terms of our cooperation in all the major political issues the world faces , " he said in a meeting with chinese president hu jintao . blair 's spokesman said that on top of the usual trade-focused agenda , global political and security issues had been added in the wake of the terrorist bombings in london which left 56 people dead in july .
human rights issues would also be discussed . despite disagreements on issues including europe 's embargo on arms sales to china and its refusal to grant beijing market economy status , hu agreed that building understanding was crucial . " regular meetings between china and the european union are good for enhancing our mutual understanding and are also good for mutual beneficial cooperation and moving forward our comprehensive strategic partnership , " he told blair . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de china wants eu to increase textile quotas beijing and brussels were set to begin trade negotiations over booming chinese textile exports with china expecting the eu to capitulate and increase import quotas , according to chinese sources on wednesday .

relaxed .
statesman-like .
gerhard schröder cut a strong figure in the election 's only one-on-one televised debate between the two candidates for chancellor .
but nobody really expected anything less from the man widely know as germany 's " media chancellor , " and though he did well , it would foolish to think his tv presence could single-handedly get him re-elected .
john kerry solidly beat us president george bush in three separate debates last year , but he still could n't defeat him at the polls when november rolled around .
that 's because bush is such a horrible speaker that he came through unscathed simply because no one imagined he 'd be able to string together a coherent argument .
merkel , similarly to bush , was playing a game of managing expectations .
she herself had set the bar low with several prominent gaffes on the campaign trail .
but on sunday she put in a respectable performance , showing none of her previous unsteadiness .
aside from looking a little uncomfortable at the start of the debate , merkel quickly gained her footing .
she was very pugnacious and did not shrink from repeatedly addressing and attacking schröder directly .
by not putting in a disastrous appearance , her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- can now be expected to hold onto their sizable lead in the polls over schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
schröder still upbeat for most of the debate , schröder seemed comfortable to take the high road , although he did repeatedly slam merkel 's intended finance minister , paul kirchhof .
arguably the best line of the contest was his jab that people would be turned into " guinea pigs " if kirchhof implemented his plans for a flat tax of 25 percent .
and you 've got to admire how the man can still come off as so confident despite trailing his opponent so badly .
maybe it 's just that he 's looking forward to spending more time on vacation in tuscany next year .
bildunterschrift : the biggest losers of the evening were clearly the debate moderators .
after merkel rejected having a second tv duel on the laughable grounds there was n't enough time before the sept .
18 election , germany 's four main networks were forced to work on last night 's contest together .
the broadcasters each sent a journalist - two from private and two from public stations - which proved to be an unwieldy formation for keeping the politicians on topic and under control .
often merkel and schröder would ignore a question in order to spend minutes attacking the last statement from the opponent .
with fewer moderators they might have been less shy about cutting the candidates off or being more aggressive with their questioning .
debating in parliament some german commentators have lamented that the televised debates are part of the " americanization " of german politics , where style trumps substance .
i 'm not sure i totally agree with that assessment , but one does have to question whether such contests are superfluous in a parliamentary democracy .
unlike america where presidential candidate otherwise never have to face each other directly , parliamentary leaders constantly debate one another in germany .
later this week , just days after sunday 's tv duel , both schröder and merkel will take to the floor of the bundestag for a bit of rhetorical thrust and parry .
schröder will have to remain in top form if he hopes to gain any momentum in the final two weeks of the campaign .

relaxed .
statesman-like .
gerhard schröder cut a strong figure in the election 's only one-on-one televised debate between the two candidates for chancellor .
but nobody really expected anything less from the man widely know as germany 's " media chancellor , " and though he did well , it would foolish to think his tv presence could single-handedly get him re-elected .
john kerry solidly beat us president george bush in three separate debates last year , but he still could n't defeat him at the polls when november rolled around .
that 's because bush is such a horrible speaker that he came through unscathed simply because no one imagined he 'd be able to string together a coherent argument .
merkel , similarly to bush , was playing a game of managing expectations .
she herself had set the bar low with several prominent gaffes on the campaign trail .
but on sunday she put in a respectable performance , showing none of her previous unsteadiness .
aside from looking a little uncomfortable at the start of the debate , merkel quickly gained her footing .
she was very pugnacious and did not shrink from repeatedly addressing and attacking schröder directly .
by not putting in a disastrous appearance , her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- can now be expected to hold onto their sizable lead in the polls over schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
schröder still upbeat for most of the debate , schröder seemed comfortable to take the high road , although he did repeatedly slam merkel 's intended finance minister , paul kirchhof .
arguably the best line of the contest was his jab that people would be turned into " guinea pigs " if kirchhof implemented his plans for a flat tax of 25 percent .
and you 've got to admire how the man can still come off as so confident despite trailing his opponent so badly .
maybe it 's just that he 's looking forward to spending more time on vacation in tuscany next year .
bildunterschrift : the biggest losers of the evening were clearly the debate moderators .
after merkel rejected having a second tv duel on the laughable grounds there was n't enough time before the sept .
18 election , germany 's four main networks were forced to work on last night 's contest together .
the broadcasters each sent a journalist - two from private and two from public stations - which proved to be an unwieldy formation for keeping the politicians on topic and under control .
often merkel and schröder would ignore a question in order to spend minutes attacking the last statement from the opponent .
with fewer moderators they might have been less shy about cutting the candidates off or being more aggressive with their questioning .
debating in parliament some german commentators have lamented that the televised debates are part of the " americanization " of german politics , where style trumps substance .
i 'm not sure i totally agree with that assessment , but one does have to question whether such contests are superfluous in a parliamentary democracy .
unlike america where presidential candidate otherwise never have to face each other directly , parliamentary leaders constantly debate one another in germany .
later this week , just days after sunday 's tv duel , both schröder and merkel will take to the floor of the bundestag for a bit of rhetorical thrust and parry .
schröder will have to remain in top form if he hopes to gain any momentum in the final two weeks of the campaign .

the chancellor came across as a more trustworthy candidate , winning 39 percent of votes in this category against his challenger , who gained only 18 percent .
the tv viewers also clearly decided that the relaxed and confident schröder , who is known in germany as " media chancellor , " presented himself as a more likeable character . yet when it came to the single most important election issue - the question of the staggering unemployment rate in germany - the polls have shown that 35 percent of the viewers believed merkel was better fit to solve the problem of unemployment in germany .
only 10 percent of the viewers expressed their confidence in schröder 's competence on this point . it 's not over till it 's over bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it has been described as the " tv event of the year " according to political scientist thorsten faas from the university of duisburg , the viewers ' assessment of the debate could still change in the following days .
political commentaries and the mass media play an important part in shaping public opinion . " a candidate could read the phone book to their supporters and the supporters would still see their candidate as the winner , " said faas . the group of voters that is most likely to be influenced by the debate are the so-called undecided - those who started watching the debate without a clear preference for either of the two candidates . according to the polls , 56 percent of the undecided found chancellor schröder convincing , whereas only 19 percent of the undecided voters were convinced by merkel .
when asked whether the debate would help them make their decision , 46 percent of the undecided said ' yes , ' whereas 52 percent said ' no . ' claiming victory representatives from both parties tried to capitalize on the poll results and claim victory for themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : confident about schröder 's performance in the debate : spd party leader franz müntefering franz müntefering , chairman of schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , said the debate had shown that the conservative movement in germany expressed no interest in social justice . " there is a kind of social coldness around merkel , " müntefering said . " i believe it 's good that people see it that way , and that they can decide , who they want to vote for .

the chancellor came across as a more trustworthy candidate , winning 39 percent of votes in this category against his challenger , who gained only 18 percent .
the tv viewers also clearly decided that the relaxed and confident schröder , who is known in germany as " media chancellor , " presented himself as a more likeable character . yet when it came to the single most important election issue - the question of the staggering unemployment rate in germany - the polls have shown that 35 percent of the viewers believed merkel was better fit to solve the problem of unemployment in germany .
only 10 percent of the viewers expressed their confidence in schröder 's competence on this point . it 's not over till it 's over bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it has been described as the " tv event of the year " according to political scientist thorsten faas from the university of duisburg , the viewers ' assessment of the debate could still change in the following days .
political commentaries and the mass media play an important part in shaping public opinion . " a candidate could read the phone book to their supporters and the supporters would still see their candidate as the winner , " said faas . the group of voters that is most likely to be influenced by the debate are the so-called undecided - those who started watching the debate without a clear preference for either of the two candidates . according to the polls , 56 percent of the undecided found chancellor schröder convincing , whereas only 19 percent of the undecided voters were convinced by merkel .
when asked whether the debate would help them make their decision , 46 percent of the undecided said ' yes , ' whereas 52 percent said ' no . ' claiming victory representatives from both parties tried to capitalize on the poll results and claim victory for themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : confident about schröder 's performance in the debate : spd party leader franz müntefering franz müntefering , chairman of schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , said the debate had shown that the conservative movement in germany expressed no interest in social justice . " there is a kind of social coldness around merkel , " müntefering said . " i believe it 's good that people see it that way , and that they can decide , who they want to vote for . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we 've won : cdu party general secretary volker kauder cdu secretary general volker kauder praised merkel for her performance . " angela merkel has won the debate .
people could see that here is someone who knows what she wants , and how she can bring her country forward , " kauder said . family affairs schröder 's supporters , however , seemed to have been somewhat baffled by schröder 's declaration of love for his wife in the midst of the debate . when asked if he had approved of a recent interview in which his wife , doris schröder-köpf , said merkel could n't understand the issues facing german families today because she was childless , the chancellor responded , not without pathos , that he loved his wife because she thought and lived what she said . schröder 's party colleague german interior minister otto schily said that the chancellor could have done without that comment . " but everybody has their own style , " schily said . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sparks fly in german election tv debate two weeks ahead of national elections , german chancellor gerhard schröder and his conservative challenger , angela merkel , met for a tv debate sunday .

yet most were disappointed by the attention to detail or simply the lack of new data . berlin 's tagesspiegel commented that the importance of the televised debate , in part due to the four journalists who asked the questions , was over-dramatized .
the two " combatants , " as one inquisitor stated it , were not dead on the floor in the end .
both chancellor gerhard schröder and his challenger angela merkel made a few mistakes in the beginning , yet what was most important really was n't what they said , but the impression they made .
both had their moments but as they missed the mark at times - when schröder said he loves his wife or merkel commented that schröder once referred to teachers as a lot of " lazy bums " - and viewers were distracted from the real purpose .
not until the end did the debate become interesting .
the chancellor was more to the point , leaving merkel look " pale " over the issue of president bush 's us response to katrina .
schröder may have won , but seeing as that was expected , the victory did n't look so good .
germany 's largest tabloid , bild , tipped its hat to the two candidates : chancellor schröder knows that he can no longer win and thus defended his seven years in office ; merkel , the challenger , wants to reform germany and all the polls show she will be assuming the post as german chancellor .
" it was a debate of past versus future .
as of sunday evening we know this : there are not only elections on september 18 , there is also a choice between two true alternatives . "
bild noted that schröder and merkel are two notable politicians who have two very different paths planned for germany - the status quo to maintain societal equilibrium , or bigger reforms to prevent the country from dropping down into the third division .
angela merkel came over stronger than expected in the only one-one-one televised debate with gerhard schröder , wrote the leipziger volkszeitung .
but to two-thirds of the german people it was obvious entering the debate that the chancellor would look better .
schröder , however , faced a tough task , since the bar was set higher for him to start with ; only if his challenger had made grave mistakes , would she leave the set a loser .
but merkel stuck to central topics , like employment , budget , taxes and pensions , expressed herself competently and even made attacks on schröder , leaving little space for him to win points .
it was a familiar model : if the favorite only just barely wins , the presumed loser can feel victorious , the paper wrote .
bildunterschrift : the candidates and inquisitors : questions lacked punch , answers lacked new content the tv debate lacked excitement .
some murder mysteries are more thrilling than the verbal duel between angela merkel and gerhard schröder on sunday , wrote the südkurier from constance .
the four networks broadcasting the debate had built up the viewers ' expectations so much that people thought this would decide the election .
" baloney - we did n't find out anything new . "
the two stuck to their positions on the topics of the labor market , taxes and gasoline prices .
the chancellor had fun , almost to the point of arrogance .
on the other hand , people could tell that the debate was work for merkel , but she rubbed schröder 's nose in the failures of his government .
whoever was expecting a clear victory for schröder was disappointed .
two things stuck in the minds of the editors of the berliner zeitung : the downfall of german television and gerhard schröder 's declaration that he loved his wife .
the duel was no duel , the daily wrote .
it was even a low point in the history of german television , as four networks simultaneously broadcast the debate .
neither the candidates nor the television networks had a program .
the four journalists propagated the poor show by asking questions that any " school kid could have answered for the candidates by reading the newspapers . "

yet most were disappointed by the attention to detail or simply the lack of new data . berlin 's tagesspiegel commented that the importance of the televised debate , in part due to the four journalists who asked the questions , was over-dramatized .
the two " combatants , " as one inquisitor stated it , were not dead on the floor in the end .
both chancellor gerhard schröder and his challenger angela merkel made a few mistakes in the beginning , yet what was most important really was n't what they said , but the impression they made .
both had their moments but as they missed the mark at times - when schröder said he loves his wife or merkel commented that schröder once referred to teachers as a lot of " lazy bums " - and viewers were distracted from the real purpose .
not until the end did the debate become interesting .
the chancellor was more to the point , leaving merkel look " pale " over the issue of president bush 's us response to katrina .
schröder may have won , but seeing as that was expected , the victory did n't look so good .
germany 's largest tabloid , bild , tipped its hat to the two candidates : chancellor schröder knows that he can no longer win and thus defended his seven years in office ; merkel , the challenger , wants to reform germany and all the polls show she will be assuming the post as german chancellor .
" it was a debate of past versus future .
as of sunday evening we know this : there are not only elections on september 18 , there is also a choice between two true alternatives . "
bild noted that schröder and merkel are two notable politicians who have two very different paths planned for germany - the status quo to maintain societal equilibrium , or bigger reforms to prevent the country from dropping down into the third division .
angela merkel came over stronger than expected in the only one-one-one televised debate with gerhard schröder , wrote the leipziger volkszeitung .
but to two-thirds of the german people it was obvious entering the debate that the chancellor would look better .
schröder , however , faced a tough task , since the bar was set higher for him to start with ; only if his challenger had made grave mistakes , would she leave the set a loser .
but merkel stuck to central topics , like employment , budget , taxes and pensions , expressed herself competently and even made attacks on schröder , leaving little space for him to win points .
it was a familiar model : if the favorite only just barely wins , the presumed loser can feel victorious , the paper wrote .
bildunterschrift : the candidates and inquisitors : questions lacked punch , answers lacked new content the tv debate lacked excitement .
some murder mysteries are more thrilling than the verbal duel between angela merkel and gerhard schröder on sunday , wrote the südkurier from constance .
the four networks broadcasting the debate had built up the viewers ' expectations so much that people thought this would decide the election .
" baloney - we did n't find out anything new . "
the two stuck to their positions on the topics of the labor market , taxes and gasoline prices .
the chancellor had fun , almost to the point of arrogance .
on the other hand , people could tell that the debate was work for merkel , but she rubbed schröder 's nose in the failures of his government .
whoever was expecting a clear victory for schröder was disappointed .
two things stuck in the minds of the editors of the berliner zeitung : the downfall of german television and gerhard schröder 's declaration that he loved his wife .
the duel was no duel , the daily wrote .
it was even a low point in the history of german television , as four networks simultaneously broadcast the debate .

relaxed .
statesman-like .
gerhard schröder cut a strong figure in the election 's only one-on-one televised debate between the two candidates for chancellor .
but nobody really expected anything less from the man widely know as germany 's " media chancellor , " and though he did well , it would foolish to think his tv presence could single-handedly get him re-elected .
john kerry solidly beat us president george bush in three separate debates last year , but he still could n't defeat him at the polls when november rolled around .
that 's because bush is such a horrible speaker that he came through unscathed simply because no one imagined he 'd be able to string together a coherent argument .
merkel , similarly to bush , was playing a game of managing expectations .
she herself had set the bar low with several prominent gaffes on the campaign trail .
but on sunday she put in a respectable performance , showing none of her previous unsteadiness .
aside from looking a little uncomfortable at the start of the debate , merkel quickly gained her footing .
she was very pugnacious and did not shrink from repeatedly addressing and attacking schröder directly .
by not putting in a disastrous appearance , her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- can now be expected to hold onto their sizable lead in the polls over schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
schröder still upbeat for most of the debate , schröder seemed comfortable to take the high road , although he did repeatedly slam merkel 's intended finance minister , paul kirchhof .
arguably the best line of the contest was his jab that people would be turned into " guinea pigs " if kirchhof implemented his plans for a flat tax of 25 percent .
and you 've got to admire how the man can still come off as so confident despite trailing his opponent so badly .
maybe it 's just that he 's looking forward to spending more time on vacation in tuscany next year .
bildunterschrift : the biggest losers of the evening were clearly the debate moderators .
after merkel rejected having a second tv duel on the laughable grounds there was n't enough time before the sept .
18 election , germany 's four main networks were forced to work on last night 's contest together .
the broadcasters each sent a journalist - two from private and two from public stations - which proved to be an unwieldy formation for keeping the politicians on topic and under control .
often merkel and schröder would ignore a question in order to spend minutes attacking the last statement from the opponent .
with fewer moderators they might have been less shy about cutting the candidates off or being more aggressive with their questioning .
debating in parliament some german commentators have lamented that the televised debates are part of the " americanization " of german politics , where style trumps substance .
i 'm not sure i totally agree with that assessment , but one does have to question whether such contests are superfluous in a parliamentary democracy .
unlike america where presidential candidate otherwise never have to face each other directly , parliamentary leaders constantly debate one another in germany .
later this week , just days after sunday 's tv duel , both schröder and merkel will take to the floor of the bundestag for a bit of rhetorical thrust and parry .
schröder will have to remain in top form if he hopes to gain any momentum in the final two weeks of the campaign .
merkel , on the other hand , may have the bar set just a tad bit higher after her solid debate performance . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sparks fly in german election tv debate two weeks ahead of national elections , german chancellor gerhard schröder and his conservative challenger , angela merkel , met for a tv debate sunday .

" modern technology is very often distinguished by very intelligent , young , male engineers , who are right-handed , developing something that they can , not necessarily that people need , " said ernst pöppel of the institute for generational research in bad tölz .
" and we try to give an indication that you can develop non-strenuous intuitive technologies . " among other things , pöppel and his colleagues at the university 's institute explore the possibilities of developing cars and mobile phones that can be easily used without reading a thick instruction manual first .
the researchers have already designed a simple cd player for dementia patients , who often find they can no longer operate modern devices . the roughly 15-centimeter -lrb- six-inch -rrb- tall cubes , or tölz dice , as they are called , have a different color on each of their six sides .
after being programmed , the dice play music according to whichever side they are resting on - without any buttons or knobs to press .
the dice could soon go into production .
changing with age bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the bad tölz research projects involves examining to what extent people 's hearing changes with age . one hundred test people of all ages took part in one study to determine whether seniors are worse at recognizing different frequencies and sequences of tones worse than younger people . psychologist jan churan 's research is similar but uses optical signals .
he discovered that people 's ability to recognize acoustic stimuli tends to remain constant as they age , but from age 60 recognizing visual stimuli becomes slightly worse . " we have n't been able to observe any dramatic collapse , " he said . the bad tölz academics have also been exploring new media formats and are currently developing year-long courses fur those above 60 who want to be kept abreast of what 's happening in the academic world beyond the pages of newspapers or the evening television news . " there 's a very astounding demand , " pöppel said . marcus schwandner -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de graying germany germany is becoming a distinctly " gray " nation and the change is requiring changes in all aspects of life : seniors need work , housing and even prisons , as this selection of dw-world stories on the topic shows .
a germany without children ?
germany is waking up to the fact that a demographic revolution is underway .
not only are people living longer , but germans are having fewer babies , meaning the population is both shrinking and ageing .
read dw-world 's dossier .
getting the gray vote senior citizens make up a third of the german electorate and are being wooed by all the parties .
but when it comes to one of the issues that concerns them - pensions - they do n't think any one party has the answers .

the higher gas prices mean that demand for more fuel-efficient cars with smaller engines should rise .

japanese manufacturer toyota has had great success with its prius hybrid in the us , and is now looking towards the growing market in china for even more profits .
the company is planning 10 new models with hybrid engines . sales of hybrids in europe have lagged far behind the us and japan , ferdinand düdenhoffer , director of the center for automotive research in gelsenkirchen told the süddeutsche zeitung .
" one reason for that is the strength of diesel engines , which are hardly present in the us and japanese car markets , " he said .
the other reason is the lack of hybrid models from european carmakers . europe 's largest carmaker , volkswagen , is reportedly looking for a partnership with porsche , which hopes to display its progress in hybrid technology at the iaa . however , scepticism towards hybrids remains in germany .
" the hybrid motor is a little bit overrated , " said automotive industry analyst willi diez .
" it does n't use that much less gas than the modern diesel engines that german manufacturers have been instrumental in developing and promoting . " even if demand for hybrids remains sluggish in europe , it will be essential for german carmakers to get up to speed with hybrid technology if they want a part of the market in north america and asia .

" one reason for that is the strength of diesel engines , which are hardly present in the us and japanese car markets , " he said .
the other reason is the lack of hybrid models from european carmakers . europe 's largest carmaker , volkswagen , is reportedly looking for a partnership with porsche , which hopes to display its progress in hybrid technology at the iaa . however , scepticism towards hybrids remains in germany .
" the hybrid motor is a little bit overrated , " said automotive industry analyst willi diez .
" it does n't use that much less gas than the modern diesel engines that german manufacturers have been instrumental in developing and promoting . " even if demand for hybrids remains sluggish in europe , it will be essential for german carmakers to get up to speed with hybrid technology if they want a part of the market in north america and asia . " german producers have to act quickly now to regain lost ground , " diez said . hydrogen the fuel of the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists surround the new hydrogen-fuel powered bmw h2r car at the 2004 mondial de l 'automobile motor show in paris , thursday 23 september 2004 .
volkswagen is looking further afield for alternative engine concepts , betting on synthetically produced fuels from biomass for the medium-term .
in the long-term , however , german manufacturers are interested in the promise of hydrogen-powered cars , even if advancements in this area have been slower than anticipated . " we 'll almost certainly have to wait for about 20 years -lrb- for the first marketable hydrogen car -rrb- , " said a vw spokesperson .
in the meantime , the company is developing its hydrogen technology with its touran hymotion prototype - a car with an electric motor that draws its power from a fuel cell . mercedes has 180 patents pending in the area of fuel cell technology , and bmw is racing ahead with its h2r hydrogen-powered prototype . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de katrina could swamp german economy germany 's economy minister has said he fears hurricane katrina , which has devastated the southern us coast , could lead to a further rise in oil prices and dampen already weak domestic spending in germany .

the higher gas prices mean that demand for more fuel-efficient cars with smaller engines should rise .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : election editorials : dw 's take opinion : dissolving the doubt opinion : greens must learn to let go the german fear of reform opinion : germany left behind europe -pipe- 05.09.2005 opinion : germany 's debatable impact großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder was expected to beat angela merkel german chancellor gerhard schröder may have won sunday 's televised debate with angela merkel , but the gaffe-prone leader of the conservative opposition might be the night 's real winner , says dw-world 's marc young . confident .
relaxed .
statesman-like .
gerhard schröder cut a strong figure in the election 's only one-on-one televised debate between the two candidates for chancellor .
but nobody really expected anything less from the man widely know as germany 's " media chancellor , " and though he did well , it would foolish to think his tv presence could single-handedly get him re-elected .
john kerry solidly beat us president george bush in three separate debates last year , but he still could n't defeat him at the polls when november rolled around .
that 's because bush is such a horrible speaker that he came through unscathed simply because no one imagined he 'd be able to string together a coherent argument .
merkel , similarly to bush , was playing a game of managing expectations .
she herself had set the bar low with several prominent gaffes on the campaign trail .
but on sunday she put in a respectable performance , showing none of her previous unsteadiness .
aside from looking a little uncomfortable at the start of the debate , merkel quickly gained her footing .
she was very pugnacious and did not shrink from repeatedly addressing and attacking schröder directly .
by not putting in a disastrous appearance , her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- can now be expected to hold onto their sizable lead in the polls over schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
schröder still upbeat for most of the debate , schröder seemed comfortable to take the high road , although he did repeatedly slam merkel 's intended finance minister , paul kirchhof .
arguably the best line of the contest was his jab that people would be turned into " guinea pigs " if kirchhof implemented his plans for a flat tax of 25 percent .
and you 've got to admire how the man can still come off as so confident despite trailing his opponent so badly .
maybe it 's just that he 's looking forward to spending more time on vacation in tuscany next year .
bildunterschrift : the biggest losers of the evening were clearly the debate moderators .
after merkel rejected having a second tv duel on the laughable grounds there was n't enough time before the sept .
18 election , germany 's four main networks were forced to work on last night 's contest together .
the broadcasters each sent a journalist - two from private and two from public stations - which proved to be an unwieldy formation for keeping the politicians on topic and under control .
often merkel and schröder would ignore a question in order to spend minutes attacking the last statement from the opponent .
with fewer moderators they might have been less shy about cutting the candidates off or being more aggressive with their questioning .
debating in parliament some german commentators have lamented that the televised debates are part of the " americanization " of german politics , where style trumps substance .
i 'm not sure i totally agree with that assessment , but one does have to question whether such contests are superfluous in a parliamentary democracy .
unlike america where presidential candidate otherwise never have to face each other directly , parliamentary leaders constantly debate one another in germany .
later this week , just days after sunday 's tv duel , both schröder and merkel will take to the floor of the bundestag for a bit of rhetorical thrust and parry .
schröder will have to remain in top form if he hopes to gain any momentum in the final two weeks of the campaign .
merkel , on the other hand , may have the bar set just a tad bit higher after her solid debate performance . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sparks fly in german election tv debate two weeks ahead of national elections , german chancellor gerhard schröder and his conservative challenger , angela merkel , met for a tv debate sunday .

the chancellor came across as a more trustworthy candidate , winning 39 percent of votes in this category against his challenger , who gained only 18 percent .
the tv viewers also clearly decided that the relaxed and confident schröder , who is known in germany as " media chancellor , " presented himself as a more likeable character . yet when it came to the single most important election issue - the question of the staggering unemployment rate in germany - the polls have shown that 35 percent of the viewers believed merkel was better fit to solve the problem of unemployment in germany .
only 10 percent of the viewers expressed their confidence in schröder 's competence on this point . it 's not over till it 's over bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it has been described as the " tv event of the year " according to political scientist thorsten faas from the university of duisburg , the viewers ' assessment of the debate could still change in the following days .
political commentaries and the mass media play an important part in shaping public opinion .

yet most were disappointed by the attention to detail or simply the lack of new data . berlin 's tagesspiegel commented that the importance of the televised debate , in part due to the four journalists who asked the questions , was over-dramatized .
the two " combatants , " as one inquisitor stated it , were not dead on the floor in the end .
both chancellor gerhard schröder and his challenger angela merkel made a few mistakes in the beginning , yet what was most important really was n't what they said , but the impression they made .
both had their moments but as they missed the mark at times - when schröder said he loves his wife or merkel commented that schröder once referred to teachers as a lot of " lazy bums " - and viewers were distracted from the real purpose .
not until the end did the debate become interesting .
the chancellor was more to the point , leaving merkel look " pale " over the issue of president bush 's us response to katrina .
schröder may have won , but seeing as that was expected , the victory did n't look so good .
germany 's largest tabloid , bild , tipped its hat to the two candidates : chancellor schröder knows that he can no longer win and thus defended his seven years in office ; merkel , the challenger , wants to reform germany and all the polls show she will be assuming the post as german chancellor .
" it was a debate of past versus future .
as of sunday evening we know this : there are not only elections on september 18 , there is also a choice between two true alternatives . "
bild noted that schröder and merkel are two notable politicians who have two very different paths planned for germany - the status quo to maintain societal equilibrium , or bigger reforms to prevent the country from dropping down into the third division .
angela merkel came over stronger than expected in the only one-one-one televised debate with gerhard schröder , wrote the leipziger volkszeitung .
but to two-thirds of the german people it was obvious entering the debate that the chancellor would look better .
schröder , however , faced a tough task , since the bar was set higher for him to start with ; only if his challenger had made grave mistakes , would she leave the set a loser .
but merkel stuck to central topics , like employment , budget , taxes and pensions , expressed herself competently and even made attacks on schröder , leaving little space for him to win points .
it was a familiar model : if the favorite only just barely wins , the presumed loser can feel victorious , the paper wrote .
bildunterschrift : the candidates and inquisitors : questions lacked punch , answers lacked new content the tv debate lacked excitement .
some murder mysteries are more thrilling than the verbal duel between angela merkel and gerhard schröder on sunday , wrote the südkurier from constance .
the four networks broadcasting the debate had built up the viewers ' expectations so much that people thought this would decide the election .
" baloney - we did n't find out anything new . "
the two stuck to their positions on the topics of the labor market , taxes and gasoline prices .
the chancellor had fun , almost to the point of arrogance .
on the other hand , people could tell that the debate was work for merkel , but she rubbed schröder 's nose in the failures of his government .
whoever was expecting a clear victory for schröder was disappointed .
two things stuck in the minds of the editors of the berliner zeitung : the downfall of german television and gerhard schröder 's declaration that he loved his wife .
the duel was no duel , the daily wrote .
it was even a low point in the history of german television , as four networks simultaneously broadcast the debate .
neither the candidates nor the television networks had a program .
the four journalists propagated the poor show by asking questions that any " school kid could have answered for the candidates by reading the newspapers . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 05.09.2005 german press says schröder won großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the media said the chancellor was more impressive in the debate newspaper editors were almost unanimous that chancellor schröder won sunday 's long-awaited debate against challenger angela merkel .
yet most were disappointed by the attention to detail or simply the lack of new data . berlin 's tagesspiegel commented that the importance of the televised debate , in part due to the four journalists who asked the questions , was over-dramatized .
the two " combatants , " as one inquisitor stated it , were not dead on the floor in the end .
both chancellor gerhard schröder and his challenger angela merkel made a few mistakes in the beginning , yet what was most important really was n't what they said , but the impression they made .
both had their moments but as they missed the mark at times - when schröder said he loves his wife or merkel commented that schröder once referred to teachers as a lot of " lazy bums " - and viewers were distracted from the real purpose .
not until the end did the debate become interesting .
the chancellor was more to the point , leaving merkel look " pale " over the issue of president bush 's us response to katrina .
schröder may have won , but seeing as that was expected , the victory did n't look so good .
germany 's largest tabloid , bild , tipped its hat to the two candidates : chancellor schröder knows that he can no longer win and thus defended his seven years in office ; merkel , the challenger , wants to reform germany and all the polls show she will be assuming the post as german chancellor .
" it was a debate of past versus future .
as of sunday evening we know this : there are not only elections on september 18 , there is also a choice between two true alternatives . "
bild noted that schröder and merkel are two notable politicians who have two very different paths planned for germany - the status quo to maintain societal equilibrium , or bigger reforms to prevent the country from dropping down into the third division .
angela merkel came over stronger than expected in the only one-one-one televised debate with gerhard schröder , wrote the leipziger volkszeitung .
but to two-thirds of the german people it was obvious entering the debate that the chancellor would look better .
schröder , however , faced a tough task , since the bar was set higher for him to start with ; only if his challenger had made grave mistakes , would she leave the set a loser .
but merkel stuck to central topics , like employment , budget , taxes and pensions , expressed herself competently and even made attacks on schröder , leaving little space for him to win points .
it was a familiar model : if the favorite only just barely wins , the presumed loser can feel victorious , the paper wrote .
bildunterschrift : the candidates and inquisitors : questions lacked punch , answers lacked new content the tv debate lacked excitement .
some murder mysteries are more thrilling than the verbal duel between angela merkel and gerhard schröder on sunday , wrote the südkurier from constance .
the four networks broadcasting the debate had built up the viewers ' expectations so much that people thought this would decide the election .
" baloney - we did n't find out anything new . "
the two stuck to their positions on the topics of the labor market , taxes and gasoline prices .
the chancellor had fun , almost to the point of arrogance .
on the other hand , people could tell that the debate was work for merkel , but she rubbed schröder 's nose in the failures of his government .
whoever was expecting a clear victory for schröder was disappointed .
two things stuck in the minds of the editors of the berliner zeitung : the downfall of german television and gerhard schröder 's declaration that he loved his wife .
the duel was no duel , the daily wrote .
it was even a low point in the history of german television , as four networks simultaneously broadcast the debate .
neither the candidates nor the television networks had a program .
the four journalists propagated the poor show by asking questions that any " school kid could have answered for the candidates by reading the newspapers . "
if the weakness of german politics lies in leaders talking about how they will get the country out of its troubles without explaining the causes and without naming the goals , then this debate was a demonstration of just that . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sparks fly in german election tv debate two weeks ahead of national elections , german chancellor gerhard schröder and his conservative challenger , angela merkel , met for a tv debate sunday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.09.2005 high fuel prices push alternative engines großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas prices in germany continue to rise in katrina 's wake record prices at gas stations caused in part by the devastating effects of hurricane katrina have knocked discussion in germany about alternative engines into high gear ahead of this month 's auto show . the goal of introducing cleaner , more fuel-efficient engines has , for many people , never been so desirable - mainly because the cost of filling their car 's gas tank has never been so high . in europe , gas prices are up more than 10 percent over last year and now seem to be climbing by the day as a result of the devastation hurricane katrina caused to the united states ' oil industry last week . in germany , the average price of fuel is currently hovering at around 1.46 euros -lrb- $ 1.83 -rrb- per liter of super . but environmental activists are pointing to the silver lining .
the higher gas prices mean that demand for more fuel-efficient cars with smaller engines should rise .
in the run up to the iaa international motor show in frankfurt -lrb- sept.15-25 -rrb- , car manufacturers are increasingly talking about alternative or hybrid engines ; cleaner diesel , biomass and hydrogen-power are the current buzzwords . getting aboard the hybrid train bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toyota motor corp. executives masatami takimoto , left , and hiroyuki watanabe pose with a model of the hybrid prius sedan .
when it comes to hybrid engines - a combination electrical and conventional combustion engine - german carmakers could find themselves playing catch-up for the next few years .
japanese manufacturer toyota has had great success with its prius hybrid in the us , and is now looking towards the growing market in china for even more profits .
the company is planning 10 new models with hybrid engines . sales of hybrids in europe have lagged far behind the us and japan , ferdinand düdenhoffer , director of the center for automotive research in gelsenkirchen told the süddeutsche zeitung .
" one reason for that is the strength of diesel engines , which are hardly present in the us and japanese car markets , " he said .
the other reason is the lack of hybrid models from european carmakers . europe 's largest carmaker , volkswagen , is reportedly looking for a partnership with porsche , which hopes to display its progress in hybrid technology at the iaa . however , scepticism towards hybrids remains in germany .
" the hybrid motor is a little bit overrated , " said automotive industry analyst willi diez .
" it does n't use that much less gas than the modern diesel engines that german manufacturers have been instrumental in developing and promoting . " even if demand for hybrids remains sluggish in europe , it will be essential for german carmakers to get up to speed with hybrid technology if they want a part of the market in north america and asia . " german producers have to act quickly now to regain lost ground , " diez said . hydrogen the fuel of the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists surround the new hydrogen-fuel powered bmw h2r car at the 2004 mondial de l 'automobile motor show in paris , thursday 23 september 2004 .

there was also a surge in orders immediately after that deal was announced . a logistical nightmare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the eu-chinese deal , fashion has won back its freedom calling the june agreement " robust , " barroso said that a sudden surge in orders and shipments had " frankly overwhelmed administrative arrangements . " releasing the blocked products should save european importers hundreds of millions of dollars in orders and other costly shipping and storage fees . china shipped more than 300 million sweaters to europe so far this year , compared to about 40 million last year . the surge in textiles started after a global multi-fiber textile quota system was abolished in line with world trade organization guidelines to liberalize the garment trade on jan .
1 . china has opposed efforts from the eu and the united states to block the surge of textiles as moves against free trade but wto guidelines allow for re-implementation of quotas on a limited basis if such sharp increases are deemed " destabilizing " to importing countries . bolstering eu-chinese relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's prime minister tony blair -lrb- left -rrb- greeted by china 's president hu jintao at the great hall of the people in beijing british prime minister tony blair , who is attending the eu-china summit as head of the rotating eu presidency , said monday that strong relations between the eu and china were " immensely important . " " the strategic partnership between china and the european union is of immense importance , not just in terms of trade and the economy , but also in terms of our cooperation in all the major political issues the world faces , " he said in a meeting with chinese president hu jintao . blair 's spokesman said that on top of the usual trade-focused agenda , global political and security issues had been added in the wake of the terrorist bombings in london which left 56 people dead in july .
human rights issues would also be discussed . despite disagreements on issues including europe 's embargo on arms sales to china and its refusal to grant beijing market economy status , hu agreed that building understanding was crucial . " regular meetings between china and the european union are good for enhancing our mutual understanding and are also good for mutual beneficial cooperation and moving forward our comprehensive strategic partnership , " he told blair . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de china wants eu to increase textile quotas beijing and brussels were set to begin trade negotiations over booming chinese textile exports with china expecting the eu to capitulate and increase import quotas , according to chinese sources on wednesday .

relaxed .
statesman-like .
gerhard schröder cut a strong figure in the election 's only one-on-one televised debate between the two candidates for chancellor .
but nobody really expected anything less from the man widely know as germany 's " media chancellor , " and though he did well , it would foolish to think his tv presence could single-handedly get him re-elected .
john kerry solidly beat us president george bush in three separate debates last year , but he still could n't defeat him at the polls when november rolled around .
that 's because bush is such a horrible speaker that he came through unscathed simply because no one imagined he 'd be able to string together a coherent argument .
merkel , similarly to bush , was playing a game of managing expectations .
she herself had set the bar low with several prominent gaffes on the campaign trail .
but on sunday she put in a respectable performance , showing none of her previous unsteadiness .
aside from looking a little uncomfortable at the start of the debate , merkel quickly gained her footing .
she was very pugnacious and did not shrink from repeatedly addressing and attacking schröder directly .
by not putting in a disastrous appearance , her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- can now be expected to hold onto their sizable lead in the polls over schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
schröder still upbeat for most of the debate , schröder seemed comfortable to take the high road , although he did repeatedly slam merkel 's intended finance minister , paul kirchhof .
arguably the best line of the contest was his jab that people would be turned into " guinea pigs " if kirchhof implemented his plans for a flat tax of 25 percent .
and you 've got to admire how the man can still come off as so confident despite trailing his opponent so badly .
maybe it 's just that he 's looking forward to spending more time on vacation in tuscany next year .

18 election , germany 's four main networks were forced to work on last night 's contest together .
the broadcasters each sent a journalist - two from private and two from public stations - which proved to be an unwieldy formation for keeping the politicians on topic and under control .
often merkel and schröder would ignore a question in order to spend minutes attacking the last statement from the opponent .
with fewer moderators they might have been less shy about cutting the candidates off or being more aggressive with their questioning .
debating in parliament some german commentators have lamented that the televised debates are part of the " americanization " of german politics , where style trumps substance .
i 'm not sure i totally agree with that assessment , but one does have to question whether such contests are superfluous in a parliamentary democracy .
unlike america where presidential candidate otherwise never have to face each other directly , parliamentary leaders constantly debate one another in germany .
later this week , just days after sunday 's tv duel , both schröder and merkel will take to the floor of the bundestag for a bit of rhetorical thrust and parry .
schröder will have to remain in top form if he hopes to gain any momentum in the final two weeks of the campaign .

yet most were disappointed by the attention to detail or simply the lack of new data . berlin 's tagesspiegel commented that the importance of the televised debate , in part due to the four journalists who asked the questions , was over-dramatized .
the two " combatants , " as one inquisitor stated it , were not dead on the floor in the end .
both chancellor gerhard schröder and his challenger angela merkel made a few mistakes in the beginning , yet what was most important really was n't what they said , but the impression they made .
both had their moments but as they missed the mark at times - when schröder said he loves his wife or merkel commented that schröder once referred to teachers as a lot of " lazy bums " - and viewers were distracted from the real purpose .
not until the end did the debate become interesting .
the chancellor was more to the point , leaving merkel look " pale " over the issue of president bush 's us response to katrina .
schröder may have won , but seeing as that was expected , the victory did n't look so good .
germany 's largest tabloid , bild , tipped its hat to the two candidates : chancellor schröder knows that he can no longer win and thus defended his seven years in office ; merkel , the challenger , wants to reform germany and all the polls show she will be assuming the post as german chancellor .
" it was a debate of past versus future .
as of sunday evening we know this : there are not only elections on september 18 , there is also a choice between two true alternatives . "
bild noted that schröder and merkel are two notable politicians who have two very different paths planned for germany - the status quo to maintain societal equilibrium , or bigger reforms to prevent the country from dropping down into the third division .
angela merkel came over stronger than expected in the only one-one-one televised debate with gerhard schröder , wrote the leipziger volkszeitung .
but to two-thirds of the german people it was obvious entering the debate that the chancellor would look better .
schröder , however , faced a tough task , since the bar was set higher for him to start with ; only if his challenger had made grave mistakes , would she leave the set a loser .
but merkel stuck to central topics , like employment , budget , taxes and pensions , expressed herself competently and even made attacks on schröder , leaving little space for him to win points .
it was a familiar model : if the favorite only just barely wins , the presumed loser can feel victorious , the paper wrote .
bildunterschrift : the candidates and inquisitors : questions lacked punch , answers lacked new content the tv debate lacked excitement .
some murder mysteries are more thrilling than the verbal duel between angela merkel and gerhard schröder on sunday , wrote the südkurier from constance .
the four networks broadcasting the debate had built up the viewers ' expectations so much that people thought this would decide the election .
" baloney - we did n't find out anything new . "
the two stuck to their positions on the topics of the labor market , taxes and gasoline prices .
the chancellor had fun , almost to the point of arrogance .
on the other hand , people could tell that the debate was work for merkel , but she rubbed schröder 's nose in the failures of his government .
whoever was expecting a clear victory for schröder was disappointed .
two things stuck in the minds of the editors of the berliner zeitung : the downfall of german television and gerhard schröder 's declaration that he loved his wife .

neither the candidates nor the television networks had a program .
the four journalists propagated the poor show by asking questions that any " school kid could have answered for the candidates by reading the newspapers . "

relaxed .
statesman-like .
gerhard schröder cut a strong figure in the election 's only one-on-one televised debate between the two candidates for chancellor .
but nobody really expected anything less from the man widely know as germany 's " media chancellor , " and though he did well , it would foolish to think his tv presence could single-handedly get him re-elected .
john kerry solidly beat us president george bush in three separate debates last year , but he still could n't defeat him at the polls when november rolled around .
that 's because bush is such a horrible speaker that he came through unscathed simply because no one imagined he 'd be able to string together a coherent argument .
merkel , similarly to bush , was playing a game of managing expectations .
she herself had set the bar low with several prominent gaffes on the campaign trail .
but on sunday she put in a respectable performance , showing none of her previous unsteadiness .
aside from looking a little uncomfortable at the start of the debate , merkel quickly gained her footing .
she was very pugnacious and did not shrink from repeatedly addressing and attacking schröder directly .
by not putting in a disastrous appearance , her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- can now be expected to hold onto their sizable lead in the polls over schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
schröder still upbeat for most of the debate , schröder seemed comfortable to take the high road , although he did repeatedly slam merkel 's intended finance minister , paul kirchhof .
arguably the best line of the contest was his jab that people would be turned into " guinea pigs " if kirchhof implemented his plans for a flat tax of 25 percent .
and you 've got to admire how the man can still come off as so confident despite trailing his opponent so badly .
maybe it 's just that he 's looking forward to spending more time on vacation in tuscany next year .
bildunterschrift : the biggest losers of the evening were clearly the debate moderators .
after merkel rejected having a second tv duel on the laughable grounds there was n't enough time before the sept .
18 election , germany 's four main networks were forced to work on last night 's contest together .
the broadcasters each sent a journalist - two from private and two from public stations - which proved to be an unwieldy formation for keeping the politicians on topic and under control .
often merkel and schröder would ignore a question in order to spend minutes attacking the last statement from the opponent .
with fewer moderators they might have been less shy about cutting the candidates off or being more aggressive with their questioning .
debating in parliament some german commentators have lamented that the televised debates are part of the " americanization " of german politics , where style trumps substance .
i 'm not sure i totally agree with that assessment , but one does have to question whether such contests are superfluous in a parliamentary democracy .
unlike america where presidential candidate otherwise never have to face each other directly , parliamentary leaders constantly debate one another in germany .
later this week , just days after sunday 's tv duel , both schröder and merkel will take to the floor of the bundestag for a bit of rhetorical thrust and parry .
schröder will have to remain in top form if he hopes to gain any momentum in the final two weeks of the campaign .

schröder still upbeat for most of the debate , schröder seemed comfortable to take the high road , although he did repeatedly slam merkel 's intended finance minister , paul kirchhof .
arguably the best line of the contest was his jab that people would be turned into " guinea pigs " if kirchhof implemented his plans for a flat tax of 25 percent .
and you 've got to admire how the man can still come off as so confident despite trailing his opponent so badly .
maybe it 's just that he 's looking forward to spending more time on vacation in tuscany next year .
bildunterschrift : the biggest losers of the evening were clearly the debate moderators .
after merkel rejected having a second tv duel on the laughable grounds there was n't enough time before the sept .
18 election , germany 's four main networks were forced to work on last night 's contest together .
the broadcasters each sent a journalist - two from private and two from public stations - which proved to be an unwieldy formation for keeping the politicians on topic and under control .
often merkel and schröder would ignore a question in order to spend minutes attacking the last statement from the opponent .
with fewer moderators they might have been less shy about cutting the candidates off or being more aggressive with their questioning .
debating in parliament some german commentators have lamented that the televised debates are part of the " americanization " of german politics , where style trumps substance .
i 'm not sure i totally agree with that assessment , but one does have to question whether such contests are superfluous in a parliamentary democracy .
unlike america where presidential candidate otherwise never have to face each other directly , parliamentary leaders constantly debate one another in germany .
later this week , just days after sunday 's tv duel , both schröder and merkel will take to the floor of the bundestag for a bit of rhetorical thrust and parry .
schröder will have to remain in top form if he hopes to gain any momentum in the final two weeks of the campaign .
merkel , on the other hand , may have the bar set just a tad bit higher after her solid debate performance . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sparks fly in german election tv debate two weeks ahead of national elections , german chancellor gerhard schröder and his conservative challenger , angela merkel , met for a tv debate sunday .
they largely focused on domestic rather than foreign policy issues .

at one point during the talks , bo stormed out of the meeting late sunday , but discussions apparently continued as lower-level officials shuffled messages back and forth . millions of chinese textile items including sweaters , pants , blouses , t-shirts , bras , and tons of flax yarn were impounded in european ports because they exceeded import quotas agreed to by both sides in june . the backlog stems from goods that were already in transit when the two sides reached an accord in june to limit imports of chinese textiles .

" today , our trade commissioner -lrb- peter -rrb- mandelson and -lrb- chinese commerce -rrb- minister bo xilai ... made it possible to have an agreement for an equitable way to share the burden of unlicensed goods blocked in our ports , " he told a press conference . " once again , we have shown ... that it is possible when there is real good will to achieve the objectives and priorities to solve all issues between china and the european union , " barroso said . any deal between the eu and china must be accepted by all 25 eu member states . grueling talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade commissioner peter mandelson -lrb- right -rrb- , with the chinese minister of commerce bo xilai negotiations between mandelson and bo started in beijing on sunday , a day ahead of the eu-china summit , and continued through the night into monday .
at one point during the talks , bo stormed out of the meeting late sunday , but discussions apparently continued as lower-level officials shuffled messages back and forth . millions of chinese textile items including sweaters , pants , blouses , t-shirts , bras , and tons of flax yarn were impounded in european ports because they exceeded import quotas agreed to by both sides in june . the backlog stems from goods that were already in transit when the two sides reached an accord in june to limit imports of chinese textiles .
there was also a surge in orders immediately after that deal was announced . a logistical nightmare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the eu-chinese deal , fashion has won back its freedom calling the june agreement " robust , " barroso said that a sudden surge in orders and shipments had " frankly overwhelmed administrative arrangements . " releasing the blocked products should save european importers hundreds of millions of dollars in orders and other costly shipping and storage fees . china shipped more than 300 million sweaters to europe so far this year , compared to about 40 million last year . the surge in textiles started after a global multi-fiber textile quota system was abolished in line with world trade organization guidelines to liberalize the garment trade on jan .
1 . china has opposed efforts from the eu and the united states to block the surge of textiles as moves against free trade but wto guidelines allow for re-implementation of quotas on a limited basis if such sharp increases are deemed " destabilizing " to importing countries . bolstering eu-chinese relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's prime minister tony blair -lrb- left -rrb- greeted by china 's president hu jintao at the great hall of the people in beijing british prime minister tony blair , who is attending the eu-china summit as head of the rotating eu presidency , said monday that strong relations between the eu and china were " immensely important . " " the strategic partnership between china and the european union is of immense importance , not just in terms of trade and the economy , but also in terms of our cooperation in all the major political issues the world faces , " he said in a meeting with chinese president hu jintao . blair 's spokesman said that on top of the usual trade-focused agenda , global political and security issues had been added in the wake of the terrorist bombings in london which left 56 people dead in july .
human rights issues would also be discussed . despite disagreements on issues including europe 's embargo on arms sales to china and its refusal to grant beijing market economy status , hu agreed that building understanding was crucial . " regular meetings between china and the european union are good for enhancing our mutual understanding and are also good for mutual beneficial cooperation and moving forward our comprehensive strategic partnership , " he told blair . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de china wants eu to increase textile quotas beijing and brussels were set to begin trade negotiations over booming chinese textile exports with china expecting the eu to capitulate and increase import quotas , according to chinese sources on wednesday .

the higher gas prices mean that demand for more fuel-efficient cars with smaller engines should rise .
in the run up to the iaa international motor show in frankfurt -lrb- sept.15-25 -rrb- , car manufacturers are increasingly talking about alternative or hybrid engines ; cleaner diesel , biomass and hydrogen-power are the current buzzwords . getting aboard the hybrid train bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toyota motor corp. executives masatami takimoto , left , and hiroyuki watanabe pose with a model of the hybrid prius sedan .
when it comes to hybrid engines - a combination electrical and conventional combustion engine - german carmakers could find themselves playing catch-up for the next few years .
japanese manufacturer toyota has had great success with its prius hybrid in the us , and is now looking towards the growing market in china for even more profits .
the company is planning 10 new models with hybrid engines . sales of hybrids in europe have lagged far behind the us and japan , ferdinand düdenhoffer , director of the center for automotive research in gelsenkirchen told the süddeutsche zeitung .
" one reason for that is the strength of diesel engines , which are hardly present in the us and japanese car markets , " he said .
the other reason is the lack of hybrid models from european carmakers . europe 's largest carmaker , volkswagen , is reportedly looking for a partnership with porsche , which hopes to display its progress in hybrid technology at the iaa . however , scepticism towards hybrids remains in germany .
" the hybrid motor is a little bit overrated , " said automotive industry analyst willi diez .
" it does n't use that much less gas than the modern diesel engines that german manufacturers have been instrumental in developing and promoting . " even if demand for hybrids remains sluggish in europe , it will be essential for german carmakers to get up to speed with hybrid technology if they want a part of the market in north america and asia . " german producers have to act quickly now to regain lost ground , " diez said . hydrogen the fuel of the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists surround the new hydrogen-fuel powered bmw h2r car at the 2004 mondial de l 'automobile motor show in paris , thursday 23 september 2004 .
volkswagen is looking further afield for alternative engine concepts , betting on synthetically produced fuels from biomass for the medium-term .
in the long-term , however , german manufacturers are interested in the promise of hydrogen-powered cars , even if advancements in this area have been slower than anticipated . " we 'll almost certainly have to wait for about 20 years -lrb- for the first marketable hydrogen car -rrb- , " said a vw spokesperson .
in the meantime , the company is developing its hydrogen technology with its touran hymotion prototype - a car with an electric motor that draws its power from a fuel cell . mercedes has 180 patents pending in the area of fuel cell technology , and bmw is racing ahead with its h2r hydrogen-powered prototype . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de katrina could swamp german economy germany 's economy minister has said he fears hurricane katrina , which has devastated the southern us coast , could lead to a further rise in oil prices and dampen already weak domestic spending in germany .

the higher gas prices mean that demand for more fuel-efficient cars with smaller engines should rise .
in the run up to the iaa international motor show in frankfurt -lrb- sept.15-25 -rrb- , car manufacturers are increasingly talking about alternative or hybrid engines ; cleaner diesel , biomass and hydrogen-power are the current buzzwords . getting aboard the hybrid train bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toyota motor corp. executives masatami takimoto , left , and hiroyuki watanabe pose with a model of the hybrid prius sedan .
when it comes to hybrid engines - a combination electrical and conventional combustion engine - german carmakers could find themselves playing catch-up for the next few years .
japanese manufacturer toyota has had great success with its prius hybrid in the us , and is now looking towards the growing market in china for even more profits .
the company is planning 10 new models with hybrid engines . sales of hybrids in europe have lagged far behind the us and japan , ferdinand düdenhoffer , director of the center for automotive research in gelsenkirchen told the süddeutsche zeitung .
" one reason for that is the strength of diesel engines , which are hardly present in the us and japanese car markets , " he said .
the other reason is the lack of hybrid models from european carmakers . europe 's largest carmaker , volkswagen , is reportedly looking for a partnership with porsche , which hopes to display its progress in hybrid technology at the iaa . however , scepticism towards hybrids remains in germany .
" the hybrid motor is a little bit overrated , " said automotive industry analyst willi diez .
" it does n't use that much less gas than the modern diesel engines that german manufacturers have been instrumental in developing and promoting . " even if demand for hybrids remains sluggish in europe , it will be essential for german carmakers to get up to speed with hybrid technology if they want a part of the market in north america and asia . " german producers have to act quickly now to regain lost ground , " diez said . hydrogen the fuel of the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists surround the new hydrogen-fuel powered bmw h2r car at the 2004 mondial de l 'automobile motor show in paris , thursday 23 september 2004 .
volkswagen is looking further afield for alternative engine concepts , betting on synthetically produced fuels from biomass for the medium-term .
in the long-term , however , german manufacturers are interested in the promise of hydrogen-powered cars , even if advancements in this area have been slower than anticipated . " we 'll almost certainly have to wait for about 20 years -lrb- for the first marketable hydrogen car -rrb- , " said a vw spokesperson .
in the meantime , the company is developing its hydrogen technology with its touran hymotion prototype - a car with an electric motor that draws its power from a fuel cell . mercedes has 180 patents pending in the area of fuel cell technology , and bmw is racing ahead with its h2r hydrogen-powered prototype . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de katrina could swamp german economy germany 's economy minister has said he fears hurricane katrina , which has devastated the southern us coast , could lead to a further rise in oil prices and dampen already weak domestic spending in germany .

interior minister otto schily and the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- are trying to get a grip on the violence . german soccer managed an ignominious double on saturday in bratislava .
on the pitch , the team around coach jürgen klinsmann embarrassed themselves by losing 2-0 to slovakia , currently the 45th ranked team in the world .
to pour salt in the wound of german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- officials and interior minister otto schily , who was present , german hooligans again ran amok off the pitch , albeit not to the extent they did at a friendly in slovenia in march .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenian police forces clash with german fans in march friendly in celje six people were injured and two were taken into custody after a troop of hooligans who had made the trip to bratislava did battle with slovakian police .
the dfb apologized for the behavior of the fans who during the match also screamed scandalous chants such as " foreigners out " and " we 've marched in again , " in reference to nazi germany 's occupation of then czechoslovakia .
" that does not give a good image of germans abroad , " commented dfb team manager oliver bierhoff .
the incident was especially discouraging to organizers since german police and the dfb had worked closely with slovak security officials before the match to prevent a repeat of the ugly riots in celje in march .
small allotment of tickets for germans the match between the two sides attracted little attention amongst soccer fans in slovakia .
only 9,000 viewers attended the game at sk slovan stadium , which holds over 30,000 .
the dfb had sold 560 tickets through the national fan club as a measure to control just who would accompany the squad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior and sports minister otto schily -lrb- l -rrb- and german soccer legend and head of the organizing comitee for the world cup 2006 franz beckenbauer hooligans made the journey anyway and got their hands on tickets from slovak acquaintances .
" we do our best , but in another country it 's difficult to control the situation , " said bierhoff .
interior minister otto schily appeared vindicated in the comments he had made ahead of the match when he said that tighter police cooperation , which slovenian authorities had refused , would prevent any violence .
world cup security in question ?
in pure provocation towards the minister who has organized security measures so far in the run-up to the world cup next year , hooligans chanted " we all have stadium bans , " and " otto , we 're here anyway , " during the game .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dfb president theo zwanziger schily may be out of office should the social democrats do poorly in the sept .
18 general election .
yet , no matter which minister leads security measures in germany when the world cup kicks off in june 2006 , the dfb wants to see violent supporters prevented from carrying out their agenda at world cup cities .
it will be easier to control hooligans from getting to the stadiums , said dfb president theo zwanziger , but in public squares where games will be shown on large-screens , they must separated from peaceful soccer fans .
" we need a clear police presence , but it must n't be conspicuous .
it is supposed to be a peaceful party , " he said in german sports television dsf . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de klinsi 's boys belittled in bratislava jürgen klinsmann 's national squad put on a poor display of abilities saturday , suffering a humiliating 2-0 defeat against slovakia .

" modern technology is very often distinguished by very intelligent , young , male engineers , who are right-handed , developing something that they can , not necessarily that people need , " said ernst pöppel of the institute for generational research in bad tölz .
" and we try to give an indication that you can develop non-strenuous intuitive technologies . " among other things , pöppel and his colleagues at the university 's institute explore the possibilities of developing cars and mobile phones that can be easily used without reading a thick instruction manual first .
the researchers have already designed a simple cd player for dementia patients , who often find they can no longer operate modern devices . the roughly 15-centimeter -lrb- six-inch -rrb- tall cubes , or tölz dice , as they are called , have a different color on each of their six sides .
after being programmed , the dice play music according to whichever side they are resting on - without any buttons or knobs to press .
the dice could soon go into production .
changing with age bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the bad tölz research projects involves examining to what extent people 's hearing changes with age . one hundred test people of all ages took part in one study to determine whether seniors are worse at recognizing different frequencies and sequences of tones worse than younger people . psychologist jan churan 's research is similar but uses optical signals .
he discovered that people 's ability to recognize acoustic stimuli tends to remain constant as they age , but from age 60 recognizing visual stimuli becomes slightly worse . " we have n't been able to observe any dramatic collapse , " he said . the bad tölz academics have also been exploring new media formats and are currently developing year-long courses fur those above 60 who want to be kept abreast of what 's happening in the academic world beyond the pages of newspapers or the evening television news .

a germany without children ?
germany is waking up to the fact that a demographic revolution is underway .
not only are people living longer , but germans are having fewer babies , meaning the population is both shrinking and ageing .

the chancellor came across as a more trustworthy candidate , winning 39 percent of votes in this category against his challenger , who gained only 18 percent .
the tv viewers also clearly decided that the relaxed and confident schröder , who is known in germany as " media chancellor , " presented himself as a more likeable character . yet when it came to the single most important election issue - the question of the staggering unemployment rate in germany - the polls have shown that 35 percent of the viewers believed merkel was better fit to solve the problem of unemployment in germany .

political commentaries and the mass media play an important part in shaping public opinion . " a candidate could read the phone book to their supporters and the supporters would still see their candidate as the winner , " said faas . the group of voters that is most likely to be influenced by the debate are the so-called undecided - those who started watching the debate without a clear preference for either of the two candidates . according to the polls , 56 percent of the undecided found chancellor schröder convincing , whereas only 19 percent of the undecided voters were convinced by merkel .

but nobody really expected anything less from the man widely know as germany 's " media chancellor , " and though he did well , it would foolish to think his tv presence could single-handedly get him re-elected .
john kerry solidly beat us president george bush in three separate debates last year , but he still could n't defeat him at the polls when november rolled around .
that 's because bush is such a horrible speaker that he came through unscathed simply because no one imagined he 'd be able to string together a coherent argument .
merkel , similarly to bush , was playing a game of managing expectations .
she herself had set the bar low with several prominent gaffes on the campaign trail .
but on sunday she put in a respectable performance , showing none of her previous unsteadiness .
aside from looking a little uncomfortable at the start of the debate , merkel quickly gained her footing .
she was very pugnacious and did not shrink from repeatedly addressing and attacking schröder directly .
by not putting in a disastrous appearance , her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- can now be expected to hold onto their sizable lead in the polls over schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
schröder still upbeat for most of the debate , schröder seemed comfortable to take the high road , although he did repeatedly slam merkel 's intended finance minister , paul kirchhof .
arguably the best line of the contest was his jab that people would be turned into " guinea pigs " if kirchhof implemented his plans for a flat tax of 25 percent .
and you 've got to admire how the man can still come off as so confident despite trailing his opponent so badly .
maybe it 's just that he 's looking forward to spending more time on vacation in tuscany next year .

18 election , germany 's four main networks were forced to work on last night 's contest together .
the broadcasters each sent a journalist - two from private and two from public stations - which proved to be an unwieldy formation for keeping the politicians on topic and under control .
often merkel and schröder would ignore a question in order to spend minutes attacking the last statement from the opponent .
with fewer moderators they might have been less shy about cutting the candidates off or being more aggressive with their questioning .
debating in parliament some german commentators have lamented that the televised debates are part of the " americanization " of german politics , where style trumps substance .
i 'm not sure i totally agree with that assessment , but one does have to question whether such contests are superfluous in a parliamentary democracy .
unlike america where presidential candidate otherwise never have to face each other directly , parliamentary leaders constantly debate one another in germany .
later this week , just days after sunday 's tv duel , both schröder and merkel will take to the floor of the bundestag for a bit of rhetorical thrust and parry .

" today , our trade commissioner -lrb- peter -rrb- mandelson and -lrb- chinese commerce -rrb- minister bo xilai ... made it possible to have an agreement for an equitable way to share the burden of unlicensed goods blocked in our ports , " he told a press conference .

at one point during the talks , bo stormed out of the meeting late sunday , but discussions apparently continued as lower-level officials shuffled messages back and forth . millions of chinese textile items including sweaters , pants , blouses , t-shirts , bras , and tons of flax yarn were impounded in european ports because they exceeded import quotas agreed to by both sides in june . the backlog stems from goods that were already in transit when the two sides reached an accord in june to limit imports of chinese textiles .

human rights issues would also be discussed . despite disagreements on issues including europe 's embargo on arms sales to china and its refusal to grant beijing market economy status , hu agreed that building understanding was crucial .

" today , our trade commissioner -lrb- peter -rrb- mandelson and -lrb- chinese commerce -rrb- minister bo xilai ... made it possible to have an agreement for an equitable way to share the burden of unlicensed goods blocked in our ports , " he told a press conference . " once again , we have shown ... that it is possible when there is real good will to achieve the objectives and priorities to solve all issues between china and the european union , " barroso said . any deal between the eu and china must be accepted by all 25 eu member states . grueling talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade commissioner peter mandelson -lrb- right -rrb- , with the chinese minister of commerce bo xilai negotiations between mandelson and bo started in beijing on sunday , a day ahead of the eu-china summit , and continued through the night into monday .
at one point during the talks , bo stormed out of the meeting late sunday , but discussions apparently continued as lower-level officials shuffled messages back and forth . millions of chinese textile items including sweaters , pants , blouses , t-shirts , bras , and tons of flax yarn were impounded in european ports because they exceeded import quotas agreed to by both sides in june . the backlog stems from goods that were already in transit when the two sides reached an accord in june to limit imports of chinese textiles .
there was also a surge in orders immediately after that deal was announced . a logistical nightmare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the eu-chinese deal , fashion has won back its freedom calling the june agreement " robust , " barroso said that a sudden surge in orders and shipments had " frankly overwhelmed administrative arrangements . " releasing the blocked products should save european importers hundreds of millions of dollars in orders and other costly shipping and storage fees . china shipped more than 300 million sweaters to europe so far this year , compared to about 40 million last year . the surge in textiles started after a global multi-fiber textile quota system was abolished in line with world trade organization guidelines to liberalize the garment trade on jan .
1 . china has opposed efforts from the eu and the united states to block the surge of textiles as moves against free trade but wto guidelines allow for re-implementation of quotas on a limited basis if such sharp increases are deemed " destabilizing " to importing countries . bolstering eu-chinese relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's prime minister tony blair -lrb- left -rrb- greeted by china 's president hu jintao at the great hall of the people in beijing british prime minister tony blair , who is attending the eu-china summit as head of the rotating eu presidency , said monday that strong relations between the eu and china were " immensely important . " " the strategic partnership between china and the european union is of immense importance , not just in terms of trade and the economy , but also in terms of our cooperation in all the major political issues the world faces , " he said in a meeting with chinese president hu jintao . blair 's spokesman said that on top of the usual trade-focused agenda , global political and security issues had been added in the wake of the terrorist bombings in london which left 56 people dead in july .
human rights issues would also be discussed . despite disagreements on issues including europe 's embargo on arms sales to china and its refusal to grant beijing market economy status , hu agreed that building understanding was crucial . " regular meetings between china and the european union are good for enhancing our mutual understanding and are also good for mutual beneficial cooperation and moving forward our comprehensive strategic partnership , " he told blair . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de china wants eu to increase textile quotas beijing and brussels were set to begin trade negotiations over booming chinese textile exports with china expecting the eu to capitulate and increase import quotas , according to chinese sources on wednesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : election editorials : dw 's take opinion : dissolving the doubt opinion : greens must learn to let go the german fear of reform opinion : germany left behind europe -pipe- 05.09.2005 opinion : germany 's debatable impact großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder was expected to beat angela merkel german chancellor gerhard schröder may have won sunday 's televised debate with angela merkel , but the gaffe-prone leader of the conservative opposition might be the night 's real winner , says dw-world 's marc young . confident .
relaxed .
statesman-like .
gerhard schröder cut a strong figure in the election 's only one-on-one televised debate between the two candidates for chancellor .
but nobody really expected anything less from the man widely know as germany 's " media chancellor , " and though he did well , it would foolish to think his tv presence could single-handedly get him re-elected .
john kerry solidly beat us president george bush in three separate debates last year , but he still could n't defeat him at the polls when november rolled around .
that 's because bush is such a horrible speaker that he came through unscathed simply because no one imagined he 'd be able to string together a coherent argument .
merkel , similarly to bush , was playing a game of managing expectations .
she herself had set the bar low with several prominent gaffes on the campaign trail .
but on sunday she put in a respectable performance , showing none of her previous unsteadiness .
aside from looking a little uncomfortable at the start of the debate , merkel quickly gained her footing .
she was very pugnacious and did not shrink from repeatedly addressing and attacking schröder directly .
by not putting in a disastrous appearance , her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- can now be expected to hold onto their sizable lead in the polls over schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
schröder still upbeat for most of the debate , schröder seemed comfortable to take the high road , although he did repeatedly slam merkel 's intended finance minister , paul kirchhof .
arguably the best line of the contest was his jab that people would be turned into " guinea pigs " if kirchhof implemented his plans for a flat tax of 25 percent .
and you 've got to admire how the man can still come off as so confident despite trailing his opponent so badly .
maybe it 's just that he 's looking forward to spending more time on vacation in tuscany next year .
bildunterschrift : the biggest losers of the evening were clearly the debate moderators .
after merkel rejected having a second tv duel on the laughable grounds there was n't enough time before the sept .
18 election , germany 's four main networks were forced to work on last night 's contest together .
the broadcasters each sent a journalist - two from private and two from public stations - which proved to be an unwieldy formation for keeping the politicians on topic and under control .
often merkel and schröder would ignore a question in order to spend minutes attacking the last statement from the opponent .
with fewer moderators they might have been less shy about cutting the candidates off or being more aggressive with their questioning .
debating in parliament some german commentators have lamented that the televised debates are part of the " americanization " of german politics , where style trumps substance .
i 'm not sure i totally agree with that assessment , but one does have to question whether such contests are superfluous in a parliamentary democracy .
unlike america where presidential candidate otherwise never have to face each other directly , parliamentary leaders constantly debate one another in germany .
later this week , just days after sunday 's tv duel , both schröder and merkel will take to the floor of the bundestag for a bit of rhetorical thrust and parry .
schröder will have to remain in top form if he hopes to gain any momentum in the final two weeks of the campaign .
merkel , on the other hand , may have the bar set just a tad bit higher after her solid debate performance . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sparks fly in german election tv debate two weeks ahead of national elections , german chancellor gerhard schröder and his conservative challenger , angela merkel , met for a tv debate sunday .

the higher gas prices mean that demand for more fuel-efficient cars with smaller engines should rise .

when it comes to hybrid engines - a combination electrical and conventional combustion engine - german carmakers could find themselves playing catch-up for the next few years .
japanese manufacturer toyota has had great success with its prius hybrid in the us , and is now looking towards the growing market in china for even more profits .
the company is planning 10 new models with hybrid engines . sales of hybrids in europe have lagged far behind the us and japan , ferdinand düdenhoffer , director of the center for automotive research in gelsenkirchen told the süddeutsche zeitung .
" one reason for that is the strength of diesel engines , which are hardly present in the us and japanese car markets , " he said .
the other reason is the lack of hybrid models from european carmakers . europe 's largest carmaker , volkswagen , is reportedly looking for a partnership with porsche , which hopes to display its progress in hybrid technology at the iaa . however , scepticism towards hybrids remains in germany .
" the hybrid motor is a little bit overrated , " said automotive industry analyst willi diez .
" it does n't use that much less gas than the modern diesel engines that german manufacturers have been instrumental in developing and promoting . " even if demand for hybrids remains sluggish in europe , it will be essential for german carmakers to get up to speed with hybrid technology if they want a part of the market in north america and asia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 05.09.2005 german press says schröder won großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the media said the chancellor was more impressive in the debate newspaper editors were almost unanimous that chancellor schröder won sunday 's long-awaited debate against challenger angela merkel .
yet most were disappointed by the attention to detail or simply the lack of new data . berlin 's tagesspiegel commented that the importance of the televised debate , in part due to the four journalists who asked the questions , was over-dramatized .
the two " combatants , " as one inquisitor stated it , were not dead on the floor in the end .
both chancellor gerhard schröder and his challenger angela merkel made a few mistakes in the beginning , yet what was most important really was n't what they said , but the impression they made .
both had their moments but as they missed the mark at times - when schröder said he loves his wife or merkel commented that schröder once referred to teachers as a lot of " lazy bums " - and viewers were distracted from the real purpose .
not until the end did the debate become interesting .
the chancellor was more to the point , leaving merkel look " pale " over the issue of president bush 's us response to katrina .
schröder may have won , but seeing as that was expected , the victory did n't look so good .
germany 's largest tabloid , bild , tipped its hat to the two candidates : chancellor schröder knows that he can no longer win and thus defended his seven years in office ; merkel , the challenger , wants to reform germany and all the polls show she will be assuming the post as german chancellor .
" it was a debate of past versus future .
as of sunday evening we know this : there are not only elections on september 18 , there is also a choice between two true alternatives . "
bild noted that schröder and merkel are two notable politicians who have two very different paths planned for germany - the status quo to maintain societal equilibrium , or bigger reforms to prevent the country from dropping down into the third division .
angela merkel came over stronger than expected in the only one-one-one televised debate with gerhard schröder , wrote the leipziger volkszeitung .
but to two-thirds of the german people it was obvious entering the debate that the chancellor would look better .
schröder , however , faced a tough task , since the bar was set higher for him to start with ; only if his challenger had made grave mistakes , would she leave the set a loser .
but merkel stuck to central topics , like employment , budget , taxes and pensions , expressed herself competently and even made attacks on schröder , leaving little space for him to win points .
it was a familiar model : if the favorite only just barely wins , the presumed loser can feel victorious , the paper wrote .
bildunterschrift : the candidates and inquisitors : questions lacked punch , answers lacked new content the tv debate lacked excitement .
some murder mysteries are more thrilling than the verbal duel between angela merkel and gerhard schröder on sunday , wrote the südkurier from constance .
the four networks broadcasting the debate had built up the viewers ' expectations so much that people thought this would decide the election .
" baloney - we did n't find out anything new . "
the two stuck to their positions on the topics of the labor market , taxes and gasoline prices .
the chancellor had fun , almost to the point of arrogance .
on the other hand , people could tell that the debate was work for merkel , but she rubbed schröder 's nose in the failures of his government .
whoever was expecting a clear victory for schröder was disappointed .
two things stuck in the minds of the editors of the berliner zeitung : the downfall of german television and gerhard schröder 's declaration that he loved his wife .
the duel was no duel , the daily wrote .
it was even a low point in the history of german television , as four networks simultaneously broadcast the debate .
neither the candidates nor the television networks had a program .
the four journalists propagated the poor show by asking questions that any " school kid could have answered for the candidates by reading the newspapers . "
if the weakness of german politics lies in leaders talking about how they will get the country out of its troubles without explaining the causes and without naming the goals , then this debate was a demonstration of just that . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sparks fly in german election tv debate two weeks ahead of national elections , german chancellor gerhard schröder and his conservative challenger , angela merkel , met for a tv debate sunday .
they largely focused on domestic rather than foreign policy issues .

yet most were disappointed by the attention to detail or simply the lack of new data . berlin 's tagesspiegel commented that the importance of the televised debate , in part due to the four journalists who asked the questions , was over-dramatized .
the two " combatants , " as one inquisitor stated it , were not dead on the floor in the end .
both chancellor gerhard schröder and his challenger angela merkel made a few mistakes in the beginning , yet what was most important really was n't what they said , but the impression they made .
both had their moments but as they missed the mark at times - when schröder said he loves his wife or merkel commented that schröder once referred to teachers as a lot of " lazy bums " - and viewers were distracted from the real purpose .
not until the end did the debate become interesting .
the chancellor was more to the point , leaving merkel look " pale " over the issue of president bush 's us response to katrina .
schröder may have won , but seeing as that was expected , the victory did n't look so good .
germany 's largest tabloid , bild , tipped its hat to the two candidates : chancellor schröder knows that he can no longer win and thus defended his seven years in office ; merkel , the challenger , wants to reform germany and all the polls show she will be assuming the post as german chancellor .
" it was a debate of past versus future .
as of sunday evening we know this : there are not only elections on september 18 , there is also a choice between two true alternatives . "
bild noted that schröder and merkel are two notable politicians who have two very different paths planned for germany - the status quo to maintain societal equilibrium , or bigger reforms to prevent the country from dropping down into the third division .
angela merkel came over stronger than expected in the only one-one-one televised debate with gerhard schröder , wrote the leipziger volkszeitung .
but to two-thirds of the german people it was obvious entering the debate that the chancellor would look better .
schröder , however , faced a tough task , since the bar was set higher for him to start with ; only if his challenger had made grave mistakes , would she leave the set a loser .
but merkel stuck to central topics , like employment , budget , taxes and pensions , expressed herself competently and even made attacks on schröder , leaving little space for him to win points .
it was a familiar model : if the favorite only just barely wins , the presumed loser can feel victorious , the paper wrote .
bildunterschrift : the candidates and inquisitors : questions lacked punch , answers lacked new content the tv debate lacked excitement .
some murder mysteries are more thrilling than the verbal duel between angela merkel and gerhard schröder on sunday , wrote the südkurier from constance .
the four networks broadcasting the debate had built up the viewers ' expectations so much that people thought this would decide the election .
" baloney - we did n't find out anything new . "
the two stuck to their positions on the topics of the labor market , taxes and gasoline prices .
the chancellor had fun , almost to the point of arrogance .
on the other hand , people could tell that the debate was work for merkel , but she rubbed schröder 's nose in the failures of his government .
whoever was expecting a clear victory for schröder was disappointed .
two things stuck in the minds of the editors of the berliner zeitung : the downfall of german television and gerhard schröder 's declaration that he loved his wife .

the four journalists propagated the poor show by asking questions that any " school kid could have answered for the candidates by reading the newspapers . "

the chancellor came across as a more trustworthy candidate , winning 39 percent of votes in this category against his challenger , who gained only 18 percent .
the tv viewers also clearly decided that the relaxed and confident schröder , who is known in germany as " media chancellor , " presented himself as a more likeable character . yet when it came to the single most important election issue - the question of the staggering unemployment rate in germany - the polls have shown that 35 percent of the viewers believed merkel was better fit to solve the problem of unemployment in germany .
only 10 percent of the viewers expressed their confidence in schröder 's competence on this point . it 's not over till it 's over bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it has been described as the " tv event of the year " according to political scientist thorsten faas from the university of duisburg , the viewers ' assessment of the debate could still change in the following days .
political commentaries and the mass media play an important part in shaping public opinion . " a candidate could read the phone book to their supporters and the supporters would still see their candidate as the winner , " said faas . the group of voters that is most likely to be influenced by the debate are the so-called undecided - those who started watching the debate without a clear preference for either of the two candidates . according to the polls , 56 percent of the undecided found chancellor schröder convincing , whereas only 19 percent of the undecided voters were convinced by merkel .
when asked whether the debate would help them make their decision , 46 percent of the undecided said ' yes , ' whereas 52 percent said ' no .

it will be easier to control hooligans from getting to the stadiums , said dfb president theo zwanziger , but in public squares where games will be shown on large-screens , they must separated from peaceful soccer fans .

relaxed .
statesman-like .
gerhard schröder cut a strong figure in the election 's only one-on-one televised debate between the two candidates for chancellor .
but nobody really expected anything less from the man widely know as germany 's " media chancellor , " and though he did well , it would foolish to think his tv presence could single-handedly get him re-elected .
john kerry solidly beat us president george bush in three separate debates last year , but he still could n't defeat him at the polls when november rolled around .
that 's because bush is such a horrible speaker that he came through unscathed simply because no one imagined he 'd be able to string together a coherent argument .
merkel , similarly to bush , was playing a game of managing expectations .
she herself had set the bar low with several prominent gaffes on the campaign trail .
but on sunday she put in a respectable performance , showing none of her previous unsteadiness .
aside from looking a little uncomfortable at the start of the debate , merkel quickly gained her footing .
she was very pugnacious and did not shrink from repeatedly addressing and attacking schröder directly .
by not putting in a disastrous appearance , her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- can now be expected to hold onto their sizable lead in the polls over schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
schröder still upbeat for most of the debate , schröder seemed comfortable to take the high road , although he did repeatedly slam merkel 's intended finance minister , paul kirchhof .
arguably the best line of the contest was his jab that people would be turned into " guinea pigs " if kirchhof implemented his plans for a flat tax of 25 percent .
and you 've got to admire how the man can still come off as so confident despite trailing his opponent so badly .
maybe it 's just that he 's looking forward to spending more time on vacation in tuscany next year .
bildunterschrift : the biggest losers of the evening were clearly the debate moderators .
after merkel rejected having a second tv duel on the laughable grounds there was n't enough time before the sept .
18 election , germany 's four main networks were forced to work on last night 's contest together .
the broadcasters each sent a journalist - two from private and two from public stations - which proved to be an unwieldy formation for keeping the politicians on topic and under control .
often merkel and schröder would ignore a question in order to spend minutes attacking the last statement from the opponent .
with fewer moderators they might have been less shy about cutting the candidates off or being more aggressive with their questioning .
debating in parliament some german commentators have lamented that the televised debates are part of the " americanization " of german politics , where style trumps substance .
i 'm not sure i totally agree with that assessment , but one does have to question whether such contests are superfluous in a parliamentary democracy .
unlike america where presidential candidate otherwise never have to face each other directly , parliamentary leaders constantly debate one another in germany .
later this week , just days after sunday 's tv duel , both schröder and merkel will take to the floor of the bundestag for a bit of rhetorical thrust and parry .
schröder will have to remain in top form if he hopes to gain any momentum in the final two weeks of the campaign .

more than 75 million garments - including jumpers , t-shirts , blouses and bras - are being held up in european seaports because they exceed quotas on chinese textile imports set by the eu in june .
meanwhile , chinese officials failed to reach agreement with us negotiators in beijing in talks over quotas for 20 categories of chinese textiles .
retailers from both continents are warning of shortages and inflated prices in shops this autumn if quotas remain in place .
as things stand , quotas will remain in place until 2008 , when they must end according to the rules of the world trade organisation .
the alternative route in the meantime , retailers are finding clever ways to get garments out of china .
the most popular is through hong kong , which remains quota free . "
" made in hong kong " is big business and it 's growing " william connor , connor associates chief executive a growing number of retailers from the us and europe are placing orders with hong kong manufacturers who are then outsourcing production to the mainland via an agreement known as the outward processing arrangement -lrb- opa -rrb- .
the agreement states that hong kong manufacturers can subcontract subsidiary and finishing processes to mainland factories as long as the " major transformation " of the garment takes place in hong kong .
what this means in practice is that 90 % of the work can be done on the mainland .
finishing touches the tal group is one of hong kong 's largest clothing manufacturers .
the company has a small production facility employing 400 staff in hong kong .
their main facility is over the border in the mainland city of dongguan , the heartland of china 's textile industry .
there , the company employs 4,500 mainlanders .
the dongguan factory cuts , hems and sews buttons or zips into the material before sending it to hong kong .
in the case of a shirt , all the hong kong factory then needs to do is sew four seams connecting the pieces together before sending it back to dongguan for finishing , washing , ironing and packing .
" producing this way costs roughly 35 % to 40 % more than if we make everything directly in china , " says the managing director of the tal group and vice chairman of the hong kong textile council , dr harry lee .
" but cost-wise it is comparable to places like thailand or indonesia and production in hong kong has the added perception of quality for consumers in the us and europe . "
growing market the quality is good .
but consumers are paying more for the fact that these are some of the best travelled shirts you are likely to find .
a single garment might travel up to six times across the border before it is finally shipped to the us or europe .
an estimated 2,000 hong kong companies are shipping goods back and forth in this way .
a business that , according to textile traders , is now worth as much as business conducted direct with mainland china .
" about half of our $ 400m textile sourcing business through the hong kong office is garments with " made in hong kong " labels that are produced under the cross-border arrangement with the mainland , " says william connor , chief executive of connor associates , one of hong kong 's leading textile traders .
" the other half are ' made in china ' garments sourced directly from the mainland at a lower cost .
so as you can see ' made in hong kong ' is big business and it 's growing .
" if you want to source from china in the latter part of this year you are going to have to resort to this cross-border arrangement or go elsewhere because quotas for the year are already full . "
the system adds costs for retailers and , by keeping jobs in china , appears to do nothing to safeguard jobs in europe or us .
the process is complicated , time consuming and costly , but as long as quotas remain in place its popularity as a tool for sourcing from china is likely to grow .

more than 75 million garments - including jumpers , t-shirts , blouses and bras - are being held up in european seaports because they exceed quotas on chinese textile imports set by the eu in june .
meanwhile , chinese officials failed to reach agreement with us negotiators in beijing in talks over quotas for 20 categories of chinese textiles .
retailers from both continents are warning of shortages and inflated prices in shops this autumn if quotas remain in place .
as things stand , quotas will remain in place until 2008 , when they must end according to the rules of the world trade organisation .
the alternative route in the meantime , retailers are finding clever ways to get garments out of china .
the most popular is through hong kong , which remains quota free .
" made in hong kong " is big business and it 's growing william connor , connor associates chief executive a growing number of retailers from the us and europe are placing orders with hong kong manufacturers who are then outsourcing production to the mainland via an agreement known as the outward processing arrangement -lrb- opa -rrb- .
the agreement states that hong kong manufacturers can subcontract subsidiary and finishing processes to mainland factories as long as the " major transformation " of the garment takes place in hong kong .
what this means in practice is that 90 % of the work can be done on the mainland .
finishing touches the tal group is one of hong kong 's largest clothing manufacturers .
the company has a small production facility employing 400 staff in hong kong .
their main facility is over the border in the mainland city of dongguan , the heartland of china 's textile industry .
despite the label , much of the work is still being done in china there , the company employs 4,500 mainlanders .
the dongguan factory cuts , hems and sews buttons or zips into the material before sending it to hong kong .
in the case of a shirt , all the hong kong factory then needs to do is sew four seams connecting the pieces together before sending it back to dongguan for finishing , washing , ironing and packing .
" producing this way costs roughly 35 % to 40 % more than if we make everything directly in china , " says the managing director of the tal group and vice chairman of the hong kong textile council , dr harry lee .
" but cost-wise it is comparable to places like thailand or indonesia and production in hong kong has the added perception of quality for consumers in the us and europe . "
growing market the quality is good .
but consumers are paying more for the fact that these are some of the best travelled shirts you are likely to find .
a single garment might travel up to six times across the border before it is finally shipped to the us or europe .
an estimated 2,000 hong kong companies are shipping goods back and forth in this way .
a business that , according to textile traders , is now worth as much as business conducted direct with mainland china .
" about half of our $ 400m textile sourcing business through the hong kong office is garments with " made in hong kong " labels that are produced under the cross-border arrangement with the mainland , " says william connor , chief executive of connor associates , one of hong kong 's leading textile traders .
" the other half are ' made in china ' garments sourced directly from the mainland at a lower cost .
so as you can see ' made in hong kong ' is big business and it 's growing .
" if you want to source from china in the latter part of this year you are going to have to resort to this cross-border arrangement or go elsewhere because quotas for the year are already full . "
the system adds costs for retailers and , by keeping jobs in china , appears to do nothing to safeguard jobs in europe or us .
the process is complicated , time consuming and costly , but as long as quotas remain in place its popularity as a tool for sourcing from china is likely to grow .

criminologist dr emily finch believes studying the way people disclose information is more likely to win the battle against identity theft fraudsters , she claims , are " tenacious , merely adapting " to meet the challenge of new technology .
dr finch will outline her research at the festival of science in dublin .
dr finch , a reader in law at the uea , hopes to challenge the assumption that technology-based security systems provide the solution .
" there is a worrying assumption that advances in technology will provide the solution to identity theft whereas it is possible that they may actually aggravate the problem , " she said .

he fears a backlash if science fails to deliver on some of the " hype " around the cells - as he believes may happen .
he says the notion that a host of cures for serious , degenerative disorders are just around the corner is fanciful .
however , a cambridge university stem cell researcher said he was certain the work would lead to clinical benefits .
lord winston believes some of the uncertainties need to be emphasised .
" both in britain and america , huge publicity has been given to stem cells , particularly embryonic stem cells , and the potential they offer , " he said in his presidential address to the british association 's festival science in dublin , ireland , on monday .
" of course , the study of stem cells is one of the most exciting areas in biology but i think it is unlikely that embryonic stem cells are likely to be useful in healthcare for a long time . "
embryonic doubts stem cells are the body 's " master cells " and have the ability to produce all manner of tissues - which has led science to investigate their potential to be used to replace the failed cells responsible for many conditions , such as heart disease and diabetes . "
i was concerned that parliamentarians have been convinced that it was just a matter of a few years before we would be able to transplant stem cells and cure a lot of neurological disorders " lord winston , ba president science community reaction but their desire to source some stem cells from embryos - an ethically controversial area - probably led a number of the field 's proponents to hype outcomes just to get liberal legislative approval , lord winston claims .
" i was concerned that parliamentarians - particularly in the house of commons - have been convinced that it was just a matter of a few years before we would be able to transplant stem cells and cure a lot of neurological disorders , like alzheimer 's disease , for which i think it is going to be a hugely difficult problem and probably completely insoluble by stem cells . "
lord winston said from his own lab 's work he could see there were many problems associated with embryonic stem cells that would need to be understood and resolved before they could have clinical applications .
cancer gain he points to their low cell-cycle time , leading to slow replication in culture and the fact there might be selective pressure for the faster growing , but possibly abnormal cells , to dominate a culture system . "
will there be a clinical impact ?
yes , there will be ; i 'm absolutely certain of it " roger pederson , cambridge stem cell initiative he also highlights the instability of embryonic cells in general and " their remarkable propensity to produce abnormal numbers of chromosomes " .
these and other issues , unless resolved , he says , will result in unsuccessful therapies .
lord winston does not doubt that study in this area will lead to remarkable and fundamental insights into the workings of the biological cell - and that this should have a huge knock-on effect for medicine with perhaps cancer treatments among the first to benefit .
but he says he does view " the current wave of optimism " about embryonic stem cells and their use in transplant treatments with " growing scepticism " .
wide view commenting on lord winston 's remarks , roger pederson , a professor of regenerative medicine and convenor of the cambridge stem cell initiative , said it was difficult to be specific about future outcomes given the youthfulness of stem cell study .
however , he told the bbc news website he was confident great gains would be made from the research .
" -lsb- lord winston 's -rsb- concerns about the slow pace of the field or the potential downside risks are not at all surprising to somebody actually working in the field .
we all think about these questions all the time , " he said .
" if you want to know when there will be a clinical impact on the field of diabetes , let 's say , i ca n't answer that question ; but i can answer the question , ' will there be a clinical impact ? '
yes , there will be ; i 'm absolutely certain of it - but when exactly and what field that will be in is much harder to speculate about . "
professor pederson said it was important to consider benefits beyond just transplant therapies .
he said he expected , for example , drug development to make big strides by allowing pharma companies to test novel compounds on specific tissue types derived from stem cells .

he fears a backlash if science fails to deliver on some of the " hype " around the cells - as he believes may happen .
he says the notion that a host of cures for serious , degenerative disorders are just around the corner is fanciful .
however , a cambridge university stem cell researcher said he was certain the work would lead to clinical benefits .
lord winston believes some of the uncertainties need to be emphasised .
" both in britain and america , huge publicity has been given to stem cells , particularly embryonic stem cells , and the potential they offer , " he said in his presidential address to the british association 's festival science in dublin , ireland , on monday .
" of course , the study of stem cells is one of the most exciting areas in biology but i think it is unlikely that embryonic stem cells are likely to be useful in healthcare for a long time . "
embryonic doubts stem cells are the body 's " master cells " and have the ability to produce all manner of tissues - which has led science to investigate their potential to be used to replace the failed cells responsible for many conditions , such as heart disease and diabetes .

" i was concerned that parliamentarians - particularly in the house of commons - have been convinced that it was just a matter of a few years before we would be able to transplant stem cells and cure a lot of neurological disorders , like alzheimer 's disease , for which i think it is going to be a hugely difficult problem and probably completely insoluble by stem cells . "
lord winston said from his own lab 's work he could see there were many problems associated with embryonic stem cells that would need to be understood and resolved before they could have clinical applications .
cancer gain he points to their low cell-cycle time , leading to slow replication in culture and the fact there might be selective pressure for the faster growing , but possibly abnormal cells , to dominate a culture system .
will there be a clinical impact ?
yes , there will be ; i 'm absolutely certain of it roger pederson , cambridge stem cell initiative he also highlights the instability of embryonic cells in general and " their remarkable propensity to produce abnormal numbers of chromosomes " .
these and other issues , unless resolved , he says , will result in unsuccessful therapies .
lord winston does not doubt that study in this area will lead to remarkable and fundamental insights into the workings of the biological cell - and that this should have a huge knock-on effect for medicine with perhaps cancer treatments among the first to benefit .
but he says he does view " the current wave of optimism " about embryonic stem cells and their use in transplant treatments with " growing scepticism " .
wide view commenting on lord winston 's remarks , roger pederson , a professor of regenerative medicine and convenor of the cambridge stem cell initiative , said it was difficult to be specific about future outcomes given the youthfulness of stem cell study .
however , he told the bbc news website he was confident great gains would be made from the research .

by tim weber business editor , bbc news website , reporting from germany germany 's economy , once the engine of european prosperity , is one of the eurozone 's worst performers - so what are the prospects for a recovery ?
could the real german economy please step forward ?
the country is the world 's leading exporter , selling goods worth 733bn euro -lrb- $ 920bn , £ 500bn -rrb- a year and growing .
profits at germany 's large companies are soaring .
business confidence is also improving - several respected surveys suggest company bosses are getting bullish about the future .
" perhaps we are now seeing the spark from exports firing up the economy , " says wolfgang franz , president of the zew economic think tank .
and yet , after travelling through the country - listening to people , politicians and companies , and following the media - one would assume that germany is on the blink .
it 's the economy , stupid german voters go to the polls on 18 september , and bill clinton 's election mantra of 1992 - " it 's the economy , stupid " - could have been written just for this campaign .
how german firms fight the slump " more growth , more jobs " ...
" bold reforms are needed to create jobs " ...
" new ideas for new jobs " - the slogans on the campaign posters are interchangeable , but one thing is constant : this campaign is focused on the state of germany 's economy like none before .
voters are deeply cynical about the solutions on offer .
with days to go to the election , more than a third of the electorate says it has yet to decide who to vote for .
twin problems voters have been disappointed before .
right-wing chancellor helmut kohl failed to deliver the promised " flourishing " eastern germany ; left-wing chancellor gerhard schroeder pledged in vain to cut unemployment in half .
eastern germany and unemployment are still the country 's twin problems .
unification 15 years ago resulted in a classic boom and bust .
billions of deutschmarks were spent to restore the east 's infrastructure .
when the money began to run out whole industries imploded and unemployment soared .
earlier this year , the number of jobless reached a post-war record of 5.2 million .
every day , says the opposition , another 1,000 jobs disappear .
over the past five months unemployment rates have improved slightly , but in some regions - especially the east - unemployment is still well above 20 % .
vicious circle unemployment is hitting both consumers ' confidence and their purchasing power .
as they tighten their belts , germany 's savings rate has reached a staggering 11 % .
" consumers think it 's cool to be a scrooge these days , " says frank brueckner , who runs a heating and plumbing business near coburg , bavaria .
it is a vicious circle : consumers stop spending ; retailers bemoan empty shops .
in particular , weak domestic demand hurts the small and medium-sized enterprises that are the backbone of germany 's economy - its famous mittelstand .
many of these firms now cut jobs and invest less .
with eight out of 10 employees working for mittelstand firms , consumer confidence takes yet another plunge .
for once , the current export boom has failed to trigger a higher rate of investment , says hans-werner sinn , president of the ifo institute for economic research .
all that results in poor tax receipts and - combined with eurozone stability rules - starves the federal government of money needed to kickstart the economy .
an entrepreneur 's hell ?
so how can the vicious circle be broken ?
some company bosses have a long list of issues they want to see tackled : the complex tax system ; restrictive labour laws ; rampant bureaucracy ; and high social security and healthcare costs , which now make up 42 % of the wage bill .
large companies have the profit margins and legal teams to stay on top of such worries - or relocate to countries with cheap labour .
it 's the mittelstand that feels the pain .
" if i had n't been born in germany i would n't invest here , because the labour laws impose so much regulation they make an entrepreneur 's life hell , " says dr ute bergner , founder and boss of vacom , a small firm in the east specialising in vacuum technology .
but its too early to write off germany .
technology-intensive firms like dr bergner 's - and thousands like hers - are actually expanding .
germany is moving over the past few years radical welfare reforms have changed the country 's labour market beyond recognition .
tales of germany 's high wages and short working hours are just that - tales .
real wages have fallen dramatically and working hours are nearly back to 40 a week - to the point where some employers say they do n't see much difference between the cost of hiring a german or british worker .
trade unions negotiate deals with flexible hours and lower wages , tailored to the needs of companies under competitive pressure .
" i have to discuss such deals with nearly all companies in our region , " says juergen apfel , regional organiser for the ig metall trade union in coburg , a depressed region in northern bavaria .
at the same time imports have begun to rise again , an indicator , experts say , that domestic demand is on the mend .
foreign investors , especially hedge funds , are already busy snapping up germany 's undervalued companies and assets , hoping to capitalise on the country 's potential for growth .
the risks it will be a slow start .
this year germany 's economy is expected to grow by less than 1 % .
next year it might manage about 1.5 % .
should there be a recovery , it is likely to come too late for chancellor schroeder , who is widely expected to lose the election .
and higher oil prices , a volatile euro or a global economic slowdown could easily derail the recovery .
there are homemade threats too .
the main opposition party , the cdu , wants to cut social security taxes and make up the funding shortfall by raising vat by 2 percentage points .
that , says julien seetharamdoo of capital economics , could be as disastrous as a similar tax change in japan in the early 1990s , which triggered a decade of low growth .
germany 's biggest problem , though , may be of its own making .
" we germans are world class whingers , " says dr rainer hecker , boss of loewe , a high-end consumer electronics firm in bavaria .
his words are echoed by many business people .
if only consumers and entrepreneurs would stop moaning and buy , invest , take risks instead .
but if it is just the gloomy mood that is holding back germany , then the recovery could be at the mercy of some 11 men .
next year germany will host the football world cup .
should its national team do well , a consumer spending spree would be all but guaranteed .
this is the first in a series of reports from germany ; in the run-up to the election we will look at the country 's unemployed , eastern germany , and how its companies are trying to beat the slump .

vicious circle unemployment is hitting both consumers ' confidence and their purchasing power .
german shoppers are reluctant to spend as they tighten their belts , germany 's savings rate has reached a staggering 11 % .
" consumers think it 's cool to be a scrooge these days , " says frank brueckner , who runs a heating and plumbing business near coburg , bavaria .
it is a vicious circle : consumers stop spending ; retailers bemoan empty shops .
in particular , weak domestic demand hurts the small and medium-sized enterprises that are the backbone of germany 's economy - its famous mittelstand .
many of these firms now cut jobs and invest less .
with eight out of 10 employees working for mittelstand firms , consumer confidence takes yet another plunge .
for once , the current export boom has failed to trigger a higher rate of investment , says hans-werner sinn , president of the ifo institute for economic research .
all that results in poor tax receipts and - combined with eurozone stability rules - starves the federal government of money needed to kickstart the economy .
an entrepreneur 's hell ?
so how can the vicious circle be broken ?
some company bosses have a long list of issues they want to see tackled : the complex tax system ; restrictive labour laws ; rampant bureaucracy ; and high social security and healthcare costs , which now make up 42 % of the wage bill .
seven case studies that show how german companies are beating the slump at-a-glance large companies have the profit margins and legal teams to stay on top of such worries - or relocate to countries with cheap labour .
it 's the mittelstand that feels the pain .
" if i had n't been born in germany i would n't invest here , because the labour laws impose so much regulation they make an entrepreneur 's life hell , " says dr ute bergner , founder and boss of vacom , a small firm in the east specialising in vacuum technology .
but its too early to write off germany .
technology-intensive firms like dr bergner 's - and thousands like hers - are actually expanding .
germany is moving over the past few years radical welfare reforms have changed the country 's labour market beyond recognition .
tales of germany 's high wages and short working hours are just that - tales .
real wages have fallen dramatically and working hours are nearly back to 40 a week - to the point where some employers say they do n't see much difference between the cost of hiring a german or british worker .
trade unions negotiate deals with flexible hours and lower wages , tailored to the needs of companies under competitive pressure .
" i have to discuss such deals with nearly all companies in our region , " says juergen apfel , regional organiser for the ig metall trade union in coburg , a depressed region in northern bavaria .
at the same time imports have begun to rise again , an indicator , experts say , that domestic demand is on the mend .
foreign investors , especially hedge funds , are already busy snapping up germany 's undervalued companies and assets , hoping to capitalise on the country 's potential for growth .
the risks it will be a slow start .
this year germany 's economy is expected to grow by less than 1 % .
next year it might manage about 1.5 % .
should there be a recovery , it is likely to come too late for chancellor schroeder , who is widely expected to lose the election .
and higher oil prices , a volatile euro or a global economic slowdown could easily derail the recovery .
there are homemade threats too .
the main opposition party , the cdu , wants to cut social security taxes and make up the funding shortfall by raising vat by 2 percentage points .
that , says julien seetharamdoo of capital economics , could be as disastrous as a similar tax change in japan in the early 1990s , which triggered a decade of low growth .
germany 's biggest problem , though , may be of its own making .
" we germans are world class whingers , " says dr rainer hecker , boss of loewe , a high-end consumer electronics firm in bavaria .
his words are echoed by many business people .
if only consumers and entrepreneurs would stop moaning and buy , invest , take risks instead .
but if it is just the gloomy mood that is holding back germany , then the recovery could be at the mercy of some 11 men .
next year germany will host the football world cup .
should its national team do well , a consumer spending spree would be all but guaranteed .

all that results in poor tax receipts and - combined with eurozone stability rules - starves the federal government of money needed to kickstart the economy .
an entrepreneur 's hell ?
so how can the vicious circle be broken ?
some company bosses have a long list of issues they want to see tackled : the complex tax system ; restrictive labour laws ; rampant bureaucracy ; and high social security and healthcare costs , which now make up 42 % of the wage bill .
seven case studies that show how german companies are beating the slump at-a-glance large companies have the profit margins and legal teams to stay on top of such worries - or relocate to countries with cheap labour .
it 's the mittelstand that feels the pain .
" if i had n't been born in germany i would n't invest here , because the labour laws impose so much regulation they make an entrepreneur 's life hell , " says dr ute bergner , founder and boss of vacom , a small firm in the east specialising in vacuum technology .
but its too early to write off germany .
technology-intensive firms like dr bergner 's - and thousands like hers - are actually expanding .
germany is moving over the past few years radical welfare reforms have changed the country 's labour market beyond recognition .
tales of germany 's high wages and short working hours are just that - tales .
real wages have fallen dramatically and working hours are nearly back to 40 a week - to the point where some employers say they do n't see much difference between the cost of hiring a german or british worker .
trade unions negotiate deals with flexible hours and lower wages , tailored to the needs of companies under competitive pressure .
" i have to discuss such deals with nearly all companies in our region , " says juergen apfel , regional organiser for the ig metall trade union in coburg , a depressed region in northern bavaria .
at the same time imports have begun to rise again , an indicator , experts say , that domestic demand is on the mend .
foreign investors , especially hedge funds , are already busy snapping up germany 's undervalued companies and assets , hoping to capitalise on the country 's potential for growth .
the risks it will be a slow start .
this year germany 's economy is expected to grow by less than 1 % .
next year it might manage about 1.5 % .
should there be a recovery , it is likely to come too late for chancellor schroeder , who is widely expected to lose the election .
and higher oil prices , a volatile euro or a global economic slowdown could easily derail the recovery .
there are homemade threats too .
the main opposition party , the cdu , wants to cut social security taxes and make up the funding shortfall by raising vat by 2 percentage points .
that , says julien seetharamdoo of capital economics , could be as disastrous as a similar tax change in japan in the early 1990s , which triggered a decade of low growth .
germany 's biggest problem , though , may be of its own making .
" we germans are world class whingers , " says dr rainer hecker , boss of loewe , a high-end consumer electronics firm in bavaria .
his words are echoed by many business people .
if only consumers and entrepreneurs would stop moaning and buy , invest , take risks instead .
but if it is just the gloomy mood that is holding back germany , then the recovery could be at the mercy of some 11 men .
next year germany will host the football world cup .
should its national team do well , a consumer spending spree would be all but guaranteed .
this is the first in a series of reports from germany ; in the run-up to the election we will look at the country 's unemployed , eastern germany , and how its companies are trying to beat the slump .

the federal court ordered kazaa 's owners , sharman networks , to modify the software to prevent further piracy .
the ruling comes after months of legal wrangling between sharman networks , and a group of record labels .
the case is the latest courtroom battle between peer-to-peer networks and copyright holders , such as record labels and music studios .
' milestone ' although the ruling is only enforceable in australia , the record industry has hailed it as a victory that would resonate around the world .
we will ask the court when it comes to damages to reflect the value of the music these people ripped off michael speck , record industry spokesman " today 's judgement shows that kazaa , one of the biggest engines of copyright theft and the biggest brand in music piracy worldwide , is illegal , " said john kennedy , chairman of the international federation of phonographic industries .
" this is a milestone in the fight against internet piracy worldwide . "
the defeat for kazaa comes two months after the supreme court in the us ruled that file-sharing services could be held liable for copyright infringement under certain circumstances .
the lawsuit was brought by five record labels - universal , emi , sony bmg , warner and festival mushroom - who said that kazaa technology helped copyright infringement on a huge scale .
the defendants in the case argued they had no control over how people used their technology , comparing it to a photocopier or tape recorder .
two months to change in his ruling , federal court judge murray wilcox said the owners of kazaa had " long known that the kazaa system is widely used for the sharing of copyright files " .
kazaa website ' suggested it was ' cool ' to defy the record labels ' he went on to say that the effect of the kazaa website was " to encourage visitors to think it ' cool ' to defy the record companies by ignoring copyright constraints " .
the judge dismissed as " overstated " accusations that kazaa 's owners were infringing copyright themselves .
" the more realistic claim is that the respondents authorised users to infringe the applicants ' copyright in their sound recordings , " he said .
kazaa 's owners were ordered to modify the software within two months to include filters designed to stop the sharing of copyright material .
a fresh round of hearings will now be held to determine the level of damages , which could run into the millions of dollars .
" the court has ruled the current kazaa system illegal , " said record industry spokesman michael speck said outside the court .
" these people have crowed for years about the downloads , 270 million downloads of somebody else 's work each month .
we will ask the court when it comes to damages to reflect the value of the music these people ripped off . "
lawyers for kazaa said they would appeal against the decision .
moving target the victory for the record industry may be too little , too late .
research shows that file-sharers have already moved from kazaa to other peer-to-peer software .
" it just is n't as big a player as it once was , as bittorrent and edonkey are now far more important to file sharers , " said professor michael geist , an e-commerce expert at ottawa university .
" this has been a common trend for years as file sharers move between services . "
according to internet analysis firm cachelogic , 60 % of the traffic on the net by the end of 2004 was made up of peer-to-peer activity .
it found that edonkey has become the dominant peer-to-peer file-sharing network in countries such as south korea , italy , germany and spain .
in australia , bittorrent accounts for more than half of all file-sharing , followed by edonkey , cachelogic figures show .
fasttrack , the network used by kazaa , makes up about 10 % of all peer-to-peer traffic .

the defendants in the case argued they had no control over how people used their technology , comparing it to a photocopier or tape recorder .
two months to change in his ruling , federal court judge murray wilcox said the owners of kazaa had " long known that the kazaa system is widely used for the sharing of copyright files " .
kazaa website ' suggested it was ' cool ' to defy the record labels ' he went on to say that the effect of the kazaa website was " to encourage visitors to think it ' cool ' to defy the record companies by ignoring copyright constraints " .
the judge dismissed as " overstated " accusations that kazaa 's owners were infringing copyright themselves .
" the more realistic claim is that the respondents authorised users to infringe the applicants ' copyright in their sound recordings , " he said .
kazaa 's owners were ordered to modify the software within two months to include filters designed to stop the sharing of copyright material .
a fresh round of hearings will now be held to determine the level of damages , which could run into the millions of dollars .
" the court has ruled the current kazaa system illegal , " said record industry spokesman michael speck said outside the court .
" these people have crowed for years about the downloads , 270 million downloads of somebody else 's work each month .
we will ask the court when it comes to damages to reflect the value of the music these people ripped off . "
lawyers for kazaa said they would appeal against the decision .
moving target the victory for the record industry may be too little , too late .
research shows that file-sharers have already moved from kazaa to other peer-to-peer software .
" it just is n't as big a player as it once was , as bittorrent and edonkey are now far more important to file sharers , " said professor michael geist , an e-commerce expert at ottawa university .
" this has been a common trend for years as file sharers move between services . "
according to internet analysis firm cachelogic , 60 % of the traffic on the net by the end of 2004 was made up of peer-to-peer activity .
it found that edonkey has become the dominant peer-to-peer file-sharing network in countries such as south korea , italy , germany and spain .
in australia , bittorrent accounts for more than half of all file-sharing , followed by edonkey , cachelogic figures show .
fasttrack , the network used by kazaa , makes up about 10 % of all peer-to-peer traffic .

the government has been seeking assurances from several countries that no-one it deports will be ill-treated .
the european convention on human rights currently blocks the uk from sending back foreigners considered to be promoting terrorism .
but mr blair told the bbc : " we may have to amend the law to get it done . "
' slow process ' in an interview in beijing during trade talks , mr blair was asked why no deportations had yet taken place .
he replied : " you can serve the orders for deportation swiftly , but the legal process then takes some time to determine .
" because there 's a major question , which is whether we are going to be able , on the basis of understandings with the countries to which we 're returning these people , whether we will be able , according to the law of the courts , to be able to return those people properly .
" and that 's the issue which i explained , you know before i left , and that 's why this will take some time through the courts , through the parliament , because we may have to amend the law in order to get it done . "
tory backing but shadow home secretary david davis said that while mr blair was " very good on stern tones " , the issue was whether he could deliver on a change in the law .
he said he had warned home secretary charles clarke at the time when changes to the rules on deportations were announced that the wording of planned legislation would have to be revised in order to overcome difficulties in the courts .
" we have been saying for years now that these people should be deported , " mr davis told bbc radio 4 's today programme .
" we have called for either reform or repeal of the human rights act .
we have called for action to ensure that british courts behave in a similar way to some european courts on all this .
" of course , it is now going to take time .
they have waited until now to do something about it and it is going to take time .
they will get our support in terms of doing that , but there will have to be changes in the law . "
' challenge ideas ' the two politicians were speaking just days after a video was shown on arab tv network al-jazeera showing london bomber mohammed sidique kahn criticising british foreign policy and saying he was a soldier fighting a war .
commenting on the video , the prime minister said : " in the end , we have got to challenge the idea that a section of our country is being victimised by our country . "
he said the government had to " take on the ideas of these people , to challenge them head on - to say it 's absurd of anybody growing up in our country to say they are a victim or have a grievance on these issues . "
