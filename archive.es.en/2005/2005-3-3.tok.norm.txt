democrat senator joseph biden joined in , saying that the lifting of the ban would be " a non-starter with congress " after he and lugar met with president bush in the white house . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president chen shui-bian of taiwan the warning from congress follows a rebuke from taiwan 's president chen shui-bian on tuesday when he told the eu via a video link that eu plans to lift the arms embargo endangered the military balance in east asia and accused some in europe of double standards in currying favour with beijing . he added that the planned lifting of the arms ban could also let the chinese think it did not need to proceed with democratic reforms . " should the eu decide to lift its arms embargo against china it might lead to a tilt in the military balance in the taiwan strait , which would pose a clear threat to peace and stability , " he said . bush returned from his european tour smarting from his china-related encounters with european leaders , especially the one that heralded a widely reported and embarrassing no-nonsense declaration from french president jacques chirac that europe intended to lift the ban .
the end of the embargo has been penciled in for may 8 , when the eu holds a meeting with the chinese leadership . eu must prepare a case for congress the europeans are expected to make a case to congress for acceptance of their decision by arguing that the embargo was a response to tiananmen square massacre in 1989 , and that china has moved on dramatically since then .
during his visit , bush let it be known that he was " open minded " about the lifting of the ban , but told eu leaders that they would have to convince congress . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george w bush , left , poses with european union commission president jose manual barroso , following an eu summit at the european union commission headquarters in brussels , tuesday feb .

if they ca n't , the repairs made to the us-eu relationship during bush 's visit could come unravel . " europe can do defense trade with china or it can do defense trade with the us .
it ca n't do both , " daniel goure , a pentagon consultant and vice president of the lexington institute military think-tank , told the british guardian newspaper . europeans want discussion with us the europeans went into damage limitation mode soon after the statements from congress were issued . " it is not our intention that this change will increase the quantity or the quality of arms exports to china , " an eu commission spokeswoman told reporters .

1 , 2010 , a german city will celebrate its first day as europe 's cultural capital .
what 's still unclear , however , is which town will be able to do so as 10 cities across the country are still in the running . from lübeck in the north to karlsruhe in the south , from görlitz in the east to essen in the west , the contenders have lobbying hard to bring home the title .
whether it 's prominent supporters such as halle native and former german foreign minister hans-dietrich genscher promoting his city on posters across the country or regensburg enlisting scandalous theater director christoph schlingensief to put on an -lrb- albeit unflattering -rrb- play about the bavarian town , most have come up with ways to get some attention . on march 10 and 11 , a jury of experts will pick two cities and recommend them to germany 's upper house , the bundesrat .

but a scandal involving the abuse of tourist visas has dented his reputation and is threatening to unravel his political future . last weekend , fischer gave a speech that was likely one of the most difficult of his lengthy political career .
in an address to members of his greens party at a regional congress , he had to admit he had made mistakes in handling a widening affair in which foreign criminals made use of relaxed visa requirements – approved by fischer – to smuggle people into germany . while he rejected demands by the conservative opposition to resign , the fact that fischer felt compelled to devote his speech to the visa scandal shows just how much the matter has the experienced political operator on the defensive . " fischer certainly underestimated the situation , " dr. jürgen falter , director of the domestic politics program at the university of mainz , told dw-world .
" at the moment it does n't look like it will push him from office , but we 'll have to wait and see if more serious revelations come to light . " opposition politicians claim thousands of illegal immigrants – including many from ukraine and china – were able to enter germany between 2000 and 2003 after tourist visa criteria were relaxed .

24 , 2001 .
known as someone who does n't suffer fools gladly , fischer has as many enemies as he does admirers in parliament , the press , and even in his own party .
over the years , he has developed a reputation as being aloof and arrogant to journalists and his colleagues .
perhaps worse , he has the nasty habit of unnecessarily humiliating those working for him at the foreign ministry .
it appears as if fischer is now reaping what he 's sown as those who feel slighted by the minister look for some payback . " he always thought he was almost invulnerable and could survive anything , which was the case up till now , " fischer 's biographer bernd ulrich said in a recent radio interview with deutschlandfunk .
" that 's why he 's approached this matter with a certain amount of arrogance . " yet despite his prickly public persona , fischer has consistently ranked as one of germany 's most popular politicians .
born in 1948 as the humble son of butcher in stuttgart , fischer has one of the most unconventional backgrounds of the country 's political elite .

while he lived in frankfurt , he also became involved in the leftwing student protests of 1968 .
during that turbulent time he was involved in violent street fighting with the police .
pictures of him made public in 2001 in a black motorcycle helmet kicking a police officer during a protest led conservatives to call for his head . authentic and quirky but german chancellor gerhard schröder stuck by him back then and the public chalked up the affair as a youthful indiscretion on fischer 's part .
and for many germans , it was simply more proof of his " authenticity " that has made him both the greens ' elder statesman and a quirky public figure that could do little wrong . " he has a personality bonus , " explained richard hilmer from the public polling organization infratest / dimap .

but a scandal involving the abuse of tourist visas has dented his reputation and is threatening to unravel his political future . last weekend , fischer gave a speech that was likely one of the most difficult of his lengthy political career .
in an address to members of his greens party at a regional congress , he had to admit he had made mistakes in handling a widening affair in which foreign criminals made use of relaxed visa requirements – approved by fischer – to smuggle people into germany . while he rejected demands by the conservative opposition to resign , the fact that fischer felt compelled to devote his speech to the visa scandal shows just how much the matter has the experienced political operator on the defensive . " fischer certainly underestimated the situation , " dr. jürgen falter , director of the domestic politics program at the university of mainz , told dw-world .
" at the moment it does n't look like it will push him from office , but we 'll have to wait and see if more serious revelations come to light . " opposition politicians claim thousands of illegal immigrants – including many from ukraine and china – were able to enter germany between 2000 and 2003 after tourist visa criteria were relaxed .
they say that led to an increase in organized crime , drugs and prostitution on fischer 's watch . admirers and enemies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer looks on during the greens party congress in rostock , eastern germany , on saturday , nov .
24 , 2001 .
known as someone who does n't suffer fools gladly , fischer has as many enemies as he does admirers in parliament , the press , and even in his own party .
over the years , he has developed a reputation as being aloof and arrogant to journalists and his colleagues .
perhaps worse , he has the nasty habit of unnecessarily humiliating those working for him at the foreign ministry .
it appears as if fischer is now reaping what he 's sown as those who feel slighted by the minister look for some payback . " he always thought he was almost invulnerable and could survive anything , which was the case up till now , " fischer 's biographer bernd ulrich said in a recent radio interview with deutschlandfunk .
" that 's why he 's approached this matter with a certain amount of arrogance . " yet despite his prickly public persona , fischer has consistently ranked as one of germany 's most popular politicians .
born in 1948 as the humble son of butcher in stuttgart , fischer has one of the most unconventional backgrounds of the country 's political elite .
having left school in 10th grade , he made a living in the 1970s as a taxi driver before helping set up the greens and leading the upstart party into parliament in the 1980s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer said he recognized himself on this picture of being beaten by the police in 1968 .
other photos showed fischer beating a police officer .
while he lived in frankfurt , he also became involved in the leftwing student protests of 1968 .
during that turbulent time he was involved in violent street fighting with the police .
pictures of him made public in 2001 in a black motorcycle helmet kicking a police officer during a protest led conservatives to call for his head . authentic and quirky but german chancellor gerhard schröder stuck by him back then and the public chalked up the affair as a youthful indiscretion on fischer 's part .
and for many germans , it was simply more proof of his " authenticity " that has made him both the greens ' elder statesman and a quirky public figure that could do little wrong . " he has a personality bonus , " explained richard hilmer from the public polling organization infratest / dimap .
" he 's considered a different kind of politician .
his moving background is considered convincing and authentic . " but the visa affair has battered fischer 's reputation in the eyes of many .
for the first time in three years , fischer last week lost his status as germany 's most popular politician in a regular poll by public broadcaster zdf . " he 's smacked quite a few people around and that has come back to haunt him .
there appears to be quite a bit of schadenfreude over his predicament , " dr. falter said , adding he expected fischer to survive the current scandal largely intact .
" if he makes it through this he 'll be know as the teflon minister .
nothing will stick to him . " schröder 's backing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka and gerd .
as in 2001 , schröder has once again demonstratively backed his foreign minister , saying there was no question that fischer will stay in office .
the chancellor has also expressed his desire to stand for reelection in 2006 with fischer at his side . fischer biographer ulrich even said the governing center-left coalition of social democrats and greens could possible survive with another chancellor than schröder , but that the foreign minister was indispensable . " he 's too important for the stability of the coalition , " he said , adding that because of the visa affair fischer had also become a liability .

but a scandal involving the abuse of tourist visas has dented his reputation and is threatening to unravel his political future . last weekend , fischer gave a speech that was likely one of the most difficult of his lengthy political career .
in an address to members of his greens party at a regional congress , he had to admit he had made mistakes in handling a widening affair in which foreign criminals made use of relaxed visa requirements – approved by fischer – to smuggle people into germany . while he rejected demands by the conservative opposition to resign , the fact that fischer felt compelled to devote his speech to the visa scandal shows just how much the matter has the experienced political operator on the defensive . " fischer certainly underestimated the situation , " dr. jürgen falter , director of the domestic politics program at the university of mainz , told dw-world .
" at the moment it does n't look like it will push him from office , but we 'll have to wait and see if more serious revelations come to light . " opposition politicians claim thousands of illegal immigrants – including many from ukraine and china – were able to enter germany between 2000 and 2003 after tourist visa criteria were relaxed .
they say that led to an increase in organized crime , drugs and prostitution on fischer 's watch . admirers and enemies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer looks on during the greens party congress in rostock , eastern germany , on saturday , nov .
24 , 2001 .
known as someone who does n't suffer fools gladly , fischer has as many enemies as he does admirers in parliament , the press , and even in his own party .
over the years , he has developed a reputation as being aloof and arrogant to journalists and his colleagues .
perhaps worse , he has the nasty habit of unnecessarily humiliating those working for him at the foreign ministry .
it appears as if fischer is now reaping what he 's sown as those who feel slighted by the minister look for some payback . " he always thought he was almost invulnerable and could survive anything , which was the case up till now , " fischer 's biographer bernd ulrich said in a recent radio interview with deutschlandfunk .
" that 's why he 's approached this matter with a certain amount of arrogance . " yet despite his prickly public persona , fischer has consistently ranked as one of germany 's most popular politicians .
born in 1948 as the humble son of butcher in stuttgart , fischer has one of the most unconventional backgrounds of the country 's political elite .
having left school in 10th grade , he made a living in the 1970s as a taxi driver before helping set up the greens and leading the upstart party into parliament in the 1980s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer said he recognized himself on this picture of being beaten by the police in 1968 .
other photos showed fischer beating a police officer .
while he lived in frankfurt , he also became involved in the leftwing student protests of 1968 .
during that turbulent time he was involved in violent street fighting with the police .
pictures of him made public in 2001 in a black motorcycle helmet kicking a police officer during a protest led conservatives to call for his head . authentic and quirky but german chancellor gerhard schröder stuck by him back then and the public chalked up the affair as a youthful indiscretion on fischer 's part .
and for many germans , it was simply more proof of his " authenticity " that has made him both the greens ' elder statesman and a quirky public figure that could do little wrong . " he has a personality bonus , " explained richard hilmer from the public polling organization infratest / dimap .
" he 's considered a different kind of politician .
his moving background is considered convincing and authentic . " but the visa affair has battered fischer 's reputation in the eyes of many .
for the first time in three years , fischer last week lost his status as germany 's most popular politician in a regular poll by public broadcaster zdf . " he 's smacked quite a few people around and that has come back to haunt him .
there appears to be quite a bit of schadenfreude over his predicament , " dr. falter said , adding he expected fischer to survive the current scandal largely intact .
" if he makes it through this he 'll be know as the teflon minister .
nothing will stick to him . " schröder 's backing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka and gerd .
as in 2001 , schröder has once again demonstratively backed his foreign minister , saying there was no question that fischer will stay in office .
the chancellor has also expressed his desire to stand for reelection in 2006 with fischer at his side . fischer biographer ulrich even said the governing center-left coalition of social democrats and greens could possible survive with another chancellor than schröder , but that the foreign minister was indispensable . " he 's too important for the stability of the coalition , " he said , adding that because of the visa affair fischer had also become a liability .
" he wo n't fall but he 'll definitely slide a bit .
and when he sinks , he 'll pull the red-green coalition down a bit further .

but many cases remain unsolved and bitter feuds prevent other paintings being returned . a cultural legacy left over from the third reich which german museums continue to face is the return of stolen art .
since 1998 when a conference in washington heralded the beginning of a concerted effort by germany and 43 other countries to find and return artworks stolen by the nazis during world war ii , museums across the country have experienced the headaches attached to this quest . one on-going saga involving three paintings seized by the nazis between 1937 and 1939 was resolved this week when they were returned to their original jewish owners after a long legal wrangle , a local official said on wednesday . a spokeswoman for city authorities in wuppertal , western germany , said the handover , which should have happened more than a year ago but was held up by a legal technicality , would go ahead " as soon as possible , once the conditions for their return are set in a contract . " the process of handing back the three paintings , which are currently on display in the city 's heydt museum , had previously been delayed by doubts about who the real owners were . the work " felsige flusslandschaft , " by frankfurt artist otto scholderer , was bought by the museum in 1939 after its forced sale a year earlier .
" erinnerung vom dampfboot auf der donau , " by adolph menzel , was given as a gift to the heydt in 1956 . the owners of hans von marees ' " tatar mit pferd , " forced into sale in 1937 , fled germany for the netherlands where they were caught and killed in a concentration camp in 1944 .
the painting was bought by the museum in 1948 and is expected to be given to the grandchildren of its deceased owners . complications the rule , not exception bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : such complications are not unusual .
returning stolen art to the rightful owners 60 years after it was first taken is an awkward affair .
despite the best efforts of the german states and local authorities , which have been keeping an internet database of reportedly stolen artefacts , many critics have derided these attempts , citing inexact information and conflicts of interest . one particularly high-profile case is still caught in a bitter impasse due to these reasons .

the rest was confiscated by the gestapo . the duisburg museum bought the painting in the 1950s without any knowledge of the painting 's history and now refuses to return it . legal gray area bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portrait of wally , painted by the late austrian expressionist egon schiele .
the museum of modern art turned down pleas from two jewish families to hold onto two paintings in a traveling exhibit while they press claims that the artworks were lost to nazi wartime plundering .
there are very few legal statutes regarding the return of stolen art appropriated by the nazis .
while court rulings decide the fate of some , the majority of cases are fought on moral and ethical grounds and many victims of the third reich base their cases on emotional pleas . however , since the summer of 2003 , the federal stolen art ethics committee has mediated in many cases between victims and museums .

since 1998 when a conference in washington heralded the beginning of a concerted effort by germany and 43 other countries to find and return artworks stolen by the nazis during world war ii , museums across the country have experienced the headaches attached to this quest . one on-going saga involving three paintings seized by the nazis between 1937 and 1939 was resolved this week when they were returned to their original jewish owners after a long legal wrangle , a local official said on wednesday . a spokeswoman for city authorities in wuppertal , western germany , said the handover , which should have happened more than a year ago but was held up by a legal technicality , would go ahead " as soon as possible , once the conditions for their return are set in a contract . " the process of handing back the three paintings , which are currently on display in the city 's heydt museum , had previously been delayed by doubts about who the real owners were . the work " felsige flusslandschaft , " by frankfurt artist otto scholderer , was bought by the museum in 1939 after its forced sale a year earlier .
" erinnerung vom dampfboot auf der donau , " by adolph menzel , was given as a gift to the heydt in 1956 . the owners of hans von marees ' " tatar mit pferd , " forced into sale in 1937 , fled germany for the netherlands where they were caught and killed in a concentration camp in 1944 .

returning stolen art to the rightful owners 60 years after it was first taken is an awkward affair .

there are very few legal statutes regarding the return of stolen art appropriated by the nazis .

unlike many of his peers , the pioneering economist is happy to work in germany - despite his international reputation . why do you always get out-bid on internet auctions ?
are buyer 's recommendations reliable ?
why does the price always rocket at the last minute ? if you want to understand how ebay works , then 36-year-old axel ockenfels is your man .
online bidding practices are one of his areas of expertise , and his students at the laboratory for controlled experimental economics at cologne university are finding out what it takes to get what you want in the cut-throat world of the online marketplace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " typically , what happens is , the person who wins , pays too much , " says ockenfels .
" the person who wins is n't the person who 's estimated the value of the product most precisely , but the person who 's most overestimated its value . " experimental economics ockenfels ' analysis of contemporary economic behavior has propelled him to the forefront of his field .
a protegé of reinhard selten , germany 's one and only winner of the nobel prize for economics , ockenfels ' research into experimental economics and game theory sheds light on the way modern man behaves when it comes to economic decision making - and proves that traditional economics has had its day . " the hypothesis that man is rational and egotistical is one that was n't put to the test for a long time , " explains ockenfels .
" man probably is n't as self-serving as economists would like him to be .
man himself has n't changed , but economic theories have .
new ideas and empirical evidence have been incorporated into economic theory and the concept of the ' homo oeconomicus ' is now less accepted . " the psychology of economics according to game theory , there 's a key psychological aspect to economics .
envy , rivalry and a desire for fairness all play a role . " people 's first priority is n't just getting a bargain , " insists ockenfels .
" they also keep an eye on what other people are getting and their status in their peer group . " " it 's important to understand theory , " he stresses , " but it 's also important to understand how people react .
i feel that a lot of textbooks neglect the empirical and experimental dimensions of economic behaviour and overly concentrate on theories developed in ivory towers . " leaving the ivory tower - but not germany no one can accuse axel ockenfels of living in an ivory tower .
at the age of 36 , he 's already one of the influential economic scientists in the world , hotly pursued by the world 's best universities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but unlike many of germany 's a-list scientists , he 's never been tempted to join the brain-drain crowd and head to the us to enjoy the higher salaries and first-class research opportunities available at the country 's generously funded ivy league schools .
now that he 's scooped germany 's most lucrative research prize , worth € 1.55 million -lrb- $ 2 million -rrb- , he probably feels vindicated in his decision . as far as he 's concerned , germany is where he can work best . " no other country in the world has as many experimental laboratories , " he says .
" but people wo n't have realized this until the next generation of professors has come of age .

the iaea had reported key areas where iran was refusing to cooperate with un inspectors . " while transparency visits have taken place , iran seems to have been determined to limit their scope , " said british ambassador robin wright , reading from the joint statement . the europeans still took a more conciliatory tone than the americans .
they noted that iran 's decision to suspend uranium enrichment - which can be used for either nuclear energy or to make atomic weapons - was " a voluntary commitment " and urged tehran to keep its word . the us maintains that iran 's nuclear activities are designed for a clandestine weapons program .
the head of the us delegation to the iaea board , jackie sanders , cited " an alarming number " of unresolved questions and warned that the iaea could not put off " forever " taking tehran before the un security council for possible sanctions . refusal of inspections causes friction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like the us , the europeans criticized iran for refusing to allow un inspectors to visit its military site in parchin , a site where there are definitely nuclear materials , where washington accuses tehran of simulating testing of nuclear weapons . the iranian delegate to the iaea , cyrus nasseri , said iran was not allowing a second visit to parchin , after a first one in january , in part because it was concerned about information leaks " in view of potential threats of military strikes against iran 's safeguarded and other facilities " by what he called " a major nuclear weapons state " in a clear reference to the united states . but iaea director-general mohamed el baradei said that iran was a " special case " since its nuclear program " has been clandestine for almost two decades " and he asked tehran to allow widespread visits by un inspectors .
the europeans endorsed el baradei 's call for iran to come clean " in order to make up for the confidence deficit created by past activities and to build the necessary confidence in the future , " the european statement said . us president george w. bush has said washington is seeking a diplomatic solution in iran and supports eu talks with tehran .
but bush has said all options , including the military one , remain on the table . bush considers dangling the carrot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , it appears that the president is increasingly aligning himself with european efforts and is considering offering incentives to iran , according to us officials on thursday .
in a preparatory statement ahead of an expected announcement of the us strategy later this week , the united states said it would not block iran as it seeks to start the process of joining the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , and would not stand in the way of european allies if they want to sell tehran parts for civilian aircraft . white house spokesman scott mcclellan said the president had not finalized his decision but said that the united states and europe were discussing " how we can move forward together on a common strategy to get iran to abandon any ambitions for a nuclear weapon . " " we want to do our part to support the european efforts .
this is about strengthening their diplomatic approach to resolving this matter , " he added . in return for supporting incentives , it is likely that the americans would insist that iran abandon uranium enrichment , the major sticking point in the on-going negotiations .
but while it appears that the us has shifted considerable ground , the reality is a little different .

" it is a carrot , and it 's not a very big one , " a senior congressional aide involved in the wto issue was quoted as saying by reuters . membership of the wto can take years after a country has been granted observer status , the first stepping stone to full accession . iran would have a stipulated five years after observer status is achieved to begin the process of moving toward full membership and actual entry into the wto can take many more after that .
however , negotiations on iran 's membership could be strung out indefinitely by the us , binding the iranians to years of concessions over its nuclear program . if the iranians see through this and refuse to accept the incentives , maintaining their efforts to enrich uranium , then the us would resort to its original course of action which would be to take iran to the un security council for possible sanctions . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran signs russian nuclear deal iran and russia on sunday signed a landmark nuclear fuel accord that paves the way for the islamic republic 's first atomic power station , a project the united states alleges is part of a cover for weapons development .

" we say to our friends in berlin , you have to persevere and create more impulse for growth despite the difficult budgetary situation , " harald schartau , the spd leader in north rhine-westphalia said on german television . nationwide , 5.22 million people are looking for work - a rise of 177,000 over january , and more than half a million above the figure at the same time last year , according to figures released by the federal labor agency pressure on berlin to unveil new job creation schemes is mounting . with nearly 13 percent of the workforce currently unemployed , germany is seeing its highest jobless rate since the 1930s . " the figures can be explained " chancellor gerhard schröder , currently on a tour of seven gulf states , took time out in quatar on wednesday to comment on the latest figures . " there 's no doubt that the unemployment figures are depressing , " he said .
" but we ca n't allow ourselves to be forced on the defensive .
the figures can be explained .
in january alone 360,000 people who had been on social support payments were included in the jobless totals . "
some 75 percent of february 's 180,000 additions to the total figure can be seen as the result of a reclassification system introduced in january , with many benefit claimants added to the list for the first time thanks to new rules . ilo statistic less bleak the government can also now point to a new statistic calculated using standards set by the international labor organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- , which does not count the long-term unemployed or people who work just a few hours a week .
" we are now publishing a new monthly unemployment figure based on ilo standards , in addition to the figure calculated in the traditional way , " said economics minister wolfgang clement . this figure put unemployment at just under 4 million , well below the politically sensitive 5 million mark . cross-party cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other contributing factors to the apparent rise in joblessness are the weak economy and the current cold weather , which has badly hit the hitting the construction industry . but while berlin insists its efforts to tackle joblessness with the controversial " hartz iv " labor market reforms need time to take effect , the conservative opposition argues the government needs to change tack . " we need a program to bolster medium-sized business and a program for lower energy costs , " argued angela merkel .

the iaea had reported key areas where iran was refusing to cooperate with un inspectors . " while transparency visits have taken place , iran seems to have been determined to limit their scope , " said british ambassador robin wright , reading from the joint statement . the europeans still took a more conciliatory tone than the americans .
they noted that iran 's decision to suspend uranium enrichment - which can be used for either nuclear energy or to make atomic weapons - was " a voluntary commitment " and urged tehran to keep its word . the us maintains that iran 's nuclear activities are designed for a clandestine weapons program .

in a letter to the german government , kroes demanded more clarification on how the public networks are funded . " the commission 's preliminary view is that the current financing system is no longer in line with eu rules , " the letter read . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zdf 's star team of sports presenters the eu competition watchdogs were reacting to complaints lodged by commercial television networks in germany in 2003 that their state-funded rivals used illegal subsidies .
on thursday , kroes ' department made it clear that it considered the funding of public television in germany to amount to a sort of unlawful state subsidy which hampered free competition in several areas . apart from germany , the eu investigation has also centered on ireland and the netherlands .
on thursday , kroes dashed off similar letters to governments in dublin and amsterdam .
kroes has warned that the three eu member states needed to ensure transparency in the financing of their public television networks and make a clear distinction between their public activities and other commercial ventures such as the internet and digital tv . the commission insisted that it was n't questioning the national right of the eu 's 25 member states to set their own level of funding and public license fees as well as the objectives of their public broadcasters so long as they do not unfairly harm private sector competitors . online services under scrutiny too the eu investigation is expected to have a far-reaching effect on public broadcasters ' rights to offer online services .

they are reported to point to these interventions as being directly contradictory to previous eu rulings upholding the right of britain 's public network bbc to go ahead with nine digital tv and radio channels or even ard 's special interest channels , phoenix and kinderkanal . while deutsche welle is part of the ard network , it is not funded by license fees but government money . ard and zdf are now said to be looking at scaling down their internet services as a precautionary measure and only provide internet content relating to their programming schedules . the bbc is also said to be worriedly watching brussels ' investigation of public networks in germany , ireland and the netherlands .
top bbc executives are reportedly in talks with their counterparts at the german broadcasters as well as eu officials over what the case might mean for them . brussels wants independent monitor kroes on thursday also demanded the setting up of an independent national authority that would monitor the upholding of transparency in the funding of public broadcasters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 03.03.2005 us , europe aligned on iran nuke incentives großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and europe are moving closer in their approaches to iran while the europeans talked tough on wednesday , calling for more transparency from iran in its nuclear activities , the us announced that it may back europe 's incentive-based negotiations with tehran . germany , france and britain joined the united states and the united nations nuclear watchdog on wednesday in calling on iran to show more transparency regarding its nuclear activities . the three european union countries , which have been negotiating with iran to stop its uranium enrichment program in exchange for trade and security benefits , issued a joint statement to the board of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- in vienna .
the iaea had reported key areas where iran was refusing to cooperate with un inspectors . " while transparency visits have taken place , iran seems to have been determined to limit their scope , " said british ambassador robin wright , reading from the joint statement . the europeans still took a more conciliatory tone than the americans .
they noted that iran 's decision to suspend uranium enrichment - which can be used for either nuclear energy or to make atomic weapons - was " a voluntary commitment " and urged tehran to keep its word . the us maintains that iran 's nuclear activities are designed for a clandestine weapons program .
the head of the us delegation to the iaea board , jackie sanders , cited " an alarming number " of unresolved questions and warned that the iaea could not put off " forever " taking tehran before the un security council for possible sanctions . refusal of inspections causes friction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like the us , the europeans criticized iran for refusing to allow un inspectors to visit its military site in parchin , a site where there are definitely nuclear materials , where washington accuses tehran of simulating testing of nuclear weapons . the iranian delegate to the iaea , cyrus nasseri , said iran was not allowing a second visit to parchin , after a first one in january , in part because it was concerned about information leaks " in view of potential threats of military strikes against iran 's safeguarded and other facilities " by what he called " a major nuclear weapons state " in a clear reference to the united states . but iaea director-general mohamed el baradei said that iran was a " special case " since its nuclear program " has been clandestine for almost two decades " and he asked tehran to allow widespread visits by un inspectors .
the europeans endorsed el baradei 's call for iran to come clean " in order to make up for the confidence deficit created by past activities and to build the necessary confidence in the future , " the european statement said . us president george w. bush has said washington is seeking a diplomatic solution in iran and supports eu talks with tehran .
but bush has said all options , including the military one , remain on the table . bush considers dangling the carrot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , it appears that the president is increasingly aligning himself with european efforts and is considering offering incentives to iran , according to us officials on thursday .
in a preparatory statement ahead of an expected announcement of the us strategy later this week , the united states said it would not block iran as it seeks to start the process of joining the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , and would not stand in the way of european allies if they want to sell tehran parts for civilian aircraft . white house spokesman scott mcclellan said the president had not finalized his decision but said that the united states and europe were discussing " how we can move forward together on a common strategy to get iran to abandon any ambitions for a nuclear weapon . " " we want to do our part to support the european efforts .
this is about strengthening their diplomatic approach to resolving this matter , " he added . in return for supporting incentives , it is likely that the americans would insist that iran abandon uranium enrichment , the major sticking point in the on-going negotiations .
but while it appears that the us has shifted considerable ground , the reality is a little different .
the europeans and the americans would get the better end of the deal if iran accepts the incentives . wto accession a one-sided deal ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- headquarters in geneva , switzerland .

kroes has warned that the three eu member states needed to ensure transparency in the financing of their public television networks and make a clear distinction between their public activities and other commercial ventures such as the internet and digital tv . the commission insisted that it was n't questioning the national right of the eu 's 25 member states to set their own level of funding and public license fees as well as the objectives of their public broadcasters so long as they do not unfairly harm private sector competitors . online services under scrutiny too the eu investigation is expected to have a far-reaching effect on public broadcasters ' rights to offer online services .

they are reported to point to these interventions as being directly contradictory to previous eu rulings upholding the right of britain 's public network bbc to go ahead with nine digital tv and radio channels or even ard 's special interest channels , phoenix and kinderkanal . while deutsche welle is part of the ard network , it is not funded by license fees but government money . ard and zdf are now said to be looking at scaling down their internet services as a precautionary measure and only provide internet content relating to their programming schedules . the bbc is also said to be worriedly watching brussels ' investigation of public networks in germany , ireland and the netherlands .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.03.2005 joint-rule in serbia-montenegro in jeopardy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toasting independence : djukanovic after his 2001 election victory with parliamentary mandates now expired , montenegro 's prime minister is calling for an end to the serbia-montenegro union .
but his serbian counterpart could n't agree less . two weeks ago , montenegro 's prime minister milo djukanovic wrote to the serbian government outlining his hopes for the future of the two nations .
his plan foresaw serbia and montenegro ending the state union of serbia and montenegro and forming independent nations , without a union parliament but with a form of federal council . although the two states would maintain a central administration in charge of economic and political affairs , they would operate separate foreign and defence policies . premature pressure the union of serbia and montenegro was voted into existence by the yugoslav parliament in 2003 .
the eu-brokered belgrade agreement marked an end to a long-drawn out constitutional crisis and was designed to remain in place for a minimum of three years , after which the two republics were to hold referendums on whether to maintain the union arrangement or vote for independence . djukanovic has made no bones about his desire to end the union and insists his proposal does not represent any breach of the agreement , even though this is supposedly valid until 2006 .
but he 's determined to forge ahead with the referendum determining whether or not the tiny republic can attain full sovereignty . " we have made our intentions clear to both our partners both in belgrade and brussels , " he said . more differences than similarities the loose union has always been seen as a provisional solution only , with its primary task billed as foreign and defense policy , while the respective republics retained autonomy regarding economic and customs issues . montenegro has adopted the euro , while serbia is holding tightly onto the dinar .
montenegro relies heavily on tourism , while serbia 's economic mainstays are agriculture and industry - differences which make a cohesive tax and customs policy impossible . and while serbia is keen to invest in its dilapidated armed forces , montenegro wants to introduce a 4000-strong professional army . on march 3 , the mandates of all the deputies in the state union parliament expire .
but with montenegro and serbia unable to reach agreement as to how new elections should be held , the mandates are expected to be extended until a solution is found . time for brussels to intervene belgrade hopes this solution will come from brussels .
eu foreign policy chief javier solana - one of the signatories of the belgrade agreement - has invited djukanovic to brussels , which has always insisted serbia and montenegro will only ever join the eu in a joint bid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schroeder and svetozar marovic many in belgrade agree .
" i believe we will have a positive feasibility study by late march , and can then begin stabilization talks with the eu and also finally join nato , " said svetozar marovic , the montenegrin president of the union of serbia-montenegro and member of djukanovic 's democratic party of socialists -lrb- pictured with gerhard schröder -rrb- . but neither marovic nor the foreign minister of serbia-montenegro , vuk draskovic , appear able to influence the two sides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a kosovo albanian family walks under an albanian flag into a polling station to vote for kosovo 's general elections in capital pristina , on saturday , oct .
23 , 2004 .
voters in the u.n.-run province of kosovo elected provincial leaders saturday in a major test for international officials ' efforts to reconcile bitterly divided ethnic communities and establish a multiethnic society .
about 1.3 million voters are eligible to elect representatives to a 120-seat assembly , which in turn will elect a president and a government that holds limited authority -lrb- ap photo / visar kryeziu -rrb- the serbian government , led by prime minister vojislav kostunica is refusing to negotiate montenegrin independence , fearing it may encourage a claim for independence from serbia on the part of the kosovo-albanians , ahead of the un 's negotiations about the long-term status kosovo , which is currently an international protectorate . ulterior motives ? western europe is beginning sit up and take notice .
franz-lothar altmann , balkans expert at the berlin foundation for science and politics , says a a relaxing of joint-rule between montenegro and serbia is by no means out of the question . " why should n't the union become even looser ? " he says .
" one could even go a step further and include kosovo in the equation . " altmann also points out that independence for montenegro is very much in djukanovic 's interests .
the prime minister faces a trial in italy on charges of involvement with organized crime and cigarette smuggling in the 1990s .
it was recently decided in italy that because he is not the head of a sovereign state , he does not enjoy immunity from prosecution . were this to change , djukanovic could no longer be tried in an italian court . filip slavkovic -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de killing of serbian prime minister fuels fears about country 's stability zoran djindjic , the man who made many enemies as he tried to transform the serbia of slobodan milosevic , was assassinated on wednesday .

but his serbian counterpart could n't agree less . two weeks ago , montenegro 's prime minister milo djukanovic wrote to the serbian government outlining his hopes for the future of the two nations .
his plan foresaw serbia and montenegro ending the state union of serbia and montenegro and forming independent nations , without a union parliament but with a form of federal council . although the two states would maintain a central administration in charge of economic and political affairs , they would operate separate foreign and defence policies . premature pressure the union of serbia and montenegro was voted into existence by the yugoslav parliament in 2003 .
the eu-brokered belgrade agreement marked an end to a long-drawn out constitutional crisis and was designed to remain in place for a minimum of three years , after which the two republics were to hold referendums on whether to maintain the union arrangement or vote for independence . djukanovic has made no bones about his desire to end the union and insists his proposal does not represent any breach of the agreement , even though this is supposedly valid until 2006 .
but he 's determined to forge ahead with the referendum determining whether or not the tiny republic can attain full sovereignty . " we have made our intentions clear to both our partners both in belgrade and brussels , " he said . more differences than similarities the loose union has always been seen as a provisional solution only , with its primary task billed as foreign and defense policy , while the respective republics retained autonomy regarding economic and customs issues . montenegro has adopted the euro , while serbia is holding tightly onto the dinar .

democrat senator joseph biden joined in , saying that the lifting of the ban would be " a non-starter with congress " after he and lugar met with president bush in the white house . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president chen shui-bian of taiwan the warning from congress follows a rebuke from taiwan 's president chen shui-bian on tuesday when he told the eu via a video link that eu plans to lift the arms embargo endangered the military balance in east asia and accused some in europe of double standards in currying favour with beijing . he added that the planned lifting of the arms ban could also let the chinese think it did not need to proceed with democratic reforms . " should the eu decide to lift its arms embargo against china it might lead to a tilt in the military balance in the taiwan strait , which would pose a clear threat to peace and stability , " he said . bush returned from his european tour smarting from his china-related encounters with european leaders , especially the one that heralded a widely reported and embarrassing no-nonsense declaration from french president jacques chirac that europe intended to lift the ban .
the end of the embargo has been penciled in for may 8 , when the eu holds a meeting with the chinese leadership . eu must prepare a case for congress the europeans are expected to make a case to congress for acceptance of their decision by arguing that the embargo was a response to tiananmen square massacre in 1989 , and that china has moved on dramatically since then .
during his visit , bush let it be known that he was " open minded " about the lifting of the ban , but told eu leaders that they would have to convince congress . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george w bush , left , poses with european union commission president jose manual barroso , following an eu summit at the european union commission headquarters in brussels , tuesday feb .

if they ca n't , the repairs made to the us-eu relationship during bush 's visit could come unravel . " europe can do defense trade with china or it can do defense trade with the us .
it ca n't do both , " daniel goure , a pentagon consultant and vice president of the lexington institute military think-tank , told the british guardian newspaper . europeans want discussion with us the europeans went into damage limitation mode soon after the statements from congress were issued . " it is not our intention that this change will increase the quantity or the quality of arms exports to china , " an eu commission spokeswoman told reporters .
" neither is it our intention to do anything to upset the military equilibrium in south-east asia .
there are concerns in america about high technology transfer .
we have made it clear that we want to talk to them about this . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us defense department has also made its feelings known regarding the situation .
the pentagon is keeping a concerned eye on an ambitious chinese military build-up which its experts believe is aimed at threatening taiwan - a country which the united sates is committed to defending . chinese build-up worrying pentagon china has allegedly boosted its military with orders of some 600 advanced russian fighter jets , mig-31s and mig-35s , and had bought modern russian destroyers and submarines .
but the pentagon is most concerned about the possible sale of advanced european communications and sensor systems , like fiber optics , infra-red , sonar and radar scanners . a recent report in the new york times has done nothing to calm us jitters , with the paper citing us intelligence pictures showing the chinese build-up and the apparent construction of 23 amphibious assault ships . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu intends to end china 's arms embargo the european union announced on tuesday that it intends to bring its 16-year arms embargo against china to an end , much to the regret of visiting us president george w. bush .

unlike many of his peers , the pioneering economist is happy to work in germany - despite his international reputation . why do you always get out-bid on internet auctions ?
are buyer 's recommendations reliable ?
why does the price always rocket at the last minute ? if you want to understand how ebay works , then 36-year-old axel ockenfels is your man .
online bidding practices are one of his areas of expertise , and his students at the laboratory for controlled experimental economics at cologne university are finding out what it takes to get what you want in the cut-throat world of the online marketplace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " typically , what happens is , the person who wins , pays too much , " says ockenfels .
" the person who wins is n't the person who 's estimated the value of the product most precisely , but the person who 's most overestimated its value . " experimental economics ockenfels ' analysis of contemporary economic behavior has propelled him to the forefront of his field .
a protegé of reinhard selten , germany 's one and only winner of the nobel prize for economics , ockenfels ' research into experimental economics and game theory sheds light on the way modern man behaves when it comes to economic decision making - and proves that traditional economics has had its day . " the hypothesis that man is rational and egotistical is one that was n't put to the test for a long time , " explains ockenfels .
" man probably is n't as self-serving as economists would like him to be .
man himself has n't changed , but economic theories have .
new ideas and empirical evidence have been incorporated into economic theory and the concept of the ' homo oeconomicus ' is now less accepted . " the psychology of economics according to game theory , there 's a key psychological aspect to economics .
envy , rivalry and a desire for fairness all play a role . " people 's first priority is n't just getting a bargain , " insists ockenfels .
" they also keep an eye on what other people are getting and their status in their peer group . " " it 's important to understand theory , " he stresses , " but it 's also important to understand how people react .
i feel that a lot of textbooks neglect the empirical and experimental dimensions of economic behaviour and overly concentrate on theories developed in ivory towers . " leaving the ivory tower - but not germany no one can accuse axel ockenfels of living in an ivory tower .
at the age of 36 , he 's already one of the influential economic scientists in the world , hotly pursued by the world 's best universities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but unlike many of germany 's a-list scientists , he 's never been tempted to join the brain-drain crowd and head to the us to enjoy the higher salaries and first-class research opportunities available at the country 's generously funded ivy league schools .
now that he 's scooped germany 's most lucrative research prize , worth € 1.55 million -lrb- $ 2 million -rrb- , he probably feels vindicated in his decision . as far as he 's concerned , germany is where he can work best . " no other country in the world has as many experimental laboratories , " he says .

the iaea had reported key areas where iran was refusing to cooperate with un inspectors . " while transparency visits have taken place , iran seems to have been determined to limit their scope , " said british ambassador robin wright , reading from the joint statement . the europeans still took a more conciliatory tone than the americans .
they noted that iran 's decision to suspend uranium enrichment - which can be used for either nuclear energy or to make atomic weapons - was " a voluntary commitment " and urged tehran to keep its word . the us maintains that iran 's nuclear activities are designed for a clandestine weapons program .
the head of the us delegation to the iaea board , jackie sanders , cited " an alarming number " of unresolved questions and warned that the iaea could not put off " forever " taking tehran before the un security council for possible sanctions . refusal of inspections causes friction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like the us , the europeans criticized iran for refusing to allow un inspectors to visit its military site in parchin , a site where there are definitely nuclear materials , where washington accuses tehran of simulating testing of nuclear weapons . the iranian delegate to the iaea , cyrus nasseri , said iran was not allowing a second visit to parchin , after a first one in january , in part because it was concerned about information leaks " in view of potential threats of military strikes against iran 's safeguarded and other facilities " by what he called " a major nuclear weapons state " in a clear reference to the united states . but iaea director-general mohamed el baradei said that iran was a " special case " since its nuclear program " has been clandestine for almost two decades " and he asked tehran to allow widespread visits by un inspectors .
the europeans endorsed el baradei 's call for iran to come clean " in order to make up for the confidence deficit created by past activities and to build the necessary confidence in the future , " the european statement said . us president george w. bush has said washington is seeking a diplomatic solution in iran and supports eu talks with tehran .
but bush has said all options , including the military one , remain on the table . bush considers dangling the carrot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , it appears that the president is increasingly aligning himself with european efforts and is considering offering incentives to iran , according to us officials on thursday .
in a preparatory statement ahead of an expected announcement of the us strategy later this week , the united states said it would not block iran as it seeks to start the process of joining the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , and would not stand in the way of european allies if they want to sell tehran parts for civilian aircraft . white house spokesman scott mcclellan said the president had not finalized his decision but said that the united states and europe were discussing " how we can move forward together on a common strategy to get iran to abandon any ambitions for a nuclear weapon . " " we want to do our part to support the european efforts .
this is about strengthening their diplomatic approach to resolving this matter , " he added . in return for supporting incentives , it is likely that the americans would insist that iran abandon uranium enrichment , the major sticking point in the on-going negotiations .
but while it appears that the us has shifted considerable ground , the reality is a little different .
the europeans and the americans would get the better end of the deal if iran accepts the incentives . wto accession a one-sided deal ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- headquarters in geneva , switzerland .
" it is a carrot , and it 's not a very big one , " a senior congressional aide involved in the wto issue was quoted as saying by reuters . membership of the wto can take years after a country has been granted observer status , the first stepping stone to full accession . iran would have a stipulated five years after observer status is achieved to begin the process of moving toward full membership and actual entry into the wto can take many more after that .
however , negotiations on iran 's membership could be strung out indefinitely by the us , binding the iranians to years of concessions over its nuclear program . if the iranians see through this and refuse to accept the incentives , maintaining their efforts to enrich uranium , then the us would resort to its original course of action which would be to take iran to the un security council for possible sanctions . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran signs russian nuclear deal iran and russia on sunday signed a landmark nuclear fuel accord that paves the way for the islamic republic 's first atomic power station , a project the united states alleges is part of a cover for weapons development .

but a scandal involving the abuse of tourist visas has dented his reputation and is threatening to unravel his political future . last weekend , fischer gave a speech that was likely one of the most difficult of his lengthy political career .
in an address to members of his greens party at a regional congress , he had to admit he had made mistakes in handling a widening affair in which foreign criminals made use of relaxed visa requirements – approved by fischer – to smuggle people into germany . while he rejected demands by the conservative opposition to resign , the fact that fischer felt compelled to devote his speech to the visa scandal shows just how much the matter has the experienced political operator on the defensive . " fischer certainly underestimated the situation , " dr. jürgen falter , director of the domestic politics program at the university of mainz , told dw-world .
" at the moment it does n't look like it will push him from office , but we 'll have to wait and see if more serious revelations come to light . " opposition politicians claim thousands of illegal immigrants – including many from ukraine and china – were able to enter germany between 2000 and 2003 after tourist visa criteria were relaxed .
they say that led to an increase in organized crime , drugs and prostitution on fischer 's watch . admirers and enemies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer looks on during the greens party congress in rostock , eastern germany , on saturday , nov .
24 , 2001 .
known as someone who does n't suffer fools gladly , fischer has as many enemies as he does admirers in parliament , the press , and even in his own party .
over the years , he has developed a reputation as being aloof and arrogant to journalists and his colleagues .
perhaps worse , he has the nasty habit of unnecessarily humiliating those working for him at the foreign ministry .
it appears as if fischer is now reaping what he 's sown as those who feel slighted by the minister look for some payback . " he always thought he was almost invulnerable and could survive anything , which was the case up till now , " fischer 's biographer bernd ulrich said in a recent radio interview with deutschlandfunk .
" that 's why he 's approached this matter with a certain amount of arrogance . " yet despite his prickly public persona , fischer has consistently ranked as one of germany 's most popular politicians .
born in 1948 as the humble son of butcher in stuttgart , fischer has one of the most unconventional backgrounds of the country 's political elite .
having left school in 10th grade , he made a living in the 1970s as a taxi driver before helping set up the greens and leading the upstart party into parliament in the 1980s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer said he recognized himself on this picture of being beaten by the police in 1968 .
other photos showed fischer beating a police officer .
while he lived in frankfurt , he also became involved in the leftwing student protests of 1968 .
during that turbulent time he was involved in violent street fighting with the police .
pictures of him made public in 2001 in a black motorcycle helmet kicking a police officer during a protest led conservatives to call for his head . authentic and quirky but german chancellor gerhard schröder stuck by him back then and the public chalked up the affair as a youthful indiscretion on fischer 's part .
and for many germans , it was simply more proof of his " authenticity " that has made him both the greens ' elder statesman and a quirky public figure that could do little wrong . " he has a personality bonus , " explained richard hilmer from the public polling organization infratest / dimap .
" he 's considered a different kind of politician .
his moving background is considered convincing and authentic . " but the visa affair has battered fischer 's reputation in the eyes of many .
for the first time in three years , fischer last week lost his status as germany 's most popular politician in a regular poll by public broadcaster zdf . " he 's smacked quite a few people around and that has come back to haunt him .
there appears to be quite a bit of schadenfreude over his predicament , " dr. falter said , adding he expected fischer to survive the current scandal largely intact .
" if he makes it through this he 'll be know as the teflon minister .
nothing will stick to him . " schröder 's backing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka and gerd .
as in 2001 , schröder has once again demonstratively backed his foreign minister , saying there was no question that fischer will stay in office .

" he 's too important for the stability of the coalition , " he said , adding that because of the visa affair fischer had also become a liability .

" opposition politicians claim thousands of illegal immigrants – including many from ukraine and china – were able to enter germany between 2000 and 2003 after tourist visa criteria were relaxed .
they say that led to an increase in organized crime , drugs and prostitution on fischer 's watch . admirers and enemies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer looks on during the greens party congress in rostock , eastern germany , on saturday , nov .
24 , 2001 .
known as someone who does n't suffer fools gladly , fischer has as many enemies as he does admirers in parliament , the press , and even in his own party .
over the years , he has developed a reputation as being aloof and arrogant to journalists and his colleagues .
perhaps worse , he has the nasty habit of unnecessarily humiliating those working for him at the foreign ministry .
it appears as if fischer is now reaping what he 's sown as those who feel slighted by the minister look for some payback . " he always thought he was almost invulnerable and could survive anything , which was the case up till now , " fischer 's biographer bernd ulrich said in a recent radio interview with deutschlandfunk .
" that 's why he 's approached this matter with a certain amount of arrogance . " yet despite his prickly public persona , fischer has consistently ranked as one of germany 's most popular politicians .
born in 1948 as the humble son of butcher in stuttgart , fischer has one of the most unconventional backgrounds of the country 's political elite .
having left school in 10th grade , he made a living in the 1970s as a taxi driver before helping set up the greens and leading the upstart party into parliament in the 1980s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer said he recognized himself on this picture of being beaten by the police in 1968 .
other photos showed fischer beating a police officer .
while he lived in frankfurt , he also became involved in the leftwing student protests of 1968 .
during that turbulent time he was involved in violent street fighting with the police .
pictures of him made public in 2001 in a black motorcycle helmet kicking a police officer during a protest led conservatives to call for his head . authentic and quirky but german chancellor gerhard schröder stuck by him back then and the public chalked up the affair as a youthful indiscretion on fischer 's part .
and for many germans , it was simply more proof of his " authenticity " that has made him both the greens ' elder statesman and a quirky public figure that could do little wrong . " he has a personality bonus , " explained richard hilmer from the public polling organization infratest / dimap .
" he 's considered a different kind of politician .
his moving background is considered convincing and authentic . " but the visa affair has battered fischer 's reputation in the eyes of many .
for the first time in three years , fischer last week lost his status as germany 's most popular politician in a regular poll by public broadcaster zdf . " he 's smacked quite a few people around and that has come back to haunt him .
there appears to be quite a bit of schadenfreude over his predicament , " dr. falter said , adding he expected fischer to survive the current scandal largely intact .
" if he makes it through this he 'll be know as the teflon minister .
nothing will stick to him . " schröder 's backing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka and gerd .
as in 2001 , schröder has once again demonstratively backed his foreign minister , saying there was no question that fischer will stay in office .
the chancellor has also expressed his desire to stand for reelection in 2006 with fischer at his side . fischer biographer ulrich even said the governing center-left coalition of social democrats and greens could possible survive with another chancellor than schröder , but that the foreign minister was indispensable . " he 's too important for the stability of the coalition , " he said , adding that because of the visa affair fischer had also become a liability .

but a scandal involving the abuse of tourist visas has dented his reputation and is threatening to unravel his political future . last weekend , fischer gave a speech that was likely one of the most difficult of his lengthy political career .
in an address to members of his greens party at a regional congress , he had to admit he had made mistakes in handling a widening affair in which foreign criminals made use of relaxed visa requirements – approved by fischer – to smuggle people into germany . while he rejected demands by the conservative opposition to resign , the fact that fischer felt compelled to devote his speech to the visa scandal shows just how much the matter has the experienced political operator on the defensive . " fischer certainly underestimated the situation , " dr. jürgen falter , director of the domestic politics program at the university of mainz , told dw-world .
" at the moment it does n't look like it will push him from office , but we 'll have to wait and see if more serious revelations come to light .

but many cases remain unsolved and bitter feuds prevent other paintings being returned . a cultural legacy left over from the third reich which german museums continue to face is the return of stolen art .
since 1998 when a conference in washington heralded the beginning of a concerted effort by germany and 43 other countries to find and return artworks stolen by the nazis during world war ii , museums across the country have experienced the headaches attached to this quest . one on-going saga involving three paintings seized by the nazis between 1937 and 1939 was resolved this week when they were returned to their original jewish owners after a long legal wrangle , a local official said on wednesday . a spokeswoman for city authorities in wuppertal , western germany , said the handover , which should have happened more than a year ago but was held up by a legal technicality , would go ahead " as soon as possible , once the conditions for their return are set in a contract . " the process of handing back the three paintings , which are currently on display in the city 's heydt museum , had previously been delayed by doubts about who the real owners were . the work " felsige flusslandschaft , " by frankfurt artist otto scholderer , was bought by the museum in 1939 after its forced sale a year earlier .
" erinnerung vom dampfboot auf der donau , " by adolph menzel , was given as a gift to the heydt in 1956 . the owners of hans von marees ' " tatar mit pferd , " forced into sale in 1937 , fled germany for the netherlands where they were caught and killed in a concentration camp in 1944 .

returning stolen art to the rightful owners 60 years after it was first taken is an awkward affair .
despite the best efforts of the german states and local authorities , which have been keeping an internet database of reportedly stolen artefacts , many critics have derided these attempts , citing inexact information and conflicts of interest . one particularly high-profile case is still caught in a bitter impasse due to these reasons .

the museum of modern art turned down pleas from two jewish families to hold onto two paintings in a traveling exhibit while they press claims that the artworks were lost to nazi wartime plundering .
there are very few legal statutes regarding the return of stolen art appropriated by the nazis .
while court rulings decide the fate of some , the majority of cases are fought on moral and ethical grounds and many victims of the third reich base their cases on emotional pleas . however , since the summer of 2003 , the federal stolen art ethics committee has mediated in many cases between victims and museums .

the iaea had reported key areas where iran was refusing to cooperate with un inspectors . " while transparency visits have taken place , iran seems to have been determined to limit their scope , " said british ambassador robin wright , reading from the joint statement . the europeans still took a more conciliatory tone than the americans .
they noted that iran 's decision to suspend uranium enrichment - which can be used for either nuclear energy or to make atomic weapons - was " a voluntary commitment " and urged tehran to keep its word . the us maintains that iran 's nuclear activities are designed for a clandestine weapons program .
the head of the us delegation to the iaea board , jackie sanders , cited " an alarming number " of unresolved questions and warned that the iaea could not put off " forever " taking tehran before the un security council for possible sanctions . refusal of inspections causes friction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like the us , the europeans criticized iran for refusing to allow un inspectors to visit its military site in parchin , a site where there are definitely nuclear materials , where washington accuses tehran of simulating testing of nuclear weapons . the iranian delegate to the iaea , cyrus nasseri , said iran was not allowing a second visit to parchin , after a first one in january , in part because it was concerned about information leaks " in view of potential threats of military strikes against iran 's safeguarded and other facilities " by what he called " a major nuclear weapons state " in a clear reference to the united states . but iaea director-general mohamed el baradei said that iran was a " special case " since its nuclear program " has been clandestine for almost two decades " and he asked tehran to allow widespread visits by un inspectors .
the europeans endorsed el baradei 's call for iran to come clean " in order to make up for the confidence deficit created by past activities and to build the necessary confidence in the future , " the european statement said . us president george w. bush has said washington is seeking a diplomatic solution in iran and supports eu talks with tehran .
but bush has said all options , including the military one , remain on the table . bush considers dangling the carrot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , it appears that the president is increasingly aligning himself with european efforts and is considering offering incentives to iran , according to us officials on thursday .
in a preparatory statement ahead of an expected announcement of the us strategy later this week , the united states said it would not block iran as it seeks to start the process of joining the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , and would not stand in the way of european allies if they want to sell tehran parts for civilian aircraft . white house spokesman scott mcclellan said the president had not finalized his decision but said that the united states and europe were discussing " how we can move forward together on a common strategy to get iran to abandon any ambitions for a nuclear weapon . " " we want to do our part to support the european efforts .
this is about strengthening their diplomatic approach to resolving this matter , " he added . in return for supporting incentives , it is likely that the americans would insist that iran abandon uranium enrichment , the major sticking point in the on-going negotiations .
but while it appears that the us has shifted considerable ground , the reality is a little different .
the europeans and the americans would get the better end of the deal if iran accepts the incentives . wto accession a one-sided deal ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- headquarters in geneva , switzerland .
" it is a carrot , and it 's not a very big one , " a senior congressional aide involved in the wto issue was quoted as saying by reuters . membership of the wto can take years after a country has been granted observer status , the first stepping stone to full accession . iran would have a stipulated five years after observer status is achieved to begin the process of moving toward full membership and actual entry into the wto can take many more after that .
however , negotiations on iran 's membership could be strung out indefinitely by the us , binding the iranians to years of concessions over its nuclear program . if the iranians see through this and refuse to accept the incentives , maintaining their efforts to enrich uranium , then the us would resort to its original course of action which would be to take iran to the un security council for possible sanctions . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran signs russian nuclear deal iran and russia on sunday signed a landmark nuclear fuel accord that paves the way for the islamic republic 's first atomic power station , a project the united states alleges is part of a cover for weapons development .

the iaea had reported key areas where iran was refusing to cooperate with un inspectors . " while transparency visits have taken place , iran seems to have been determined to limit their scope , " said british ambassador robin wright , reading from the joint statement . the europeans still took a more conciliatory tone than the americans .
they noted that iran 's decision to suspend uranium enrichment - which can be used for either nuclear energy or to make atomic weapons - was " a voluntary commitment " and urged tehran to keep its word . the us maintains that iran 's nuclear activities are designed for a clandestine weapons program .
the head of the us delegation to the iaea board , jackie sanders , cited " an alarming number " of unresolved questions and warned that the iaea could not put off " forever " taking tehran before the un security council for possible sanctions . refusal of inspections causes friction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like the us , the europeans criticized iran for refusing to allow un inspectors to visit its military site in parchin , a site where there are definitely nuclear materials , where washington accuses tehran of simulating testing of nuclear weapons . the iranian delegate to the iaea , cyrus nasseri , said iran was not allowing a second visit to parchin , after a first one in january , in part because it was concerned about information leaks " in view of potential threats of military strikes against iran 's safeguarded and other facilities " by what he called " a major nuclear weapons state " in a clear reference to the united states . but iaea director-general mohamed el baradei said that iran was a " special case " since its nuclear program " has been clandestine for almost two decades " and he asked tehran to allow widespread visits by un inspectors .
the europeans endorsed el baradei 's call for iran to come clean " in order to make up for the confidence deficit created by past activities and to build the necessary confidence in the future , " the european statement said . us president george w. bush has said washington is seeking a diplomatic solution in iran and supports eu talks with tehran .

in a preparatory statement ahead of an expected announcement of the us strategy later this week , the united states said it would not block iran as it seeks to start the process of joining the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , and would not stand in the way of european allies if they want to sell tehran parts for civilian aircraft . white house spokesman scott mcclellan said the president had not finalized his decision but said that the united states and europe were discussing " how we can move forward together on a common strategy to get iran to abandon any ambitions for a nuclear weapon . " " we want to do our part to support the european efforts .
this is about strengthening their diplomatic approach to resolving this matter , " he added . in return for supporting incentives , it is likely that the americans would insist that iran abandon uranium enrichment , the major sticking point in the on-going negotiations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.03.2005 joint-rule in serbia-montenegro in jeopardy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toasting independence : djukanovic after his 2001 election victory with parliamentary mandates now expired , montenegro 's prime minister is calling for an end to the serbia-montenegro union .
but his serbian counterpart could n't agree less . two weeks ago , montenegro 's prime minister milo djukanovic wrote to the serbian government outlining his hopes for the future of the two nations .
his plan foresaw serbia and montenegro ending the state union of serbia and montenegro and forming independent nations , without a union parliament but with a form of federal council . although the two states would maintain a central administration in charge of economic and political affairs , they would operate separate foreign and defence policies . premature pressure the union of serbia and montenegro was voted into existence by the yugoslav parliament in 2003 .
the eu-brokered belgrade agreement marked an end to a long-drawn out constitutional crisis and was designed to remain in place for a minimum of three years , after which the two republics were to hold referendums on whether to maintain the union arrangement or vote for independence . djukanovic has made no bones about his desire to end the union and insists his proposal does not represent any breach of the agreement , even though this is supposedly valid until 2006 .
but he 's determined to forge ahead with the referendum determining whether or not the tiny republic can attain full sovereignty . " we have made our intentions clear to both our partners both in belgrade and brussels , " he said . more differences than similarities the loose union has always been seen as a provisional solution only , with its primary task billed as foreign and defense policy , while the respective republics retained autonomy regarding economic and customs issues . montenegro has adopted the euro , while serbia is holding tightly onto the dinar .
montenegro relies heavily on tourism , while serbia 's economic mainstays are agriculture and industry - differences which make a cohesive tax and customs policy impossible . and while serbia is keen to invest in its dilapidated armed forces , montenegro wants to introduce a 4000-strong professional army . on march 3 , the mandates of all the deputies in the state union parliament expire .
but with montenegro and serbia unable to reach agreement as to how new elections should be held , the mandates are expected to be extended until a solution is found . time for brussels to intervene belgrade hopes this solution will come from brussels .
eu foreign policy chief javier solana - one of the signatories of the belgrade agreement - has invited djukanovic to brussels , which has always insisted serbia and montenegro will only ever join the eu in a joint bid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schroeder and svetozar marovic many in belgrade agree .
" i believe we will have a positive feasibility study by late march , and can then begin stabilization talks with the eu and also finally join nato , " said svetozar marovic , the montenegrin president of the union of serbia-montenegro and member of djukanovic 's democratic party of socialists -lrb- pictured with gerhard schröder -rrb- . but neither marovic nor the foreign minister of serbia-montenegro , vuk draskovic , appear able to influence the two sides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a kosovo albanian family walks under an albanian flag into a polling station to vote for kosovo 's general elections in capital pristina , on saturday , oct .
23 , 2004 .
voters in the u.n.-run province of kosovo elected provincial leaders saturday in a major test for international officials ' efforts to reconcile bitterly divided ethnic communities and establish a multiethnic society .

franz-lothar altmann , balkans expert at the berlin foundation for science and politics , says a a relaxing of joint-rule between montenegro and serbia is by no means out of the question . " why should n't the union become even looser ? " he says .
" one could even go a step further and include kosovo in the equation . " altmann also points out that independence for montenegro is very much in djukanovic 's interests .
the prime minister faces a trial in italy on charges of involvement with organized crime and cigarette smuggling in the 1990s .
it was recently decided in italy that because he is not the head of a sovereign state , he does not enjoy immunity from prosecution . were this to change , djukanovic could no longer be tried in an italian court . filip slavkovic -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de killing of serbian prime minister fuels fears about country 's stability zoran djindjic , the man who made many enemies as he tried to transform the serbia of slobodan milosevic , was assassinated on wednesday .

but his serbian counterpart could n't agree less . two weeks ago , montenegro 's prime minister milo djukanovic wrote to the serbian government outlining his hopes for the future of the two nations .
his plan foresaw serbia and montenegro ending the state union of serbia and montenegro and forming independent nations , without a union parliament but with a form of federal council . although the two states would maintain a central administration in charge of economic and political affairs , they would operate separate foreign and defence policies . premature pressure the union of serbia and montenegro was voted into existence by the yugoslav parliament in 2003 .
the eu-brokered belgrade agreement marked an end to a long-drawn out constitutional crisis and was designed to remain in place for a minimum of three years , after which the two republics were to hold referendums on whether to maintain the union arrangement or vote for independence . djukanovic has made no bones about his desire to end the union and insists his proposal does not represent any breach of the agreement , even though this is supposedly valid until 2006 .

but his serbian counterpart could n't agree less . two weeks ago , montenegro 's prime minister milo djukanovic wrote to the serbian government outlining his hopes for the future of the two nations .
his plan foresaw serbia and montenegro ending the state union of serbia and montenegro and forming independent nations , without a union parliament but with a form of federal council . although the two states would maintain a central administration in charge of economic and political affairs , they would operate separate foreign and defence policies . premature pressure the union of serbia and montenegro was voted into existence by the yugoslav parliament in 2003 .
the eu-brokered belgrade agreement marked an end to a long-drawn out constitutional crisis and was designed to remain in place for a minimum of three years , after which the two republics were to hold referendums on whether to maintain the union arrangement or vote for independence . djukanovic has made no bones about his desire to end the union and insists his proposal does not represent any breach of the agreement , even though this is supposedly valid until 2006 .
but he 's determined to forge ahead with the referendum determining whether or not the tiny republic can attain full sovereignty . " we have made our intentions clear to both our partners both in belgrade and brussels , " he said . more differences than similarities the loose union has always been seen as a provisional solution only , with its primary task billed as foreign and defense policy , while the respective republics retained autonomy regarding economic and customs issues . montenegro has adopted the euro , while serbia is holding tightly onto the dinar .
montenegro relies heavily on tourism , while serbia 's economic mainstays are agriculture and industry - differences which make a cohesive tax and customs policy impossible . and while serbia is keen to invest in its dilapidated armed forces , montenegro wants to introduce a 4000-strong professional army . on march 3 , the mandates of all the deputies in the state union parliament expire .
but with montenegro and serbia unable to reach agreement as to how new elections should be held , the mandates are expected to be extended until a solution is found . time for brussels to intervene belgrade hopes this solution will come from brussels .
eu foreign policy chief javier solana - one of the signatories of the belgrade agreement - has invited djukanovic to brussels , which has always insisted serbia and montenegro will only ever join the eu in a joint bid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schroeder and svetozar marovic many in belgrade agree .
" i believe we will have a positive feasibility study by late march , and can then begin stabilization talks with the eu and also finally join nato , " said svetozar marovic , the montenegrin president of the union of serbia-montenegro and member of djukanovic 's democratic party of socialists -lrb- pictured with gerhard schröder -rrb- . but neither marovic nor the foreign minister of serbia-montenegro , vuk draskovic , appear able to influence the two sides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a kosovo albanian family walks under an albanian flag into a polling station to vote for kosovo 's general elections in capital pristina , on saturday , oct .
23 , 2004 .
voters in the u.n.-run province of kosovo elected provincial leaders saturday in a major test for international officials ' efforts to reconcile bitterly divided ethnic communities and establish a multiethnic society .
about 1.3 million voters are eligible to elect representatives to a 120-seat assembly , which in turn will elect a president and a government that holds limited authority -lrb- ap photo / visar kryeziu -rrb- the serbian government , led by prime minister vojislav kostunica is refusing to negotiate montenegrin independence , fearing it may encourage a claim for independence from serbia on the part of the kosovo-albanians , ahead of the un 's negotiations about the long-term status kosovo , which is currently an international protectorate . ulterior motives ? western europe is beginning sit up and take notice .
franz-lothar altmann , balkans expert at the berlin foundation for science and politics , says a a relaxing of joint-rule between montenegro and serbia is by no means out of the question . " why should n't the union become even looser ? " he says .
" one could even go a step further and include kosovo in the equation . " altmann also points out that independence for montenegro is very much in djukanovic 's interests .
the prime minister faces a trial in italy on charges of involvement with organized crime and cigarette smuggling in the 1990s .
it was recently decided in italy that because he is not the head of a sovereign state , he does not enjoy immunity from prosecution . were this to change , djukanovic could no longer be tried in an italian court . filip slavkovic -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de killing of serbian prime minister fuels fears about country 's stability zoran djindjic , the man who made many enemies as he tried to transform the serbia of slobodan milosevic , was assassinated on wednesday .

democrat senator joseph biden joined in , saying that the lifting of the ban would be " a non-starter with congress " after he and lugar met with president bush in the white house . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president chen shui-bian of taiwan the warning from congress follows a rebuke from taiwan 's president chen shui-bian on tuesday when he told the eu via a video link that eu plans to lift the arms embargo endangered the military balance in east asia and accused some in europe of double standards in currying favour with beijing . he added that the planned lifting of the arms ban could also let the chinese think it did not need to proceed with democratic reforms . " should the eu decide to lift its arms embargo against china it might lead to a tilt in the military balance in the taiwan strait , which would pose a clear threat to peace and stability , " he said . bush returned from his european tour smarting from his china-related encounters with european leaders , especially the one that heralded a widely reported and embarrassing no-nonsense declaration from french president jacques chirac that europe intended to lift the ban .
the end of the embargo has been penciled in for may 8 , when the eu holds a meeting with the chinese leadership . eu must prepare a case for congress the europeans are expected to make a case to congress for acceptance of their decision by arguing that the embargo was a response to tiananmen square massacre in 1989 , and that china has moved on dramatically since then .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 03.03.2005 us , europe aligned on iran nuke incentives großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and europe are moving closer in their approaches to iran while the europeans talked tough on wednesday , calling for more transparency from iran in its nuclear activities , the us announced that it may back europe 's incentive-based negotiations with tehran . germany , france and britain joined the united states and the united nations nuclear watchdog on wednesday in calling on iran to show more transparency regarding its nuclear activities . the three european union countries , which have been negotiating with iran to stop its uranium enrichment program in exchange for trade and security benefits , issued a joint statement to the board of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- in vienna .
the iaea had reported key areas where iran was refusing to cooperate with un inspectors . " while transparency visits have taken place , iran seems to have been determined to limit their scope , " said british ambassador robin wright , reading from the joint statement . the europeans still took a more conciliatory tone than the americans .
they noted that iran 's decision to suspend uranium enrichment - which can be used for either nuclear energy or to make atomic weapons - was " a voluntary commitment " and urged tehran to keep its word . the us maintains that iran 's nuclear activities are designed for a clandestine weapons program .
the head of the us delegation to the iaea board , jackie sanders , cited " an alarming number " of unresolved questions and warned that the iaea could not put off " forever " taking tehran before the un security council for possible sanctions . refusal of inspections causes friction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like the us , the europeans criticized iran for refusing to allow un inspectors to visit its military site in parchin , a site where there are definitely nuclear materials , where washington accuses tehran of simulating testing of nuclear weapons . the iranian delegate to the iaea , cyrus nasseri , said iran was not allowing a second visit to parchin , after a first one in january , in part because it was concerned about information leaks " in view of potential threats of military strikes against iran 's safeguarded and other facilities " by what he called " a major nuclear weapons state " in a clear reference to the united states . but iaea director-general mohamed el baradei said that iran was a " special case " since its nuclear program " has been clandestine for almost two decades " and he asked tehran to allow widespread visits by un inspectors .
the europeans endorsed el baradei 's call for iran to come clean " in order to make up for the confidence deficit created by past activities and to build the necessary confidence in the future , " the european statement said . us president george w. bush has said washington is seeking a diplomatic solution in iran and supports eu talks with tehran .
but bush has said all options , including the military one , remain on the table . bush considers dangling the carrot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , it appears that the president is increasingly aligning himself with european efforts and is considering offering incentives to iran , according to us officials on thursday .
in a preparatory statement ahead of an expected announcement of the us strategy later this week , the united states said it would not block iran as it seeks to start the process of joining the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , and would not stand in the way of european allies if they want to sell tehran parts for civilian aircraft . white house spokesman scott mcclellan said the president had not finalized his decision but said that the united states and europe were discussing " how we can move forward together on a common strategy to get iran to abandon any ambitions for a nuclear weapon . " " we want to do our part to support the european efforts .
this is about strengthening their diplomatic approach to resolving this matter , " he added . in return for supporting incentives , it is likely that the americans would insist that iran abandon uranium enrichment , the major sticking point in the on-going negotiations .
but while it appears that the us has shifted considerable ground , the reality is a little different .
the europeans and the americans would get the better end of the deal if iran accepts the incentives . wto accession a one-sided deal ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- headquarters in geneva , switzerland .
" it is a carrot , and it 's not a very big one , " a senior congressional aide involved in the wto issue was quoted as saying by reuters . membership of the wto can take years after a country has been granted observer status , the first stepping stone to full accession . iran would have a stipulated five years after observer status is achieved to begin the process of moving toward full membership and actual entry into the wto can take many more after that .
however , negotiations on iran 's membership could be strung out indefinitely by the us , binding the iranians to years of concessions over its nuclear program . if the iranians see through this and refuse to accept the incentives , maintaining their efforts to enrich uranium , then the us would resort to its original course of action which would be to take iran to the un security council for possible sanctions . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran signs russian nuclear deal iran and russia on sunday signed a landmark nuclear fuel accord that paves the way for the islamic republic 's first atomic power station , a project the united states alleges is part of a cover for weapons development .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.03.2005 prize-winning economist defies brain drain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : axel ockenfels knows what makes ebay tick professor axel ockenfels has been awarded the prestigious 2005 gottfried wilhelm leibniz prize .
unlike many of his peers , the pioneering economist is happy to work in germany - despite his international reputation . why do you always get out-bid on internet auctions ?
are buyer 's recommendations reliable ?
why does the price always rocket at the last minute ? if you want to understand how ebay works , then 36-year-old axel ockenfels is your man .
online bidding practices are one of his areas of expertise , and his students at the laboratory for controlled experimental economics at cologne university are finding out what it takes to get what you want in the cut-throat world of the online marketplace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " typically , what happens is , the person who wins , pays too much , " says ockenfels .
" the person who wins is n't the person who 's estimated the value of the product most precisely , but the person who 's most overestimated its value . " experimental economics ockenfels ' analysis of contemporary economic behavior has propelled him to the forefront of his field .
a protegé of reinhard selten , germany 's one and only winner of the nobel prize for economics , ockenfels ' research into experimental economics and game theory sheds light on the way modern man behaves when it comes to economic decision making - and proves that traditional economics has had its day .

a protegé of reinhard selten , germany 's one and only winner of the nobel prize for economics , ockenfels ' research into experimental economics and game theory sheds light on the way modern man behaves when it comes to economic decision making - and proves that traditional economics has had its day . " the hypothesis that man is rational and egotistical is one that was n't put to the test for a long time , " explains ockenfels .
" man probably is n't as self-serving as economists would like him to be .
man himself has n't changed , but economic theories have .
new ideas and empirical evidence have been incorporated into economic theory and the concept of the ' homo oeconomicus ' is now less accepted . " the psychology of economics according to game theory , there 's a key psychological aspect to economics .
envy , rivalry and a desire for fairness all play a role . " people 's first priority is n't just getting a bargain , " insists ockenfels .
" they also keep an eye on what other people are getting and their status in their peer group . " " it 's important to understand theory , " he stresses , " but it 's also important to understand how people react .
i feel that a lot of textbooks neglect the empirical and experimental dimensions of economic behaviour and overly concentrate on theories developed in ivory towers . " leaving the ivory tower - but not germany no one can accuse axel ockenfels of living in an ivory tower .
at the age of 36 , he 's already one of the influential economic scientists in the world , hotly pursued by the world 's best universities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but unlike many of germany 's a-list scientists , he 's never been tempted to join the brain-drain crowd and head to the us to enjoy the higher salaries and first-class research opportunities available at the country 's generously funded ivy league schools .
now that he 's scooped germany 's most lucrative research prize , worth € 1.55 million -lrb- $ 2 million -rrb- , he probably feels vindicated in his decision . as far as he 's concerned , germany is where he can work best . " no other country in the world has as many experimental laboratories , " he says .

but a scandal involving the abuse of tourist visas has dented his reputation and is threatening to unravel his political future . last weekend , fischer gave a speech that was likely one of the most difficult of his lengthy political career .
in an address to members of his greens party at a regional congress , he had to admit he had made mistakes in handling a widening affair in which foreign criminals made use of relaxed visa requirements – approved by fischer – to smuggle people into germany . while he rejected demands by the conservative opposition to resign , the fact that fischer felt compelled to devote his speech to the visa scandal shows just how much the matter has the experienced political operator on the defensive . " fischer certainly underestimated the situation , " dr. jürgen falter , director of the domestic politics program at the university of mainz , told dw-world .
" at the moment it does n't look like it will push him from office , but we 'll have to wait and see if more serious revelations come to light . " opposition politicians claim thousands of illegal immigrants – including many from ukraine and china – were able to enter germany between 2000 and 2003 after tourist visa criteria were relaxed .
they say that led to an increase in organized crime , drugs and prostitution on fischer 's watch . admirers and enemies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer looks on during the greens party congress in rostock , eastern germany , on saturday , nov .
24 , 2001 .
known as someone who does n't suffer fools gladly , fischer has as many enemies as he does admirers in parliament , the press , and even in his own party .
over the years , he has developed a reputation as being aloof and arrogant to journalists and his colleagues .
perhaps worse , he has the nasty habit of unnecessarily humiliating those working for him at the foreign ministry .
it appears as if fischer is now reaping what he 's sown as those who feel slighted by the minister look for some payback . " he always thought he was almost invulnerable and could survive anything , which was the case up till now , " fischer 's biographer bernd ulrich said in a recent radio interview with deutschlandfunk .
" that 's why he 's approached this matter with a certain amount of arrogance . " yet despite his prickly public persona , fischer has consistently ranked as one of germany 's most popular politicians .
born in 1948 as the humble son of butcher in stuttgart , fischer has one of the most unconventional backgrounds of the country 's political elite .
having left school in 10th grade , he made a living in the 1970s as a taxi driver before helping set up the greens and leading the upstart party into parliament in the 1980s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer said he recognized himself on this picture of being beaten by the police in 1968 .
other photos showed fischer beating a police officer .
while he lived in frankfurt , he also became involved in the leftwing student protests of 1968 .
during that turbulent time he was involved in violent street fighting with the police .
pictures of him made public in 2001 in a black motorcycle helmet kicking a police officer during a protest led conservatives to call for his head . authentic and quirky but german chancellor gerhard schröder stuck by him back then and the public chalked up the affair as a youthful indiscretion on fischer 's part .
and for many germans , it was simply more proof of his " authenticity " that has made him both the greens ' elder statesman and a quirky public figure that could do little wrong . " he has a personality bonus , " explained richard hilmer from the public polling organization infratest / dimap .
" he 's considered a different kind of politician .
his moving background is considered convincing and authentic . " but the visa affair has battered fischer 's reputation in the eyes of many .
for the first time in three years , fischer last week lost his status as germany 's most popular politician in a regular poll by public broadcaster zdf . " he 's smacked quite a few people around and that has come back to haunt him .
there appears to be quite a bit of schadenfreude over his predicament , " dr. falter said , adding he expected fischer to survive the current scandal largely intact .
" if he makes it through this he 'll be know as the teflon minister .
nothing will stick to him . " schröder 's backing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka and gerd .
as in 2001 , schröder has once again demonstratively backed his foreign minister , saying there was no question that fischer will stay in office .
the chancellor has also expressed his desire to stand for reelection in 2006 with fischer at his side . fischer biographer ulrich even said the governing center-left coalition of social democrats and greens could possible survive with another chancellor than schröder , but that the foreign minister was indispensable . " he 's too important for the stability of the coalition , " he said , adding that because of the visa affair fischer had also become a liability .
" he wo n't fall but he 'll definitely slide a bit .

but many cases remain unsolved and bitter feuds prevent other paintings being returned . a cultural legacy left over from the third reich which german museums continue to face is the return of stolen art .
since 1998 when a conference in washington heralded the beginning of a concerted effort by germany and 43 other countries to find and return artworks stolen by the nazis during world war ii , museums across the country have experienced the headaches attached to this quest . one on-going saga involving three paintings seized by the nazis between 1937 and 1939 was resolved this week when they were returned to their original jewish owners after a long legal wrangle , a local official said on wednesday . a spokeswoman for city authorities in wuppertal , western germany , said the handover , which should have happened more than a year ago but was held up by a legal technicality , would go ahead " as soon as possible , once the conditions for their return are set in a contract . " the process of handing back the three paintings , which are currently on display in the city 's heydt museum , had previously been delayed by doubts about who the real owners were . the work " felsige flusslandschaft , " by frankfurt artist otto scholderer , was bought by the museum in 1939 after its forced sale a year earlier .
" erinnerung vom dampfboot auf der donau , " by adolph menzel , was given as a gift to the heydt in 1956 . the owners of hans von marees ' " tatar mit pferd , " forced into sale in 1937 , fled germany for the netherlands where they were caught and killed in a concentration camp in 1944 .
the painting was bought by the museum in 1948 and is expected to be given to the grandchildren of its deceased owners . complications the rule , not exception bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : such complications are not unusual .
returning stolen art to the rightful owners 60 years after it was first taken is an awkward affair .
despite the best efforts of the german states and local authorities , which have been keeping an internet database of reportedly stolen artefacts , many critics have derided these attempts , citing inexact information and conflicts of interest . one particularly high-profile case is still caught in a bitter impasse due to these reasons .
emil nold 's " buchsbaumgarten , " valued at around € 500,000 -lrb- $ 656,275 -rrb- , remains in the possession of duisburg 's wilhelm lehmbruck museum despite substantiated claims by ruth haller , a relative of jewish lawyer and art collector ismar littmann . after the nazis banned littmann from practicing , he committed suicide in 1934 and his family had to sell part of his collection .
the rest was confiscated by the gestapo . the duisburg museum bought the painting in the 1950s without any knowledge of the painting 's history and now refuses to return it . legal gray area bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portrait of wally , painted by the late austrian expressionist egon schiele .

the iaea had reported key areas where iran was refusing to cooperate with un inspectors . " while transparency visits have taken place , iran seems to have been determined to limit their scope , " said british ambassador robin wright , reading from the joint statement . the europeans still took a more conciliatory tone than the americans .
they noted that iran 's decision to suspend uranium enrichment - which can be used for either nuclear energy or to make atomic weapons - was " a voluntary commitment " and urged tehran to keep its word . the us maintains that iran 's nuclear activities are designed for a clandestine weapons program .
the head of the us delegation to the iaea board , jackie sanders , cited " an alarming number " of unresolved questions and warned that the iaea could not put off " forever " taking tehran before the un security council for possible sanctions . refusal of inspections causes friction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like the us , the europeans criticized iran for refusing to allow un inspectors to visit its military site in parchin , a site where there are definitely nuclear materials , where washington accuses tehran of simulating testing of nuclear weapons . the iranian delegate to the iaea , cyrus nasseri , said iran was not allowing a second visit to parchin , after a first one in january , in part because it was concerned about information leaks " in view of potential threats of military strikes against iran 's safeguarded and other facilities " by what he called " a major nuclear weapons state " in a clear reference to the united states . but iaea director-general mohamed el baradei said that iran was a " special case " since its nuclear program " has been clandestine for almost two decades " and he asked tehran to allow widespread visits by un inspectors .
the europeans endorsed el baradei 's call for iran to come clean " in order to make up for the confidence deficit created by past activities and to build the necessary confidence in the future , " the european statement said . us president george w. bush has said washington is seeking a diplomatic solution in iran and supports eu talks with tehran .
but bush has said all options , including the military one , remain on the table . bush considers dangling the carrot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , it appears that the president is increasingly aligning himself with european efforts and is considering offering incentives to iran , according to us officials on thursday .
in a preparatory statement ahead of an expected announcement of the us strategy later this week , the united states said it would not block iran as it seeks to start the process of joining the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , and would not stand in the way of european allies if they want to sell tehran parts for civilian aircraft . white house spokesman scott mcclellan said the president had not finalized his decision but said that the united states and europe were discussing " how we can move forward together on a common strategy to get iran to abandon any ambitions for a nuclear weapon . " " we want to do our part to support the european efforts .
this is about strengthening their diplomatic approach to resolving this matter , " he added . in return for supporting incentives , it is likely that the americans would insist that iran abandon uranium enrichment , the major sticking point in the on-going negotiations .
but while it appears that the us has shifted considerable ground , the reality is a little different .
the europeans and the americans would get the better end of the deal if iran accepts the incentives . wto accession a one-sided deal ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- headquarters in geneva , switzerland .
" it is a carrot , and it 's not a very big one , " a senior congressional aide involved in the wto issue was quoted as saying by reuters . membership of the wto can take years after a country has been granted observer status , the first stepping stone to full accession . iran would have a stipulated five years after observer status is achieved to begin the process of moving toward full membership and actual entry into the wto can take many more after that .
however , negotiations on iran 's membership could be strung out indefinitely by the us , binding the iranians to years of concessions over its nuclear program . if the iranians see through this and refuse to accept the incentives , maintaining their efforts to enrich uranium , then the us would resort to its original course of action which would be to take iran to the un security council for possible sanctions . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran signs russian nuclear deal iran and russia on sunday signed a landmark nuclear fuel accord that paves the way for the islamic republic 's first atomic power station , a project the united states alleges is part of a cover for weapons development .

the iaea had reported key areas where iran was refusing to cooperate with un inspectors . " while transparency visits have taken place , iran seems to have been determined to limit their scope , " said british ambassador robin wright , reading from the joint statement . the europeans still took a more conciliatory tone than the americans .
they noted that iran 's decision to suspend uranium enrichment - which can be used for either nuclear energy or to make atomic weapons - was " a voluntary commitment " and urged tehran to keep its word . the us maintains that iran 's nuclear activities are designed for a clandestine weapons program .
the head of the us delegation to the iaea board , jackie sanders , cited " an alarming number " of unresolved questions and warned that the iaea could not put off " forever " taking tehran before the un security council for possible sanctions . refusal of inspections causes friction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like the us , the europeans criticized iran for refusing to allow un inspectors to visit its military site in parchin , a site where there are definitely nuclear materials , where washington accuses tehran of simulating testing of nuclear weapons . the iranian delegate to the iaea , cyrus nasseri , said iran was not allowing a second visit to parchin , after a first one in january , in part because it was concerned about information leaks " in view of potential threats of military strikes against iran 's safeguarded and other facilities " by what he called " a major nuclear weapons state " in a clear reference to the united states . but iaea director-general mohamed el baradei said that iran was a " special case " since its nuclear program " has been clandestine for almost two decades " and he asked tehran to allow widespread visits by un inspectors .
the europeans endorsed el baradei 's call for iran to come clean " in order to make up for the confidence deficit created by past activities and to build the necessary confidence in the future , " the european statement said . us president george w. bush has said washington is seeking a diplomatic solution in iran and supports eu talks with tehran .

in a preparatory statement ahead of an expected announcement of the us strategy later this week , the united states said it would not block iran as it seeks to start the process of joining the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , and would not stand in the way of european allies if they want to sell tehran parts for civilian aircraft . white house spokesman scott mcclellan said the president had not finalized his decision but said that the united states and europe were discussing " how we can move forward together on a common strategy to get iran to abandon any ambitions for a nuclear weapon . " " we want to do our part to support the european efforts .
this is about strengthening their diplomatic approach to resolving this matter , " he added . in return for supporting incentives , it is likely that the americans would insist that iran abandon uranium enrichment , the major sticking point in the on-going negotiations .

however , negotiations on iran 's membership could be strung out indefinitely by the us , binding the iranians to years of concessions over its nuclear program . if the iranians see through this and refuse to accept the incentives , maintaining their efforts to enrich uranium , then the us would resort to its original course of action which would be to take iran to the un security council for possible sanctions . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran signs russian nuclear deal iran and russia on sunday signed a landmark nuclear fuel accord that paves the way for the islamic republic 's first atomic power station , a project the united states alleges is part of a cover for weapons development .

in a letter to the german government , kroes demanded more clarification on how the public networks are funded . " the commission 's preliminary view is that the current financing system is no longer in line with eu rules , " the letter read . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zdf 's star team of sports presenters the eu competition watchdogs were reacting to complaints lodged by commercial television networks in germany in 2003 that their state-funded rivals used illegal subsidies .
on thursday , kroes ' department made it clear that it considered the funding of public television in germany to amount to a sort of unlawful state subsidy which hampered free competition in several areas . apart from germany , the eu investigation has also centered on ireland and the netherlands .
on thursday , kroes dashed off similar letters to governments in dublin and amsterdam .
kroes has warned that the three eu member states needed to ensure transparency in the financing of their public television networks and make a clear distinction between their public activities and other commercial ventures such as the internet and digital tv . the commission insisted that it was n't questioning the national right of the eu 's 25 member states to set their own level of funding and public license fees as well as the objectives of their public broadcasters so long as they do not unfairly harm private sector competitors . online services under scrutiny too the eu investigation is expected to have a far-reaching effect on public broadcasters ' rights to offer online services .
among other things , germany 's commercial networks in 2003 charged that services for sale on the web sites of state-owned channels make unfair use of public money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes , eu competition commissioner kroes -lrb- photo -rrb- too is believed to have serious misgivings about the use of license fees - some € 17 -lrb- $ 22.32 -rrb- a month in germany and collected by germany 's central office for licensing fees -lrb- gez -rrb- - to fund internet services , seeing it as an illegal cross-subsidy . german public television networks ard and zdf , which were set up after the second world war to ensure pluralism after the nazi dictatorship , are now moving into sponsorship and offer a host of spin-off commercial activities on their web sites . the networks , controlled ultimately by germany 's 16 federal states , are now worried that the eu 's intervention might severely curtail their online services .
they are reported to point to these interventions as being directly contradictory to previous eu rulings upholding the right of britain 's public network bbc to go ahead with nine digital tv and radio channels or even ard 's special interest channels , phoenix and kinderkanal . while deutsche welle is part of the ard network , it is not funded by license fees but government money . ard and zdf are now said to be looking at scaling down their internet services as a precautionary measure and only provide internet content relating to their programming schedules . the bbc is also said to be worriedly watching brussels ' investigation of public networks in germany , ireland and the netherlands .
top bbc executives are reportedly in talks with their counterparts at the german broadcasters as well as eu officials over what the case might mean for them . brussels wants independent monitor kroes on thursday also demanded the setting up of an independent national authority that would monitor the upholding of transparency in the funding of public broadcasters .
she pointed out that eu members france , italy , spain and portugal had already bowed to similar eu demands in the past . germany , ireland and the netherlands will now have about four weeks to react to brussels ' letter .
kroes has already announced that brussels will drop the investigation if the three countries take the necessary steps to get their funding of public networks in order . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de media davids vs. goliath with government funding and hefty advertising revenues , public broadcasters in germany and europe have astronomically high budgets for buying olympic rights .

" dw-world.de schröder accepts opposition offer of help as unemployment in germany reaches new heights , chancellor schröder says he 's willing to discuss new reforms with the conservative opposition so long as their motive is more than electioneering .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.03.2005 eu probes germany 's public tv funding großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on brussels ' viewfinder : german public tv network ard european union regulators have warned germany that its funding for public television partly violates eu state aid law and urged it to set up an independent supervisory panel to ensure more transparency . european union competition commissioner neelie kroes on thursday told germany that it needed to overhaul its funding system for state-owned channels ard and zdf .
in a letter to the german government , kroes demanded more clarification on how the public networks are funded . " the commission 's preliminary view is that the current financing system is no longer in line with eu rules , " the letter read . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zdf 's star team of sports presenters the eu competition watchdogs were reacting to complaints lodged by commercial television networks in germany in 2003 that their state-funded rivals used illegal subsidies .
on thursday , kroes ' department made it clear that it considered the funding of public television in germany to amount to a sort of unlawful state subsidy which hampered free competition in several areas . apart from germany , the eu investigation has also centered on ireland and the netherlands .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.03.2005 eu probes germany 's public tv funding großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on brussels ' viewfinder : german public tv network ard european union regulators have warned germany that its funding for public television partly violates eu state aid law and urged it to set up an independent supervisory panel to ensure more transparency . european union competition commissioner neelie kroes on thursday told germany that it needed to overhaul its funding system for state-owned channels ard and zdf .
in a letter to the german government , kroes demanded more clarification on how the public networks are funded . " the commission 's preliminary view is that the current financing system is no longer in line with eu rules , " the letter read . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zdf 's star team of sports presenters the eu competition watchdogs were reacting to complaints lodged by commercial television networks in germany in 2003 that their state-funded rivals used illegal subsidies .
on thursday , kroes ' department made it clear that it considered the funding of public television in germany to amount to a sort of unlawful state subsidy which hampered free competition in several areas . apart from germany , the eu investigation has also centered on ireland and the netherlands .
on thursday , kroes dashed off similar letters to governments in dublin and amsterdam .
kroes has warned that the three eu member states needed to ensure transparency in the financing of their public television networks and make a clear distinction between their public activities and other commercial ventures such as the internet and digital tv . the commission insisted that it was n't questioning the national right of the eu 's 25 member states to set their own level of funding and public license fees as well as the objectives of their public broadcasters so long as they do not unfairly harm private sector competitors . online services under scrutiny too the eu investigation is expected to have a far-reaching effect on public broadcasters ' rights to offer online services .
among other things , germany 's commercial networks in 2003 charged that services for sale on the web sites of state-owned channels make unfair use of public money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes , eu competition commissioner kroes -lrb- photo -rrb- too is believed to have serious misgivings about the use of license fees - some € 17 -lrb- $ 22.32 -rrb- a month in germany and collected by germany 's central office for licensing fees -lrb- gez -rrb- - to fund internet services , seeing it as an illegal cross-subsidy . german public television networks ard and zdf , which were set up after the second world war to ensure pluralism after the nazi dictatorship , are now moving into sponsorship and offer a host of spin-off commercial activities on their web sites . the networks , controlled ultimately by germany 's 16 federal states , are now worried that the eu 's intervention might severely curtail their online services .
they are reported to point to these interventions as being directly contradictory to previous eu rulings upholding the right of britain 's public network bbc to go ahead with nine digital tv and radio channels or even ard 's special interest channels , phoenix and kinderkanal . while deutsche welle is part of the ard network , it is not funded by license fees but government money . ard and zdf are now said to be looking at scaling down their internet services as a precautionary measure and only provide internet content relating to their programming schedules . the bbc is also said to be worriedly watching brussels ' investigation of public networks in germany , ireland and the netherlands .
top bbc executives are reportedly in talks with their counterparts at the german broadcasters as well as eu officials over what the case might mean for them . brussels wants independent monitor kroes on thursday also demanded the setting up of an independent national authority that would monitor the upholding of transparency in the funding of public broadcasters .
she pointed out that eu members france , italy , spain and portugal had already bowed to similar eu demands in the past . germany , ireland and the netherlands will now have about four weeks to react to brussels ' letter .
kroes has already announced that brussels will drop the investigation if the three countries take the necessary steps to get their funding of public networks in order . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de media davids vs. goliath with government funding and hefty advertising revenues , public broadcasters in germany and europe have astronomically high budgets for buying olympic rights .

" the commission 's preliminary view is that the current financing system is no longer in line with eu rules , " the letter read . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zdf 's star team of sports presenters the eu competition watchdogs were reacting to complaints lodged by commercial television networks in germany in 2003 that their state-funded rivals used illegal subsidies .
on thursday , kroes ' department made it clear that it considered the funding of public television in germany to amount to a sort of unlawful state subsidy which hampered free competition in several areas . apart from germany , the eu investigation has also centered on ireland and the netherlands .
on thursday , kroes dashed off similar letters to governments in dublin and amsterdam .
kroes has warned that the three eu member states needed to ensure transparency in the financing of their public television networks and make a clear distinction between their public activities and other commercial ventures such as the internet and digital tv . the commission insisted that it was n't questioning the national right of the eu 's 25 member states to set their own level of funding and public license fees as well as the objectives of their public broadcasters so long as they do not unfairly harm private sector competitors . online services under scrutiny too the eu investigation is expected to have a far-reaching effect on public broadcasters ' rights to offer online services .
among other things , germany 's commercial networks in 2003 charged that services for sale on the web sites of state-owned channels make unfair use of public money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes , eu competition commissioner kroes -lrb- photo -rrb- too is believed to have serious misgivings about the use of license fees - some € 17 -lrb- $ 22.32 -rrb- a month in germany and collected by germany 's central office for licensing fees -lrb- gez -rrb- - to fund internet services , seeing it as an illegal cross-subsidy . german public television networks ard and zdf , which were set up after the second world war to ensure pluralism after the nazi dictatorship , are now moving into sponsorship and offer a host of spin-off commercial activities on their web sites . the networks , controlled ultimately by germany 's 16 federal states , are now worried that the eu 's intervention might severely curtail their online services .
they are reported to point to these interventions as being directly contradictory to previous eu rulings upholding the right of britain 's public network bbc to go ahead with nine digital tv and radio channels or even ard 's special interest channels , phoenix and kinderkanal . while deutsche welle is part of the ard network , it is not funded by license fees but government money . ard and zdf are now said to be looking at scaling down their internet services as a precautionary measure and only provide internet content relating to their programming schedules . the bbc is also said to be worriedly watching brussels ' investigation of public networks in germany , ireland and the netherlands .
top bbc executives are reportedly in talks with their counterparts at the german broadcasters as well as eu officials over what the case might mean for them . brussels wants independent monitor kroes on thursday also demanded the setting up of an independent national authority that would monitor the upholding of transparency in the funding of public broadcasters .
she pointed out that eu members france , italy , spain and portugal had already bowed to similar eu demands in the past . germany , ireland and the netherlands will now have about four weeks to react to brussels ' letter .

in a letter to the german government , kroes demanded more clarification on how the public networks are funded . " the commission 's preliminary view is that the current financing system is no longer in line with eu rules , " the letter read . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zdf 's star team of sports presenters the eu competition watchdogs were reacting to complaints lodged by commercial television networks in germany in 2003 that their state-funded rivals used illegal subsidies .
on thursday , kroes ' department made it clear that it considered the funding of public television in germany to amount to a sort of unlawful state subsidy which hampered free competition in several areas . apart from germany , the eu investigation has also centered on ireland and the netherlands .
on thursday , kroes dashed off similar letters to governments in dublin and amsterdam .
kroes has warned that the three eu member states needed to ensure transparency in the financing of their public television networks and make a clear distinction between their public activities and other commercial ventures such as the internet and digital tv . the commission insisted that it was n't questioning the national right of the eu 's 25 member states to set their own level of funding and public license fees as well as the objectives of their public broadcasters so long as they do not unfairly harm private sector competitors . online services under scrutiny too the eu investigation is expected to have a far-reaching effect on public broadcasters ' rights to offer online services .
among other things , germany 's commercial networks in 2003 charged that services for sale on the web sites of state-owned channels make unfair use of public money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes , eu competition commissioner kroes -lrb- photo -rrb- too is believed to have serious misgivings about the use of license fees - some € 17 -lrb- $ 22.32 -rrb- a month in germany and collected by germany 's central office for licensing fees -lrb- gez -rrb- - to fund internet services , seeing it as an illegal cross-subsidy . german public television networks ard and zdf , which were set up after the second world war to ensure pluralism after the nazi dictatorship , are now moving into sponsorship and offer a host of spin-off commercial activities on their web sites . the networks , controlled ultimately by germany 's 16 federal states , are now worried that the eu 's intervention might severely curtail their online services .
they are reported to point to these interventions as being directly contradictory to previous eu rulings upholding the right of britain 's public network bbc to go ahead with nine digital tv and radio channels or even ard 's special interest channels , phoenix and kinderkanal . while deutsche welle is part of the ard network , it is not funded by license fees but government money . ard and zdf are now said to be looking at scaling down their internet services as a precautionary measure and only provide internet content relating to their programming schedules . the bbc is also said to be worriedly watching brussels ' investigation of public networks in germany , ireland and the netherlands .
top bbc executives are reportedly in talks with their counterparts at the german broadcasters as well as eu officials over what the case might mean for them . brussels wants independent monitor kroes on thursday also demanded the setting up of an independent national authority that would monitor the upholding of transparency in the funding of public broadcasters .
she pointed out that eu members france , italy , spain and portugal had already bowed to similar eu demands in the past . germany , ireland and the netherlands will now have about four weeks to react to brussels ' letter .
kroes has already announced that brussels will drop the investigation if the three countries take the necessary steps to get their funding of public networks in order . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de media davids vs. goliath with government funding and hefty advertising revenues , public broadcasters in germany and europe have astronomically high budgets for buying olympic rights .

democrat senator joseph biden joined in , saying that the lifting of the ban would be " a non-starter with congress " after he and lugar met with president bush in the white house . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president chen shui-bian of taiwan the warning from congress follows a rebuke from taiwan 's president chen shui-bian on tuesday when he told the eu via a video link that eu plans to lift the arms embargo endangered the military balance in east asia and accused some in europe of double standards in currying favour with beijing . he added that the planned lifting of the arms ban could also let the chinese think it did not need to proceed with democratic reforms . " should the eu decide to lift its arms embargo against china it might lead to a tilt in the military balance in the taiwan strait , which would pose a clear threat to peace and stability , " he said . bush returned from his european tour smarting from his china-related encounters with european leaders , especially the one that heralded a widely reported and embarrassing no-nonsense declaration from french president jacques chirac that europe intended to lift the ban .
the end of the embargo has been penciled in for may 8 , when the eu holds a meeting with the chinese leadership . eu must prepare a case for congress the europeans are expected to make a case to congress for acceptance of their decision by arguing that the embargo was a response to tiananmen square massacre in 1989 , and that china has moved on dramatically since then .
during his visit , bush let it be known that he was " open minded " about the lifting of the ban , but told eu leaders that they would have to convince congress . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george w bush , left , poses with european union commission president jose manual barroso , following an eu summit at the european union commission headquarters in brussels , tuesday feb .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.03.2005 an end to superstar fischer ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer 's popularity has suffered recently foreign minister joschka fischer has long been one of germany 's most popular politicians .
but a scandal involving the abuse of tourist visas has dented his reputation and is threatening to unravel his political future . last weekend , fischer gave a speech that was likely one of the most difficult of his lengthy political career .
in an address to members of his greens party at a regional congress , he had to admit he had made mistakes in handling a widening affair in which foreign criminals made use of relaxed visa requirements – approved by fischer – to smuggle people into germany . while he rejected demands by the conservative opposition to resign , the fact that fischer felt compelled to devote his speech to the visa scandal shows just how much the matter has the experienced political operator on the defensive . " fischer certainly underestimated the situation , " dr. jürgen falter , director of the domestic politics program at the university of mainz , told dw-world .
" at the moment it does n't look like it will push him from office , but we 'll have to wait and see if more serious revelations come to light . " opposition politicians claim thousands of illegal immigrants – including many from ukraine and china – were able to enter germany between 2000 and 2003 after tourist visa criteria were relaxed .
they say that led to an increase in organized crime , drugs and prostitution on fischer 's watch . admirers and enemies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer looks on during the greens party congress in rostock , eastern germany , on saturday , nov .
24 , 2001 .
known as someone who does n't suffer fools gladly , fischer has as many enemies as he does admirers in parliament , the press , and even in his own party .
over the years , he has developed a reputation as being aloof and arrogant to journalists and his colleagues .
perhaps worse , he has the nasty habit of unnecessarily humiliating those working for him at the foreign ministry .
it appears as if fischer is now reaping what he 's sown as those who feel slighted by the minister look for some payback . " he always thought he was almost invulnerable and could survive anything , which was the case up till now , " fischer 's biographer bernd ulrich said in a recent radio interview with deutschlandfunk .
" that 's why he 's approached this matter with a certain amount of arrogance . " yet despite his prickly public persona , fischer has consistently ranked as one of germany 's most popular politicians .
born in 1948 as the humble son of butcher in stuttgart , fischer has one of the most unconventional backgrounds of the country 's political elite .
having left school in 10th grade , he made a living in the 1970s as a taxi driver before helping set up the greens and leading the upstart party into parliament in the 1980s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer said he recognized himself on this picture of being beaten by the police in 1968 .
other photos showed fischer beating a police officer .
while he lived in frankfurt , he also became involved in the leftwing student protests of 1968 .
during that turbulent time he was involved in violent street fighting with the police .
pictures of him made public in 2001 in a black motorcycle helmet kicking a police officer during a protest led conservatives to call for his head . authentic and quirky but german chancellor gerhard schröder stuck by him back then and the public chalked up the affair as a youthful indiscretion on fischer 's part .
and for many germans , it was simply more proof of his " authenticity " that has made him both the greens ' elder statesman and a quirky public figure that could do little wrong . " he has a personality bonus , " explained richard hilmer from the public polling organization infratest / dimap .
" he 's considered a different kind of politician .
his moving background is considered convincing and authentic . " but the visa affair has battered fischer 's reputation in the eyes of many .
for the first time in three years , fischer last week lost his status as germany 's most popular politician in a regular poll by public broadcaster zdf . " he 's smacked quite a few people around and that has come back to haunt him .
there appears to be quite a bit of schadenfreude over his predicament , " dr. falter said , adding he expected fischer to survive the current scandal largely intact .
" if he makes it through this he 'll be know as the teflon minister .
nothing will stick to him . " schröder 's backing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka and gerd .
as in 2001 , schröder has once again demonstratively backed his foreign minister , saying there was no question that fischer will stay in office .
the chancellor has also expressed his desire to stand for reelection in 2006 with fischer at his side . fischer biographer ulrich even said the governing center-left coalition of social democrats and greens could possible survive with another chancellor than schröder , but that the foreign minister was indispensable . " he 's too important for the stability of the coalition , " he said , adding that because of the visa affair fischer had also become a liability .
" he wo n't fall but he 'll definitely slide a bit .
and when he sinks , he 'll pull the red-green coalition down a bit further . " marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer goes on offensive in visa affair german foreign minister joschka fischer admitted saturday he made mistakes in an affair involving the misuse of visas by criminal human traffickers from eastern europe , but he remained defiant amid calls to resign .

27 , 2005 -rrb- when will fischer take the hot seat ?
these are tough times for joschka fischer .

but a scandal involving the abuse of tourist visas has dented his reputation and is threatening to unravel his political future . last weekend , fischer gave a speech that was likely one of the most difficult of his lengthy political career .
in an address to members of his greens party at a regional congress , he had to admit he had made mistakes in handling a widening affair in which foreign criminals made use of relaxed visa requirements – approved by fischer – to smuggle people into germany . while he rejected demands by the conservative opposition to resign , the fact that fischer felt compelled to devote his speech to the visa scandal shows just how much the matter has the experienced political operator on the defensive . " fischer certainly underestimated the situation , " dr. jürgen falter , director of the domestic politics program at the university of mainz , told dw-world .
" at the moment it does n't look like it will push him from office , but we 'll have to wait and see if more serious revelations come to light . " opposition politicians claim thousands of illegal immigrants – including many from ukraine and china – were able to enter germany between 2000 and 2003 after tourist visa criteria were relaxed .
they say that led to an increase in organized crime , drugs and prostitution on fischer 's watch . admirers and enemies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer looks on during the greens party congress in rostock , eastern germany , on saturday , nov .
24 , 2001 .
known as someone who does n't suffer fools gladly , fischer has as many enemies as he does admirers in parliament , the press , and even in his own party .
over the years , he has developed a reputation as being aloof and arrogant to journalists and his colleagues .
perhaps worse , he has the nasty habit of unnecessarily humiliating those working for him at the foreign ministry .
it appears as if fischer is now reaping what he 's sown as those who feel slighted by the minister look for some payback . " he always thought he was almost invulnerable and could survive anything , which was the case up till now , " fischer 's biographer bernd ulrich said in a recent radio interview with deutschlandfunk .
" that 's why he 's approached this matter with a certain amount of arrogance . " yet despite his prickly public persona , fischer has consistently ranked as one of germany 's most popular politicians .
born in 1948 as the humble son of butcher in stuttgart , fischer has one of the most unconventional backgrounds of the country 's political elite .
having left school in 10th grade , he made a living in the 1970s as a taxi driver before helping set up the greens and leading the upstart party into parliament in the 1980s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer said he recognized himself on this picture of being beaten by the police in 1968 .
other photos showed fischer beating a police officer .
while he lived in frankfurt , he also became involved in the leftwing student protests of 1968 .
during that turbulent time he was involved in violent street fighting with the police .
pictures of him made public in 2001 in a black motorcycle helmet kicking a police officer during a protest led conservatives to call for his head . authentic and quirky but german chancellor gerhard schröder stuck by him back then and the public chalked up the affair as a youthful indiscretion on fischer 's part .
and for many germans , it was simply more proof of his " authenticity " that has made him both the greens ' elder statesman and a quirky public figure that could do little wrong . " he has a personality bonus , " explained richard hilmer from the public polling organization infratest / dimap .
" he 's considered a different kind of politician .
his moving background is considered convincing and authentic . " but the visa affair has battered fischer 's reputation in the eyes of many .
for the first time in three years , fischer last week lost his status as germany 's most popular politician in a regular poll by public broadcaster zdf . " he 's smacked quite a few people around and that has come back to haunt him .
there appears to be quite a bit of schadenfreude over his predicament , " dr. falter said , adding he expected fischer to survive the current scandal largely intact .
" if he makes it through this he 'll be know as the teflon minister .
nothing will stick to him . " schröder 's backing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka and gerd .
as in 2001 , schröder has once again demonstratively backed his foreign minister , saying there was no question that fischer will stay in office .
the chancellor has also expressed his desire to stand for reelection in 2006 with fischer at his side . fischer biographer ulrich even said the governing center-left coalition of social democrats and greens could possible survive with another chancellor than schröder , but that the foreign minister was indispensable . " he 's too important for the stability of the coalition , " he said , adding that because of the visa affair fischer had also become a liability .
" he wo n't fall but he 'll definitely slide a bit .
and when he sinks , he 'll pull the red-green coalition down a bit further .

1 , 2010 , a german city will celebrate its first day as europe 's cultural capital .
what 's still unclear , however , is which town will be able to do so as 10 cities across the country are still in the running . from lübeck in the north to karlsruhe in the south , from görlitz in the east to essen in the west , the contenders have lobbying hard to bring home the title .
whether it 's prominent supporters such as halle native and former german foreign minister hans-dietrich genscher promoting his city on posters across the country or regensburg enlisting scandalous theater director christoph schlingensief to put on an -lrb- albeit unflattering -rrb- play about the bavarian town , most have come up with ways to get some attention . on march 10 and 11 , a jury of experts will pick two cities and recommend them to germany 's upper house , the bundesrat .

" in coma and looking for work germany 2004 : the road to reform germany -pipe- 03.03.2005 schröder accepts opposition offer of help großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition wants berlin to adopt their ten-point program as unemployment in germany reaches new heights , chancellor schröder says he 's willing to discuss new reforms with the conservative opposition so long as their motive is more than electioneering . angela merkel , leader of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , and edmund stoiber , leader of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- have written to schröder proposing their parties join forces to develop immediate strategies to combat joblessness . " continuing with business as usual is not an option , " they said , urging the government to accept their " ten-point plan for germany . " in yemen , schröder responded positively to their offer , but rejected aspects of their proposals including the relaxing of laws protecting german employees from dismissal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder " anyone who thinks dismissal protection law is the main obstacle to new appointments shows they have little understanding of the real problem , " he said . he also insisted their help should be unconditional .
" if their willingness to talk comes with certain conditions , they are laying themselves open to accusations of playing games that the people of this country do not need given their problems , " the chancellor said . election campaign tied to reducing joblessness after their disappointing results in the northern state of schleswig holstein in february , schröder 's social democrats are pinning their hopes on the may poll in north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state and a traditional spd stronghold . the result is expected to indicate the outcome of the 2006 general election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but data published tuesday shows that unemployment in the state has topped the 1 million mark , excacerbating public anger at the government 's failure to trigger job growth . " we say to our friends in berlin , you have to persevere and create more impulse for growth despite the difficult budgetary situation , " harald schartau , the spd leader in north rhine-westphalia said on german television . nationwide , 5.22 million people are looking for work - a rise of 177,000 over january , and more than half a million above the figure at the same time last year , according to figures released by the federal labor agency pressure on berlin to unveil new job creation schemes is mounting . with nearly 13 percent of the workforce currently unemployed , germany is seeing its highest jobless rate since the 1930s . " the figures can be explained " chancellor gerhard schröder , currently on a tour of seven gulf states , took time out in quatar on wednesday to comment on the latest figures . " there 's no doubt that the unemployment figures are depressing , " he said .
" but we ca n't allow ourselves to be forced on the defensive .
the figures can be explained .
in january alone 360,000 people who had been on social support payments were included in the jobless totals . "
some 75 percent of february 's 180,000 additions to the total figure can be seen as the result of a reclassification system introduced in january , with many benefit claimants added to the list for the first time thanks to new rules . ilo statistic less bleak the government can also now point to a new statistic calculated using standards set by the international labor organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- , which does not count the long-term unemployed or people who work just a few hours a week .
" we are now publishing a new monthly unemployment figure based on ilo standards , in addition to the figure calculated in the traditional way , " said economics minister wolfgang clement . this figure put unemployment at just under 4 million , well below the politically sensitive 5 million mark . cross-party cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other contributing factors to the apparent rise in joblessness are the weak economy and the current cold weather , which has badly hit the hitting the construction industry . but while berlin insists its efforts to tackle joblessness with the controversial " hartz iv " labor market reforms need time to take effect , the conservative opposition argues the government needs to change tack .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.03.2005 prize-winning economist defies brain drain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : axel ockenfels knows what makes ebay tick professor axel ockenfels has been awarded the prestigious 2005 gottfried wilhelm leibniz prize .
unlike many of his peers , the pioneering economist is happy to work in germany - despite his international reputation . why do you always get out-bid on internet auctions ?
are buyer 's recommendations reliable ?
why does the price always rocket at the last minute ? if you want to understand how ebay works , then 36-year-old axel ockenfels is your man .
online bidding practices are one of his areas of expertise , and his students at the laboratory for controlled experimental economics at cologne university are finding out what it takes to get what you want in the cut-throat world of the online marketplace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " typically , what happens is , the person who wins , pays too much , " says ockenfels .
" the person who wins is n't the person who 's estimated the value of the product most precisely , but the person who 's most overestimated its value . " experimental economics ockenfels ' analysis of contemporary economic behavior has propelled him to the forefront of his field .
a protegé of reinhard selten , germany 's one and only winner of the nobel prize for economics , ockenfels ' research into experimental economics and game theory sheds light on the way modern man behaves when it comes to economic decision making - and proves that traditional economics has had its day . " the hypothesis that man is rational and egotistical is one that was n't put to the test for a long time , " explains ockenfels .
" man probably is n't as self-serving as economists would like him to be .
man himself has n't changed , but economic theories have .
new ideas and empirical evidence have been incorporated into economic theory and the concept of the ' homo oeconomicus ' is now less accepted . " the psychology of economics according to game theory , there 's a key psychological aspect to economics .
envy , rivalry and a desire for fairness all play a role . " people 's first priority is n't just getting a bargain , " insists ockenfels .
" they also keep an eye on what other people are getting and their status in their peer group . " " it 's important to understand theory , " he stresses , " but it 's also important to understand how people react .
i feel that a lot of textbooks neglect the empirical and experimental dimensions of economic behaviour and overly concentrate on theories developed in ivory towers . " leaving the ivory tower - but not germany no one can accuse axel ockenfels of living in an ivory tower .
at the age of 36 , he 's already one of the influential economic scientists in the world , hotly pursued by the world 's best universities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but unlike many of germany 's a-list scientists , he 's never been tempted to join the brain-drain crowd and head to the us to enjoy the higher salaries and first-class research opportunities available at the country 's generously funded ivy league schools .
now that he 's scooped germany 's most lucrative research prize , worth € 1.55 million -lrb- $ 2 million -rrb- , he probably feels vindicated in his decision . as far as he 's concerned , germany is where he can work best . " no other country in the world has as many experimental laboratories , " he says .

in a letter to the german government , kroes demanded more clarification on how the public networks are funded . " the commission 's preliminary view is that the current financing system is no longer in line with eu rules , " the letter read . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zdf 's star team of sports presenters the eu competition watchdogs were reacting to complaints lodged by commercial television networks in germany in 2003 that their state-funded rivals used illegal subsidies .
on thursday , kroes ' department made it clear that it considered the funding of public television in germany to amount to a sort of unlawful state subsidy which hampered free competition in several areas . apart from germany , the eu investigation has also centered on ireland and the netherlands .
on thursday , kroes dashed off similar letters to governments in dublin and amsterdam .
kroes has warned that the three eu member states needed to ensure transparency in the financing of their public television networks and make a clear distinction between their public activities and other commercial ventures such as the internet and digital tv . the commission insisted that it was n't questioning the national right of the eu 's 25 member states to set their own level of funding and public license fees as well as the objectives of their public broadcasters so long as they do not unfairly harm private sector competitors . online services under scrutiny too the eu investigation is expected to have a far-reaching effect on public broadcasters ' rights to offer online services .

they are reported to point to these interventions as being directly contradictory to previous eu rulings upholding the right of britain 's public network bbc to go ahead with nine digital tv and radio channels or even ard 's special interest channels , phoenix and kinderkanal . while deutsche welle is part of the ard network , it is not funded by license fees but government money . ard and zdf are now said to be looking at scaling down their internet services as a precautionary measure and only provide internet content relating to their programming schedules . the bbc is also said to be worriedly watching brussels ' investigation of public networks in germany , ireland and the netherlands .
top bbc executives are reportedly in talks with their counterparts at the german broadcasters as well as eu officials over what the case might mean for them . brussels wants independent monitor kroes on thursday also demanded the setting up of an independent national authority that would monitor the upholding of transparency in the funding of public broadcasters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.03.2005 an end to superstar fischer ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer 's popularity has suffered recently foreign minister joschka fischer has long been one of germany 's most popular politicians .
but a scandal involving the abuse of tourist visas has dented his reputation and is threatening to unravel his political future . last weekend , fischer gave a speech that was likely one of the most difficult of his lengthy political career .
in an address to members of his greens party at a regional congress , he had to admit he had made mistakes in handling a widening affair in which foreign criminals made use of relaxed visa requirements – approved by fischer – to smuggle people into germany . while he rejected demands by the conservative opposition to resign , the fact that fischer felt compelled to devote his speech to the visa scandal shows just how much the matter has the experienced political operator on the defensive . " fischer certainly underestimated the situation , " dr. jürgen falter , director of the domestic politics program at the university of mainz , told dw-world .
" at the moment it does n't look like it will push him from office , but we 'll have to wait and see if more serious revelations come to light . " opposition politicians claim thousands of illegal immigrants – including many from ukraine and china – were able to enter germany between 2000 and 2003 after tourist visa criteria were relaxed .
they say that led to an increase in organized crime , drugs and prostitution on fischer 's watch . admirers and enemies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer looks on during the greens party congress in rostock , eastern germany , on saturday , nov .
24 , 2001 .
known as someone who does n't suffer fools gladly , fischer has as many enemies as he does admirers in parliament , the press , and even in his own party .
over the years , he has developed a reputation as being aloof and arrogant to journalists and his colleagues .
perhaps worse , he has the nasty habit of unnecessarily humiliating those working for him at the foreign ministry .
it appears as if fischer is now reaping what he 's sown as those who feel slighted by the minister look for some payback . " he always thought he was almost invulnerable and could survive anything , which was the case up till now , " fischer 's biographer bernd ulrich said in a recent radio interview with deutschlandfunk .
" that 's why he 's approached this matter with a certain amount of arrogance . " yet despite his prickly public persona , fischer has consistently ranked as one of germany 's most popular politicians .
born in 1948 as the humble son of butcher in stuttgart , fischer has one of the most unconventional backgrounds of the country 's political elite .
having left school in 10th grade , he made a living in the 1970s as a taxi driver before helping set up the greens and leading the upstart party into parliament in the 1980s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer said he recognized himself on this picture of being beaten by the police in 1968 .
other photos showed fischer beating a police officer .
while he lived in frankfurt , he also became involved in the leftwing student protests of 1968 .
during that turbulent time he was involved in violent street fighting with the police .
pictures of him made public in 2001 in a black motorcycle helmet kicking a police officer during a protest led conservatives to call for his head . authentic and quirky but german chancellor gerhard schröder stuck by him back then and the public chalked up the affair as a youthful indiscretion on fischer 's part .
and for many germans , it was simply more proof of his " authenticity " that has made him both the greens ' elder statesman and a quirky public figure that could do little wrong . " he has a personality bonus , " explained richard hilmer from the public polling organization infratest / dimap .
" he 's considered a different kind of politician .
his moving background is considered convincing and authentic . " but the visa affair has battered fischer 's reputation in the eyes of many .
for the first time in three years , fischer last week lost his status as germany 's most popular politician in a regular poll by public broadcaster zdf . " he 's smacked quite a few people around and that has come back to haunt him .
there appears to be quite a bit of schadenfreude over his predicament , " dr. falter said , adding he expected fischer to survive the current scandal largely intact .
" if he makes it through this he 'll be know as the teflon minister .
nothing will stick to him . " schröder 's backing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka and gerd .
as in 2001 , schröder has once again demonstratively backed his foreign minister , saying there was no question that fischer will stay in office .
the chancellor has also expressed his desire to stand for reelection in 2006 with fischer at his side . fischer biographer ulrich even said the governing center-left coalition of social democrats and greens could possible survive with another chancellor than schröder , but that the foreign minister was indispensable . " he 's too important for the stability of the coalition , " he said , adding that because of the visa affair fischer had also become a liability .
" he wo n't fall but he 'll definitely slide a bit .
and when he sinks , he 'll pull the red-green coalition down a bit further .

but many cases remain unsolved and bitter feuds prevent other paintings being returned . a cultural legacy left over from the third reich which german museums continue to face is the return of stolen art .
since 1998 when a conference in washington heralded the beginning of a concerted effort by germany and 43 other countries to find and return artworks stolen by the nazis during world war ii , museums across the country have experienced the headaches attached to this quest . one on-going saga involving three paintings seized by the nazis between 1937 and 1939 was resolved this week when they were returned to their original jewish owners after a long legal wrangle , a local official said on wednesday . a spokeswoman for city authorities in wuppertal , western germany , said the handover , which should have happened more than a year ago but was held up by a legal technicality , would go ahead " as soon as possible , once the conditions for their return are set in a contract . " the process of handing back the three paintings , which are currently on display in the city 's heydt museum , had previously been delayed by doubts about who the real owners were . the work " felsige flusslandschaft , " by frankfurt artist otto scholderer , was bought by the museum in 1939 after its forced sale a year earlier .
" erinnerung vom dampfboot auf der donau , " by adolph menzel , was given as a gift to the heydt in 1956 . the owners of hans von marees ' " tatar mit pferd , " forced into sale in 1937 , fled germany for the netherlands where they were caught and killed in a concentration camp in 1944 .

returning stolen art to the rightful owners 60 years after it was first taken is an awkward affair .
despite the best efforts of the german states and local authorities , which have been keeping an internet database of reportedly stolen artefacts , many critics have derided these attempts , citing inexact information and conflicts of interest . one particularly high-profile case is still caught in a bitter impasse due to these reasons .
emil nold 's " buchsbaumgarten , " valued at around € 500,000 -lrb- $ 656,275 -rrb- , remains in the possession of duisburg 's wilhelm lehmbruck museum despite substantiated claims by ruth haller , a relative of jewish lawyer and art collector ismar littmann . after the nazis banned littmann from practicing , he committed suicide in 1934 and his family had to sell part of his collection .
the rest was confiscated by the gestapo . the duisburg museum bought the painting in the 1950s without any knowledge of the painting 's history and now refuses to return it . legal gray area bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portrait of wally , painted by the late austrian expressionist egon schiele .
the museum of modern art turned down pleas from two jewish families to hold onto two paintings in a traveling exhibit while they press claims that the artworks were lost to nazi wartime plundering .
there are very few legal statutes regarding the return of stolen art appropriated by the nazis .
while court rulings decide the fate of some , the majority of cases are fought on moral and ethical grounds and many victims of the third reich base their cases on emotional pleas . however , since the summer of 2003 , the federal stolen art ethics committee has mediated in many cases between victims and museums .
even so , the committee can only recommend solutions and can not rule in favor of one party or the other .

emil nold 's " buchsbaumgarten , " valued at around € 500,000 -lrb- $ 656,275 -rrb- , remains in the possession of duisburg 's wilhelm lehmbruck museum despite substantiated claims by ruth haller , a relative of jewish lawyer and art collector ismar littmann . after the nazis banned littmann from practicing , he committed suicide in 1934 and his family had to sell part of his collection .
the rest was confiscated by the gestapo . the duisburg museum bought the painting in the 1950s without any knowledge of the painting 's history and now refuses to return it . legal gray area bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portrait of wally , painted by the late austrian expressionist egon schiele .
the museum of modern art turned down pleas from two jewish families to hold onto two paintings in a traveling exhibit while they press claims that the artworks were lost to nazi wartime plundering .
there are very few legal statutes regarding the return of stolen art appropriated by the nazis .
while court rulings decide the fate of some , the majority of cases are fought on moral and ethical grounds and many victims of the third reich base their cases on emotional pleas . however , since the summer of 2003 , the federal stolen art ethics committee has mediated in many cases between victims and museums .

in a letter to the german government , kroes demanded more clarification on how the public networks are funded . " the commission 's preliminary view is that the current financing system is no longer in line with eu rules , " the letter read . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zdf 's star team of sports presenters the eu competition watchdogs were reacting to complaints lodged by commercial television networks in germany in 2003 that their state-funded rivals used illegal subsidies .
on thursday , kroes ' department made it clear that it considered the funding of public television in germany to amount to a sort of unlawful state subsidy which hampered free competition in several areas . apart from germany , the eu investigation has also centered on ireland and the netherlands .
on thursday , kroes dashed off similar letters to governments in dublin and amsterdam .
kroes has warned that the three eu member states needed to ensure transparency in the financing of their public television networks and make a clear distinction between their public activities and other commercial ventures such as the internet and digital tv . the commission insisted that it was n't questioning the national right of the eu 's 25 member states to set their own level of funding and public license fees as well as the objectives of their public broadcasters so long as they do not unfairly harm private sector competitors . online services under scrutiny too the eu investigation is expected to have a far-reaching effect on public broadcasters ' rights to offer online services .

they are reported to point to these interventions as being directly contradictory to previous eu rulings upholding the right of britain 's public network bbc to go ahead with nine digital tv and radio channels or even ard 's special interest channels , phoenix and kinderkanal . while deutsche welle is part of the ard network , it is not funded by license fees but government money . ard and zdf are now said to be looking at scaling down their internet services as a precautionary measure and only provide internet content relating to their programming schedules . the bbc is also said to be worriedly watching brussels ' investigation of public networks in germany , ireland and the netherlands .
top bbc executives are reportedly in talks with their counterparts at the german broadcasters as well as eu officials over what the case might mean for them . brussels wants independent monitor kroes on thursday also demanded the setting up of an independent national authority that would monitor the upholding of transparency in the funding of public broadcasters .
she pointed out that eu members france , italy , spain and portugal had already bowed to similar eu demands in the past . germany , ireland and the netherlands will now have about four weeks to react to brussels ' letter .

" in coma and looking for work germany 2004 : the road to reform germany -pipe- 03.03.2005 schröder accepts opposition offer of help großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition wants berlin to adopt their ten-point program as unemployment in germany reaches new heights , chancellor schröder says he 's willing to discuss new reforms with the conservative opposition so long as their motive is more than electioneering . angela merkel , leader of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , and edmund stoiber , leader of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- have written to schröder proposing their parties join forces to develop immediate strategies to combat joblessness . " continuing with business as usual is not an option , " they said , urging the government to accept their " ten-point plan for germany . " in yemen , schröder responded positively to their offer , but rejected aspects of their proposals including the relaxing of laws protecting german employees from dismissal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder " anyone who thinks dismissal protection law is the main obstacle to new appointments shows they have little understanding of the real problem , " he said . he also insisted their help should be unconditional .
" if their willingness to talk comes with certain conditions , they are laying themselves open to accusations of playing games that the people of this country do not need given their problems , " the chancellor said . election campaign tied to reducing joblessness after their disappointing results in the northern state of schleswig holstein in february , schröder 's social democrats are pinning their hopes on the may poll in north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state and a traditional spd stronghold . the result is expected to indicate the outcome of the 2006 general election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but data published tuesday shows that unemployment in the state has topped the 1 million mark , excacerbating public anger at the government 's failure to trigger job growth . " we say to our friends in berlin , you have to persevere and create more impulse for growth despite the difficult budgetary situation , " harald schartau , the spd leader in north rhine-westphalia said on german television . nationwide , 5.22 million people are looking for work - a rise of 177,000 over january , and more than half a million above the figure at the same time last year , according to figures released by the federal labor agency pressure on berlin to unveil new job creation schemes is mounting . with nearly 13 percent of the workforce currently unemployed , germany is seeing its highest jobless rate since the 1930s . " the figures can be explained " chancellor gerhard schröder , currently on a tour of seven gulf states , took time out in quatar on wednesday to comment on the latest figures . " there 's no doubt that the unemployment figures are depressing , " he said .
" but we ca n't allow ourselves to be forced on the defensive .
the figures can be explained .
in january alone 360,000 people who had been on social support payments were included in the jobless totals . "
some 75 percent of february 's 180,000 additions to the total figure can be seen as the result of a reclassification system introduced in january , with many benefit claimants added to the list for the first time thanks to new rules . ilo statistic less bleak the government can also now point to a new statistic calculated using standards set by the international labor organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- , which does not count the long-term unemployed or people who work just a few hours a week .
" we are now publishing a new monthly unemployment figure based on ilo standards , in addition to the figure calculated in the traditional way , " said economics minister wolfgang clement . this figure put unemployment at just under 4 million , well below the politically sensitive 5 million mark . cross-party cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other contributing factors to the apparent rise in joblessness are the weak economy and the current cold weather , which has badly hit the hitting the construction industry . but while berlin insists its efforts to tackle joblessness with the controversial " hartz iv " labor market reforms need time to take effect , the conservative opposition argues the government needs to change tack . " we need a program to bolster medium-sized business and a program for lower energy costs , " argued angela merkel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.03.2005 eu probes germany 's public tv funding großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on brussels ' viewfinder : german public tv network ard european union regulators have warned germany that its funding for public television partly violates eu state aid law and urged it to set up an independent supervisory panel to ensure more transparency . european union competition commissioner neelie kroes on thursday told germany that it needed to overhaul its funding system for state-owned channels ard and zdf .
in a letter to the german government , kroes demanded more clarification on how the public networks are funded . " the commission 's preliminary view is that the current financing system is no longer in line with eu rules , " the letter read . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zdf 's star team of sports presenters the eu competition watchdogs were reacting to complaints lodged by commercial television networks in germany in 2003 that their state-funded rivals used illegal subsidies .
on thursday , kroes ' department made it clear that it considered the funding of public television in germany to amount to a sort of unlawful state subsidy which hampered free competition in several areas . apart from germany , the eu investigation has also centered on ireland and the netherlands .
on thursday , kroes dashed off similar letters to governments in dublin and amsterdam .
kroes has warned that the three eu member states needed to ensure transparency in the financing of their public television networks and make a clear distinction between their public activities and other commercial ventures such as the internet and digital tv . the commission insisted that it was n't questioning the national right of the eu 's 25 member states to set their own level of funding and public license fees as well as the objectives of their public broadcasters so long as they do not unfairly harm private sector competitors . online services under scrutiny too the eu investigation is expected to have a far-reaching effect on public broadcasters ' rights to offer online services .
among other things , germany 's commercial networks in 2003 charged that services for sale on the web sites of state-owned channels make unfair use of public money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes , eu competition commissioner kroes -lrb- photo -rrb- too is believed to have serious misgivings about the use of license fees - some € 17 -lrb- $ 22.32 -rrb- a month in germany and collected by germany 's central office for licensing fees -lrb- gez -rrb- - to fund internet services , seeing it as an illegal cross-subsidy . german public television networks ard and zdf , which were set up after the second world war to ensure pluralism after the nazi dictatorship , are now moving into sponsorship and offer a host of spin-off commercial activities on their web sites . the networks , controlled ultimately by germany 's 16 federal states , are now worried that the eu 's intervention might severely curtail their online services .
they are reported to point to these interventions as being directly contradictory to previous eu rulings upholding the right of britain 's public network bbc to go ahead with nine digital tv and radio channels or even ard 's special interest channels , phoenix and kinderkanal . while deutsche welle is part of the ard network , it is not funded by license fees but government money . ard and zdf are now said to be looking at scaling down their internet services as a precautionary measure and only provide internet content relating to their programming schedules . the bbc is also said to be worriedly watching brussels ' investigation of public networks in germany , ireland and the netherlands .
top bbc executives are reportedly in talks with their counterparts at the german broadcasters as well as eu officials over what the case might mean for them . brussels wants independent monitor kroes on thursday also demanded the setting up of an independent national authority that would monitor the upholding of transparency in the funding of public broadcasters .
she pointed out that eu members france , italy , spain and portugal had already bowed to similar eu demands in the past . germany , ireland and the netherlands will now have about four weeks to react to brussels ' letter .
kroes has already announced that brussels will drop the investigation if the three countries take the necessary steps to get their funding of public networks in order . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de media davids vs. goliath with government funding and hefty advertising revenues , public broadcasters in germany and europe have astronomically high budgets for buying olympic rights .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.03.2005 an end to superstar fischer ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer 's popularity has suffered recently foreign minister joschka fischer has long been one of germany 's most popular politicians .
but a scandal involving the abuse of tourist visas has dented his reputation and is threatening to unravel his political future . last weekend , fischer gave a speech that was likely one of the most difficult of his lengthy political career .
in an address to members of his greens party at a regional congress , he had to admit he had made mistakes in handling a widening affair in which foreign criminals made use of relaxed visa requirements – approved by fischer – to smuggle people into germany . while he rejected demands by the conservative opposition to resign , the fact that fischer felt compelled to devote his speech to the visa scandal shows just how much the matter has the experienced political operator on the defensive . " fischer certainly underestimated the situation , " dr. jürgen falter , director of the domestic politics program at the university of mainz , told dw-world .
" at the moment it does n't look like it will push him from office , but we 'll have to wait and see if more serious revelations come to light . " opposition politicians claim thousands of illegal immigrants – including many from ukraine and china – were able to enter germany between 2000 and 2003 after tourist visa criteria were relaxed .
they say that led to an increase in organized crime , drugs and prostitution on fischer 's watch . admirers and enemies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer looks on during the greens party congress in rostock , eastern germany , on saturday , nov .
24 , 2001 .
known as someone who does n't suffer fools gladly , fischer has as many enemies as he does admirers in parliament , the press , and even in his own party .
over the years , he has developed a reputation as being aloof and arrogant to journalists and his colleagues .
perhaps worse , he has the nasty habit of unnecessarily humiliating those working for him at the foreign ministry .
it appears as if fischer is now reaping what he 's sown as those who feel slighted by the minister look for some payback . " he always thought he was almost invulnerable and could survive anything , which was the case up till now , " fischer 's biographer bernd ulrich said in a recent radio interview with deutschlandfunk .
" that 's why he 's approached this matter with a certain amount of arrogance . " yet despite his prickly public persona , fischer has consistently ranked as one of germany 's most popular politicians .
born in 1948 as the humble son of butcher in stuttgart , fischer has one of the most unconventional backgrounds of the country 's political elite .
having left school in 10th grade , he made a living in the 1970s as a taxi driver before helping set up the greens and leading the upstart party into parliament in the 1980s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer said he recognized himself on this picture of being beaten by the police in 1968 .
other photos showed fischer beating a police officer .

unlike many of his peers , the pioneering economist is happy to work in germany - despite his international reputation . why do you always get out-bid on internet auctions ?
are buyer 's recommendations reliable ?
why does the price always rocket at the last minute ? if you want to understand how ebay works , then 36-year-old axel ockenfels is your man .
online bidding practices are one of his areas of expertise , and his students at the laboratory for controlled experimental economics at cologne university are finding out what it takes to get what you want in the cut-throat world of the online marketplace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " typically , what happens is , the person who wins , pays too much , " says ockenfels .
" the person who wins is n't the person who 's estimated the value of the product most precisely , but the person who 's most overestimated its value . " experimental economics ockenfels ' analysis of contemporary economic behavior has propelled him to the forefront of his field .
a protegé of reinhard selten , germany 's one and only winner of the nobel prize for economics , ockenfels ' research into experimental economics and game theory sheds light on the way modern man behaves when it comes to economic decision making - and proves that traditional economics has had its day . " the hypothesis that man is rational and egotistical is one that was n't put to the test for a long time , " explains ockenfels .
" man probably is n't as self-serving as economists would like him to be .
man himself has n't changed , but economic theories have .
new ideas and empirical evidence have been incorporated into economic theory and the concept of the ' homo oeconomicus ' is now less accepted . " the psychology of economics according to game theory , there 's a key psychological aspect to economics .
envy , rivalry and a desire for fairness all play a role . " people 's first priority is n't just getting a bargain , " insists ockenfels .
" they also keep an eye on what other people are getting and their status in their peer group . " " it 's important to understand theory , " he stresses , " but it 's also important to understand how people react .
i feel that a lot of textbooks neglect the empirical and experimental dimensions of economic behaviour and overly concentrate on theories developed in ivory towers . " leaving the ivory tower - but not germany no one can accuse axel ockenfels of living in an ivory tower .
at the age of 36 , he 's already one of the influential economic scientists in the world , hotly pursued by the world 's best universities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but unlike many of germany 's a-list scientists , he 's never been tempted to join the brain-drain crowd and head to the us to enjoy the higher salaries and first-class research opportunities available at the country 's generously funded ivy league schools .
now that he 's scooped germany 's most lucrative research prize , worth € 1.55 million -lrb- $ 2 million -rrb- , he probably feels vindicated in his decision . as far as he 's concerned , germany is where he can work best .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.03.2005 eu probes germany 's public tv funding großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on brussels ' viewfinder : german public tv network ard european union regulators have warned germany that its funding for public television partly violates eu state aid law and urged it to set up an independent supervisory panel to ensure more transparency . european union competition commissioner neelie kroes on thursday told germany that it needed to overhaul its funding system for state-owned channels ard and zdf .
in a letter to the german government , kroes demanded more clarification on how the public networks are funded . " the commission 's preliminary view is that the current financing system is no longer in line with eu rules , " the letter read . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zdf 's star team of sports presenters the eu competition watchdogs were reacting to complaints lodged by commercial television networks in germany in 2003 that their state-funded rivals used illegal subsidies .
on thursday , kroes ' department made it clear that it considered the funding of public television in germany to amount to a sort of unlawful state subsidy which hampered free competition in several areas . apart from germany , the eu investigation has also centered on ireland and the netherlands .
on thursday , kroes dashed off similar letters to governments in dublin and amsterdam .
kroes has warned that the three eu member states needed to ensure transparency in the financing of their public television networks and make a clear distinction between their public activities and other commercial ventures such as the internet and digital tv . the commission insisted that it was n't questioning the national right of the eu 's 25 member states to set their own level of funding and public license fees as well as the objectives of their public broadcasters so long as they do not unfairly harm private sector competitors . online services under scrutiny too the eu investigation is expected to have a far-reaching effect on public broadcasters ' rights to offer online services .
among other things , germany 's commercial networks in 2003 charged that services for sale on the web sites of state-owned channels make unfair use of public money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes , eu competition commissioner kroes -lrb- photo -rrb- too is believed to have serious misgivings about the use of license fees - some € 17 -lrb- $ 22.32 -rrb- a month in germany and collected by germany 's central office for licensing fees -lrb- gez -rrb- - to fund internet services , seeing it as an illegal cross-subsidy . german public television networks ard and zdf , which were set up after the second world war to ensure pluralism after the nazi dictatorship , are now moving into sponsorship and offer a host of spin-off commercial activities on their web sites . the networks , controlled ultimately by germany 's 16 federal states , are now worried that the eu 's intervention might severely curtail their online services .
they are reported to point to these interventions as being directly contradictory to previous eu rulings upholding the right of britain 's public network bbc to go ahead with nine digital tv and radio channels or even ard 's special interest channels , phoenix and kinderkanal . while deutsche welle is part of the ard network , it is not funded by license fees but government money . ard and zdf are now said to be looking at scaling down their internet services as a precautionary measure and only provide internet content relating to their programming schedules . the bbc is also said to be worriedly watching brussels ' investigation of public networks in germany , ireland and the netherlands .
top bbc executives are reportedly in talks with their counterparts at the german broadcasters as well as eu officials over what the case might mean for them . brussels wants independent monitor kroes on thursday also demanded the setting up of an independent national authority that would monitor the upholding of transparency in the funding of public broadcasters .
she pointed out that eu members france , italy , spain and portugal had already bowed to similar eu demands in the past . germany , ireland and the netherlands will now have about four weeks to react to brussels ' letter .
kroes has already announced that brussels will drop the investigation if the three countries take the necessary steps to get their funding of public networks in order . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de media davids vs. goliath with government funding and hefty advertising revenues , public broadcasters in germany and europe have astronomically high budgets for buying olympic rights .

unlike many of his peers , the pioneering economist is happy to work in germany - despite his international reputation . why do you always get out-bid on internet auctions ?
are buyer 's recommendations reliable ?
why does the price always rocket at the last minute ? if you want to understand how ebay works , then 36-year-old axel ockenfels is your man .
online bidding practices are one of his areas of expertise , and his students at the laboratory for controlled experimental economics at cologne university are finding out what it takes to get what you want in the cut-throat world of the online marketplace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " typically , what happens is , the person who wins , pays too much , " says ockenfels .
" the person who wins is n't the person who 's estimated the value of the product most precisely , but the person who 's most overestimated its value . " experimental economics ockenfels ' analysis of contemporary economic behavior has propelled him to the forefront of his field .
a protegé of reinhard selten , germany 's one and only winner of the nobel prize for economics , ockenfels ' research into experimental economics and game theory sheds light on the way modern man behaves when it comes to economic decision making - and proves that traditional economics has had its day . " the hypothesis that man is rational and egotistical is one that was n't put to the test for a long time , " explains ockenfels .
" man probably is n't as self-serving as economists would like him to be .
man himself has n't changed , but economic theories have .
new ideas and empirical evidence have been incorporated into economic theory and the concept of the ' homo oeconomicus ' is now less accepted . " the psychology of economics according to game theory , there 's a key psychological aspect to economics .
envy , rivalry and a desire for fairness all play a role . " people 's first priority is n't just getting a bargain , " insists ockenfels .
" they also keep an eye on what other people are getting and their status in their peer group . " " it 's important to understand theory , " he stresses , " but it 's also important to understand how people react .
i feel that a lot of textbooks neglect the empirical and experimental dimensions of economic behaviour and overly concentrate on theories developed in ivory towers . " leaving the ivory tower - but not germany no one can accuse axel ockenfels of living in an ivory tower .
at the age of 36 , he 's already one of the influential economic scientists in the world , hotly pursued by the world 's best universities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but unlike many of germany 's a-list scientists , he 's never been tempted to join the brain-drain crowd and head to the us to enjoy the higher salaries and first-class research opportunities available at the country 's generously funded ivy league schools .
now that he 's scooped germany 's most lucrative research prize , worth € 1.55 million -lrb- $ 2 million -rrb- , he probably feels vindicated in his decision . as far as he 's concerned , germany is where he can work best . " no other country in the world has as many experimental laboratories , " he says .
" but people wo n't have realized this until the next generation of professors has come of age . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bidders burned by ebay in time change regulars on the internet auction site ebay know that deals are made in the final minute of bidding .
but when clocks in europe were set back an hour sunday morning , many went home empty-handed . -lrb- oct .

the iaea had reported key areas where iran was refusing to cooperate with un inspectors . " while transparency visits have taken place , iran seems to have been determined to limit their scope , " said british ambassador robin wright , reading from the joint statement . the europeans still took a more conciliatory tone than the americans .
they noted that iran 's decision to suspend uranium enrichment - which can be used for either nuclear energy or to make atomic weapons - was " a voluntary commitment " and urged tehran to keep its word . the us maintains that iran 's nuclear activities are designed for a clandestine weapons program .
the head of the us delegation to the iaea board , jackie sanders , cited " an alarming number " of unresolved questions and warned that the iaea could not put off " forever " taking tehran before the un security council for possible sanctions . refusal of inspections causes friction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like the us , the europeans criticized iran for refusing to allow un inspectors to visit its military site in parchin , a site where there are definitely nuclear materials , where washington accuses tehran of simulating testing of nuclear weapons . the iranian delegate to the iaea , cyrus nasseri , said iran was not allowing a second visit to parchin , after a first one in january , in part because it was concerned about information leaks " in view of potential threats of military strikes against iran 's safeguarded and other facilities " by what he called " a major nuclear weapons state " in a clear reference to the united states . but iaea director-general mohamed el baradei said that iran was a " special case " since its nuclear program " has been clandestine for almost two decades " and he asked tehran to allow widespread visits by un inspectors .
the europeans endorsed el baradei 's call for iran to come clean " in order to make up for the confidence deficit created by past activities and to build the necessary confidence in the future , " the european statement said . us president george w. bush has said washington is seeking a diplomatic solution in iran and supports eu talks with tehran .
but bush has said all options , including the military one , remain on the table . bush considers dangling the carrot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , it appears that the president is increasingly aligning himself with european efforts and is considering offering incentives to iran , according to us officials on thursday .
in a preparatory statement ahead of an expected announcement of the us strategy later this week , the united states said it would not block iran as it seeks to start the process of joining the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , and would not stand in the way of european allies if they want to sell tehran parts for civilian aircraft . white house spokesman scott mcclellan said the president had not finalized his decision but said that the united states and europe were discussing " how we can move forward together on a common strategy to get iran to abandon any ambitions for a nuclear weapon . " " we want to do our part to support the european efforts .
this is about strengthening their diplomatic approach to resolving this matter , " he added . in return for supporting incentives , it is likely that the americans would insist that iran abandon uranium enrichment , the major sticking point in the on-going negotiations .
but while it appears that the us has shifted considerable ground , the reality is a little different .
the europeans and the americans would get the better end of the deal if iran accepts the incentives . wto accession a one-sided deal ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- headquarters in geneva , switzerland .
" it is a carrot , and it 's not a very big one , " a senior congressional aide involved in the wto issue was quoted as saying by reuters . membership of the wto can take years after a country has been granted observer status , the first stepping stone to full accession . iran would have a stipulated five years after observer status is achieved to begin the process of moving toward full membership and actual entry into the wto can take many more after that .
however , negotiations on iran 's membership could be strung out indefinitely by the us , binding the iranians to years of concessions over its nuclear program . if the iranians see through this and refuse to accept the incentives , maintaining their efforts to enrich uranium , then the us would resort to its original course of action which would be to take iran to the un security council for possible sanctions . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran signs russian nuclear deal iran and russia on sunday signed a landmark nuclear fuel accord that paves the way for the islamic republic 's first atomic power station , a project the united states alleges is part of a cover for weapons development .

" in coma and looking for work germany 2004 : the road to reform germany -pipe- 03.03.2005 schröder accepts opposition offer of help großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition wants berlin to adopt their ten-point program as unemployment in germany reaches new heights , chancellor schröder says he 's willing to discuss new reforms with the conservative opposition so long as their motive is more than electioneering . angela merkel , leader of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , and edmund stoiber , leader of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- have written to schröder proposing their parties join forces to develop immediate strategies to combat joblessness . " continuing with business as usual is not an option , " they said , urging the government to accept their " ten-point plan for germany . " in yemen , schröder responded positively to their offer , but rejected aspects of their proposals including the relaxing of laws protecting german employees from dismissal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder " anyone who thinks dismissal protection law is the main obstacle to new appointments shows they have little understanding of the real problem , " he said . he also insisted their help should be unconditional .
" if their willingness to talk comes with certain conditions , they are laying themselves open to accusations of playing games that the people of this country do not need given their problems , " the chancellor said . election campaign tied to reducing joblessness after their disappointing results in the northern state of schleswig holstein in february , schröder 's social democrats are pinning their hopes on the may poll in north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state and a traditional spd stronghold . the result is expected to indicate the outcome of the 2006 general election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but data published tuesday shows that unemployment in the state has topped the 1 million mark , excacerbating public anger at the government 's failure to trigger job growth . " we say to our friends in berlin , you have to persevere and create more impulse for growth despite the difficult budgetary situation , " harald schartau , the spd leader in north rhine-westphalia said on german television . nationwide , 5.22 million people are looking for work - a rise of 177,000 over january , and more than half a million above the figure at the same time last year , according to figures released by the federal labor agency pressure on berlin to unveil new job creation schemes is mounting . with nearly 13 percent of the workforce currently unemployed , germany is seeing its highest jobless rate since the 1930s . " the figures can be explained " chancellor gerhard schröder , currently on a tour of seven gulf states , took time out in quatar on wednesday to comment on the latest figures . " there 's no doubt that the unemployment figures are depressing , " he said .
" but we ca n't allow ourselves to be forced on the defensive .
the figures can be explained .
in january alone 360,000 people who had been on social support payments were included in the jobless totals . "
some 75 percent of february 's 180,000 additions to the total figure can be seen as the result of a reclassification system introduced in january , with many benefit claimants added to the list for the first time thanks to new rules . ilo statistic less bleak the government can also now point to a new statistic calculated using standards set by the international labor organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- , which does not count the long-term unemployed or people who work just a few hours a week .
" we are now publishing a new monthly unemployment figure based on ilo standards , in addition to the figure calculated in the traditional way , " said economics minister wolfgang clement . this figure put unemployment at just under 4 million , well below the politically sensitive 5 million mark . cross-party cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other contributing factors to the apparent rise in joblessness are the weak economy and the current cold weather , which has badly hit the hitting the construction industry . but while berlin insists its efforts to tackle joblessness with the controversial " hartz iv " labor market reforms need time to take effect , the conservative opposition argues the government needs to change tack .

but a scandal involving the abuse of tourist visas has dented his reputation and is threatening to unravel his political future . last weekend , fischer gave a speech that was likely one of the most difficult of his lengthy political career .
in an address to members of his greens party at a regional congress , he had to admit he had made mistakes in handling a widening affair in which foreign criminals made use of relaxed visa requirements – approved by fischer – to smuggle people into germany . while he rejected demands by the conservative opposition to resign , the fact that fischer felt compelled to devote his speech to the visa scandal shows just how much the matter has the experienced political operator on the defensive . " fischer certainly underestimated the situation , " dr. jürgen falter , director of the domestic politics program at the university of mainz , told dw-world .
" at the moment it does n't look like it will push him from office , but we 'll have to wait and see if more serious revelations come to light . " opposition politicians claim thousands of illegal immigrants – including many from ukraine and china – were able to enter germany between 2000 and 2003 after tourist visa criteria were relaxed .
they say that led to an increase in organized crime , drugs and prostitution on fischer 's watch . admirers and enemies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer looks on during the greens party congress in rostock , eastern germany , on saturday , nov .
24 , 2001 .
known as someone who does n't suffer fools gladly , fischer has as many enemies as he does admirers in parliament , the press , and even in his own party .
over the years , he has developed a reputation as being aloof and arrogant to journalists and his colleagues .
perhaps worse , he has the nasty habit of unnecessarily humiliating those working for him at the foreign ministry .
it appears as if fischer is now reaping what he 's sown as those who feel slighted by the minister look for some payback . " he always thought he was almost invulnerable and could survive anything , which was the case up till now , " fischer 's biographer bernd ulrich said in a recent radio interview with deutschlandfunk .
" that 's why he 's approached this matter with a certain amount of arrogance . " yet despite his prickly public persona , fischer has consistently ranked as one of germany 's most popular politicians .
born in 1948 as the humble son of butcher in stuttgart , fischer has one of the most unconventional backgrounds of the country 's political elite .
having left school in 10th grade , he made a living in the 1970s as a taxi driver before helping set up the greens and leading the upstart party into parliament in the 1980s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer said he recognized himself on this picture of being beaten by the police in 1968 .
other photos showed fischer beating a police officer .
while he lived in frankfurt , he also became involved in the leftwing student protests of 1968 .
during that turbulent time he was involved in violent street fighting with the police .
pictures of him made public in 2001 in a black motorcycle helmet kicking a police officer during a protest led conservatives to call for his head . authentic and quirky but german chancellor gerhard schröder stuck by him back then and the public chalked up the affair as a youthful indiscretion on fischer 's part .
and for many germans , it was simply more proof of his " authenticity " that has made him both the greens ' elder statesman and a quirky public figure that could do little wrong . " he has a personality bonus , " explained richard hilmer from the public polling organization infratest / dimap .
" he 's considered a different kind of politician .
his moving background is considered convincing and authentic . " but the visa affair has battered fischer 's reputation in the eyes of many .
for the first time in three years , fischer last week lost his status as germany 's most popular politician in a regular poll by public broadcaster zdf . " he 's smacked quite a few people around and that has come back to haunt him .
there appears to be quite a bit of schadenfreude over his predicament , " dr. falter said , adding he expected fischer to survive the current scandal largely intact .
" if he makes it through this he 'll be know as the teflon minister .
nothing will stick to him . " schröder 's backing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka and gerd .
as in 2001 , schröder has once again demonstratively backed his foreign minister , saying there was no question that fischer will stay in office .
the chancellor has also expressed his desire to stand for reelection in 2006 with fischer at his side . fischer biographer ulrich even said the governing center-left coalition of social democrats and greens could possible survive with another chancellor than schröder , but that the foreign minister was indispensable . " he 's too important for the stability of the coalition , " he said , adding that because of the visa affair fischer had also become a liability .
" he wo n't fall but he 'll definitely slide a bit .
and when he sinks , he 'll pull the red-green coalition down a bit further .

but his serbian counterpart could n't agree less . two weeks ago , montenegro 's prime minister milo djukanovic wrote to the serbian government outlining his hopes for the future of the two nations .
his plan foresaw serbia and montenegro ending the state union of serbia and montenegro and forming independent nations , without a union parliament but with a form of federal council . although the two states would maintain a central administration in charge of economic and political affairs , they would operate separate foreign and defence policies . premature pressure the union of serbia and montenegro was voted into existence by the yugoslav parliament in 2003 .
the eu-brokered belgrade agreement marked an end to a long-drawn out constitutional crisis and was designed to remain in place for a minimum of three years , after which the two republics were to hold referendums on whether to maintain the union arrangement or vote for independence . djukanovic has made no bones about his desire to end the union and insists his proposal does not represent any breach of the agreement , even though this is supposedly valid until 2006 .
but he 's determined to forge ahead with the referendum determining whether or not the tiny republic can attain full sovereignty . " we have made our intentions clear to both our partners both in belgrade and brussels , " he said . more differences than similarities the loose union has always been seen as a provisional solution only , with its primary task billed as foreign and defense policy , while the respective republics retained autonomy regarding economic and customs issues . montenegro has adopted the euro , while serbia is holding tightly onto the dinar .
montenegro relies heavily on tourism , while serbia 's economic mainstays are agriculture and industry - differences which make a cohesive tax and customs policy impossible . and while serbia is keen to invest in its dilapidated armed forces , montenegro wants to introduce a 4000-strong professional army . on march 3 , the mandates of all the deputies in the state union parliament expire .

but his serbian counterpart could n't agree less . two weeks ago , montenegro 's prime minister milo djukanovic wrote to the serbian government outlining his hopes for the future of the two nations .
his plan foresaw serbia and montenegro ending the state union of serbia and montenegro and forming independent nations , without a union parliament but with a form of federal council . although the two states would maintain a central administration in charge of economic and political affairs , they would operate separate foreign and defence policies . premature pressure the union of serbia and montenegro was voted into existence by the yugoslav parliament in 2003 .
the eu-brokered belgrade agreement marked an end to a long-drawn out constitutional crisis and was designed to remain in place for a minimum of three years , after which the two republics were to hold referendums on whether to maintain the union arrangement or vote for independence . djukanovic has made no bones about his desire to end the union and insists his proposal does not represent any breach of the agreement , even though this is supposedly valid until 2006 .

1 , 2010 , a german city will celebrate its first day as europe 's cultural capital .
what 's still unclear , however , is which town will be able to do so as 10 cities across the country are still in the running . from lübeck in the north to karlsruhe in the south , from görlitz in the east to essen in the west , the contenders have lobbying hard to bring home the title .
whether it 's prominent supporters such as halle native and former german foreign minister hans-dietrich genscher promoting his city on posters across the country or regensburg enlisting scandalous theater director christoph schlingensief to put on an -lrb- albeit unflattering -rrb- play about the bavarian town , most have come up with ways to get some attention . on march 10 and 11 , a jury of experts will pick two cities and recommend them to germany 's upper house , the bundesrat .

" in coma and looking for work germany 2004 : the road to reform germany -pipe- 03.03.2005 schröder accepts opposition offer of help großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition wants berlin to adopt their ten-point program as unemployment in germany reaches new heights , chancellor schröder says he 's willing to discuss new reforms with the conservative opposition so long as their motive is more than electioneering . angela merkel , leader of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , and edmund stoiber , leader of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- have written to schröder proposing their parties join forces to develop immediate strategies to combat joblessness . " continuing with business as usual is not an option , " they said , urging the government to accept their " ten-point plan for germany . " in yemen , schröder responded positively to their offer , but rejected aspects of their proposals including the relaxing of laws protecting german employees from dismissal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder " anyone who thinks dismissal protection law is the main obstacle to new appointments shows they have little understanding of the real problem , " he said . he also insisted their help should be unconditional .
" if their willingness to talk comes with certain conditions , they are laying themselves open to accusations of playing games that the people of this country do not need given their problems , " the chancellor said . election campaign tied to reducing joblessness after their disappointing results in the northern state of schleswig holstein in february , schröder 's social democrats are pinning their hopes on the may poll in north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state and a traditional spd stronghold . the result is expected to indicate the outcome of the 2006 general election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but data published tuesday shows that unemployment in the state has topped the 1 million mark , excacerbating public anger at the government 's failure to trigger job growth . " we say to our friends in berlin , you have to persevere and create more impulse for growth despite the difficult budgetary situation , " harald schartau , the spd leader in north rhine-westphalia said on german television . nationwide , 5.22 million people are looking for work - a rise of 177,000 over january , and more than half a million above the figure at the same time last year , according to figures released by the federal labor agency pressure on berlin to unveil new job creation schemes is mounting . with nearly 13 percent of the workforce currently unemployed , germany is seeing its highest jobless rate since the 1930s . " the figures can be explained " chancellor gerhard schröder , currently on a tour of seven gulf states , took time out in quatar on wednesday to comment on the latest figures . " there 's no doubt that the unemployment figures are depressing , " he said .
" but we ca n't allow ourselves to be forced on the defensive .
the figures can be explained .
in january alone 360,000 people who had been on social support payments were included in the jobless totals . "
some 75 percent of february 's 180,000 additions to the total figure can be seen as the result of a reclassification system introduced in january , with many benefit claimants added to the list for the first time thanks to new rules . ilo statistic less bleak the government can also now point to a new statistic calculated using standards set by the international labor organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- , which does not count the long-term unemployed or people who work just a few hours a week .
" we are now publishing a new monthly unemployment figure based on ilo standards , in addition to the figure calculated in the traditional way , " said economics minister wolfgang clement . this figure put unemployment at just under 4 million , well below the politically sensitive 5 million mark . cross-party cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other contributing factors to the apparent rise in joblessness are the weak economy and the current cold weather , which has badly hit the hitting the construction industry . but while berlin insists its efforts to tackle joblessness with the controversial " hartz iv " labor market reforms need time to take effect , the conservative opposition argues the government needs to change tack . " we need a program to bolster medium-sized business and a program for lower energy costs , " argued angela merkel .

in a letter to the german government , kroes demanded more clarification on how the public networks are funded . " the commission 's preliminary view is that the current financing system is no longer in line with eu rules , " the letter read . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zdf 's star team of sports presenters the eu competition watchdogs were reacting to complaints lodged by commercial television networks in germany in 2003 that their state-funded rivals used illegal subsidies .
on thursday , kroes ' department made it clear that it considered the funding of public television in germany to amount to a sort of unlawful state subsidy which hampered free competition in several areas . apart from germany , the eu investigation has also centered on ireland and the netherlands .
on thursday , kroes dashed off similar letters to governments in dublin and amsterdam .
kroes has warned that the three eu member states needed to ensure transparency in the financing of their public television networks and make a clear distinction between their public activities and other commercial ventures such as the internet and digital tv . the commission insisted that it was n't questioning the national right of the eu 's 25 member states to set their own level of funding and public license fees as well as the objectives of their public broadcasters so long as they do not unfairly harm private sector competitors . online services under scrutiny too the eu investigation is expected to have a far-reaching effect on public broadcasters ' rights to offer online services .

they are reported to point to these interventions as being directly contradictory to previous eu rulings upholding the right of britain 's public network bbc to go ahead with nine digital tv and radio channels or even ard 's special interest channels , phoenix and kinderkanal . while deutsche welle is part of the ard network , it is not funded by license fees but government money . ard and zdf are now said to be looking at scaling down their internet services as a precautionary measure and only provide internet content relating to their programming schedules . the bbc is also said to be worriedly watching brussels ' investigation of public networks in germany , ireland and the netherlands .
top bbc executives are reportedly in talks with their counterparts at the german broadcasters as well as eu officials over what the case might mean for them . brussels wants independent monitor kroes on thursday also demanded the setting up of an independent national authority that would monitor the upholding of transparency in the funding of public broadcasters .
she pointed out that eu members france , italy , spain and portugal had already bowed to similar eu demands in the past . germany , ireland and the netherlands will now have about four weeks to react to brussels ' letter .

but his serbian counterpart could n't agree less . two weeks ago , montenegro 's prime minister milo djukanovic wrote to the serbian government outlining his hopes for the future of the two nations .
his plan foresaw serbia and montenegro ending the state union of serbia and montenegro and forming independent nations , without a union parliament but with a form of federal council . although the two states would maintain a central administration in charge of economic and political affairs , they would operate separate foreign and defence policies . premature pressure the union of serbia and montenegro was voted into existence by the yugoslav parliament in 2003 .
the eu-brokered belgrade agreement marked an end to a long-drawn out constitutional crisis and was designed to remain in place for a minimum of three years , after which the two republics were to hold referendums on whether to maintain the union arrangement or vote for independence . djukanovic has made no bones about his desire to end the union and insists his proposal does not represent any breach of the agreement , even though this is supposedly valid until 2006 .
but he 's determined to forge ahead with the referendum determining whether or not the tiny republic can attain full sovereignty . " we have made our intentions clear to both our partners both in belgrade and brussels , " he said . more differences than similarities the loose union has always been seen as a provisional solution only , with its primary task billed as foreign and defense policy , while the respective republics retained autonomy regarding economic and customs issues . montenegro has adopted the euro , while serbia is holding tightly onto the dinar .
montenegro relies heavily on tourism , while serbia 's economic mainstays are agriculture and industry - differences which make a cohesive tax and customs policy impossible . and while serbia is keen to invest in its dilapidated armed forces , montenegro wants to introduce a 4000-strong professional army . on march 3 , the mandates of all the deputies in the state union parliament expire .
but with montenegro and serbia unable to reach agreement as to how new elections should be held , the mandates are expected to be extended until a solution is found . time for brussels to intervene belgrade hopes this solution will come from brussels .
eu foreign policy chief javier solana - one of the signatories of the belgrade agreement - has invited djukanovic to brussels , which has always insisted serbia and montenegro will only ever join the eu in a joint bid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schroeder and svetozar marovic many in belgrade agree .
" i believe we will have a positive feasibility study by late march , and can then begin stabilization talks with the eu and also finally join nato , " said svetozar marovic , the montenegrin president of the union of serbia-montenegro and member of djukanovic 's democratic party of socialists -lrb- pictured with gerhard schröder -rrb- . but neither marovic nor the foreign minister of serbia-montenegro , vuk draskovic , appear able to influence the two sides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a kosovo albanian family walks under an albanian flag into a polling station to vote for kosovo 's general elections in capital pristina , on saturday , oct .
23 , 2004 .
voters in the u.n.-run province of kosovo elected provincial leaders saturday in a major test for international officials ' efforts to reconcile bitterly divided ethnic communities and establish a multiethnic society .
about 1.3 million voters are eligible to elect representatives to a 120-seat assembly , which in turn will elect a president and a government that holds limited authority -lrb- ap photo / visar kryeziu -rrb- the serbian government , led by prime minister vojislav kostunica is refusing to negotiate montenegrin independence , fearing it may encourage a claim for independence from serbia on the part of the kosovo-albanians , ahead of the un 's negotiations about the long-term status kosovo , which is currently an international protectorate . ulterior motives ? western europe is beginning sit up and take notice .
franz-lothar altmann , balkans expert at the berlin foundation for science and politics , says a a relaxing of joint-rule between montenegro and serbia is by no means out of the question . " why should n't the union become even looser ? " he says .
" one could even go a step further and include kosovo in the equation . " altmann also points out that independence for montenegro is very much in djukanovic 's interests .
the prime minister faces a trial in italy on charges of involvement with organized crime and cigarette smuggling in the 1990s .
it was recently decided in italy that because he is not the head of a sovereign state , he does not enjoy immunity from prosecution . were this to change , djukanovic could no longer be tried in an italian court . filip slavkovic -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de killing of serbian prime minister fuels fears about country 's stability zoran djindjic , the man who made many enemies as he tried to transform the serbia of slobodan milosevic , was assassinated on wednesday .

democrat senator joseph biden joined in , saying that the lifting of the ban would be " a non-starter with congress " after he and lugar met with president bush in the white house . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president chen shui-bian of taiwan the warning from congress follows a rebuke from taiwan 's president chen shui-bian on tuesday when he told the eu via a video link that eu plans to lift the arms embargo endangered the military balance in east asia and accused some in europe of double standards in currying favour with beijing . he added that the planned lifting of the arms ban could also let the chinese think it did not need to proceed with democratic reforms . " should the eu decide to lift its arms embargo against china it might lead to a tilt in the military balance in the taiwan strait , which would pose a clear threat to peace and stability , " he said . bush returned from his european tour smarting from his china-related encounters with european leaders , especially the one that heralded a widely reported and embarrassing no-nonsense declaration from french president jacques chirac that europe intended to lift the ban .
the end of the embargo has been penciled in for may 8 , when the eu holds a meeting with the chinese leadership . eu must prepare a case for congress the europeans are expected to make a case to congress for acceptance of their decision by arguing that the embargo was a response to tiananmen square massacre in 1989 , and that china has moved on dramatically since then .
during his visit , bush let it be known that he was " open minded " about the lifting of the ban , but told eu leaders that they would have to convince congress . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george w bush , left , poses with european union commission president jose manual barroso , following an eu summit at the european union commission headquarters in brussels , tuesday feb .

but his serbian counterpart could n't agree less . two weeks ago , montenegro 's prime minister milo djukanovic wrote to the serbian government outlining his hopes for the future of the two nations .
his plan foresaw serbia and montenegro ending the state union of serbia and montenegro and forming independent nations , without a union parliament but with a form of federal council . although the two states would maintain a central administration in charge of economic and political affairs , they would operate separate foreign and defence policies . premature pressure the union of serbia and montenegro was voted into existence by the yugoslav parliament in 2003 .
the eu-brokered belgrade agreement marked an end to a long-drawn out constitutional crisis and was designed to remain in place for a minimum of three years , after which the two republics were to hold referendums on whether to maintain the union arrangement or vote for independence . djukanovic has made no bones about his desire to end the union and insists his proposal does not represent any breach of the agreement , even though this is supposedly valid until 2006 .
but he 's determined to forge ahead with the referendum determining whether or not the tiny republic can attain full sovereignty . " we have made our intentions clear to both our partners both in belgrade and brussels , " he said . more differences than similarities the loose union has always been seen as a provisional solution only , with its primary task billed as foreign and defense policy , while the respective republics retained autonomy regarding economic and customs issues . montenegro has adopted the euro , while serbia is holding tightly onto the dinar .

whether it 's prominent supporters such as halle native and former german foreign minister hans-dietrich genscher promoting his city on posters across the country or regensburg enlisting scandalous theater director christoph schlingensief to put on an -lrb- albeit unflattering -rrb- play about the bavarian town , most have come up with ways to get some attention . on march 10 and 11 , a jury of experts will pick two cities and recommend them to germany 's upper house , the bundesrat .
the finalists will then be officially sent to brussels by the foreign ministry in the fall . to introduce you to some of germany 's finest , dw-world has put together city portraits of all the contenders .
enjoy reading them and please let us know which city you 'd pick ! dw-world.de the pope 's chosen hometown the best preserved medieval city in germany , regensburg presents a perfect combination of an inviting skyline , impressive historical monuments and legendary bavarian hospitality .

görlitz : a tale of two cities görlitz and zgorzelec are separated by the neisse river , and the history that created the german-polish border .
but the people of both towns are already thinking in terms of one city .
essen : a changing industrial landscape essen 's moto for the european cultural capital bid is “ change through culture – culture through change ” .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.03.2005 prize-winning economist defies brain drain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : axel ockenfels knows what makes ebay tick professor axel ockenfels has been awarded the prestigious 2005 gottfried wilhelm leibniz prize .
unlike many of his peers , the pioneering economist is happy to work in germany - despite his international reputation . why do you always get out-bid on internet auctions ?
are buyer 's recommendations reliable ?
why does the price always rocket at the last minute ? if you want to understand how ebay works , then 36-year-old axel ockenfels is your man .
online bidding practices are one of his areas of expertise , and his students at the laboratory for controlled experimental economics at cologne university are finding out what it takes to get what you want in the cut-throat world of the online marketplace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " typically , what happens is , the person who wins , pays too much , " says ockenfels .
" the person who wins is n't the person who 's estimated the value of the product most precisely , but the person who 's most overestimated its value . " experimental economics ockenfels ' analysis of contemporary economic behavior has propelled him to the forefront of his field .
a protegé of reinhard selten , germany 's one and only winner of the nobel prize for economics , ockenfels ' research into experimental economics and game theory sheds light on the way modern man behaves when it comes to economic decision making - and proves that traditional economics has had its day . " the hypothesis that man is rational and egotistical is one that was n't put to the test for a long time , " explains ockenfels .
" man probably is n't as self-serving as economists would like him to be .
man himself has n't changed , but economic theories have .
new ideas and empirical evidence have been incorporated into economic theory and the concept of the ' homo oeconomicus ' is now less accepted . " the psychology of economics according to game theory , there 's a key psychological aspect to economics .
envy , rivalry and a desire for fairness all play a role . " people 's first priority is n't just getting a bargain , " insists ockenfels .
" they also keep an eye on what other people are getting and their status in their peer group . " " it 's important to understand theory , " he stresses , " but it 's also important to understand how people react .
i feel that a lot of textbooks neglect the empirical and experimental dimensions of economic behaviour and overly concentrate on theories developed in ivory towers . " leaving the ivory tower - but not germany no one can accuse axel ockenfels of living in an ivory tower .
at the age of 36 , he 's already one of the influential economic scientists in the world , hotly pursued by the world 's best universities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but unlike many of germany 's a-list scientists , he 's never been tempted to join the brain-drain crowd and head to the us to enjoy the higher salaries and first-class research opportunities available at the country 's generously funded ivy league schools .
now that he 's scooped germany 's most lucrative research prize , worth € 1.55 million -lrb- $ 2 million -rrb- , he probably feels vindicated in his decision . as far as he 's concerned , germany is where he can work best . " no other country in the world has as many experimental laboratories , " he says .
" but people wo n't have realized this until the next generation of professors has come of age .

unlike many of his peers , the pioneering economist is happy to work in germany - despite his international reputation . why do you always get out-bid on internet auctions ?
are buyer 's recommendations reliable ?
why does the price always rocket at the last minute ? if you want to understand how ebay works , then 36-year-old axel ockenfels is your man .

but his serbian counterpart could n't agree less . two weeks ago , montenegro 's prime minister milo djukanovic wrote to the serbian government outlining his hopes for the future of the two nations .
his plan foresaw serbia and montenegro ending the state union of serbia and montenegro and forming independent nations , without a union parliament but with a form of federal council . although the two states would maintain a central administration in charge of economic and political affairs , they would operate separate foreign and defence policies . premature pressure the union of serbia and montenegro was voted into existence by the yugoslav parliament in 2003 .
the eu-brokered belgrade agreement marked an end to a long-drawn out constitutional crisis and was designed to remain in place for a minimum of three years , after which the two republics were to hold referendums on whether to maintain the union arrangement or vote for independence . djukanovic has made no bones about his desire to end the union and insists his proposal does not represent any breach of the agreement , even though this is supposedly valid until 2006 .
but he 's determined to forge ahead with the referendum determining whether or not the tiny republic can attain full sovereignty . " we have made our intentions clear to both our partners both in belgrade and brussels , " he said . more differences than similarities the loose union has always been seen as a provisional solution only , with its primary task billed as foreign and defense policy , while the respective republics retained autonomy regarding economic and customs issues . montenegro has adopted the euro , while serbia is holding tightly onto the dinar .
montenegro relies heavily on tourism , while serbia 's economic mainstays are agriculture and industry - differences which make a cohesive tax and customs policy impossible . and while serbia is keen to invest in its dilapidated armed forces , montenegro wants to introduce a 4000-strong professional army . on march 3 , the mandates of all the deputies in the state union parliament expire .
but with montenegro and serbia unable to reach agreement as to how new elections should be held , the mandates are expected to be extended until a solution is found . time for brussels to intervene belgrade hopes this solution will come from brussels .
eu foreign policy chief javier solana - one of the signatories of the belgrade agreement - has invited djukanovic to brussels , which has always insisted serbia and montenegro will only ever join the eu in a joint bid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schroeder and svetozar marovic many in belgrade agree .
" i believe we will have a positive feasibility study by late march , and can then begin stabilization talks with the eu and also finally join nato , " said svetozar marovic , the montenegrin president of the union of serbia-montenegro and member of djukanovic 's democratic party of socialists -lrb- pictured with gerhard schröder -rrb- . but neither marovic nor the foreign minister of serbia-montenegro , vuk draskovic , appear able to influence the two sides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a kosovo albanian family walks under an albanian flag into a polling station to vote for kosovo 's general elections in capital pristina , on saturday , oct .

voters in the u.n.-run province of kosovo elected provincial leaders saturday in a major test for international officials ' efforts to reconcile bitterly divided ethnic communities and establish a multiethnic society .

franz-lothar altmann , balkans expert at the berlin foundation for science and politics , says a a relaxing of joint-rule between montenegro and serbia is by no means out of the question . " why should n't the union become even looser ? " he says .
" one could even go a step further and include kosovo in the equation . " altmann also points out that independence for montenegro is very much in djukanovic 's interests .
the prime minister faces a trial in italy on charges of involvement with organized crime and cigarette smuggling in the 1990s .
it was recently decided in italy that because he is not the head of a sovereign state , he does not enjoy immunity from prosecution . were this to change , djukanovic could no longer be tried in an italian court . filip slavkovic -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de killing of serbian prime minister fuels fears about country 's stability zoran djindjic , the man who made many enemies as he tried to transform the serbia of slobodan milosevic , was assassinated on wednesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.03.2005 eu probes germany 's public tv funding großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on brussels ' viewfinder : german public tv network ard european union regulators have warned germany that its funding for public television partly violates eu state aid law and urged it to set up an independent supervisory panel to ensure more transparency . european union competition commissioner neelie kroes on thursday told germany that it needed to overhaul its funding system for state-owned channels ard and zdf .
in a letter to the german government , kroes demanded more clarification on how the public networks are funded . " the commission 's preliminary view is that the current financing system is no longer in line with eu rules , " the letter read . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zdf 's star team of sports presenters the eu competition watchdogs were reacting to complaints lodged by commercial television networks in germany in 2003 that their state-funded rivals used illegal subsidies .
on thursday , kroes ' department made it clear that it considered the funding of public television in germany to amount to a sort of unlawful state subsidy which hampered free competition in several areas . apart from germany , the eu investigation has also centered on ireland and the netherlands .
on thursday , kroes dashed off similar letters to governments in dublin and amsterdam .
kroes has warned that the three eu member states needed to ensure transparency in the financing of their public television networks and make a clear distinction between their public activities and other commercial ventures such as the internet and digital tv . the commission insisted that it was n't questioning the national right of the eu 's 25 member states to set their own level of funding and public license fees as well as the objectives of their public broadcasters so long as they do not unfairly harm private sector competitors . online services under scrutiny too the eu investigation is expected to have a far-reaching effect on public broadcasters ' rights to offer online services .
among other things , germany 's commercial networks in 2003 charged that services for sale on the web sites of state-owned channels make unfair use of public money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes , eu competition commissioner kroes -lrb- photo -rrb- too is believed to have serious misgivings about the use of license fees - some € 17 -lrb- $ 22.32 -rrb- a month in germany and collected by germany 's central office for licensing fees -lrb- gez -rrb- - to fund internet services , seeing it as an illegal cross-subsidy . german public television networks ard and zdf , which were set up after the second world war to ensure pluralism after the nazi dictatorship , are now moving into sponsorship and offer a host of spin-off commercial activities on their web sites . the networks , controlled ultimately by germany 's 16 federal states , are now worried that the eu 's intervention might severely curtail their online services .
they are reported to point to these interventions as being directly contradictory to previous eu rulings upholding the right of britain 's public network bbc to go ahead with nine digital tv and radio channels or even ard 's special interest channels , phoenix and kinderkanal . while deutsche welle is part of the ard network , it is not funded by license fees but government money . ard and zdf are now said to be looking at scaling down their internet services as a precautionary measure and only provide internet content relating to their programming schedules . the bbc is also said to be worriedly watching brussels ' investigation of public networks in germany , ireland and the netherlands .

in a letter to the german government , kroes demanded more clarification on how the public networks are funded . " the commission 's preliminary view is that the current financing system is no longer in line with eu rules , " the letter read . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zdf 's star team of sports presenters the eu competition watchdogs were reacting to complaints lodged by commercial television networks in germany in 2003 that their state-funded rivals used illegal subsidies .
on thursday , kroes ' department made it clear that it considered the funding of public television in germany to amount to a sort of unlawful state subsidy which hampered free competition in several areas . apart from germany , the eu investigation has also centered on ireland and the netherlands .
on thursday , kroes dashed off similar letters to governments in dublin and amsterdam .
kroes has warned that the three eu member states needed to ensure transparency in the financing of their public television networks and make a clear distinction between their public activities and other commercial ventures such as the internet and digital tv . the commission insisted that it was n't questioning the national right of the eu 's 25 member states to set their own level of funding and public license fees as well as the objectives of their public broadcasters so long as they do not unfairly harm private sector competitors . online services under scrutiny too the eu investigation is expected to have a far-reaching effect on public broadcasters ' rights to offer online services .
among other things , germany 's commercial networks in 2003 charged that services for sale on the web sites of state-owned channels make unfair use of public money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes , eu competition commissioner kroes -lrb- photo -rrb- too is believed to have serious misgivings about the use of license fees - some € 17 -lrb- $ 22.32 -rrb- a month in germany and collected by germany 's central office for licensing fees -lrb- gez -rrb- - to fund internet services , seeing it as an illegal cross-subsidy . german public television networks ard and zdf , which were set up after the second world war to ensure pluralism after the nazi dictatorship , are now moving into sponsorship and offer a host of spin-off commercial activities on their web sites . the networks , controlled ultimately by germany 's 16 federal states , are now worried that the eu 's intervention might severely curtail their online services .
they are reported to point to these interventions as being directly contradictory to previous eu rulings upholding the right of britain 's public network bbc to go ahead with nine digital tv and radio channels or even ard 's special interest channels , phoenix and kinderkanal . while deutsche welle is part of the ard network , it is not funded by license fees but government money . ard and zdf are now said to be looking at scaling down their internet services as a precautionary measure and only provide internet content relating to their programming schedules . the bbc is also said to be worriedly watching brussels ' investigation of public networks in germany , ireland and the netherlands .

but his serbian counterpart could n't agree less . two weeks ago , montenegro 's prime minister milo djukanovic wrote to the serbian government outlining his hopes for the future of the two nations .
his plan foresaw serbia and montenegro ending the state union of serbia and montenegro and forming independent nations , without a union parliament but with a form of federal council . although the two states would maintain a central administration in charge of economic and political affairs , they would operate separate foreign and defence policies . premature pressure the union of serbia and montenegro was voted into existence by the yugoslav parliament in 2003 .
the eu-brokered belgrade agreement marked an end to a long-drawn out constitutional crisis and was designed to remain in place for a minimum of three years , after which the two republics were to hold referendums on whether to maintain the union arrangement or vote for independence . djukanovic has made no bones about his desire to end the union and insists his proposal does not represent any breach of the agreement , even though this is supposedly valid until 2006 .
but he 's determined to forge ahead with the referendum determining whether or not the tiny republic can attain full sovereignty . " we have made our intentions clear to both our partners both in belgrade and brussels , " he said . more differences than similarities the loose union has always been seen as a provisional solution only , with its primary task billed as foreign and defense policy , while the respective republics retained autonomy regarding economic and customs issues . montenegro has adopted the euro , while serbia is holding tightly onto the dinar .
montenegro relies heavily on tourism , while serbia 's economic mainstays are agriculture and industry - differences which make a cohesive tax and customs policy impossible . and while serbia is keen to invest in its dilapidated armed forces , montenegro wants to introduce a 4000-strong professional army . on march 3 , the mandates of all the deputies in the state union parliament expire .
but with montenegro and serbia unable to reach agreement as to how new elections should be held , the mandates are expected to be extended until a solution is found . time for brussels to intervene belgrade hopes this solution will come from brussels .
eu foreign policy chief javier solana - one of the signatories of the belgrade agreement - has invited djukanovic to brussels , which has always insisted serbia and montenegro will only ever join the eu in a joint bid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schroeder and svetozar marovic many in belgrade agree .
" i believe we will have a positive feasibility study by late march , and can then begin stabilization talks with the eu and also finally join nato , " said svetozar marovic , the montenegrin president of the union of serbia-montenegro and member of djukanovic 's democratic party of socialists -lrb- pictured with gerhard schröder -rrb- . but neither marovic nor the foreign minister of serbia-montenegro , vuk draskovic , appear able to influence the two sides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a kosovo albanian family walks under an albanian flag into a polling station to vote for kosovo 's general elections in capital pristina , on saturday , oct .

democrat senator joseph biden joined in , saying that the lifting of the ban would be " a non-starter with congress " after he and lugar met with president bush in the white house . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president chen shui-bian of taiwan the warning from congress follows a rebuke from taiwan 's president chen shui-bian on tuesday when he told the eu via a video link that eu plans to lift the arms embargo endangered the military balance in east asia and accused some in europe of double standards in currying favour with beijing . he added that the planned lifting of the arms ban could also let the chinese think it did not need to proceed with democratic reforms . " should the eu decide to lift its arms embargo against china it might lead to a tilt in the military balance in the taiwan strait , which would pose a clear threat to peace and stability , " he said . bush returned from his european tour smarting from his china-related encounters with european leaders , especially the one that heralded a widely reported and embarrassing no-nonsense declaration from french president jacques chirac that europe intended to lift the ban .
the end of the embargo has been penciled in for may 8 , when the eu holds a meeting with the chinese leadership . eu must prepare a case for congress the europeans are expected to make a case to congress for acceptance of their decision by arguing that the embargo was a response to tiananmen square massacre in 1989 , and that china has moved on dramatically since then .
during his visit , bush let it be known that he was " open minded " about the lifting of the ban , but told eu leaders that they would have to convince congress . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george w bush , left , poses with european union commission president jose manual barroso , following an eu summit at the european union commission headquarters in brussels , tuesday feb .

if they ca n't , the repairs made to the us-eu relationship during bush 's visit could come unravel . " europe can do defense trade with china or it can do defense trade with the us .
it ca n't do both , " daniel goure , a pentagon consultant and vice president of the lexington institute military think-tank , told the british guardian newspaper . europeans want discussion with us the europeans went into damage limitation mode soon after the statements from congress were issued . " it is not our intention that this change will increase the quantity or the quality of arms exports to china , " an eu commission spokeswoman told reporters .
" neither is it our intention to do anything to upset the military equilibrium in south-east asia .
there are concerns in america about high technology transfer .
we have made it clear that we want to talk to them about this . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us defense department has also made its feelings known regarding the situation .
the pentagon is keeping a concerned eye on an ambitious chinese military build-up which its experts believe is aimed at threatening taiwan - a country which the united sates is committed to defending . chinese build-up worrying pentagon china has allegedly boosted its military with orders of some 600 advanced russian fighter jets , mig-31s and mig-35s , and had bought modern russian destroyers and submarines .
but the pentagon is most concerned about the possible sale of advanced european communications and sensor systems , like fiber optics , infra-red , sonar and radar scanners . a recent report in the new york times has done nothing to calm us jitters , with the paper citing us intelligence pictures showing the chinese build-up and the apparent construction of 23 amphibious assault ships . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu intends to end china 's arms embargo the european union announced on tuesday that it intends to bring its 16-year arms embargo against china to an end , much to the regret of visiting us president george w. bush .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.03.2005 eu probes germany 's public tv funding großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on brussels ' viewfinder : german public tv network ard european union regulators have warned germany that its funding for public television partly violates eu state aid law and urged it to set up an independent supervisory panel to ensure more transparency . european union competition commissioner neelie kroes on thursday told germany that it needed to overhaul its funding system for state-owned channels ard and zdf .
in a letter to the german government , kroes demanded more clarification on how the public networks are funded . " the commission 's preliminary view is that the current financing system is no longer in line with eu rules , " the letter read . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zdf 's star team of sports presenters the eu competition watchdogs were reacting to complaints lodged by commercial television networks in germany in 2003 that their state-funded rivals used illegal subsidies .
on thursday , kroes ' department made it clear that it considered the funding of public television in germany to amount to a sort of unlawful state subsidy which hampered free competition in several areas . apart from germany , the eu investigation has also centered on ireland and the netherlands .
on thursday , kroes dashed off similar letters to governments in dublin and amsterdam .
kroes has warned that the three eu member states needed to ensure transparency in the financing of their public television networks and make a clear distinction between their public activities and other commercial ventures such as the internet and digital tv . the commission insisted that it was n't questioning the national right of the eu 's 25 member states to set their own level of funding and public license fees as well as the objectives of their public broadcasters so long as they do not unfairly harm private sector competitors . online services under scrutiny too the eu investigation is expected to have a far-reaching effect on public broadcasters ' rights to offer online services .
among other things , germany 's commercial networks in 2003 charged that services for sale on the web sites of state-owned channels make unfair use of public money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes , eu competition commissioner kroes -lrb- photo -rrb- too is believed to have serious misgivings about the use of license fees - some € 17 -lrb- $ 22.32 -rrb- a month in germany and collected by germany 's central office for licensing fees -lrb- gez -rrb- - to fund internet services , seeing it as an illegal cross-subsidy . german public television networks ard and zdf , which were set up after the second world war to ensure pluralism after the nazi dictatorship , are now moving into sponsorship and offer a host of spin-off commercial activities on their web sites . the networks , controlled ultimately by germany 's 16 federal states , are now worried that the eu 's intervention might severely curtail their online services .
they are reported to point to these interventions as being directly contradictory to previous eu rulings upholding the right of britain 's public network bbc to go ahead with nine digital tv and radio channels or even ard 's special interest channels , phoenix and kinderkanal . while deutsche welle is part of the ard network , it is not funded by license fees but government money . ard and zdf are now said to be looking at scaling down their internet services as a precautionary measure and only provide internet content relating to their programming schedules . the bbc is also said to be worriedly watching brussels ' investigation of public networks in germany , ireland and the netherlands .
top bbc executives are reportedly in talks with their counterparts at the german broadcasters as well as eu officials over what the case might mean for them . brussels wants independent monitor kroes on thursday also demanded the setting up of an independent national authority that would monitor the upholding of transparency in the funding of public broadcasters .
she pointed out that eu members france , italy , spain and portugal had already bowed to similar eu demands in the past . germany , ireland and the netherlands will now have about four weeks to react to brussels ' letter .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.03.2005 joint-rule in serbia-montenegro in jeopardy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toasting independence : djukanovic after his 2001 election victory with parliamentary mandates now expired , montenegro 's prime minister is calling for an end to the serbia-montenegro union .
but his serbian counterpart could n't agree less . two weeks ago , montenegro 's prime minister milo djukanovic wrote to the serbian government outlining his hopes for the future of the two nations .
his plan foresaw serbia and montenegro ending the state union of serbia and montenegro and forming independent nations , without a union parliament but with a form of federal council . although the two states would maintain a central administration in charge of economic and political affairs , they would operate separate foreign and defence policies . premature pressure the union of serbia and montenegro was voted into existence by the yugoslav parliament in 2003 .
the eu-brokered belgrade agreement marked an end to a long-drawn out constitutional crisis and was designed to remain in place for a minimum of three years , after which the two republics were to hold referendums on whether to maintain the union arrangement or vote for independence . djukanovic has made no bones about his desire to end the union and insists his proposal does not represent any breach of the agreement , even though this is supposedly valid until 2006 .
but he 's determined to forge ahead with the referendum determining whether or not the tiny republic can attain full sovereignty . " we have made our intentions clear to both our partners both in belgrade and brussels , " he said . more differences than similarities the loose union has always been seen as a provisional solution only , with its primary task billed as foreign and defense policy , while the respective republics retained autonomy regarding economic and customs issues . montenegro has adopted the euro , while serbia is holding tightly onto the dinar .
montenegro relies heavily on tourism , while serbia 's economic mainstays are agriculture and industry - differences which make a cohesive tax and customs policy impossible . and while serbia is keen to invest in its dilapidated armed forces , montenegro wants to introduce a 4000-strong professional army . on march 3 , the mandates of all the deputies in the state union parliament expire .
but with montenegro and serbia unable to reach agreement as to how new elections should be held , the mandates are expected to be extended until a solution is found . time for brussels to intervene belgrade hopes this solution will come from brussels .
eu foreign policy chief javier solana - one of the signatories of the belgrade agreement - has invited djukanovic to brussels , which has always insisted serbia and montenegro will only ever join the eu in a joint bid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schroeder and svetozar marovic many in belgrade agree .
" i believe we will have a positive feasibility study by late march , and can then begin stabilization talks with the eu and also finally join nato , " said svetozar marovic , the montenegrin president of the union of serbia-montenegro and member of djukanovic 's democratic party of socialists -lrb- pictured with gerhard schröder -rrb- . but neither marovic nor the foreign minister of serbia-montenegro , vuk draskovic , appear able to influence the two sides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a kosovo albanian family walks under an albanian flag into a polling station to vote for kosovo 's general elections in capital pristina , on saturday , oct .

in a letter to the german government , kroes demanded more clarification on how the public networks are funded . " the commission 's preliminary view is that the current financing system is no longer in line with eu rules , " the letter read . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zdf 's star team of sports presenters the eu competition watchdogs were reacting to complaints lodged by commercial television networks in germany in 2003 that their state-funded rivals used illegal subsidies .
on thursday , kroes ' department made it clear that it considered the funding of public television in germany to amount to a sort of unlawful state subsidy which hampered free competition in several areas . apart from germany , the eu investigation has also centered on ireland and the netherlands .
on thursday , kroes dashed off similar letters to governments in dublin and amsterdam .
kroes has warned that the three eu member states needed to ensure transparency in the financing of their public television networks and make a clear distinction between their public activities and other commercial ventures such as the internet and digital tv . the commission insisted that it was n't questioning the national right of the eu 's 25 member states to set their own level of funding and public license fees as well as the objectives of their public broadcasters so long as they do not unfairly harm private sector competitors . online services under scrutiny too the eu investigation is expected to have a far-reaching effect on public broadcasters ' rights to offer online services .
among other things , germany 's commercial networks in 2003 charged that services for sale on the web sites of state-owned channels make unfair use of public money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes , eu competition commissioner kroes -lrb- photo -rrb- too is believed to have serious misgivings about the use of license fees - some € 17 -lrb- $ 22.32 -rrb- a month in germany and collected by germany 's central office for licensing fees -lrb- gez -rrb- - to fund internet services , seeing it as an illegal cross-subsidy . german public television networks ard and zdf , which were set up after the second world war to ensure pluralism after the nazi dictatorship , are now moving into sponsorship and offer a host of spin-off commercial activities on their web sites . the networks , controlled ultimately by germany 's 16 federal states , are now worried that the eu 's intervention might severely curtail their online services .
they are reported to point to these interventions as being directly contradictory to previous eu rulings upholding the right of britain 's public network bbc to go ahead with nine digital tv and radio channels or even ard 's special interest channels , phoenix and kinderkanal . while deutsche welle is part of the ard network , it is not funded by license fees but government money . ard and zdf are now said to be looking at scaling down their internet services as a precautionary measure and only provide internet content relating to their programming schedules . the bbc is also said to be worriedly watching brussels ' investigation of public networks in germany , ireland and the netherlands .
top bbc executives are reportedly in talks with their counterparts at the german broadcasters as well as eu officials over what the case might mean for them . brussels wants independent monitor kroes on thursday also demanded the setting up of an independent national authority that would monitor the upholding of transparency in the funding of public broadcasters .
she pointed out that eu members france , italy , spain and portugal had already bowed to similar eu demands in the past . germany , ireland and the netherlands will now have about four weeks to react to brussels ' letter .
kroes has already announced that brussels will drop the investigation if the three countries take the necessary steps to get their funding of public networks in order . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de media davids vs. goliath with government funding and hefty advertising revenues , public broadcasters in germany and europe have astronomically high budgets for buying olympic rights .

unlike many of his peers , the pioneering economist is happy to work in germany - despite his international reputation . why do you always get out-bid on internet auctions ?
are buyer 's recommendations reliable ?
why does the price always rocket at the last minute ? if you want to understand how ebay works , then 36-year-old axel ockenfels is your man .
online bidding practices are one of his areas of expertise , and his students at the laboratory for controlled experimental economics at cologne university are finding out what it takes to get what you want in the cut-throat world of the online marketplace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " typically , what happens is , the person who wins , pays too much , " says ockenfels .
" the person who wins is n't the person who 's estimated the value of the product most precisely , but the person who 's most overestimated its value . " experimental economics ockenfels ' analysis of contemporary economic behavior has propelled him to the forefront of his field .
a protegé of reinhard selten , germany 's one and only winner of the nobel prize for economics , ockenfels ' research into experimental economics and game theory sheds light on the way modern man behaves when it comes to economic decision making - and proves that traditional economics has had its day . " the hypothesis that man is rational and egotistical is one that was n't put to the test for a long time , " explains ockenfels .
" man probably is n't as self-serving as economists would like him to be .
man himself has n't changed , but economic theories have .
new ideas and empirical evidence have been incorporated into economic theory and the concept of the ' homo oeconomicus ' is now less accepted . " the psychology of economics according to game theory , there 's a key psychological aspect to economics .
envy , rivalry and a desire for fairness all play a role . " people 's first priority is n't just getting a bargain , " insists ockenfels .
" they also keep an eye on what other people are getting and their status in their peer group . " " it 's important to understand theory , " he stresses , " but it 's also important to understand how people react .
i feel that a lot of textbooks neglect the empirical and experimental dimensions of economic behaviour and overly concentrate on theories developed in ivory towers . " leaving the ivory tower - but not germany no one can accuse axel ockenfels of living in an ivory tower .
at the age of 36 , he 's already one of the influential economic scientists in the world , hotly pursued by the world 's best universities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but unlike many of germany 's a-list scientists , he 's never been tempted to join the brain-drain crowd and head to the us to enjoy the higher salaries and first-class research opportunities available at the country 's generously funded ivy league schools .
now that he 's scooped germany 's most lucrative research prize , worth € 1.55 million -lrb- $ 2 million -rrb- , he probably feels vindicated in his decision . as far as he 's concerned , germany is where he can work best . " no other country in the world has as many experimental laboratories , " he says .

in a letter to the german government , kroes demanded more clarification on how the public networks are funded . " the commission 's preliminary view is that the current financing system is no longer in line with eu rules , " the letter read . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zdf 's star team of sports presenters the eu competition watchdogs were reacting to complaints lodged by commercial television networks in germany in 2003 that their state-funded rivals used illegal subsidies .
on thursday , kroes ' department made it clear that it considered the funding of public television in germany to amount to a sort of unlawful state subsidy which hampered free competition in several areas . apart from germany , the eu investigation has also centered on ireland and the netherlands .
on thursday , kroes dashed off similar letters to governments in dublin and amsterdam .
kroes has warned that the three eu member states needed to ensure transparency in the financing of their public television networks and make a clear distinction between their public activities and other commercial ventures such as the internet and digital tv . the commission insisted that it was n't questioning the national right of the eu 's 25 member states to set their own level of funding and public license fees as well as the objectives of their public broadcasters so long as they do not unfairly harm private sector competitors . online services under scrutiny too the eu investigation is expected to have a far-reaching effect on public broadcasters ' rights to offer online services .
among other things , germany 's commercial networks in 2003 charged that services for sale on the web sites of state-owned channels make unfair use of public money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes , eu competition commissioner kroes -lrb- photo -rrb- too is believed to have serious misgivings about the use of license fees - some € 17 -lrb- $ 22.32 -rrb- a month in germany and collected by germany 's central office for licensing fees -lrb- gez -rrb- - to fund internet services , seeing it as an illegal cross-subsidy . german public television networks ard and zdf , which were set up after the second world war to ensure pluralism after the nazi dictatorship , are now moving into sponsorship and offer a host of spin-off commercial activities on their web sites . the networks , controlled ultimately by germany 's 16 federal states , are now worried that the eu 's intervention might severely curtail their online services .
they are reported to point to these interventions as being directly contradictory to previous eu rulings upholding the right of britain 's public network bbc to go ahead with nine digital tv and radio channels or even ard 's special interest channels , phoenix and kinderkanal . while deutsche welle is part of the ard network , it is not funded by license fees but government money . ard and zdf are now said to be looking at scaling down their internet services as a precautionary measure and only provide internet content relating to their programming schedules . the bbc is also said to be worriedly watching brussels ' investigation of public networks in germany , ireland and the netherlands .
top bbc executives are reportedly in talks with their counterparts at the german broadcasters as well as eu officials over what the case might mean for them . brussels wants independent monitor kroes on thursday also demanded the setting up of an independent national authority that would monitor the upholding of transparency in the funding of public broadcasters .
she pointed out that eu members france , italy , spain and portugal had already bowed to similar eu demands in the past . germany , ireland and the netherlands will now have about four weeks to react to brussels ' letter .
kroes has already announced that brussels will drop the investigation if the three countries take the necessary steps to get their funding of public networks in order . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de media davids vs. goliath with government funding and hefty advertising revenues , public broadcasters in germany and europe have astronomically high budgets for buying olympic rights .

the iaea had reported key areas where iran was refusing to cooperate with un inspectors . " while transparency visits have taken place , iran seems to have been determined to limit their scope , " said british ambassador robin wright , reading from the joint statement . the europeans still took a more conciliatory tone than the americans .
they noted that iran 's decision to suspend uranium enrichment - which can be used for either nuclear energy or to make atomic weapons - was " a voluntary commitment " and urged tehran to keep its word . the us maintains that iran 's nuclear activities are designed for a clandestine weapons program .
the head of the us delegation to the iaea board , jackie sanders , cited " an alarming number " of unresolved questions and warned that the iaea could not put off " forever " taking tehran before the un security council for possible sanctions . refusal of inspections causes friction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like the us , the europeans criticized iran for refusing to allow un inspectors to visit its military site in parchin , a site where there are definitely nuclear materials , where washington accuses tehran of simulating testing of nuclear weapons . the iranian delegate to the iaea , cyrus nasseri , said iran was not allowing a second visit to parchin , after a first one in january , in part because it was concerned about information leaks " in view of potential threats of military strikes against iran 's safeguarded and other facilities " by what he called " a major nuclear weapons state " in a clear reference to the united states . but iaea director-general mohamed el baradei said that iran was a " special case " since its nuclear program " has been clandestine for almost two decades " and he asked tehran to allow widespread visits by un inspectors .
the europeans endorsed el baradei 's call for iran to come clean " in order to make up for the confidence deficit created by past activities and to build the necessary confidence in the future , " the european statement said . us president george w. bush has said washington is seeking a diplomatic solution in iran and supports eu talks with tehran .
but bush has said all options , including the military one , remain on the table . bush considers dangling the carrot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , it appears that the president is increasingly aligning himself with european efforts and is considering offering incentives to iran , according to us officials on thursday .
in a preparatory statement ahead of an expected announcement of the us strategy later this week , the united states said it would not block iran as it seeks to start the process of joining the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , and would not stand in the way of european allies if they want to sell tehran parts for civilian aircraft . white house spokesman scott mcclellan said the president had not finalized his decision but said that the united states and europe were discussing " how we can move forward together on a common strategy to get iran to abandon any ambitions for a nuclear weapon . " " we want to do our part to support the european efforts .
this is about strengthening their diplomatic approach to resolving this matter , " he added . in return for supporting incentives , it is likely that the americans would insist that iran abandon uranium enrichment , the major sticking point in the on-going negotiations .

however , negotiations on iran 's membership could be strung out indefinitely by the us , binding the iranians to years of concessions over its nuclear program . if the iranians see through this and refuse to accept the incentives , maintaining their efforts to enrich uranium , then the us would resort to its original course of action which would be to take iran to the un security council for possible sanctions . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran signs russian nuclear deal iran and russia on sunday signed a landmark nuclear fuel accord that paves the way for the islamic republic 's first atomic power station , a project the united states alleges is part of a cover for weapons development .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.03.2005 an end to superstar fischer ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer 's popularity has suffered recently foreign minister joschka fischer has long been one of germany 's most popular politicians .
but a scandal involving the abuse of tourist visas has dented his reputation and is threatening to unravel his political future . last weekend , fischer gave a speech that was likely one of the most difficult of his lengthy political career .
in an address to members of his greens party at a regional congress , he had to admit he had made mistakes in handling a widening affair in which foreign criminals made use of relaxed visa requirements – approved by fischer – to smuggle people into germany . while he rejected demands by the conservative opposition to resign , the fact that fischer felt compelled to devote his speech to the visa scandal shows just how much the matter has the experienced political operator on the defensive . " fischer certainly underestimated the situation , " dr. jürgen falter , director of the domestic politics program at the university of mainz , told dw-world .
" at the moment it does n't look like it will push him from office , but we 'll have to wait and see if more serious revelations come to light . " opposition politicians claim thousands of illegal immigrants – including many from ukraine and china – were able to enter germany between 2000 and 2003 after tourist visa criteria were relaxed .
they say that led to an increase in organized crime , drugs and prostitution on fischer 's watch . admirers and enemies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer looks on during the greens party congress in rostock , eastern germany , on saturday , nov .
24 , 2001 .
known as someone who does n't suffer fools gladly , fischer has as many enemies as he does admirers in parliament , the press , and even in his own party .
over the years , he has developed a reputation as being aloof and arrogant to journalists and his colleagues .
perhaps worse , he has the nasty habit of unnecessarily humiliating those working for him at the foreign ministry .
it appears as if fischer is now reaping what he 's sown as those who feel slighted by the minister look for some payback . " he always thought he was almost invulnerable and could survive anything , which was the case up till now , " fischer 's biographer bernd ulrich said in a recent radio interview with deutschlandfunk .
" that 's why he 's approached this matter with a certain amount of arrogance . " yet despite his prickly public persona , fischer has consistently ranked as one of germany 's most popular politicians .
born in 1948 as the humble son of butcher in stuttgart , fischer has one of the most unconventional backgrounds of the country 's political elite .
having left school in 10th grade , he made a living in the 1970s as a taxi driver before helping set up the greens and leading the upstart party into parliament in the 1980s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer said he recognized himself on this picture of being beaten by the police in 1968 .
other photos showed fischer beating a police officer .
while he lived in frankfurt , he also became involved in the leftwing student protests of 1968 .
during that turbulent time he was involved in violent street fighting with the police .
pictures of him made public in 2001 in a black motorcycle helmet kicking a police officer during a protest led conservatives to call for his head . authentic and quirky but german chancellor gerhard schröder stuck by him back then and the public chalked up the affair as a youthful indiscretion on fischer 's part .
and for many germans , it was simply more proof of his " authenticity " that has made him both the greens ' elder statesman and a quirky public figure that could do little wrong . " he has a personality bonus , " explained richard hilmer from the public polling organization infratest / dimap .
" he 's considered a different kind of politician .
his moving background is considered convincing and authentic . " but the visa affair has battered fischer 's reputation in the eyes of many .
for the first time in three years , fischer last week lost his status as germany 's most popular politician in a regular poll by public broadcaster zdf . " he 's smacked quite a few people around and that has come back to haunt him .
there appears to be quite a bit of schadenfreude over his predicament , " dr. falter said , adding he expected fischer to survive the current scandal largely intact .
" if he makes it through this he 'll be know as the teflon minister .
nothing will stick to him . " schröder 's backing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka and gerd .
as in 2001 , schröder has once again demonstratively backed his foreign minister , saying there was no question that fischer will stay in office .
the chancellor has also expressed his desire to stand for reelection in 2006 with fischer at his side . fischer biographer ulrich even said the governing center-left coalition of social democrats and greens could possible survive with another chancellor than schröder , but that the foreign minister was indispensable . " he 's too important for the stability of the coalition , " he said , adding that because of the visa affair fischer had also become a liability .
" he wo n't fall but he 'll definitely slide a bit .
and when he sinks , he 'll pull the red-green coalition down a bit further .

the iaea had reported key areas where iran was refusing to cooperate with un inspectors .

but a scandal involving the abuse of tourist visas has dented his reputation and is threatening to unravel his political future . last weekend , fischer gave a speech that was likely one of the most difficult of his lengthy political career .
in an address to members of his greens party at a regional congress , he had to admit he had made mistakes in handling a widening affair in which foreign criminals made use of relaxed visa requirements – approved by fischer – to smuggle people into germany . while he rejected demands by the conservative opposition to resign , the fact that fischer felt compelled to devote his speech to the visa scandal shows just how much the matter has the experienced political operator on the defensive . " fischer certainly underestimated the situation , " dr. jürgen falter , director of the domestic politics program at the university of mainz , told dw-world .
" at the moment it does n't look like it will push him from office , but we 'll have to wait and see if more serious revelations come to light . " opposition politicians claim thousands of illegal immigrants – including many from ukraine and china – were able to enter germany between 2000 and 2003 after tourist visa criteria were relaxed .
they say that led to an increase in organized crime , drugs and prostitution on fischer 's watch . admirers and enemies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer looks on during the greens party congress in rostock , eastern germany , on saturday , nov .
24 , 2001 .
known as someone who does n't suffer fools gladly , fischer has as many enemies as he does admirers in parliament , the press , and even in his own party .
over the years , he has developed a reputation as being aloof and arrogant to journalists and his colleagues .
perhaps worse , he has the nasty habit of unnecessarily humiliating those working for him at the foreign ministry .
it appears as if fischer is now reaping what he 's sown as those who feel slighted by the minister look for some payback . " he always thought he was almost invulnerable and could survive anything , which was the case up till now , " fischer 's biographer bernd ulrich said in a recent radio interview with deutschlandfunk .
" that 's why he 's approached this matter with a certain amount of arrogance . " yet despite his prickly public persona , fischer has consistently ranked as one of germany 's most popular politicians .
born in 1948 as the humble son of butcher in stuttgart , fischer has one of the most unconventional backgrounds of the country 's political elite .
having left school in 10th grade , he made a living in the 1970s as a taxi driver before helping set up the greens and leading the upstart party into parliament in the 1980s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer said he recognized himself on this picture of being beaten by the police in 1968 .
other photos showed fischer beating a police officer .
while he lived in frankfurt , he also became involved in the leftwing student protests of 1968 .
during that turbulent time he was involved in violent street fighting with the police .
pictures of him made public in 2001 in a black motorcycle helmet kicking a police officer during a protest led conservatives to call for his head . authentic and quirky but german chancellor gerhard schröder stuck by him back then and the public chalked up the affair as a youthful indiscretion on fischer 's part .
and for many germans , it was simply more proof of his " authenticity " that has made him both the greens ' elder statesman and a quirky public figure that could do little wrong . " he has a personality bonus , " explained richard hilmer from the public polling organization infratest / dimap .
" he 's considered a different kind of politician .
his moving background is considered convincing and authentic . " but the visa affair has battered fischer 's reputation in the eyes of many .
for the first time in three years , fischer last week lost his status as germany 's most popular politician in a regular poll by public broadcaster zdf . " he 's smacked quite a few people around and that has come back to haunt him .
there appears to be quite a bit of schadenfreude over his predicament , " dr. falter said , adding he expected fischer to survive the current scandal largely intact .
" if he makes it through this he 'll be know as the teflon minister .
nothing will stick to him . " schröder 's backing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka and gerd .
as in 2001 , schröder has once again demonstratively backed his foreign minister , saying there was no question that fischer will stay in office .
the chancellor has also expressed his desire to stand for reelection in 2006 with fischer at his side . fischer biographer ulrich even said the governing center-left coalition of social democrats and greens could possible survive with another chancellor than schröder , but that the foreign minister was indispensable . " he 's too important for the stability of the coalition , " he said , adding that because of the visa affair fischer had also become a liability .

but a scandal involving the abuse of tourist visas has dented his reputation and is threatening to unravel his political future . last weekend , fischer gave a speech that was likely one of the most difficult of his lengthy political career .
in an address to members of his greens party at a regional congress , he had to admit he had made mistakes in handling a widening affair in which foreign criminals made use of relaxed visa requirements – approved by fischer – to smuggle people into germany . while he rejected demands by the conservative opposition to resign , the fact that fischer felt compelled to devote his speech to the visa scandal shows just how much the matter has the experienced political operator on the defensive . " fischer certainly underestimated the situation , " dr. jürgen falter , director of the domestic politics program at the university of mainz , told dw-world .
" at the moment it does n't look like it will push him from office , but we 'll have to wait and see if more serious revelations come to light . " opposition politicians claim thousands of illegal immigrants – including many from ukraine and china – were able to enter germany between 2000 and 2003 after tourist visa criteria were relaxed .
they say that led to an increase in organized crime , drugs and prostitution on fischer 's watch . admirers and enemies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer looks on during the greens party congress in rostock , eastern germany , on saturday , nov .
24 , 2001 .
known as someone who does n't suffer fools gladly , fischer has as many enemies as he does admirers in parliament , the press , and even in his own party .
over the years , he has developed a reputation as being aloof and arrogant to journalists and his colleagues .
perhaps worse , he has the nasty habit of unnecessarily humiliating those working for him at the foreign ministry .
it appears as if fischer is now reaping what he 's sown as those who feel slighted by the minister look for some payback . " he always thought he was almost invulnerable and could survive anything , which was the case up till now , " fischer 's biographer bernd ulrich said in a recent radio interview with deutschlandfunk .
" that 's why he 's approached this matter with a certain amount of arrogance . " yet despite his prickly public persona , fischer has consistently ranked as one of germany 's most popular politicians .

the iaea had reported key areas where iran was refusing to cooperate with un inspectors . " while transparency visits have taken place , iran seems to have been determined to limit their scope , " said british ambassador robin wright , reading from the joint statement . the europeans still took a more conciliatory tone than the americans .
they noted that iran 's decision to suspend uranium enrichment - which can be used for either nuclear energy or to make atomic weapons - was " a voluntary commitment " and urged tehran to keep its word . the us maintains that iran 's nuclear activities are designed for a clandestine weapons program .
the head of the us delegation to the iaea board , jackie sanders , cited " an alarming number " of unresolved questions and warned that the iaea could not put off " forever " taking tehran before the un security council for possible sanctions . refusal of inspections causes friction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like the us , the europeans criticized iran for refusing to allow un inspectors to visit its military site in parchin , a site where there are definitely nuclear materials , where washington accuses tehran of simulating testing of nuclear weapons . the iranian delegate to the iaea , cyrus nasseri , said iran was not allowing a second visit to parchin , after a first one in january , in part because it was concerned about information leaks " in view of potential threats of military strikes against iran 's safeguarded and other facilities " by what he called " a major nuclear weapons state " in a clear reference to the united states . but iaea director-general mohamed el baradei said that iran was a " special case " since its nuclear program " has been clandestine for almost two decades " and he asked tehran to allow widespread visits by un inspectors .
the europeans endorsed el baradei 's call for iran to come clean " in order to make up for the confidence deficit created by past activities and to build the necessary confidence in the future , " the european statement said . us president george w. bush has said washington is seeking a diplomatic solution in iran and supports eu talks with tehran .

" " we want to do our part to support the european efforts .
this is about strengthening their diplomatic approach to resolving this matter , " he added . in return for supporting incentives , it is likely that the americans would insist that iran abandon uranium enrichment , the major sticking point in the on-going negotiations .
but while it appears that the us has shifted considerable ground , the reality is a little different .

however , negotiations on iran 's membership could be strung out indefinitely by the us , binding the iranians to years of concessions over its nuclear program . if the iranians see through this and refuse to accept the incentives , maintaining their efforts to enrich uranium , then the us would resort to its original course of action which would be to take iran to the un security council for possible sanctions . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran signs russian nuclear deal iran and russia on sunday signed a landmark nuclear fuel accord that paves the way for the islamic republic 's first atomic power station , a project the united states alleges is part of a cover for weapons development .

" in coma and looking for work germany 2004 : the road to reform germany -pipe- 03.03.2005 schröder accepts opposition offer of help großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition wants berlin to adopt their ten-point program as unemployment in germany reaches new heights , chancellor schröder says he 's willing to discuss new reforms with the conservative opposition so long as their motive is more than electioneering . angela merkel , leader of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , and edmund stoiber , leader of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- have written to schröder proposing their parties join forces to develop immediate strategies to combat joblessness . " continuing with business as usual is not an option , " they said , urging the government to accept their " ten-point plan for germany . " in yemen , schröder responded positively to their offer , but rejected aspects of their proposals including the relaxing of laws protecting german employees from dismissal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder " anyone who thinks dismissal protection law is the main obstacle to new appointments shows they have little understanding of the real problem , " he said . he also insisted their help should be unconditional .
" if their willingness to talk comes with certain conditions , they are laying themselves open to accusations of playing games that the people of this country do not need given their problems , " the chancellor said . election campaign tied to reducing joblessness after their disappointing results in the northern state of schleswig holstein in february , schröder 's social democrats are pinning their hopes on the may poll in north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state and a traditional spd stronghold . the result is expected to indicate the outcome of the 2006 general election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but data published tuesday shows that unemployment in the state has topped the 1 million mark , excacerbating public anger at the government 's failure to trigger job growth . " we say to our friends in berlin , you have to persevere and create more impulse for growth despite the difficult budgetary situation , " harald schartau , the spd leader in north rhine-westphalia said on german television . nationwide , 5.22 million people are looking for work - a rise of 177,000 over january , and more than half a million above the figure at the same time last year , according to figures released by the federal labor agency pressure on berlin to unveil new job creation schemes is mounting . with nearly 13 percent of the workforce currently unemployed , germany is seeing its highest jobless rate since the 1930s . " the figures can be explained " chancellor gerhard schröder , currently on a tour of seven gulf states , took time out in quatar on wednesday to comment on the latest figures . " there 's no doubt that the unemployment figures are depressing , " he said .
" but we ca n't allow ourselves to be forced on the defensive .
the figures can be explained .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.03.2005 an end to superstar fischer ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer 's popularity has suffered recently foreign minister joschka fischer has long been one of germany 's most popular politicians .
but a scandal involving the abuse of tourist visas has dented his reputation and is threatening to unravel his political future . last weekend , fischer gave a speech that was likely one of the most difficult of his lengthy political career .
in an address to members of his greens party at a regional congress , he had to admit he had made mistakes in handling a widening affair in which foreign criminals made use of relaxed visa requirements – approved by fischer – to smuggle people into germany . while he rejected demands by the conservative opposition to resign , the fact that fischer felt compelled to devote his speech to the visa scandal shows just how much the matter has the experienced political operator on the defensive . " fischer certainly underestimated the situation , " dr. jürgen falter , director of the domestic politics program at the university of mainz , told dw-world .
" at the moment it does n't look like it will push him from office , but we 'll have to wait and see if more serious revelations come to light . " opposition politicians claim thousands of illegal immigrants – including many from ukraine and china – were able to enter germany between 2000 and 2003 after tourist visa criteria were relaxed .
they say that led to an increase in organized crime , drugs and prostitution on fischer 's watch . admirers and enemies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer looks on during the greens party congress in rostock , eastern germany , on saturday , nov .
24 , 2001 .
known as someone who does n't suffer fools gladly , fischer has as many enemies as he does admirers in parliament , the press , and even in his own party .
over the years , he has developed a reputation as being aloof and arrogant to journalists and his colleagues .
perhaps worse , he has the nasty habit of unnecessarily humiliating those working for him at the foreign ministry .
it appears as if fischer is now reaping what he 's sown as those who feel slighted by the minister look for some payback . " he always thought he was almost invulnerable and could survive anything , which was the case up till now , " fischer 's biographer bernd ulrich said in a recent radio interview with deutschlandfunk .
" that 's why he 's approached this matter with a certain amount of arrogance . " yet despite his prickly public persona , fischer has consistently ranked as one of germany 's most popular politicians .
born in 1948 as the humble son of butcher in stuttgart , fischer has one of the most unconventional backgrounds of the country 's political elite .
having left school in 10th grade , he made a living in the 1970s as a taxi driver before helping set up the greens and leading the upstart party into parliament in the 1980s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer said he recognized himself on this picture of being beaten by the police in 1968 .
other photos showed fischer beating a police officer .
while he lived in frankfurt , he also became involved in the leftwing student protests of 1968 .
during that turbulent time he was involved in violent street fighting with the police .
pictures of him made public in 2001 in a black motorcycle helmet kicking a police officer during a protest led conservatives to call for his head . authentic and quirky but german chancellor gerhard schröder stuck by him back then and the public chalked up the affair as a youthful indiscretion on fischer 's part .
and for many germans , it was simply more proof of his " authenticity " that has made him both the greens ' elder statesman and a quirky public figure that could do little wrong . " he has a personality bonus , " explained richard hilmer from the public polling organization infratest / dimap .
" he 's considered a different kind of politician .
his moving background is considered convincing and authentic . " but the visa affair has battered fischer 's reputation in the eyes of many .
for the first time in three years , fischer last week lost his status as germany 's most popular politician in a regular poll by public broadcaster zdf . " he 's smacked quite a few people around and that has come back to haunt him .
there appears to be quite a bit of schadenfreude over his predicament , " dr. falter said , adding he expected fischer to survive the current scandal largely intact .
" if he makes it through this he 'll be know as the teflon minister .
nothing will stick to him . " schröder 's backing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka and gerd .
as in 2001 , schröder has once again demonstratively backed his foreign minister , saying there was no question that fischer will stay in office .
the chancellor has also expressed his desire to stand for reelection in 2006 with fischer at his side . fischer biographer ulrich even said the governing center-left coalition of social democrats and greens could possible survive with another chancellor than schröder , but that the foreign minister was indispensable . " he 's too important for the stability of the coalition , " he said , adding that because of the visa affair fischer had also become a liability .
" he wo n't fall but he 'll definitely slide a bit .
and when he sinks , he 'll pull the red-green coalition down a bit further .

but many cases remain unsolved and bitter feuds prevent other paintings being returned . a cultural legacy left over from the third reich which german museums continue to face is the return of stolen art .
since 1998 when a conference in washington heralded the beginning of a concerted effort by germany and 43 other countries to find and return artworks stolen by the nazis during world war ii , museums across the country have experienced the headaches attached to this quest . one on-going saga involving three paintings seized by the nazis between 1937 and 1939 was resolved this week when they were returned to their original jewish owners after a long legal wrangle , a local official said on wednesday . a spokeswoman for city authorities in wuppertal , western germany , said the handover , which should have happened more than a year ago but was held up by a legal technicality , would go ahead " as soon as possible , once the conditions for their return are set in a contract . " the process of handing back the three paintings , which are currently on display in the city 's heydt museum , had previously been delayed by doubts about who the real owners were . the work " felsige flusslandschaft , " by frankfurt artist otto scholderer , was bought by the museum in 1939 after its forced sale a year earlier .
" erinnerung vom dampfboot auf der donau , " by adolph menzel , was given as a gift to the heydt in 1956 . the owners of hans von marees ' " tatar mit pferd , " forced into sale in 1937 , fled germany for the netherlands where they were caught and killed in a concentration camp in 1944 .

returning stolen art to the rightful owners 60 years after it was first taken is an awkward affair .

but many cases remain unsolved and bitter feuds prevent other paintings being returned . a cultural legacy left over from the third reich which german museums continue to face is the return of stolen art .
since 1998 when a conference in washington heralded the beginning of a concerted effort by germany and 43 other countries to find and return artworks stolen by the nazis during world war ii , museums across the country have experienced the headaches attached to this quest . one on-going saga involving three paintings seized by the nazis between 1937 and 1939 was resolved this week when they were returned to their original jewish owners after a long legal wrangle , a local official said on wednesday . a spokeswoman for city authorities in wuppertal , western germany , said the handover , which should have happened more than a year ago but was held up by a legal technicality , would go ahead " as soon as possible , once the conditions for their return are set in a contract . " the process of handing back the three paintings , which are currently on display in the city 's heydt museum , had previously been delayed by doubts about who the real owners were . the work " felsige flusslandschaft , " by frankfurt artist otto scholderer , was bought by the museum in 1939 after its forced sale a year earlier .
" erinnerung vom dampfboot auf der donau , " by adolph menzel , was given as a gift to the heydt in 1956 . the owners of hans von marees ' " tatar mit pferd , " forced into sale in 1937 , fled germany for the netherlands where they were caught and killed in a concentration camp in 1944 .
the painting was bought by the museum in 1948 and is expected to be given to the grandchildren of its deceased owners . complications the rule , not exception bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : such complications are not unusual .

" in coma and looking for work germany 2004 : the road to reform germany -pipe- 03.03.2005 schröder accepts opposition offer of help großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition wants berlin to adopt their ten-point program as unemployment in germany reaches new heights , chancellor schröder says he 's willing to discuss new reforms with the conservative opposition so long as their motive is more than electioneering . angela merkel , leader of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , and edmund stoiber , leader of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- have written to schröder proposing their parties join forces to develop immediate strategies to combat joblessness . " continuing with business as usual is not an option , " they said , urging the government to accept their " ten-point plan for germany . " in yemen , schröder responded positively to their offer , but rejected aspects of their proposals including the relaxing of laws protecting german employees from dismissal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder " anyone who thinks dismissal protection law is the main obstacle to new appointments shows they have little understanding of the real problem , " he said . he also insisted their help should be unconditional .
" if their willingness to talk comes with certain conditions , they are laying themselves open to accusations of playing games that the people of this country do not need given their problems , " the chancellor said . election campaign tied to reducing joblessness after their disappointing results in the northern state of schleswig holstein in february , schröder 's social democrats are pinning their hopes on the may poll in north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state and a traditional spd stronghold . the result is expected to indicate the outcome of the 2006 general election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but data published tuesday shows that unemployment in the state has topped the 1 million mark , excacerbating public anger at the government 's failure to trigger job growth . " we say to our friends in berlin , you have to persevere and create more impulse for growth despite the difficult budgetary situation , " harald schartau , the spd leader in north rhine-westphalia said on german television . nationwide , 5.22 million people are looking for work - a rise of 177,000 over january , and more than half a million above the figure at the same time last year , according to figures released by the federal labor agency pressure on berlin to unveil new job creation schemes is mounting . with nearly 13 percent of the workforce currently unemployed , germany is seeing its highest jobless rate since the 1930s . " the figures can be explained " chancellor gerhard schröder , currently on a tour of seven gulf states , took time out in quatar on wednesday to comment on the latest figures . " there 's no doubt that the unemployment figures are depressing , " he said .
" but we ca n't allow ourselves to be forced on the defensive .
the figures can be explained .
in january alone 360,000 people who had been on social support payments were included in the jobless totals . "
some 75 percent of february 's 180,000 additions to the total figure can be seen as the result of a reclassification system introduced in january , with many benefit claimants added to the list for the first time thanks to new rules . ilo statistic less bleak the government can also now point to a new statistic calculated using standards set by the international labor organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- , which does not count the long-term unemployed or people who work just a few hours a week .
" we are now publishing a new monthly unemployment figure based on ilo standards , in addition to the figure calculated in the traditional way , " said economics minister wolfgang clement . this figure put unemployment at just under 4 million , well below the politically sensitive 5 million mark . cross-party cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other contributing factors to the apparent rise in joblessness are the weak economy and the current cold weather , which has badly hit the hitting the construction industry . but while berlin insists its efforts to tackle joblessness with the controversial " hartz iv " labor market reforms need time to take effect , the conservative opposition argues the government needs to change tack . " we need a program to bolster medium-sized business and a program for lower energy costs , " argued angela merkel .

democrat senator joseph biden joined in , saying that the lifting of the ban would be " a non-starter with congress " after he and lugar met with president bush in the white house . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president chen shui-bian of taiwan the warning from congress follows a rebuke from taiwan 's president chen shui-bian on tuesday when he told the eu via a video link that eu plans to lift the arms embargo endangered the military balance in east asia and accused some in europe of double standards in currying favour with beijing . he added that the planned lifting of the arms ban could also let the chinese think it did not need to proceed with democratic reforms . " should the eu decide to lift its arms embargo against china it might lead to a tilt in the military balance in the taiwan strait , which would pose a clear threat to peace and stability , " he said . bush returned from his european tour smarting from his china-related encounters with european leaders , especially the one that heralded a widely reported and embarrassing no-nonsense declaration from french president jacques chirac that europe intended to lift the ban .
the end of the embargo has been penciled in for may 8 , when the eu holds a meeting with the chinese leadership . eu must prepare a case for congress the europeans are expected to make a case to congress for acceptance of their decision by arguing that the embargo was a response to tiananmen square massacre in 1989 , and that china has moved on dramatically since then .
during his visit , bush let it be known that he was " open minded " about the lifting of the ban , but told eu leaders that they would have to convince congress . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george w bush , left , poses with european union commission president jose manual barroso , following an eu summit at the european union commission headquarters in brussels , tuesday feb .
22 , 2005 .
if they ca n't , the repairs made to the us-eu relationship during bush 's visit could come unravel . " europe can do defense trade with china or it can do defense trade with the us .

but his serbian counterpart could n't agree less . two weeks ago , montenegro 's prime minister milo djukanovic wrote to the serbian government outlining his hopes for the future of the two nations .
his plan foresaw serbia and montenegro ending the state union of serbia and montenegro and forming independent nations , without a union parliament but with a form of federal council . although the two states would maintain a central administration in charge of economic and political affairs , they would operate separate foreign and defence policies . premature pressure the union of serbia and montenegro was voted into existence by the yugoslav parliament in 2003 .
the eu-brokered belgrade agreement marked an end to a long-drawn out constitutional crisis and was designed to remain in place for a minimum of three years , after which the two republics were to hold referendums on whether to maintain the union arrangement or vote for independence . djukanovic has made no bones about his desire to end the union and insists his proposal does not represent any breach of the agreement , even though this is supposedly valid until 2006 .
but he 's determined to forge ahead with the referendum determining whether or not the tiny republic can attain full sovereignty . " we have made our intentions clear to both our partners both in belgrade and brussels , " he said . more differences than similarities the loose union has always been seen as a provisional solution only , with its primary task billed as foreign and defense policy , while the respective republics retained autonomy regarding economic and customs issues . montenegro has adopted the euro , while serbia is holding tightly onto the dinar .
montenegro relies heavily on tourism , while serbia 's economic mainstays are agriculture and industry - differences which make a cohesive tax and customs policy impossible . and while serbia is keen to invest in its dilapidated armed forces , montenegro wants to introduce a 4000-strong professional army . on march 3 , the mandates of all the deputies in the state union parliament expire .
but with montenegro and serbia unable to reach agreement as to how new elections should be held , the mandates are expected to be extended until a solution is found . time for brussels to intervene belgrade hopes this solution will come from brussels .
eu foreign policy chief javier solana - one of the signatories of the belgrade agreement - has invited djukanovic to brussels , which has always insisted serbia and montenegro will only ever join the eu in a joint bid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schroeder and svetozar marovic many in belgrade agree .
" i believe we will have a positive feasibility study by late march , and can then begin stabilization talks with the eu and also finally join nato , " said svetozar marovic , the montenegrin president of the union of serbia-montenegro and member of djukanovic 's democratic party of socialists -lrb- pictured with gerhard schröder -rrb- . but neither marovic nor the foreign minister of serbia-montenegro , vuk draskovic , appear able to influence the two sides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a kosovo albanian family walks under an albanian flag into a polling station to vote for kosovo 's general elections in capital pristina , on saturday , oct .

voters in the u.n.-run province of kosovo elected provincial leaders saturday in a major test for international officials ' efforts to reconcile bitterly divided ethnic communities and establish a multiethnic society .

franz-lothar altmann , balkans expert at the berlin foundation for science and politics , says a a relaxing of joint-rule between montenegro and serbia is by no means out of the question . " why should n't the union become even looser ? " he says .
" one could even go a step further and include kosovo in the equation . " altmann also points out that independence for montenegro is very much in djukanovic 's interests .
the prime minister faces a trial in italy on charges of involvement with organized crime and cigarette smuggling in the 1990s .
it was recently decided in italy that because he is not the head of a sovereign state , he does not enjoy immunity from prosecution . were this to change , djukanovic could no longer be tried in an italian court . filip slavkovic -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de killing of serbian prime minister fuels fears about country 's stability zoran djindjic , the man who made many enemies as he tried to transform the serbia of slobodan milosevic , was assassinated on wednesday .

" continuing with business as usual is not an option , " they said , urging the government to accept their " ten-point plan for germany . " in yemen , schröder responded positively to their offer , but rejected aspects of their proposals including the relaxing of laws protecting german employees from dismissal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder " anyone who thinks dismissal protection law is the main obstacle to new appointments shows they have little understanding of the real problem , " he said . he also insisted their help should be unconditional .
" if their willingness to talk comes with certain conditions , they are laying themselves open to accusations of playing games that the people of this country do not need given their problems , " the chancellor said . election campaign tied to reducing joblessness after their disappointing results in the northern state of schleswig holstein in february , schröder 's social democrats are pinning their hopes on the may poll in north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state and a traditional spd stronghold . the result is expected to indicate the outcome of the 2006 general election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but data published tuesday shows that unemployment in the state has topped the 1 million mark , excacerbating public anger at the government 's failure to trigger job growth .

" the figures can be explained " chancellor gerhard schröder , currently on a tour of seven gulf states , took time out in quatar on wednesday to comment on the latest figures . " there 's no doubt that the unemployment figures are depressing , " he said .
" but we ca n't allow ourselves to be forced on the defensive .
the figures can be explained .
in january alone 360,000 people who had been on social support payments were included in the jobless totals . "
some 75 percent of february 's 180,000 additions to the total figure can be seen as the result of a reclassification system introduced in january , with many benefit claimants added to the list for the first time thanks to new rules . ilo statistic less bleak the government can also now point to a new statistic calculated using standards set by the international labor organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- , which does not count the long-term unemployed or people who work just a few hours a week .
" we are now publishing a new monthly unemployment figure based on ilo standards , in addition to the figure calculated in the traditional way , " said economics minister wolfgang clement . this figure put unemployment at just under 4 million , well below the politically sensitive 5 million mark . cross-party cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other contributing factors to the apparent rise in joblessness are the weak economy and the current cold weather , which has badly hit the hitting the construction industry . but while berlin insists its efforts to tackle joblessness with the controversial " hartz iv " labor market reforms need time to take effect , the conservative opposition argues the government needs to change tack .

" in coma and looking for work germany 2004 : the road to reform germany -pipe- 03.03.2005 schröder accepts opposition offer of help großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition wants berlin to adopt their ten-point program as unemployment in germany reaches new heights , chancellor schröder says he 's willing to discuss new reforms with the conservative opposition so long as their motive is more than electioneering . angela merkel , leader of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , and edmund stoiber , leader of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- have written to schröder proposing their parties join forces to develop immediate strategies to combat joblessness . " continuing with business as usual is not an option , " they said , urging the government to accept their " ten-point plan for germany . " in yemen , schröder responded positively to their offer , but rejected aspects of their proposals including the relaxing of laws protecting german employees from dismissal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder " anyone who thinks dismissal protection law is the main obstacle to new appointments shows they have little understanding of the real problem , " he said . he also insisted their help should be unconditional .
" if their willingness to talk comes with certain conditions , they are laying themselves open to accusations of playing games that the people of this country do not need given their problems , " the chancellor said . election campaign tied to reducing joblessness after their disappointing results in the northern state of schleswig holstein in february , schröder 's social democrats are pinning their hopes on the may poll in north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state and a traditional spd stronghold . the result is expected to indicate the outcome of the 2006 general election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but data published tuesday shows that unemployment in the state has topped the 1 million mark , excacerbating public anger at the government 's failure to trigger job growth . " we say to our friends in berlin , you have to persevere and create more impulse for growth despite the difficult budgetary situation , " harald schartau , the spd leader in north rhine-westphalia said on german television . nationwide , 5.22 million people are looking for work - a rise of 177,000 over january , and more than half a million above the figure at the same time last year , according to figures released by the federal labor agency pressure on berlin to unveil new job creation schemes is mounting . with nearly 13 percent of the workforce currently unemployed , germany is seeing its highest jobless rate since the 1930s . " the figures can be explained " chancellor gerhard schröder , currently on a tour of seven gulf states , took time out in quatar on wednesday to comment on the latest figures . " there 's no doubt that the unemployment figures are depressing , " he said .
" but we ca n't allow ourselves to be forced on the defensive .
the figures can be explained .
in january alone 360,000 people who had been on social support payments were included in the jobless totals . "
some 75 percent of february 's 180,000 additions to the total figure can be seen as the result of a reclassification system introduced in january , with many benefit claimants added to the list for the first time thanks to new rules . ilo statistic less bleak the government can also now point to a new statistic calculated using standards set by the international labor organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- , which does not count the long-term unemployed or people who work just a few hours a week .
" we are now publishing a new monthly unemployment figure based on ilo standards , in addition to the figure calculated in the traditional way , " said economics minister wolfgang clement . this figure put unemployment at just under 4 million , well below the politically sensitive 5 million mark . cross-party cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other contributing factors to the apparent rise in joblessness are the weak economy and the current cold weather , which has badly hit the hitting the construction industry . but while berlin insists its efforts to tackle joblessness with the controversial " hartz iv " labor market reforms need time to take effect , the conservative opposition argues the government needs to change tack . " we need a program to bolster medium-sized business and a program for lower energy costs , " argued angela merkel .

on thursday , kroes ' department made it clear that it considered the funding of public television in germany to amount to a sort of unlawful state subsidy which hampered free competition in several areas . apart from germany , the eu investigation has also centered on ireland and the netherlands .
on thursday , kroes dashed off similar letters to governments in dublin and amsterdam .
kroes has warned that the three eu member states needed to ensure transparency in the financing of their public television networks and make a clear distinction between their public activities and other commercial ventures such as the internet and digital tv . the commission insisted that it was n't questioning the national right of the eu 's 25 member states to set their own level of funding and public license fees as well as the objectives of their public broadcasters so long as they do not unfairly harm private sector competitors . online services under scrutiny too the eu investigation is expected to have a far-reaching effect on public broadcasters ' rights to offer online services .

they are reported to point to these interventions as being directly contradictory to previous eu rulings upholding the right of britain 's public network bbc to go ahead with nine digital tv and radio channels or even ard 's special interest channels , phoenix and kinderkanal . while deutsche welle is part of the ard network , it is not funded by license fees but government money . ard and zdf are now said to be looking at scaling down their internet services as a precautionary measure and only provide internet content relating to their programming schedules . the bbc is also said to be worriedly watching brussels ' investigation of public networks in germany , ireland and the netherlands .
top bbc executives are reportedly in talks with their counterparts at the german broadcasters as well as eu officials over what the case might mean for them . brussels wants independent monitor kroes on thursday also demanded the setting up of an independent national authority that would monitor the upholding of transparency in the funding of public broadcasters .
she pointed out that eu members france , italy , spain and portugal had already bowed to similar eu demands in the past . germany , ireland and the netherlands will now have about four weeks to react to brussels ' letter .

but his serbian counterpart could n't agree less . two weeks ago , montenegro 's prime minister milo djukanovic wrote to the serbian government outlining his hopes for the future of the two nations .
his plan foresaw serbia and montenegro ending the state union of serbia and montenegro and forming independent nations , without a union parliament but with a form of federal council . although the two states would maintain a central administration in charge of economic and political affairs , they would operate separate foreign and defence policies . premature pressure the union of serbia and montenegro was voted into existence by the yugoslav parliament in 2003 .
the eu-brokered belgrade agreement marked an end to a long-drawn out constitutional crisis and was designed to remain in place for a minimum of three years , after which the two republics were to hold referendums on whether to maintain the union arrangement or vote for independence . djukanovic has made no bones about his desire to end the union and insists his proposal does not represent any breach of the agreement , even though this is supposedly valid until 2006 .
but he 's determined to forge ahead with the referendum determining whether or not the tiny republic can attain full sovereignty . " we have made our intentions clear to both our partners both in belgrade and brussels , " he said . more differences than similarities the loose union has always been seen as a provisional solution only , with its primary task billed as foreign and defense policy , while the respective republics retained autonomy regarding economic and customs issues . montenegro has adopted the euro , while serbia is holding tightly onto the dinar .
montenegro relies heavily on tourism , while serbia 's economic mainstays are agriculture and industry - differences which make a cohesive tax and customs policy impossible . and while serbia is keen to invest in its dilapidated armed forces , montenegro wants to introduce a 4000-strong professional army . on march 3 , the mandates of all the deputies in the state union parliament expire .
but with montenegro and serbia unable to reach agreement as to how new elections should be held , the mandates are expected to be extended until a solution is found . time for brussels to intervene belgrade hopes this solution will come from brussels .
eu foreign policy chief javier solana - one of the signatories of the belgrade agreement - has invited djukanovic to brussels , which has always insisted serbia and montenegro will only ever join the eu in a joint bid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schroeder and svetozar marovic many in belgrade agree .
" i believe we will have a positive feasibility study by late march , and can then begin stabilization talks with the eu and also finally join nato , " said svetozar marovic , the montenegrin president of the union of serbia-montenegro and member of djukanovic 's democratic party of socialists -lrb- pictured with gerhard schröder -rrb- . but neither marovic nor the foreign minister of serbia-montenegro , vuk draskovic , appear able to influence the two sides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a kosovo albanian family walks under an albanian flag into a polling station to vote for kosovo 's general elections in capital pristina , on saturday , oct .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.03.2005 eu probes germany 's public tv funding großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on brussels ' viewfinder : german public tv network ard european union regulators have warned germany that its funding for public television partly violates eu state aid law and urged it to set up an independent supervisory panel to ensure more transparency . european union competition commissioner neelie kroes on thursday told germany that it needed to overhaul its funding system for state-owned channels ard and zdf .
in a letter to the german government , kroes demanded more clarification on how the public networks are funded . " the commission 's preliminary view is that the current financing system is no longer in line with eu rules , " the letter read . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zdf 's star team of sports presenters the eu competition watchdogs were reacting to complaints lodged by commercial television networks in germany in 2003 that their state-funded rivals used illegal subsidies .
on thursday , kroes ' department made it clear that it considered the funding of public television in germany to amount to a sort of unlawful state subsidy which hampered free competition in several areas . apart from germany , the eu investigation has also centered on ireland and the netherlands .
on thursday , kroes dashed off similar letters to governments in dublin and amsterdam .
kroes has warned that the three eu member states needed to ensure transparency in the financing of their public television networks and make a clear distinction between their public activities and other commercial ventures such as the internet and digital tv . the commission insisted that it was n't questioning the national right of the eu 's 25 member states to set their own level of funding and public license fees as well as the objectives of their public broadcasters so long as they do not unfairly harm private sector competitors . online services under scrutiny too the eu investigation is expected to have a far-reaching effect on public broadcasters ' rights to offer online services .
among other things , germany 's commercial networks in 2003 charged that services for sale on the web sites of state-owned channels make unfair use of public money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes , eu competition commissioner kroes -lrb- photo -rrb- too is believed to have serious misgivings about the use of license fees - some € 17 -lrb- $ 22.32 -rrb- a month in germany and collected by germany 's central office for licensing fees -lrb- gez -rrb- - to fund internet services , seeing it as an illegal cross-subsidy . german public television networks ard and zdf , which were set up after the second world war to ensure pluralism after the nazi dictatorship , are now moving into sponsorship and offer a host of spin-off commercial activities on their web sites . the networks , controlled ultimately by germany 's 16 federal states , are now worried that the eu 's intervention might severely curtail their online services .

in a letter to the german government , kroes demanded more clarification on how the public networks are funded . " the commission 's preliminary view is that the current financing system is no longer in line with eu rules , " the letter read . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zdf 's star team of sports presenters the eu competition watchdogs were reacting to complaints lodged by commercial television networks in germany in 2003 that their state-funded rivals used illegal subsidies .
on thursday , kroes ' department made it clear that it considered the funding of public television in germany to amount to a sort of unlawful state subsidy which hampered free competition in several areas . apart from germany , the eu investigation has also centered on ireland and the netherlands .
on thursday , kroes dashed off similar letters to governments in dublin and amsterdam .
kroes has warned that the three eu member states needed to ensure transparency in the financing of their public television networks and make a clear distinction between their public activities and other commercial ventures such as the internet and digital tv . the commission insisted that it was n't questioning the national right of the eu 's 25 member states to set their own level of funding and public license fees as well as the objectives of their public broadcasters so long as they do not unfairly harm private sector competitors . online services under scrutiny too the eu investigation is expected to have a far-reaching effect on public broadcasters ' rights to offer online services .
among other things , germany 's commercial networks in 2003 charged that services for sale on the web sites of state-owned channels make unfair use of public money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes , eu competition commissioner kroes -lrb- photo -rrb- too is believed to have serious misgivings about the use of license fees - some € 17 -lrb- $ 22.32 -rrb- a month in germany and collected by germany 's central office for licensing fees -lrb- gez -rrb- - to fund internet services , seeing it as an illegal cross-subsidy . german public television networks ard and zdf , which were set up after the second world war to ensure pluralism after the nazi dictatorship , are now moving into sponsorship and offer a host of spin-off commercial activities on their web sites . the networks , controlled ultimately by germany 's 16 federal states , are now worried that the eu 's intervention might severely curtail their online services .

the iaea had reported key areas where iran was refusing to cooperate with un inspectors . " while transparency visits have taken place , iran seems to have been determined to limit their scope , " said british ambassador robin wright , reading from the joint statement . the europeans still took a more conciliatory tone than the americans .
they noted that iran 's decision to suspend uranium enrichment - which can be used for either nuclear energy or to make atomic weapons - was " a voluntary commitment " and urged tehran to keep its word . the us maintains that iran 's nuclear activities are designed for a clandestine weapons program .
the head of the us delegation to the iaea board , jackie sanders , cited " an alarming number " of unresolved questions and warned that the iaea could not put off " forever " taking tehran before the un security council for possible sanctions . refusal of inspections causes friction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like the us , the europeans criticized iran for refusing to allow un inspectors to visit its military site in parchin , a site where there are definitely nuclear materials , where washington accuses tehran of simulating testing of nuclear weapons . the iranian delegate to the iaea , cyrus nasseri , said iran was not allowing a second visit to parchin , after a first one in january , in part because it was concerned about information leaks " in view of potential threats of military strikes against iran 's safeguarded and other facilities " by what he called " a major nuclear weapons state " in a clear reference to the united states . but iaea director-general mohamed el baradei said that iran was a " special case " since its nuclear program " has been clandestine for almost two decades " and he asked tehran to allow widespread visits by un inspectors .
the europeans endorsed el baradei 's call for iran to come clean " in order to make up for the confidence deficit created by past activities and to build the necessary confidence in the future , " the european statement said . us president george w. bush has said washington is seeking a diplomatic solution in iran and supports eu talks with tehran .
but bush has said all options , including the military one , remain on the table . bush considers dangling the carrot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , it appears that the president is increasingly aligning himself with european efforts and is considering offering incentives to iran , according to us officials on thursday .
in a preparatory statement ahead of an expected announcement of the us strategy later this week , the united states said it would not block iran as it seeks to start the process of joining the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , and would not stand in the way of european allies if they want to sell tehran parts for civilian aircraft . white house spokesman scott mcclellan said the president had not finalized his decision but said that the united states and europe were discussing " how we can move forward together on a common strategy to get iran to abandon any ambitions for a nuclear weapon . " " we want to do our part to support the european efforts .
this is about strengthening their diplomatic approach to resolving this matter , " he added . in return for supporting incentives , it is likely that the americans would insist that iran abandon uranium enrichment , the major sticking point in the on-going negotiations .

" it is a carrot , and it 's not a very big one , " a senior congressional aide involved in the wto issue was quoted as saying by reuters . membership of the wto can take years after a country has been granted observer status , the first stepping stone to full accession . iran would have a stipulated five years after observer status is achieved to begin the process of moving toward full membership and actual entry into the wto can take many more after that .
however , negotiations on iran 's membership could be strung out indefinitely by the us , binding the iranians to years of concessions over its nuclear program . if the iranians see through this and refuse to accept the incentives , maintaining their efforts to enrich uranium , then the us would resort to its original course of action which would be to take iran to the un security council for possible sanctions . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran signs russian nuclear deal iran and russia on sunday signed a landmark nuclear fuel accord that paves the way for the islamic republic 's first atomic power station , a project the united states alleges is part of a cover for weapons development .

the iaea had reported key areas where iran was refusing to cooperate with un inspectors . " while transparency visits have taken place , iran seems to have been determined to limit their scope , " said british ambassador robin wright , reading from the joint statement . the europeans still took a more conciliatory tone than the americans .
they noted that iran 's decision to suspend uranium enrichment - which can be used for either nuclear energy or to make atomic weapons - was " a voluntary commitment " and urged tehran to keep its word . the us maintains that iran 's nuclear activities are designed for a clandestine weapons program .
the head of the us delegation to the iaea board , jackie sanders , cited " an alarming number " of unresolved questions and warned that the iaea could not put off " forever " taking tehran before the un security council for possible sanctions . refusal of inspections causes friction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like the us , the europeans criticized iran for refusing to allow un inspectors to visit its military site in parchin , a site where there are definitely nuclear materials , where washington accuses tehran of simulating testing of nuclear weapons . the iranian delegate to the iaea , cyrus nasseri , said iran was not allowing a second visit to parchin , after a first one in january , in part because it was concerned about information leaks " in view of potential threats of military strikes against iran 's safeguarded and other facilities " by what he called " a major nuclear weapons state " in a clear reference to the united states . but iaea director-general mohamed el baradei said that iran was a " special case " since its nuclear program " has been clandestine for almost two decades " and he asked tehran to allow widespread visits by un inspectors .
the europeans endorsed el baradei 's call for iran to come clean " in order to make up for the confidence deficit created by past activities and to build the necessary confidence in the future , " the european statement said . us president george w. bush has said washington is seeking a diplomatic solution in iran and supports eu talks with tehran .
but bush has said all options , including the military one , remain on the table . bush considers dangling the carrot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , it appears that the president is increasingly aligning himself with european efforts and is considering offering incentives to iran , according to us officials on thursday .
in a preparatory statement ahead of an expected announcement of the us strategy later this week , the united states said it would not block iran as it seeks to start the process of joining the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , and would not stand in the way of european allies if they want to sell tehran parts for civilian aircraft . white house spokesman scott mcclellan said the president had not finalized his decision but said that the united states and europe were discussing " how we can move forward together on a common strategy to get iran to abandon any ambitions for a nuclear weapon . " " we want to do our part to support the european efforts .
this is about strengthening their diplomatic approach to resolving this matter , " he added . in return for supporting incentives , it is likely that the americans would insist that iran abandon uranium enrichment , the major sticking point in the on-going negotiations .
but while it appears that the us has shifted considerable ground , the reality is a little different .

" it is a carrot , and it 's not a very big one , " a senior congressional aide involved in the wto issue was quoted as saying by reuters . membership of the wto can take years after a country has been granted observer status , the first stepping stone to full accession . iran would have a stipulated five years after observer status is achieved to begin the process of moving toward full membership and actual entry into the wto can take many more after that .
however , negotiations on iran 's membership could be strung out indefinitely by the us , binding the iranians to years of concessions over its nuclear program . if the iranians see through this and refuse to accept the incentives , maintaining their efforts to enrich uranium , then the us would resort to its original course of action which would be to take iran to the un security council for possible sanctions . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran signs russian nuclear deal iran and russia on sunday signed a landmark nuclear fuel accord that paves the way for the islamic republic 's first atomic power station , a project the united states alleges is part of a cover for weapons development .

but his serbian counterpart could n't agree less . two weeks ago , montenegro 's prime minister milo djukanovic wrote to the serbian government outlining his hopes for the future of the two nations .
his plan foresaw serbia and montenegro ending the state union of serbia and montenegro and forming independent nations , without a union parliament but with a form of federal council . although the two states would maintain a central administration in charge of economic and political affairs , they would operate separate foreign and defence policies . premature pressure the union of serbia and montenegro was voted into existence by the yugoslav parliament in 2003 .
the eu-brokered belgrade agreement marked an end to a long-drawn out constitutional crisis and was designed to remain in place for a minimum of three years , after which the two republics were to hold referendums on whether to maintain the union arrangement or vote for independence . djukanovic has made no bones about his desire to end the union and insists his proposal does not represent any breach of the agreement , even though this is supposedly valid until 2006 .

since 1998 when a conference in washington heralded the beginning of a concerted effort by germany and 43 other countries to find and return artworks stolen by the nazis during world war ii , museums across the country have experienced the headaches attached to this quest . one on-going saga involving three paintings seized by the nazis between 1937 and 1939 was resolved this week when they were returned to their original jewish owners after a long legal wrangle , a local official said on wednesday . a spokeswoman for city authorities in wuppertal , western germany , said the handover , which should have happened more than a year ago but was held up by a legal technicality , would go ahead " as soon as possible , once the conditions for their return are set in a contract . " the process of handing back the three paintings , which are currently on display in the city 's heydt museum , had previously been delayed by doubts about who the real owners were . the work " felsige flusslandschaft , " by frankfurt artist otto scholderer , was bought by the museum in 1939 after its forced sale a year earlier .
" erinnerung vom dampfboot auf der donau , " by adolph menzel , was given as a gift to the heydt in 1956 . the owners of hans von marees ' " tatar mit pferd , " forced into sale in 1937 , fled germany for the netherlands where they were caught and killed in a concentration camp in 1944 .
the painting was bought by the museum in 1948 and is expected to be given to the grandchildren of its deceased owners . complications the rule , not exception bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : such complications are not unusual .
returning stolen art to the rightful owners 60 years after it was first taken is an awkward affair .
despite the best efforts of the german states and local authorities , which have been keeping an internet database of reportedly stolen artefacts , many critics have derided these attempts , citing inexact information and conflicts of interest . one particularly high-profile case is still caught in a bitter impasse due to these reasons .
emil nold 's " buchsbaumgarten , " valued at around € 500,000 -lrb- $ 656,275 -rrb- , remains in the possession of duisburg 's wilhelm lehmbruck museum despite substantiated claims by ruth haller , a relative of jewish lawyer and art collector ismar littmann . after the nazis banned littmann from practicing , he committed suicide in 1934 and his family had to sell part of his collection .
the rest was confiscated by the gestapo . the duisburg museum bought the painting in the 1950s without any knowledge of the painting 's history and now refuses to return it . legal gray area bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portrait of wally , painted by the late austrian expressionist egon schiele .
the museum of modern art turned down pleas from two jewish families to hold onto two paintings in a traveling exhibit while they press claims that the artworks were lost to nazi wartime plundering .
there are very few legal statutes regarding the return of stolen art appropriated by the nazis .
while court rulings decide the fate of some , the majority of cases are fought on moral and ethical grounds and many victims of the third reich base their cases on emotional pleas . however , since the summer of 2003 , the federal stolen art ethics committee has mediated in many cases between victims and museums .

but many cases remain unsolved and bitter feuds prevent other paintings being returned . a cultural legacy left over from the third reich which german museums continue to face is the return of stolen art .
since 1998 when a conference in washington heralded the beginning of a concerted effort by germany and 43 other countries to find and return artworks stolen by the nazis during world war ii , museums across the country have experienced the headaches attached to this quest . one on-going saga involving three paintings seized by the nazis between 1937 and 1939 was resolved this week when they were returned to their original jewish owners after a long legal wrangle , a local official said on wednesday . a spokeswoman for city authorities in wuppertal , western germany , said the handover , which should have happened more than a year ago but was held up by a legal technicality , would go ahead " as soon as possible , once the conditions for their return are set in a contract . " the process of handing back the three paintings , which are currently on display in the city 's heydt museum , had previously been delayed by doubts about who the real owners were . the work " felsige flusslandschaft , " by frankfurt artist otto scholderer , was bought by the museum in 1939 after its forced sale a year earlier .
" erinnerung vom dampfboot auf der donau , " by adolph menzel , was given as a gift to the heydt in 1956 . the owners of hans von marees ' " tatar mit pferd , " forced into sale in 1937 , fled germany for the netherlands where they were caught and killed in a concentration camp in 1944 .
the painting was bought by the museum in 1948 and is expected to be given to the grandchildren of its deceased owners . complications the rule , not exception bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : such complications are not unusual .
returning stolen art to the rightful owners 60 years after it was first taken is an awkward affair .
despite the best efforts of the german states and local authorities , which have been keeping an internet database of reportedly stolen artefacts , many critics have derided these attempts , citing inexact information and conflicts of interest . one particularly high-profile case is still caught in a bitter impasse due to these reasons .

1 , 2010 , a german city will celebrate its first day as europe 's cultural capital .
what 's still unclear , however , is which town will be able to do so as 10 cities across the country are still in the running . from lübeck in the north to karlsruhe in the south , from görlitz in the east to essen in the west , the contenders have lobbying hard to bring home the title .
whether it 's prominent supporters such as halle native and former german foreign minister hans-dietrich genscher promoting his city on posters across the country or regensburg enlisting scandalous theater director christoph schlingensief to put on an -lrb- albeit unflattering -rrb- play about the bavarian town , most have come up with ways to get some attention . on march 10 and 11 , a jury of experts will pick two cities and recommend them to germany 's upper house , the bundesrat .
the finalists will then be officially sent to brussels by the foreign ministry in the fall . to introduce you to some of germany 's finest , dw-world has put together city portraits of all the contenders .

" while transparency visits have taken place , iran seems to have been determined to limit their scope , " said british ambassador robin wright , reading from the joint statement . the europeans still took a more conciliatory tone than the americans .

but a scandal involving the abuse of tourist visas has dented his reputation and is threatening to unravel his political future . last weekend , fischer gave a speech that was likely one of the most difficult of his lengthy political career .
in an address to members of his greens party at a regional congress , he had to admit he had made mistakes in handling a widening affair in which foreign criminals made use of relaxed visa requirements – approved by fischer – to smuggle people into germany . while he rejected demands by the conservative opposition to resign , the fact that fischer felt compelled to devote his speech to the visa scandal shows just how much the matter has the experienced political operator on the defensive . " fischer certainly underestimated the situation , " dr. jürgen falter , director of the domestic politics program at the university of mainz , told dw-world .
" at the moment it does n't look like it will push him from office , but we 'll have to wait and see if more serious revelations come to light . " opposition politicians claim thousands of illegal immigrants – including many from ukraine and china – were able to enter germany between 2000 and 2003 after tourist visa criteria were relaxed .
they say that led to an increase in organized crime , drugs and prostitution on fischer 's watch . admirers and enemies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer looks on during the greens party congress in rostock , eastern germany , on saturday , nov .
24 , 2001 .
known as someone who does n't suffer fools gladly , fischer has as many enemies as he does admirers in parliament , the press , and even in his own party .
over the years , he has developed a reputation as being aloof and arrogant to journalists and his colleagues .
perhaps worse , he has the nasty habit of unnecessarily humiliating those working for him at the foreign ministry .
it appears as if fischer is now reaping what he 's sown as those who feel slighted by the minister look for some payback . " he always thought he was almost invulnerable and could survive anything , which was the case up till now , " fischer 's biographer bernd ulrich said in a recent radio interview with deutschlandfunk .
" that 's why he 's approached this matter with a certain amount of arrogance . " yet despite his prickly public persona , fischer has consistently ranked as one of germany 's most popular politicians .
born in 1948 as the humble son of butcher in stuttgart , fischer has one of the most unconventional backgrounds of the country 's political elite .
having left school in 10th grade , he made a living in the 1970s as a taxi driver before helping set up the greens and leading the upstart party into parliament in the 1980s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer said he recognized himself on this picture of being beaten by the police in 1968 .
other photos showed fischer beating a police officer .
while he lived in frankfurt , he also became involved in the leftwing student protests of 1968 .
during that turbulent time he was involved in violent street fighting with the police .
pictures of him made public in 2001 in a black motorcycle helmet kicking a police officer during a protest led conservatives to call for his head . authentic and quirky but german chancellor gerhard schröder stuck by him back then and the public chalked up the affair as a youthful indiscretion on fischer 's part .
and for many germans , it was simply more proof of his " authenticity " that has made him both the greens ' elder statesman and a quirky public figure that could do little wrong . " he has a personality bonus , " explained richard hilmer from the public polling organization infratest / dimap .
" he 's considered a different kind of politician .
his moving background is considered convincing and authentic . " but the visa affair has battered fischer 's reputation in the eyes of many .
for the first time in three years , fischer last week lost his status as germany 's most popular politician in a regular poll by public broadcaster zdf . " he 's smacked quite a few people around and that has come back to haunt him .
there appears to be quite a bit of schadenfreude over his predicament , " dr. falter said , adding he expected fischer to survive the current scandal largely intact .
" if he makes it through this he 'll be know as the teflon minister .
nothing will stick to him . " schröder 's backing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka and gerd .
as in 2001 , schröder has once again demonstratively backed his foreign minister , saying there was no question that fischer will stay in office .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 03.03.2005 us , europe aligned on iran nuke incentives großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and europe are moving closer in their approaches to iran while the europeans talked tough on wednesday , calling for more transparency from iran in its nuclear activities , the us announced that it may back europe 's incentive-based negotiations with tehran . germany , france and britain joined the united states and the united nations nuclear watchdog on wednesday in calling on iran to show more transparency regarding its nuclear activities . the three european union countries , which have been negotiating with iran to stop its uranium enrichment program in exchange for trade and security benefits , issued a joint statement to the board of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- in vienna .
the iaea had reported key areas where iran was refusing to cooperate with un inspectors . " while transparency visits have taken place , iran seems to have been determined to limit their scope , " said british ambassador robin wright , reading from the joint statement . the europeans still took a more conciliatory tone than the americans .
they noted that iran 's decision to suspend uranium enrichment - which can be used for either nuclear energy or to make atomic weapons - was " a voluntary commitment " and urged tehran to keep its word . the us maintains that iran 's nuclear activities are designed for a clandestine weapons program .
the head of the us delegation to the iaea board , jackie sanders , cited " an alarming number " of unresolved questions and warned that the iaea could not put off " forever " taking tehran before the un security council for possible sanctions . refusal of inspections causes friction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like the us , the europeans criticized iran for refusing to allow un inspectors to visit its military site in parchin , a site where there are definitely nuclear materials , where washington accuses tehran of simulating testing of nuclear weapons . the iranian delegate to the iaea , cyrus nasseri , said iran was not allowing a second visit to parchin , after a first one in january , in part because it was concerned about information leaks " in view of potential threats of military strikes against iran 's safeguarded and other facilities " by what he called " a major nuclear weapons state " in a clear reference to the united states . but iaea director-general mohamed el baradei said that iran was a " special case " since its nuclear program " has been clandestine for almost two decades " and he asked tehran to allow widespread visits by un inspectors .
the europeans endorsed el baradei 's call for iran to come clean " in order to make up for the confidence deficit created by past activities and to build the necessary confidence in the future , " the european statement said . us president george w. bush has said washington is seeking a diplomatic solution in iran and supports eu talks with tehran .
but bush has said all options , including the military one , remain on the table . bush considers dangling the carrot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , it appears that the president is increasingly aligning himself with european efforts and is considering offering incentives to iran , according to us officials on thursday .
in a preparatory statement ahead of an expected announcement of the us strategy later this week , the united states said it would not block iran as it seeks to start the process of joining the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , and would not stand in the way of european allies if they want to sell tehran parts for civilian aircraft . white house spokesman scott mcclellan said the president had not finalized his decision but said that the united states and europe were discussing " how we can move forward together on a common strategy to get iran to abandon any ambitions for a nuclear weapon . " " we want to do our part to support the european efforts .
this is about strengthening their diplomatic approach to resolving this matter , " he added . in return for supporting incentives , it is likely that the americans would insist that iran abandon uranium enrichment , the major sticking point in the on-going negotiations .
but while it appears that the us has shifted considerable ground , the reality is a little different .
the europeans and the americans would get the better end of the deal if iran accepts the incentives . wto accession a one-sided deal ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- headquarters in geneva , switzerland .
" it is a carrot , and it 's not a very big one , " a senior congressional aide involved in the wto issue was quoted as saying by reuters . membership of the wto can take years after a country has been granted observer status , the first stepping stone to full accession . iran would have a stipulated five years after observer status is achieved to begin the process of moving toward full membership and actual entry into the wto can take many more after that .
however , negotiations on iran 's membership could be strung out indefinitely by the us , binding the iranians to years of concessions over its nuclear program . if the iranians see through this and refuse to accept the incentives , maintaining their efforts to enrich uranium , then the us would resort to its original course of action which would be to take iran to the un security council for possible sanctions . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran signs russian nuclear deal iran and russia on sunday signed a landmark nuclear fuel accord that paves the way for the islamic republic 's first atomic power station , a project the united states alleges is part of a cover for weapons development .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.03.2005 an end to superstar fischer ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer 's popularity has suffered recently foreign minister joschka fischer has long been one of germany 's most popular politicians .
but a scandal involving the abuse of tourist visas has dented his reputation and is threatening to unravel his political future . last weekend , fischer gave a speech that was likely one of the most difficult of his lengthy political career .
in an address to members of his greens party at a regional congress , he had to admit he had made mistakes in handling a widening affair in which foreign criminals made use of relaxed visa requirements – approved by fischer – to smuggle people into germany . while he rejected demands by the conservative opposition to resign , the fact that fischer felt compelled to devote his speech to the visa scandal shows just how much the matter has the experienced political operator on the defensive . " fischer certainly underestimated the situation , " dr. jürgen falter , director of the domestic politics program at the university of mainz , told dw-world .
" at the moment it does n't look like it will push him from office , but we 'll have to wait and see if more serious revelations come to light . " opposition politicians claim thousands of illegal immigrants – including many from ukraine and china – were able to enter germany between 2000 and 2003 after tourist visa criteria were relaxed .
they say that led to an increase in organized crime , drugs and prostitution on fischer 's watch . admirers and enemies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer looks on during the greens party congress in rostock , eastern germany , on saturday , nov .
24 , 2001 .
known as someone who does n't suffer fools gladly , fischer has as many enemies as he does admirers in parliament , the press , and even in his own party .
over the years , he has developed a reputation as being aloof and arrogant to journalists and his colleagues .
perhaps worse , he has the nasty habit of unnecessarily humiliating those working for him at the foreign ministry .
it appears as if fischer is now reaping what he 's sown as those who feel slighted by the minister look for some payback . " he always thought he was almost invulnerable and could survive anything , which was the case up till now , " fischer 's biographer bernd ulrich said in a recent radio interview with deutschlandfunk .
" that 's why he 's approached this matter with a certain amount of arrogance . " yet despite his prickly public persona , fischer has consistently ranked as one of germany 's most popular politicians .
born in 1948 as the humble son of butcher in stuttgart , fischer has one of the most unconventional backgrounds of the country 's political elite .
having left school in 10th grade , he made a living in the 1970s as a taxi driver before helping set up the greens and leading the upstart party into parliament in the 1980s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer said he recognized himself on this picture of being beaten by the police in 1968 .
other photos showed fischer beating a police officer .
while he lived in frankfurt , he also became involved in the leftwing student protests of 1968 .
during that turbulent time he was involved in violent street fighting with the police .
pictures of him made public in 2001 in a black motorcycle helmet kicking a police officer during a protest led conservatives to call for his head . authentic and quirky but german chancellor gerhard schröder stuck by him back then and the public chalked up the affair as a youthful indiscretion on fischer 's part .
and for many germans , it was simply more proof of his " authenticity " that has made him both the greens ' elder statesman and a quirky public figure that could do little wrong . " he has a personality bonus , " explained richard hilmer from the public polling organization infratest / dimap .
" he 's considered a different kind of politician .
his moving background is considered convincing and authentic . " but the visa affair has battered fischer 's reputation in the eyes of many .
for the first time in three years , fischer last week lost his status as germany 's most popular politician in a regular poll by public broadcaster zdf . " he 's smacked quite a few people around and that has come back to haunt him .
there appears to be quite a bit of schadenfreude over his predicament , " dr. falter said , adding he expected fischer to survive the current scandal largely intact .
" if he makes it through this he 'll be know as the teflon minister .
nothing will stick to him . " schröder 's backing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka and gerd .
as in 2001 , schröder has once again demonstratively backed his foreign minister , saying there was no question that fischer will stay in office .
the chancellor has also expressed his desire to stand for reelection in 2006 with fischer at his side . fischer biographer ulrich even said the governing center-left coalition of social democrats and greens could possible survive with another chancellor than schröder , but that the foreign minister was indispensable . " he 's too important for the stability of the coalition , " he said , adding that because of the visa affair fischer had also become a liability .
" he wo n't fall but he 'll definitely slide a bit .
and when he sinks , he 'll pull the red-green coalition down a bit further .

" opposition politicians claim thousands of illegal immigrants – including many from ukraine and china – were able to enter germany between 2000 and 2003 after tourist visa criteria were relaxed .
they say that led to an increase in organized crime , drugs and prostitution on fischer 's watch . admirers and enemies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer looks on during the greens party congress in rostock , eastern germany , on saturday , nov .
24 , 2001 .
known as someone who does n't suffer fools gladly , fischer has as many enemies as he does admirers in parliament , the press , and even in his own party .
over the years , he has developed a reputation as being aloof and arrogant to journalists and his colleagues .
perhaps worse , he has the nasty habit of unnecessarily humiliating those working for him at the foreign ministry .
it appears as if fischer is now reaping what he 's sown as those who feel slighted by the minister look for some payback . " he always thought he was almost invulnerable and could survive anything , which was the case up till now , " fischer 's biographer bernd ulrich said in a recent radio interview with deutschlandfunk .
" that 's why he 's approached this matter with a certain amount of arrogance . " yet despite his prickly public persona , fischer has consistently ranked as one of germany 's most popular politicians .
born in 1948 as the humble son of butcher in stuttgart , fischer has one of the most unconventional backgrounds of the country 's political elite .
having left school in 10th grade , he made a living in the 1970s as a taxi driver before helping set up the greens and leading the upstart party into parliament in the 1980s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer said he recognized himself on this picture of being beaten by the police in 1968 .
other photos showed fischer beating a police officer .
while he lived in frankfurt , he also became involved in the leftwing student protests of 1968 .
during that turbulent time he was involved in violent street fighting with the police .
pictures of him made public in 2001 in a black motorcycle helmet kicking a police officer during a protest led conservatives to call for his head . authentic and quirky but german chancellor gerhard schröder stuck by him back then and the public chalked up the affair as a youthful indiscretion on fischer 's part .
and for many germans , it was simply more proof of his " authenticity " that has made him both the greens ' elder statesman and a quirky public figure that could do little wrong . " he has a personality bonus , " explained richard hilmer from the public polling organization infratest / dimap .
" he 's considered a different kind of politician .
his moving background is considered convincing and authentic . " but the visa affair has battered fischer 's reputation in the eyes of many .
for the first time in three years , fischer last week lost his status as germany 's most popular politician in a regular poll by public broadcaster zdf . " he 's smacked quite a few people around and that has come back to haunt him .
there appears to be quite a bit of schadenfreude over his predicament , " dr. falter said , adding he expected fischer to survive the current scandal largely intact .
" if he makes it through this he 'll be know as the teflon minister .
nothing will stick to him . " schröder 's backing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka and gerd .
as in 2001 , schröder has once again demonstratively backed his foreign minister , saying there was no question that fischer will stay in office .
the chancellor has also expressed his desire to stand for reelection in 2006 with fischer at his side . fischer biographer ulrich even said the governing center-left coalition of social democrats and greens could possible survive with another chancellor than schröder , but that the foreign minister was indispensable . " he 's too important for the stability of the coalition , " he said , adding that because of the visa affair fischer had also become a liability .
" he wo n't fall but he 'll definitely slide a bit .
and when he sinks , he 'll pull the red-green coalition down a bit further .

democrat senator joseph biden joined in , saying that the lifting of the ban would be " a non-starter with congress " after he and lugar met with president bush in the white house . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president chen shui-bian of taiwan the warning from congress follows a rebuke from taiwan 's president chen shui-bian on tuesday when he told the eu via a video link that eu plans to lift the arms embargo endangered the military balance in east asia and accused some in europe of double standards in currying favour with beijing . he added that the planned lifting of the arms ban could also let the chinese think it did not need to proceed with democratic reforms . " should the eu decide to lift its arms embargo against china it might lead to a tilt in the military balance in the taiwan strait , which would pose a clear threat to peace and stability , " he said . bush returned from his european tour smarting from his china-related encounters with european leaders , especially the one that heralded a widely reported and embarrassing no-nonsense declaration from french president jacques chirac that europe intended to lift the ban .
the end of the embargo has been penciled in for may 8 , when the eu holds a meeting with the chinese leadership . eu must prepare a case for congress the europeans are expected to make a case to congress for acceptance of their decision by arguing that the embargo was a response to tiananmen square massacre in 1989 , and that china has moved on dramatically since then .
during his visit , bush let it be known that he was " open minded " about the lifting of the ban , but told eu leaders that they would have to convince congress . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george w bush , left , poses with european union commission president jose manual barroso , following an eu summit at the european union commission headquarters in brussels , tuesday feb .
22 , 2005 .
if they ca n't , the repairs made to the us-eu relationship during bush 's visit could come unravel . " europe can do defense trade with china or it can do defense trade with the us .
it ca n't do both , " daniel goure , a pentagon consultant and vice president of the lexington institute military think-tank , told the british guardian newspaper . europeans want discussion with us the europeans went into damage limitation mode soon after the statements from congress were issued . " it is not our intention that this change will increase the quantity or the quality of arms exports to china , " an eu commission spokeswoman told reporters .
" neither is it our intention to do anything to upset the military equilibrium in south-east asia .
there are concerns in america about high technology transfer .
we have made it clear that we want to talk to them about this . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us defense department has also made its feelings known regarding the situation .

1 , 2010 , a german city will celebrate its first day as europe 's cultural capital .
what 's still unclear , however , is which town will be able to do so as 10 cities across the country are still in the running . from lübeck in the north to karlsruhe in the south , from görlitz in the east to essen in the west , the contenders have lobbying hard to bring home the title .
whether it 's prominent supporters such as halle native and former german foreign minister hans-dietrich genscher promoting his city on posters across the country or regensburg enlisting scandalous theater director christoph schlingensief to put on an -lrb- albeit unflattering -rrb- play about the bavarian town , most have come up with ways to get some attention . on march 10 and 11 , a jury of experts will pick two cities and recommend them to germany 's upper house , the bundesrat .
the finalists will then be officially sent to brussels by the foreign ministry in the fall . to introduce you to some of germany 's finest , dw-world has put together city portraits of all the contenders .

but his serbian counterpart could n't agree less . two weeks ago , montenegro 's prime minister milo djukanovic wrote to the serbian government outlining his hopes for the future of the two nations .
his plan foresaw serbia and montenegro ending the state union of serbia and montenegro and forming independent nations , without a union parliament but with a form of federal council . although the two states would maintain a central administration in charge of economic and political affairs , they would operate separate foreign and defence policies . premature pressure the union of serbia and montenegro was voted into existence by the yugoslav parliament in 2003 .
the eu-brokered belgrade agreement marked an end to a long-drawn out constitutional crisis and was designed to remain in place for a minimum of three years , after which the two republics were to hold referendums on whether to maintain the union arrangement or vote for independence . djukanovic has made no bones about his desire to end the union and insists his proposal does not represent any breach of the agreement , even though this is supposedly valid until 2006 .
but he 's determined to forge ahead with the referendum determining whether or not the tiny republic can attain full sovereignty . " we have made our intentions clear to both our partners both in belgrade and brussels , " he said . more differences than similarities the loose union has always been seen as a provisional solution only , with its primary task billed as foreign and defense policy , while the respective republics retained autonomy regarding economic and customs issues . montenegro has adopted the euro , while serbia is holding tightly onto the dinar .
montenegro relies heavily on tourism , while serbia 's economic mainstays are agriculture and industry - differences which make a cohesive tax and customs policy impossible . and while serbia is keen to invest in its dilapidated armed forces , montenegro wants to introduce a 4000-strong professional army . on march 3 , the mandates of all the deputies in the state union parliament expire .
but with montenegro and serbia unable to reach agreement as to how new elections should be held , the mandates are expected to be extended until a solution is found . time for brussels to intervene belgrade hopes this solution will come from brussels .
eu foreign policy chief javier solana - one of the signatories of the belgrade agreement - has invited djukanovic to brussels , which has always insisted serbia and montenegro will only ever join the eu in a joint bid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schroeder and svetozar marovic many in belgrade agree .
" i believe we will have a positive feasibility study by late march , and can then begin stabilization talks with the eu and also finally join nato , " said svetozar marovic , the montenegrin president of the union of serbia-montenegro and member of djukanovic 's democratic party of socialists -lrb- pictured with gerhard schröder -rrb- . but neither marovic nor the foreign minister of serbia-montenegro , vuk draskovic , appear able to influence the two sides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a kosovo albanian family walks under an albanian flag into a polling station to vote for kosovo 's general elections in capital pristina , on saturday , oct .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.03.2005 eu probes germany 's public tv funding großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on brussels ' viewfinder : german public tv network ard european union regulators have warned germany that its funding for public television partly violates eu state aid law and urged it to set up an independent supervisory panel to ensure more transparency . european union competition commissioner neelie kroes on thursday told germany that it needed to overhaul its funding system for state-owned channels ard and zdf .
in a letter to the german government , kroes demanded more clarification on how the public networks are funded . " the commission 's preliminary view is that the current financing system is no longer in line with eu rules , " the letter read . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zdf 's star team of sports presenters the eu competition watchdogs were reacting to complaints lodged by commercial television networks in germany in 2003 that their state-funded rivals used illegal subsidies .
on thursday , kroes ' department made it clear that it considered the funding of public television in germany to amount to a sort of unlawful state subsidy which hampered free competition in several areas . apart from germany , the eu investigation has also centered on ireland and the netherlands .
on thursday , kroes dashed off similar letters to governments in dublin and amsterdam .
kroes has warned that the three eu member states needed to ensure transparency in the financing of their public television networks and make a clear distinction between their public activities and other commercial ventures such as the internet and digital tv . the commission insisted that it was n't questioning the national right of the eu 's 25 member states to set their own level of funding and public license fees as well as the objectives of their public broadcasters so long as they do not unfairly harm private sector competitors . online services under scrutiny too the eu investigation is expected to have a far-reaching effect on public broadcasters ' rights to offer online services .
among other things , germany 's commercial networks in 2003 charged that services for sale on the web sites of state-owned channels make unfair use of public money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes , eu competition commissioner kroes -lrb- photo -rrb- too is believed to have serious misgivings about the use of license fees - some € 17 -lrb- $ 22.32 -rrb- a month in germany and collected by germany 's central office for licensing fees -lrb- gez -rrb- - to fund internet services , seeing it as an illegal cross-subsidy . german public television networks ard and zdf , which were set up after the second world war to ensure pluralism after the nazi dictatorship , are now moving into sponsorship and offer a host of spin-off commercial activities on their web sites . the networks , controlled ultimately by germany 's 16 federal states , are now worried that the eu 's intervention might severely curtail their online services .
they are reported to point to these interventions as being directly contradictory to previous eu rulings upholding the right of britain 's public network bbc to go ahead with nine digital tv and radio channels or even ard 's special interest channels , phoenix and kinderkanal . while deutsche welle is part of the ard network , it is not funded by license fees but government money . ard and zdf are now said to be looking at scaling down their internet services as a precautionary measure and only provide internet content relating to their programming schedules . the bbc is also said to be worriedly watching brussels ' investigation of public networks in germany , ireland and the netherlands .
top bbc executives are reportedly in talks with their counterparts at the german broadcasters as well as eu officials over what the case might mean for them . brussels wants independent monitor kroes on thursday also demanded the setting up of an independent national authority that would monitor the upholding of transparency in the funding of public broadcasters .
she pointed out that eu members france , italy , spain and portugal had already bowed to similar eu demands in the past . germany , ireland and the netherlands will now have about four weeks to react to brussels ' letter .
kroes has already announced that brussels will drop the investigation if the three countries take the necessary steps to get their funding of public networks in order . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de media davids vs. goliath with government funding and hefty advertising revenues , public broadcasters in germany and europe have astronomically high budgets for buying olympic rights .

in a letter to the german government , kroes demanded more clarification on how the public networks are funded . " the commission 's preliminary view is that the current financing system is no longer in line with eu rules , " the letter read . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zdf 's star team of sports presenters the eu competition watchdogs were reacting to complaints lodged by commercial television networks in germany in 2003 that their state-funded rivals used illegal subsidies .
on thursday , kroes ' department made it clear that it considered the funding of public television in germany to amount to a sort of unlawful state subsidy which hampered free competition in several areas . apart from germany , the eu investigation has also centered on ireland and the netherlands .
on thursday , kroes dashed off similar letters to governments in dublin and amsterdam .
kroes has warned that the three eu member states needed to ensure transparency in the financing of their public television networks and make a clear distinction between their public activities and other commercial ventures such as the internet and digital tv . the commission insisted that it was n't questioning the national right of the eu 's 25 member states to set their own level of funding and public license fees as well as the objectives of their public broadcasters so long as they do not unfairly harm private sector competitors . online services under scrutiny too the eu investigation is expected to have a far-reaching effect on public broadcasters ' rights to offer online services .
among other things , germany 's commercial networks in 2003 charged that services for sale on the web sites of state-owned channels make unfair use of public money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes , eu competition commissioner kroes -lrb- photo -rrb- too is believed to have serious misgivings about the use of license fees - some € 17 -lrb- $ 22.32 -rrb- a month in germany and collected by germany 's central office for licensing fees -lrb- gez -rrb- - to fund internet services , seeing it as an illegal cross-subsidy . german public television networks ard and zdf , which were set up after the second world war to ensure pluralism after the nazi dictatorship , are now moving into sponsorship and offer a host of spin-off commercial activities on their web sites . the networks , controlled ultimately by germany 's 16 federal states , are now worried that the eu 's intervention might severely curtail their online services .
they are reported to point to these interventions as being directly contradictory to previous eu rulings upholding the right of britain 's public network bbc to go ahead with nine digital tv and radio channels or even ard 's special interest channels , phoenix and kinderkanal . while deutsche welle is part of the ard network , it is not funded by license fees but government money . ard and zdf are now said to be looking at scaling down their internet services as a precautionary measure and only provide internet content relating to their programming schedules . the bbc is also said to be worriedly watching brussels ' investigation of public networks in germany , ireland and the netherlands .
top bbc executives are reportedly in talks with their counterparts at the german broadcasters as well as eu officials over what the case might mean for them . brussels wants independent monitor kroes on thursday also demanded the setting up of an independent national authority that would monitor the upholding of transparency in the funding of public broadcasters .
she pointed out that eu members france , italy , spain and portugal had already bowed to similar eu demands in the past . germany , ireland and the netherlands will now have about four weeks to react to brussels ' letter .
kroes has already announced that brussels will drop the investigation if the three countries take the necessary steps to get their funding of public networks in order . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de media davids vs. goliath with government funding and hefty advertising revenues , public broadcasters in germany and europe have astronomically high budgets for buying olympic rights .

the claims were made in a leaflet last year , but could not be substantiated scientifically , the asa said .
sales of organic food have increased tenfold in the last decade , driven in part by perceived health benefits and concern over animal welfare .
the soil association told the bbc it still thinks organic food is healthier .
it says it has recently submitted new evidence to the asa which means it can now legitimately state that no other food has higher amounts of beneficial minerals and vitamins .
and it argues no other system of farming has higher levels of animal welfare standards .
debate raging the asa was responding to a complaint about the leaflet .
organic food is produced in a way that minimises the use of artificial pesticides and fertilisers , and is usually more expensive than conventionally produced food .
the soil association is the main uk body which certifies food and farming as organic , and also campaigns on the issue .
a debate has raged within the scientific community for the last few years over whether organic food can be said to be healthier .
a recent study on rats found those fed on organic fruit and vegetables were slimmer , slept better and had stronger immune systems .
and another showed organic milk had higher levels of vitamin e , omega 3 essential fatty acids and antioxidants , which help beat infections .
but many dispute the claims , saying there is insufficient evidence of any health benefits over ordinary food .

researchers looked at the incidence of autism in a japanese city before and after the withdrawal of the measles , mumps and rubella jab in 1993 .
new scientist reports autism rates kept rising after mmr was withdrawn .
michael rutter , of the institute of psychiatry , who worked on the study , said it " rubbished " the link between mmr and a general rise in autism .
however , autism campaigners said they would want to see more conclusive proof from uk-based studies before being convinced the jab was safe .
these findings are resoundingly negative in relation to the link between mmr and autism professor michael rutter , institute of psychiatry q & a : the mmr debate have your say : are you convinced ?
medical notes : autism concern over a link between the two were raised after a study by dr andrew wakefield published in the lancet in 1998 which claimed mmr might trigger autism .
however , no research has ever proved a link , and the overwhelming majority of experts believe the vaccine is safe .
despite this , rates of mmr vaccination in england have continued to fall .
in some areas , they are just over 60 % .
steady rise this study is the first to look at rates of autism after the withdrawal of the vaccine .
japan withdrew mmr after concerns that the strain of mumps vaccine it contained was linked to cases of meningitis , and replaced it with single vaccines .
mmr take-up had fallen steadily in the years prior to its removal .
have your say there was never a convincing argument of a link with autism david hazel , fareham , uk send us your comments japan 's programme targeted one-year-olds .
the proportion who received the jab fell from 69.8 % in 1988 , to 33.6 % in 1990 and just 1.8 % in 1992 .
the researchers from the yokohama rehabilitation center and the institute of psychiatry looked at the incidence of autism spectrum disorders among 31,426 children up to the age of seven born from 1988 to 1996 .
the research , also published in the journal of child psychology and psychiatry , found that the number of cases continued to rise after the mmr vaccination programme stopped .
there were between 48 cases per 10,000 children born in 1988.the rate was steadily seen to rise to 117.2 per 10,000 for those born in 1996 .
the same pattern was seen in incidence of a particular form of autism in which children appear to develop normally and then regress , which dr andrew wakefield linked to mmr .
uk research call professor rutter told the bbc news website : " if there was a true causal relationship between mmr and autism , one would have expected rates to fall after the vaccine was withdrawn .
" in fact , the rate continued to rise . "
this new research on the mmr vaccination and autism adds to the body of evidence stuart notholt national autistic society he added : " these findings are resoundingly negative in relation to the link between mmr and autism .
they rubbish the claim that mmr is having a general effect on the rate of autism . "
he said the research did not deal with the suggestion that there is a small group of children who are unusually vulnerable in whom mmr triggers autism - but there was no evidence that this was the case .
however , professor rutter said there had certainly been a rise in autism cases .
" professionals are better at picking it up .
and there has been a broadening of the definition , so it 's not just children with the most severe form of autism , but all gradients within the range of autistic disorders who are diagnosed . "
rates of mmr immunisation in the uk have fallen jean golding , professor of paediatric and perinatal epidemiology and is based in the department of clinical medicine at the university of bristol , is carrying out research into the causes of autism .
she said : " these findings are in line with all of the other research that 's been done .
i think that this is evidence that there is n't a link . "
stuart notholt , of the national autistic society added : " this new research on the mmr vaccination and autism adds to the body of evidence , most of which would support the hypothesis that there is no link between the mmr vaccination and autism . "
and stephen rooney , of sense , the national deafblind and rubella association , said : " since mmr was introduced , the number of congenital rubella births and the number of rubella-related terminations of pregnancy have both fallen dramatically . "
the department of health said the research supported its belief that mmr remained the best form of protection against measles , mumps and rubella .
but jackie fletcher of the campaign group jabs , said : " instead of relying on research carried out abroad , we would like the government to actually clinically investigate the 1,700 children believed to have been affected by the mmr jab in the uk .
" we 've all got the same objective of preventing infectious diseases .
but we also want to prevent injury to children too . "

have your say there was never a convincing argument of a link with autism david hazel , fareham , uk send us your comments japan 's programme targeted one-year-olds .
the proportion who received the jab fell from 69.8 % in 1988 , to 33.6 % in 1990 and just 1.8 % in 1992 .
the researchers from the yokohama rehabilitation center and the institute of psychiatry looked at the incidence of autism spectrum disorders among 31,426 children up to the age of seven born from 1988 to 1996 .
the research , also published in the journal of child psychology and psychiatry , found that the number of cases continued to rise after the mmr vaccination programme stopped .
there were between 48 cases per 10,000 children born in 1988.the rate was steadily seen to rise to 117.2 per 10,000 for those born in 1996 .
the same pattern was seen in incidence of a particular form of autism in which children appear to develop normally and then regress , which dr andrew wakefield linked to mmr .
uk research call professor rutter told the bbc news website : " if there was a true causal relationship between mmr and autism , one would have expected rates to fall after the vaccine was withdrawn .
" in fact , the rate continued to rise . "
this new research on the mmr vaccination and autism adds to the body of evidence stuart notholt national autistic society he added : " these findings are resoundingly negative in relation to the link between mmr and autism .
they rubbish the claim that mmr is having a general effect on the rate of autism . "
he said the research did not deal with the suggestion that there is a small group of children who are unusually vulnerable in whom mmr triggers autism - but there was no evidence that this was the case .
however , professor rutter said there had certainly been a rise in autism cases .
" professionals are better at picking it up .
and there has been a broadening of the definition , so it 's not just children with the most severe form of autism , but all gradients within the range of autistic disorders who are diagnosed . "
rates of mmr immunisation in the uk have fallen jean golding , professor of paediatric and perinatal epidemiology and is based in the department of clinical medicine at the university of bristol , is carrying out research into the causes of autism .
she said : " these findings are in line with all of the other research that 's been done .

stuart notholt , of the national autistic society added : " this new research on the mmr vaccination and autism adds to the body of evidence , most of which would support the hypothesis that there is no link between the mmr vaccination and autism . "
and stephen rooney , of sense , the national deafblind and rubella association , said : " since mmr was introduced , the number of congenital rubella births and the number of rubella-related terminations of pregnancy have both fallen dramatically . "
the department of health said the research supported its belief that mmr remained the best form of protection against measles , mumps and rubella .
but jackie fletcher of the campaign group jabs , said : " instead of relying on research carried out abroad , we would like the government to actually clinically investigate the 1,700 children believed to have been affected by the mmr jab in the uk .
" we 've all got the same objective of preventing infectious diseases .
but we also want to prevent injury to children too . "

the researchers from the yokohama rehabilitation center and the institute of psychiatry looked at the incidence of autism spectrum disorders among 31,426 children up to the age of seven born from 1988 to 1996 .
the research , also published in the journal of child psychology and psychiatry , found that the number of cases continued to rise after the mmr vaccination programme stopped .
there were between 48 cases per 10,000 children born in 1988.the rate was steadily seen to rise to 117.2 per 10,000 for those born in 1996 .
the same pattern was seen in incidence of a particular form of autism in which children appear to develop normally and then regress , which dr andrew wakefield linked to mmr .
uk research call professor rutter told the bbc news website : " if there was a true causal relationship between mmr and autism , one would have expected rates to fall after the vaccine was withdrawn .

this new research on the mmr vaccination and autism adds to the body of evidence stuart notholt national autistic society he added : " these findings are resoundingly negative in relation to the link between mmr and autism .
they rubbish the claim that mmr is having a general effect on the rate of autism . "
he said the research did not deal with the suggestion that there is a small group of children who are unusually vulnerable in whom mmr triggers autism - but there was no evidence that this was the case .
however , professor rutter said there had certainly been a rise in autism cases .
" professionals are better at picking it up .
and there has been a broadening of the definition , so it 's not just children with the most severe form of autism , but all gradients within the range of autistic disorders who are diagnosed . "
rates of mmr immunisation in the uk have fallen jean golding , professor of paediatric and perinatal epidemiology and is based in the department of clinical medicine at the university of bristol , is carrying out research into the causes of autism .
she said : " these findings are in line with all of the other research that 's been done .

stuart notholt , of the national autistic society added : " this new research on the mmr vaccination and autism adds to the body of evidence , most of which would support the hypothesis that there is no link between the mmr vaccination and autism . "
and stephen rooney , of sense , the national deafblind and rubella association , said : " since mmr was introduced , the number of congenital rubella births and the number of rubella-related terminations of pregnancy have both fallen dramatically . "
the department of health said the research supported its belief that mmr remained the best form of protection against measles , mumps and rubella .
but jackie fletcher of the campaign group jabs , said : " instead of relying on research carried out abroad , we would like the government to actually clinically investigate the 1,700 children believed to have been affected by the mmr jab in the uk .
" we 've all got the same objective of preventing infectious diseases .
but we also want to prevent injury to children too . "

it is hoped the discovery will lead to better understand of the brain disorder which disrupts reading and writing .
it is believed to be the first time a single gene linked to the condition has been identified .
the team analysed 300 families from wales and the west of england who had at least one child with dyslexia .
they isolated the gene by comparing these results with those from families who do not suffer from the condition , which affects around 5 % of the uk population .
the research will now focus on how the gene , called kiaa0319 , works within the brain to disrupt reading and writing skills .
we found there were a lot of differences coming from just one single gene prof julie williams the research has been carried out by a team from the department of psychological medicine at wales college of medicine , who described their findings as a major breakthrough .
they are looking for new volunteers to take part in their research .
professor julie williams , who led the team , told bbc wales : " we have known for a number of years there is a gene on chromosome six that confers susceptibility to develop dyslexia .
" we along with other groups throughout the world have been chasing this gene .
" we found a number of dna variants in children we tested with dyslexia and compared them with children without dyslexia .
" we found there were a lot of differences coming from just one single gene . "
ruth madoc she added : " there will probably be a number of genes as well as environmental factors that contribute to dyslexia .
" we need to find out how this gene functions and how it actually contributes to dyslexia .
" perhaps it may also tell us how it contributes to the way we process language normally , which is one of the major puzzles for neuroscience today . "
actress ruth madoc , most famous for her role in hi-he-hi and more latterly in little britain , was diagnosed with dyslexia when she was still a girl .
she said the condition caused her problems at the start of her career because she would find herself in auditions when she had to read from a script unprepared .
she said : " i would fall down at that - it would be very difficult for me . "
she said her parents " never let it be a stumbling block in any way " but she welcomed the research findings at cardiff .
" any knowledge would take away the stigma that dyslexia has , " she said .

the internationalised domain names system has been a work in progress for years and has recently been approved by the internet engineering task force .
but the uk internet forum -lrb- ukif -rrb- is concerned that the system will let scammers create fake sites more easily .
the problem lies in the computer codes used to represent language .
coding problem registering names that look like that of legitimate companies but lead users to fake sites designed to steal passwords and credit card details could become a whole lot easier for determined scammers , says stephen dyer , director of ukif .
domain names are the " real language " addresses of websites , rather than their internet protocol address , which is a series of numbers .
they are used so people can more easily navigate the web .
so-called ascii codes are used to represent european languages but for other languages a hybrid of a system called unicode is used .
so , for example , website paypal could now be coded using a mixture of the latin alphabet and the russian alphabet .
the resulting domain as displayed to the users would look identical to the real site as a russian ' a ' look just like an english ' a ' .
but the computer code would be different , and the site it would lead users to could be a fake .
this is more than just a theory .
a fake paypal.com has already been registered with net domain giant verisign by someone who has followed the debate around the internationalised domain name -lrb- idn -rrb- system , said mr dyer .
as the idea was to prove a point rather than be malicious the fake domain has now been handed back to paypal but it sets a worrying precedent , mr dyer said .
" although the idn problem is well known in technical circles , the commercial world is totally unaware how easily their websites can be faked , " said mr dyer .
no easy answers " it is important to alert users that there is a new and invisible and almost undetectable way of diverting them to what looks like a perfectly genuine site , " he added .
there are solutions .
for instance , browsers could spot domains that use mixed characters and display them in different colours as a warning to users .
mr dyer acknowledged that it would be a huge undertaking to update all the world 's browsers .
another solution , to introduce idn-disabled browsers could be a case of " throwing out the baby with the bath water , " he said .
centr , the council of european national top level domain registries , agrees .
" a rush to introduce idn-disabled browsers into the marketplace is an overly-zealous step that will harm public confidence in idns - a technology that is desperately needed in the non-english speaking world , " the organisation said in a statement .

the internationalised domain names system has been a work in progress for years and has recently been approved by the internet engineering task force .
but the uk internet forum -lrb- ukif -rrb- is concerned that the system will let scammers create fake sites more easily .
the problem lies in the computer codes used to represent language .
coding problem registering names that look like that of legitimate companies but lead users to fake sites designed to steal passwords and credit card details could become a whole lot easier for determined scammers , says stephen dyer , director of ukif .
domain names are the " real language " addresses of websites , rather than their internet protocol address , which is a series of numbers .
they are used so people can more easily navigate the web .
so-called ascii codes are used to represent european languages but for other languages a hybrid of a system called unicode is used .
so , for example , website paypal could now be coded using a mixture of the latin alphabet and the russian alphabet .
the resulting domain as displayed to the users would look identical to the real site as a russian ' a ' look just like an english ' a ' .
but the computer code would be different , and the site it would lead users to could be a fake .
this is more than just a theory .
a fake paypal.com has already been registered with net domain giant verisign by someone who has followed the debate around the internationalised domain name -lrb- idn -rrb- system , said mr dyer .
as the idea was to prove a point rather than be malicious the fake domain has now been handed back to paypal but it sets a worrying precedent , mr dyer said .
" although the idn problem is well known in technical circles , the commercial world is totally unaware how easily their websites can be faked , " said mr dyer .
no easy answers " it is important to alert users that there is a new and invisible and almost undetectable way of diverting them to what looks like a perfectly genuine site , " he added .
there are solutions .
for instance , browsers could spot domains that use mixed characters and display them in different colours as a warning to users .
mr dyer acknowledged that it would be a huge undertaking to update all the world 's browsers .
another solution , to introduce idn-disabled browsers could be a case of " throwing out the baby with the bath water , " he said .
