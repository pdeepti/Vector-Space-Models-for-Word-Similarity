bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it includes general policy measures , specific programs aimed at the prevention of drug use among young people , in the workplace and in recreational settings , as well as measures for improving access to treatment programs , both for drug use and drug-related illness .
still a widespread problem the action plan is based on the results of an annual report published by the european monitoring center for drug addiction -lrb- emcdda -rrb- in lisbon .
according to the study , drugs claimed fewer lives in 2004 , but some two million people in europe still have a problem with drug addiction .
roland simon , who worked on the emcdda report , believes the action plan is definitely a step in the right direction .
" i feel the plan has a very sound basis , " he explained .
" it 's a very sensible idea to provide prevention and treatment for people who experiment with drug consumption before they slide too deep into addiction . "
moving away from criminalization one of the main problems support schemes face is financing .
the only projects eligible for eu funding are those that promote europe-wide cooperation .
that means that an initiative such as pauke has to depend on national or even district funding .
in times of economic gloom , these subsidies are the first to feel the pinch .
even so , roland simon is convinced a pan-european drug policy makes sense .
" the advantage of a unified policy , " he said , " is that you can combine targets and develop a common approach that can be pursued on a european-wide level . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the approach that forms the cornerstone of the action plan is that drug addicts are seen as people suffering from an illness rather than criminals .
instead of putting them behind bars , the plan is to refer them to organizations such as pauke and help them return to normal life .
karl-heinz bitzer also welcomes the eu 's new strategy .
" we 're very glad to see that in the last five years there 's been a move away from criminalizing drug users , " he said .
" there 's greater tolerance of addiction and much better support structures .

the first book on the german cannibal has just been released in english .
dw-world talked to the author . germany and the world were shocked in december 2002 , when details about meiwes ' deed first emerged : he confessed to stabbing and eating 43-year-old bernd-jürgen brandes .
what disturbed people most , however , was that brandes had agreed to his slaughter and even tried to consume his own genitals before meiwes killed him . meiwes , who has never expressed remorse over what he did , was sentenced to eight years and six months in prison for manslaughter in january 2003 .
he has declined requests for interviews as he has sold his story to a german media production company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lois jones that 's why lois jones -lrb- photo -rrb- , a munich-based journalist from wales , based her book " cannibal " on interviews with friends and relatives of both men and those involved in meiwes ' trial .
the result is the most graphic and detailed account of the case published for a general audience so far . dw-world : what was your reaction when you first heard about the case ? lois jones : i was shocked , basically .
i felt what these two men did pushed far beyond the boundaries of what is acceptable .
germany is a very civilized society .
it amazed me that something like this was going on in europe in today 's world .
i did find it revolting .
i 'm quite a squeamish person and also a strict vegetarian , which made it even more disgusting or shocking for me .
i found it almost incomprehensible .
i found meiwes more revolting and brandes more disturbing : as soon as i heard about it , i was mystified and thought , " what could drive a man , a seemingly successful man , to be eaten by another ? " what made you decide to write about it ? the publisher was looking for someone to write the story - a native english speaker , working as a journalist in germany .
i always wanted to write books and thought , " maybe now is the right time to start . "
i found the subject fascinating : what would drive someone to eat a man ?
why would his victim give his consent ? what fascinated you most about the story ? three main things : first , the psychology of the two men involved .
what shocked me about both of them was that people had no idea and thought they were relatively normal individuals .
it was very hard to believe .
secondly , i 'm a strict vegetarian , i 've consciously not eaten meat for years and was interested in the question : what do people think is acceptable to eat ?
and thirdly , the fact that the people involved were perceived as quite normal , the fact that it was n't just them , but hundreds and thousands of people worldwide who are interested in cannibalism - this something that appeals to so many people . bildunterschrift : meiwes killed brandes in his house in a hamlet called wüstefeld near rotenburg in the central german state of hesse how did you go about writing the book ? i approached meiwes in prison , he wrote back a curt , type-written letter .
it was n't particularly friendly , he basically said that he would n't agree to be interviewed because he wanted to write his own book .
it was a bit of a relief .
so i talked to friends , acquaintances , people he 'd gone to school with , policemen , lawyers - anyone who had anything to do with him .
a lot of people were willing to talk about it .
neighbors were keen to talk about it because it maybe helped them understand , being able to talk about it with someone else .
i also checked out cannibal web sites and chat rooms , which were slightly disturbing , i must admit . was it difficult for you to deal with the subject for months ? it surprised me in some ways - i am a person who does get upset when i watch a horror movie , but i was able to distance myself more than i thought .
admittedly , i did find some chapters particularly gruesome .
i was n't allowed to see the video -lrb- depicting the slaughter -rrb- , but people described what happened .
that bit particularly was gruesome , detectives had to receive counseling because it was so disturbing . you include the brandes ' thoughts in your book .
where did you get that information ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd-jügen brandes it says in the front of the book that " the events in the book are real , or as close to real as humanly possible . "
a lot of it is from what meiwes told psychologists , what he said in court , and how psychologists said -lrb- brandes -rrb- would be thinking . meiwes has sold the rights to his story .
how do you feel about that ? in his letter , meiwes told me that if i were interested in being a ghost writer for his autobiography , i should apply to his lawyer .
i did n't want to do that .
i do n't think it 's quite right that he should be making money out of what he 's done .
it 's not helping him at all - here 's someone who needs help and it 's only going to fuel his ego .
he has stated that he no longer feels the need to eat another man .
but before he was caught by police , he was looking around for other victims , which indicates that he has n't gotten over this urge .
there are fans , web sites on the internet that are dedicated to him .
in a way this could encourage people out there who have similar tendencies to actually carry them out . is n't your book also helping to promote his celebrity ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : book cover - lois jones : " cannibal " what i tried to write was an objective view of what happened and not glorify what he 's done .
my book was trying to be more , look , this is what happened . your book came out as a mass-market edition , which is also sold in supermarkets in the us .
it is very graphic at times .
would you have written it differently if you 'd written it for a different publication ? the publishers were certainly keen for it to be written the way it was .
they were very liberal in giving me a free reign , but i probably would have written it a little less gruesome . do you think you 'll write another true crime book ? i think i could , but i do n't solely want to write them .

the first book on the german cannibal has just been released in english .
dw-world talked to the author . germany and the world were shocked in december 2002 , when details about meiwes ' deed first emerged : he confessed to stabbing and eating 43-year-old bernd-jürgen brandes .
what disturbed people most , however , was that brandes had agreed to his slaughter and even tried to consume his own genitals before meiwes killed him . meiwes , who has never expressed remorse over what he did , was sentenced to eight years and six months in prison for manslaughter in january 2003 .
he has declined requests for interviews as he has sold his story to a german media production company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lois jones that 's why lois jones -lrb- photo -rrb- , a munich-based journalist from wales , based her book " cannibal " on interviews with friends and relatives of both men and those involved in meiwes ' trial .
the result is the most graphic and detailed account of the case published for a general audience so far . dw-world : what was your reaction when you first heard about the case ? lois jones : i was shocked , basically .
i felt what these two men did pushed far beyond the boundaries of what is acceptable .
germany is a very civilized society .
it amazed me that something like this was going on in europe in today 's world .
i did find it revolting .
i 'm quite a squeamish person and also a strict vegetarian , which made it even more disgusting or shocking for me .
i found it almost incomprehensible .
i found meiwes more revolting and brandes more disturbing : as soon as i heard about it , i was mystified and thought , " what could drive a man , a seemingly successful man , to be eaten by another ? " what made you decide to write about it ? the publisher was looking for someone to write the story - a native english speaker , working as a journalist in germany .
i always wanted to write books and thought , " maybe now is the right time to start . "
i found the subject fascinating : what would drive someone to eat a man ?
why would his victim give his consent ? what fascinated you most about the story ? three main things : first , the psychology of the two men involved .
what shocked me about both of them was that people had no idea and thought they were relatively normal individuals .
it was very hard to believe .
secondly , i 'm a strict vegetarian , i 've consciously not eaten meat for years and was interested in the question : what do people think is acceptable to eat ?
and thirdly , the fact that the people involved were perceived as quite normal , the fact that it was n't just them , but hundreds and thousands of people worldwide who are interested in cannibalism - this something that appeals to so many people . bildunterschrift : meiwes killed brandes in his house in a hamlet called wüstefeld near rotenburg in the central german state of hesse how did you go about writing the book ? i approached meiwes in prison , he wrote back a curt , type-written letter .
it was n't particularly friendly , he basically said that he would n't agree to be interviewed because he wanted to write his own book .
it was a bit of a relief .
so i talked to friends , acquaintances , people he 'd gone to school with , policemen , lawyers - anyone who had anything to do with him .
a lot of people were willing to talk about it .
neighbors were keen to talk about it because it maybe helped them understand , being able to talk about it with someone else .
i also checked out cannibal web sites and chat rooms , which were slightly disturbing , i must admit . was it difficult for you to deal with the subject for months ? it surprised me in some ways - i am a person who does get upset when i watch a horror movie , but i was able to distance myself more than i thought .
admittedly , i did find some chapters particularly gruesome .
i was n't allowed to see the video -lrb- depicting the slaughter -rrb- , but people described what happened .
that bit particularly was gruesome , detectives had to receive counseling because it was so disturbing . you include the brandes ' thoughts in your book .
where did you get that information ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd-jügen brandes it says in the front of the book that " the events in the book are real , or as close to real as humanly possible . "
a lot of it is from what meiwes told psychologists , what he said in court , and how psychologists said -lrb- brandes -rrb- would be thinking . meiwes has sold the rights to his story .
how do you feel about that ? in his letter , meiwes told me that if i were interested in being a ghost writer for his autobiography , i should apply to his lawyer .
i did n't want to do that .
i do n't think it 's quite right that he should be making money out of what he 's done .
it 's not helping him at all - here 's someone who needs help and it 's only going to fuel his ego .
he has stated that he no longer feels the need to eat another man .
but before he was caught by police , he was looking around for other victims , which indicates that he has n't gotten over this urge .
there are fans , web sites on the internet that are dedicated to him .
in a way this could encourage people out there who have similar tendencies to actually carry them out . is n't your book also helping to promote his celebrity ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : book cover - lois jones : " cannibal " what i tried to write was an objective view of what happened and not glorify what he 's done .
my book was trying to be more , look , this is what happened . your book came out as a mass-market edition , which is also sold in supermarkets in the us .
it is very graphic at times .
would you have written it differently if you 'd written it for a different publication ? the publishers were certainly keen for it to be written the way it was .
they were very liberal in giving me a free reign , but i probably would have written it a little less gruesome . do you think you 'll write another true crime book ? i think i could , but i do n't solely want to write them .
right now i 'm writing a book about -lrb- british discount airline -rrb- easyjet .
that 's a bit less gruesome . mathis winkler interviewed lois jones send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cannibal convicted of manslaughter one of the most sensational trials in german legal history ended on friday when judges convicted self-confessed cannibal , armin meiwes , to eight years and six months in prison .

" that view is shared by 42 percent in the 10 new states which joined the union last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people enter europe illegally by ship across the bloc , nearly half of the population opposed granting legal immigrants full civil rights .
but beate winkler , head of the vienna-based european monitoring center on racism and xenophobia , eumc , says that the majority of citizens are happy to live in multi-ethnic communities .
onus on governments the eumc encourages governments to introduce appropriate policies to help avoid hostilities and potential for conflict .
however , winkler asserted that some governments have either failed to address the problems or even deny that they exist .
“ of course , you must be very concerned about negative attitudes because violence almost always starts with words , ” she said winkler said the picture of xenophobia in europe is full of contradictions , adding that attitudes can be influenced strongly by good political leadership .
one apparent contradiction is that while 50 percent of europeans " have resistance to immigrants " only 30 percent say they don ’ t want asylum seekers in their country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the survey revealed resistance to immigration in rural areas the survey shows that poor or poorly educated people are " more likely to display negative attitudes towards minorities . ” and it reflects that people from rural areas tend to be more hostile to immigration , despite the fact that most immigrants live in cities . shaye hoobanoff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government says immigrant wave receding in germany immigration into germany in the year 2003 , for the first time in many decades , dropped below 800,000 as the influx of foreigners throughout the 1990s has receded , according to government statistics released on monday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.03.2005 canvassing a cannibal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meiwes has never shown remorse for his crime armin meiwes , who admittedly killed and ate another man , made headlines around the world .
the first book on the german cannibal has just been released in english .
dw-world talked to the author . germany and the world were shocked in december 2002 , when details about meiwes ' deed first emerged : he confessed to stabbing and eating 43-year-old bernd-jürgen brandes .
what disturbed people most , however , was that brandes had agreed to his slaughter and even tried to consume his own genitals before meiwes killed him . meiwes , who has never expressed remorse over what he did , was sentenced to eight years and six months in prison for manslaughter in january 2003 .
he has declined requests for interviews as he has sold his story to a german media production company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lois jones that 's why lois jones -lrb- photo -rrb- , a munich-based journalist from wales , based her book " cannibal " on interviews with friends and relatives of both men and those involved in meiwes ' trial .
the result is the most graphic and detailed account of the case published for a general audience so far . dw-world : what was your reaction when you first heard about the case ? lois jones : i was shocked , basically .
i felt what these two men did pushed far beyond the boundaries of what is acceptable .
germany is a very civilized society .
it amazed me that something like this was going on in europe in today 's world .
i did find it revolting .
i 'm quite a squeamish person and also a strict vegetarian , which made it even more disgusting or shocking for me .
i found it almost incomprehensible .
i found meiwes more revolting and brandes more disturbing : as soon as i heard about it , i was mystified and thought , " what could drive a man , a seemingly successful man , to be eaten by another ? " what made you decide to write about it ? the publisher was looking for someone to write the story - a native english speaker , working as a journalist in germany .
i always wanted to write books and thought , " maybe now is the right time to start . "
i found the subject fascinating : what would drive someone to eat a man ?
why would his victim give his consent ? what fascinated you most about the story ? three main things : first , the psychology of the two men involved .
what shocked me about both of them was that people had no idea and thought they were relatively normal individuals .
it was very hard to believe .
secondly , i 'm a strict vegetarian , i 've consciously not eaten meat for years and was interested in the question : what do people think is acceptable to eat ?
and thirdly , the fact that the people involved were perceived as quite normal , the fact that it was n't just them , but hundreds and thousands of people worldwide who are interested in cannibalism - this something that appeals to so many people . bildunterschrift : meiwes killed brandes in his house in a hamlet called wüstefeld near rotenburg in the central german state of hesse how did you go about writing the book ? i approached meiwes in prison , he wrote back a curt , type-written letter .
it was n't particularly friendly , he basically said that he would n't agree to be interviewed because he wanted to write his own book .
it was a bit of a relief .
so i talked to friends , acquaintances , people he 'd gone to school with , policemen , lawyers - anyone who had anything to do with him .
a lot of people were willing to talk about it .
neighbors were keen to talk about it because it maybe helped them understand , being able to talk about it with someone else .
i also checked out cannibal web sites and chat rooms , which were slightly disturbing , i must admit . was it difficult for you to deal with the subject for months ? it surprised me in some ways - i am a person who does get upset when i watch a horror movie , but i was able to distance myself more than i thought .
admittedly , i did find some chapters particularly gruesome .
i was n't allowed to see the video -lrb- depicting the slaughter -rrb- , but people described what happened .
that bit particularly was gruesome , detectives had to receive counseling because it was so disturbing . you include the brandes ' thoughts in your book .
where did you get that information ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd-jügen brandes it says in the front of the book that " the events in the book are real , or as close to real as humanly possible . "
a lot of it is from what meiwes told psychologists , what he said in court , and how psychologists said -lrb- brandes -rrb- would be thinking . meiwes has sold the rights to his story .
how do you feel about that ? in his letter , meiwes told me that if i were interested in being a ghost writer for his autobiography , i should apply to his lawyer .
i did n't want to do that .
i do n't think it 's quite right that he should be making money out of what he 's done .
it 's not helping him at all - here 's someone who needs help and it 's only going to fuel his ego .
he has stated that he no longer feels the need to eat another man .
but before he was caught by police , he was looking around for other victims , which indicates that he has n't gotten over this urge .
there are fans , web sites on the internet that are dedicated to him .
in a way this could encourage people out there who have similar tendencies to actually carry them out . is n't your book also helping to promote his celebrity ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : book cover - lois jones : " cannibal " what i tried to write was an objective view of what happened and not glorify what he 's done .
my book was trying to be more , look , this is what happened . your book came out as a mass-market edition , which is also sold in supermarkets in the us .
it is very graphic at times .
would you have written it differently if you 'd written it for a different publication ? the publishers were certainly keen for it to be written the way it was .
they were very liberal in giving me a free reign , but i probably would have written it a little less gruesome . do you think you 'll write another true crime book ? i think i could , but i do n't solely want to write them .
right now i 'm writing a book about -lrb- british discount airline -rrb- easyjet .
that 's a bit less gruesome . mathis winkler interviewed lois jones send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cannibal convicted of manslaughter one of the most sensational trials in german legal history ended on friday when judges convicted self-confessed cannibal , armin meiwes , to eight years and six months in prison .

" i think the talks , which we conducted in an incredibly civil manner , prove that there are certain similarities .

as the third summit of interior ministers and high-ranking government officials from the 46-member council of europe enters its last day in warsaw , talks continue to focus on tackling terrorism and organized crime . polish president aleksander kwasniewski warned council of europe member states friday against paralyzing democracy in the fight against organised crime and terrorism . " we must be careful to avoid that the fight against terrorism and organized crime do not paralyze the smooth functioning of a normal democratic society .
we must not lose what constitutes the basis of a democratic society , " said kwasniewski , whose country has chaired the council 's committee of ministers since november . " given that criminal activity transcends national borders , we must reinforce cooperation among our intelligence services and better control the flow of people and merchandise , " kwasniewski told the meeting in warsaw .
but he stressed that any moves to clamp down on organized crime and terrorism must be taken with respect for individual freedoms . developing strategies ministerial-level meetings at the conference are being held behind closed doors and are focussing on special investigative techniques , the protection of witnesses , money laundering and the financing of terrorism . the officials are also debating two draft conventions aimed at nipping in the bud terrorism and other forms of serious crime in the early , preparative stages . the draft convention on the prevention of terrorism proposes criminalizing acts deemed as laying the groundwork for a terrorist attack , such as provocation of terrorism , recruitment and training . " we ca n't wait for another madrid " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british member of the council of europe terry davis , points the scoreboard after being elected as new secretary general of the council of europe , tuesday , june 22 , 2004 in strasbourg , eastern france .
terry davis will replace austria 's walter schwimmer for the next five years .
-lrb- ap photo / christian lutz -rrb- on thursday , the council 's secretary general terry davis -lrb- photo -rrb- urged delegates to move quickly and decisively against terrorism . " we ca n't wait for another madrid or beslan , " he said , calling on delegates " to provide a message of support for the new instruments " being debated at the two-day meeting . more than 340 people died , half of them children , when a standoff between law enforcement authorities and hostage-takers who had herded more than 1,000 students and teachers into a school in the southern russian town of beslan last september ended in a chaotic shootout . the bombing of four madrid commuter trains on march 11 last year killed 191 people and injured over 1,900 . fleshing out the anti-terror convention negotiating the terms of the anti-terror convention , expected to be ready by may , showed " how difficult it can be to enhance the efficiency of the fight against terrorism at the same time as safeguarding fundamental human rights , " said davis , a former british lawmaker .
" but it has also shown that it is possible to reconcile these twin objectives . " " terrorism is an attack on human rights , " he went on .
" however , while tackling terrorism , we must be careful not to undermine human rights , " he said . davis said he expected recommendations on the topics debated by the conference as well as the new conventions to be adopted by the end of the month .
they will then be presented to a summit of council of europe heads of state and government due to be held in warsaw in may . in addition to its 46 members , five states which have observer status on the council of europe were also represented at the meeting : canada , japan , mexico , the united states and the vatican . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a day of infamy in spain after a series of explosions in madrid killed close to 200 people and wounded more than 1,400 , spanish officials are still uncertain who is behind the worst terrorist attack in the country 's history . -lrb- march 12 , 2004 -rrb- madrid hosts anti-terror summit an international symposium on the fight against terrorism begins in madrid on tuesday , a year on from the devastating bombings which ripped through the spanish capital on march 11 , 2004 . -lrb- march 8 , 2005 -rrb- british labor mp elected to head council of europe british labor parliamentarian terry davis beat out two other candidates to be elected the new secretary general of europe 's top human rights organization , the 45-nation council of europe . -lrb- june 23 , 2004 -rrb- feedback do you think the fight against terror risks undermining human rights ?

the first book on the german cannibal has just been released in english .
dw-world talked to the author . germany and the world were shocked in december 2002 , when details about meiwes ' deed first emerged : he confessed to stabbing and eating 43-year-old bernd-jürgen brandes .
what disturbed people most , however , was that brandes had agreed to his slaughter and even tried to consume his own genitals before meiwes killed him . meiwes , who has never expressed remorse over what he did , was sentenced to eight years and six months in prison for manslaughter in january 2003 .
he has declined requests for interviews as he has sold his story to a german media production company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lois jones that 's why lois jones -lrb- photo -rrb- , a munich-based journalist from wales , based her book " cannibal " on interviews with friends and relatives of both men and those involved in meiwes ' trial .
the result is the most graphic and detailed account of the case published for a general audience so far . dw-world : what was your reaction when you first heard about the case ? lois jones : i was shocked , basically .
i felt what these two men did pushed far beyond the boundaries of what is acceptable .
germany is a very civilized society .
it amazed me that something like this was going on in europe in today 's world .
i did find it revolting .
i 'm quite a squeamish person and also a strict vegetarian , which made it even more disgusting or shocking for me .
i found it almost incomprehensible .
i found meiwes more revolting and brandes more disturbing : as soon as i heard about it , i was mystified and thought , " what could drive a man , a seemingly successful man , to be eaten by another ? " what made you decide to write about it ? the publisher was looking for someone to write the story - a native english speaker , working as a journalist in germany .
i always wanted to write books and thought , " maybe now is the right time to start . "
i found the subject fascinating : what would drive someone to eat a man ?
why would his victim give his consent ? what fascinated you most about the story ? three main things : first , the psychology of the two men involved .
what shocked me about both of them was that people had no idea and thought they were relatively normal individuals .
it was very hard to believe .
secondly , i 'm a strict vegetarian , i 've consciously not eaten meat for years and was interested in the question : what do people think is acceptable to eat ?
and thirdly , the fact that the people involved were perceived as quite normal , the fact that it was n't just them , but hundreds and thousands of people worldwide who are interested in cannibalism - this something that appeals to so many people . bildunterschrift : meiwes killed brandes in his house in a hamlet called wüstefeld near rotenburg in the central german state of hesse how did you go about writing the book ? i approached meiwes in prison , he wrote back a curt , type-written letter .
it was n't particularly friendly , he basically said that he would n't agree to be interviewed because he wanted to write his own book .
it was a bit of a relief .
so i talked to friends , acquaintances , people he 'd gone to school with , policemen , lawyers - anyone who had anything to do with him .
a lot of people were willing to talk about it .
neighbors were keen to talk about it because it maybe helped them understand , being able to talk about it with someone else .
i also checked out cannibal web sites and chat rooms , which were slightly disturbing , i must admit . was it difficult for you to deal with the subject for months ? it surprised me in some ways - i am a person who does get upset when i watch a horror movie , but i was able to distance myself more than i thought .
admittedly , i did find some chapters particularly gruesome .
i was n't allowed to see the video -lrb- depicting the slaughter -rrb- , but people described what happened .
that bit particularly was gruesome , detectives had to receive counseling because it was so disturbing . you include the brandes ' thoughts in your book .
where did you get that information ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd-jügen brandes it says in the front of the book that " the events in the book are real , or as close to real as humanly possible . "
a lot of it is from what meiwes told psychologists , what he said in court , and how psychologists said -lrb- brandes -rrb- would be thinking . meiwes has sold the rights to his story .
how do you feel about that ? in his letter , meiwes told me that if i were interested in being a ghost writer for his autobiography , i should apply to his lawyer .
i did n't want to do that .
i do n't think it 's quite right that he should be making money out of what he 's done .
it 's not helping him at all - here 's someone who needs help and it 's only going to fuel his ego .
he has stated that he no longer feels the need to eat another man .
but before he was caught by police , he was looking around for other victims , which indicates that he has n't gotten over this urge .
there are fans , web sites on the internet that are dedicated to him .
in a way this could encourage people out there who have similar tendencies to actually carry them out . is n't your book also helping to promote his celebrity ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : book cover - lois jones : " cannibal " what i tried to write was an objective view of what happened and not glorify what he 's done .
my book was trying to be more , look , this is what happened . your book came out as a mass-market edition , which is also sold in supermarkets in the us .
it is very graphic at times .
would you have written it differently if you 'd written it for a different publication ? the publishers were certainly keen for it to be written the way it was .
they were very liberal in giving me a free reign , but i probably would have written it a little less gruesome . do you think you 'll write another true crime book ? i think i could , but i do n't solely want to write them .
right now i 'm writing a book about -lrb- british discount airline -rrb- easyjet .

the positive noises emanating from the summit suggested harmony but critics complained of issues swept under the carpet . russian president vladimir putin on friday was given a friendly reception by the leaders of france , germany and spain when they met for informal talks aimed at bolstering recently strained ties between moscow and the european union . french president jacques chirac invited german chancellor gerhard schröder and spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero to his elysee palace for the first-ever such meeting , after holding bilateral talks with putin . at a press conference after the 90-minute four-way session , the leaders said it had been a useful preparation for an eu-russian summit due in may .
" france , germany , spain and russia see in this relationship a way of ensuring ... the definitive establishment of peace , democracy and the rule of law across the whole of our continent , " chirac said . among the issues under discussion were the so-called four " common spaces " meant to guide eu-russian ties through 2007 - the economy , justice and internal security , external security , and education and culture , chirac said .
the leaders also touched on international affairs , including kosovo , iran , the middle east peace process , iraq and lebanon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder was welcomed by chirac on friday all four leaders were in agreement that iran should be prevented from developing nuclear weapons .
" we are working very closely on the iran question , " schröder said , dismissing any suggestion of differences even though russia has been supplying tehran with nuclear technology , saying it is for civilian purposes .
president chirac added that " there is no contradiction between the russian position and that of france and germany " when it came to iran . the leaders also agreed on a collective stand in favor of a complete withdrawal of syrian forces from lebanon .
" we have adopted a joint statement on lebanon , a communiqué , which , like the whole international community , insists on the compelling necessity to implement resolution 1559 , " chirac told the press conference , referring to united nations resolution 1559 which calls for a withdrawal which france co-sponsored with the united states .
putin 's agreement on the subject was particularly telling due to russia 's long-standing links with damascus . there was also unanimous agreement to maintain good contacts with the united states but chirac said the eu was " clearly for lifting the embargo " on arms sales to china .
washington wants the ban to remain . in keeping with all the positive news , which included an announcement that the four countries would meet again in the next two months , there was no explicit acknowledgement of the widespread international criticism of putin for flouting democratic norms in his handling of the chechen war , the press and business , as well as in his relations with ukraine and the baltic states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder , zapatero and chirac during a meeting in september 2004 in madrid zapatero said that in russia as elsewhere the best way to fight terrorism was " the force of reason , the force of the rule of law and international cooperation . " last month us president george w. bush publicly criticized russia 's democratic shortcomings at a meeting with putin in bratislava , indicating a new chill in the us-russian relationship . aides to chirac said the purpose of the informal gathering was to " hold out the hand of friendship to putin " to encourage him down the path of political and economic reforms . putin was making his first visit to the french capital since november 2003 , but he and chirac have seen each other several times in the interim - in 2004 at d-day commemorations in normandy and at the g8 summit , and in january at ceremonies marking the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz . the two presidents met with 35 russian writers attending the just-opened paris book fair - deemed safer than a visit to the fair itself , where putin could have faced protestors . after a private lunch , chirac accompanied putin on a visit to an air force base outside the capital , a gesture of reciprocity after the russian president took chirac to see a top secret russian space center last april . putin , chirac and schröder first forged their alliance two years ago when they spearheaded opposition to the us-led war in iraq .
chirac invited zapatero , whom he sees as a new ally in the european union , to join the group . but the meeting risked annoying leaders elsewhere in europe - notably in poland and the baltics - where any franco-german effort to set the agenda for the eu 's relations with russia would be strongly opposed . chirac 's office said other countries - and the european commission in brussels - should not feel slighted , as it was important to encourage all kinds of links with moscow . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin says he 's ready to talk in germany for a two-day visit , vladimir putin said he 's ready to work with the eu about the chechnya conflict and is prepared to answer questions about delicate subjects like ukraine and press freedom .

the first book on the german cannibal has just been released in english .
dw-world talked to the author . germany and the world were shocked in december 2002 , when details about meiwes ' deed first emerged : he confessed to stabbing and eating 43-year-old bernd-jürgen brandes .
what disturbed people most , however , was that brandes had agreed to his slaughter and even tried to consume his own genitals before meiwes killed him . meiwes , who has never expressed remorse over what he did , was sentenced to eight years and six months in prison for manslaughter in january 2003 .
he has declined requests for interviews as he has sold his story to a german media production company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lois jones that 's why lois jones -lrb- photo -rrb- , a munich-based journalist from wales , based her book " cannibal " on interviews with friends and relatives of both men and those involved in meiwes ' trial .
the result is the most graphic and detailed account of the case published for a general audience so far . dw-world : what was your reaction when you first heard about the case ? lois jones : i was shocked , basically .
i felt what these two men did pushed far beyond the boundaries of what is acceptable .
germany is a very civilized society .
it amazed me that something like this was going on in europe in today 's world .
i did find it revolting .
i 'm quite a squeamish person and also a strict vegetarian , which made it even more disgusting or shocking for me .
i found it almost incomprehensible .
i found meiwes more revolting and brandes more disturbing : as soon as i heard about it , i was mystified and thought , " what could drive a man , a seemingly successful man , to be eaten by another ? " what made you decide to write about it ? the publisher was looking for someone to write the story - a native english speaker , working as a journalist in germany .
i always wanted to write books and thought , " maybe now is the right time to start . "
i found the subject fascinating : what would drive someone to eat a man ?
why would his victim give his consent ? what fascinated you most about the story ? three main things : first , the psychology of the two men involved .
what shocked me about both of them was that people had no idea and thought they were relatively normal individuals .
it was very hard to believe .
secondly , i 'm a strict vegetarian , i 've consciously not eaten meat for years and was interested in the question : what do people think is acceptable to eat ?
and thirdly , the fact that the people involved were perceived as quite normal , the fact that it was n't just them , but hundreds and thousands of people worldwide who are interested in cannibalism - this something that appeals to so many people . bildunterschrift : meiwes killed brandes in his house in a hamlet called wüstefeld near rotenburg in the central german state of hesse how did you go about writing the book ? i approached meiwes in prison , he wrote back a curt , type-written letter .
it was n't particularly friendly , he basically said that he would n't agree to be interviewed because he wanted to write his own book .
it was a bit of a relief .
so i talked to friends , acquaintances , people he 'd gone to school with , policemen , lawyers - anyone who had anything to do with him .
a lot of people were willing to talk about it .
neighbors were keen to talk about it because it maybe helped them understand , being able to talk about it with someone else .
i also checked out cannibal web sites and chat rooms , which were slightly disturbing , i must admit . was it difficult for you to deal with the subject for months ? it surprised me in some ways - i am a person who does get upset when i watch a horror movie , but i was able to distance myself more than i thought .
admittedly , i did find some chapters particularly gruesome .
i was n't allowed to see the video -lrb- depicting the slaughter -rrb- , but people described what happened .
that bit particularly was gruesome , detectives had to receive counseling because it was so disturbing . you include the brandes ' thoughts in your book .
where did you get that information ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd-jügen brandes it says in the front of the book that " the events in the book are real , or as close to real as humanly possible . "
a lot of it is from what meiwes told psychologists , what he said in court , and how psychologists said -lrb- brandes -rrb- would be thinking . meiwes has sold the rights to his story .
how do you feel about that ? in his letter , meiwes told me that if i were interested in being a ghost writer for his autobiography , i should apply to his lawyer .
i did n't want to do that .
i do n't think it 's quite right that he should be making money out of what he 's done .
it 's not helping him at all - here 's someone who needs help and it 's only going to fuel his ego .
he has stated that he no longer feels the need to eat another man .
but before he was caught by police , he was looking around for other victims , which indicates that he has n't gotten over this urge .
there are fans , web sites on the internet that are dedicated to him .
in a way this could encourage people out there who have similar tendencies to actually carry them out . is n't your book also helping to promote his celebrity ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : book cover - lois jones : " cannibal " what i tried to write was an objective view of what happened and not glorify what he 's done .
my book was trying to be more , look , this is what happened . your book came out as a mass-market edition , which is also sold in supermarkets in the us .
it is very graphic at times .
would you have written it differently if you 'd written it for a different publication ? the publishers were certainly keen for it to be written the way it was .
they were very liberal in giving me a free reign , but i probably would have written it a little less gruesome . do you think you 'll write another true crime book ? i think i could , but i do n't solely want to write them .
right now i 'm writing a book about -lrb- british discount airline -rrb- easyjet .
that 's a bit less gruesome . mathis winkler interviewed lois jones send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cannibal convicted of manslaughter one of the most sensational trials in german legal history ended on friday when judges convicted self-confessed cannibal , armin meiwes , to eight years and six months in prison .

the first book on the german cannibal has just been released in english .
dw-world talked to the author . germany and the world were shocked in december 2002 , when details about meiwes ' deed first emerged : he confessed to stabbing and eating 43-year-old bernd-jürgen brandes .
what disturbed people most , however , was that brandes had agreed to his slaughter and even tried to consume his own genitals before meiwes killed him . meiwes , who has never expressed remorse over what he did , was sentenced to eight years and six months in prison for manslaughter in january 2003 .
he has declined requests for interviews as he has sold his story to a german media production company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lois jones that 's why lois jones -lrb- photo -rrb- , a munich-based journalist from wales , based her book " cannibal " on interviews with friends and relatives of both men and those involved in meiwes ' trial .
the result is the most graphic and detailed account of the case published for a general audience so far . dw-world : what was your reaction when you first heard about the case ? lois jones : i was shocked , basically .
i felt what these two men did pushed far beyond the boundaries of what is acceptable .
germany is a very civilized society .
it amazed me that something like this was going on in europe in today 's world .
i did find it revolting .
i 'm quite a squeamish person and also a strict vegetarian , which made it even more disgusting or shocking for me .
i found it almost incomprehensible .
i found meiwes more revolting and brandes more disturbing : as soon as i heard about it , i was mystified and thought , " what could drive a man , a seemingly successful man , to be eaten by another ? " what made you decide to write about it ? the publisher was looking for someone to write the story - a native english speaker , working as a journalist in germany .
i always wanted to write books and thought , " maybe now is the right time to start . "
i found the subject fascinating : what would drive someone to eat a man ?
why would his victim give his consent ? what fascinated you most about the story ? three main things : first , the psychology of the two men involved .
what shocked me about both of them was that people had no idea and thought they were relatively normal individuals .
it was very hard to believe .
secondly , i 'm a strict vegetarian , i 've consciously not eaten meat for years and was interested in the question : what do people think is acceptable to eat ?
and thirdly , the fact that the people involved were perceived as quite normal , the fact that it was n't just them , but hundreds and thousands of people worldwide who are interested in cannibalism - this something that appeals to so many people . bildunterschrift : meiwes killed brandes in his house in a hamlet called wüstefeld near rotenburg in the central german state of hesse how did you go about writing the book ? i approached meiwes in prison , he wrote back a curt , type-written letter .
it was n't particularly friendly , he basically said that he would n't agree to be interviewed because he wanted to write his own book .
it was a bit of a relief .
so i talked to friends , acquaintances , people he 'd gone to school with , policemen , lawyers - anyone who had anything to do with him .
a lot of people were willing to talk about it .
neighbors were keen to talk about it because it maybe helped them understand , being able to talk about it with someone else .
i also checked out cannibal web sites and chat rooms , which were slightly disturbing , i must admit . was it difficult for you to deal with the subject for months ? it surprised me in some ways - i am a person who does get upset when i watch a horror movie , but i was able to distance myself more than i thought .
admittedly , i did find some chapters particularly gruesome .
i was n't allowed to see the video -lrb- depicting the slaughter -rrb- , but people described what happened .
that bit particularly was gruesome , detectives had to receive counseling because it was so disturbing . you include the brandes ' thoughts in your book .
where did you get that information ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd-jügen brandes it says in the front of the book that " the events in the book are real , or as close to real as humanly possible . "
a lot of it is from what meiwes told psychologists , what he said in court , and how psychologists said -lrb- brandes -rrb- would be thinking . meiwes has sold the rights to his story .
how do you feel about that ? in his letter , meiwes told me that if i were interested in being a ghost writer for his autobiography , i should apply to his lawyer .
i did n't want to do that .
i do n't think it 's quite right that he should be making money out of what he 's done .
it 's not helping him at all - here 's someone who needs help and it 's only going to fuel his ego .
he has stated that he no longer feels the need to eat another man .
but before he was caught by police , he was looking around for other victims , which indicates that he has n't gotten over this urge .
there are fans , web sites on the internet that are dedicated to him .
in a way this could encourage people out there who have similar tendencies to actually carry them out . is n't your book also helping to promote his celebrity ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : book cover - lois jones : " cannibal " what i tried to write was an objective view of what happened and not glorify what he 's done .
my book was trying to be more , look , this is what happened . your book came out as a mass-market edition , which is also sold in supermarkets in the us .
it is very graphic at times .
would you have written it differently if you 'd written it for a different publication ? the publishers were certainly keen for it to be written the way it was .
they were very liberal in giving me a free reign , but i probably would have written it a little less gruesome . do you think you 'll write another true crime book ? i think i could , but i do n't solely want to write them .
right now i 'm writing a book about -lrb- british discount airline -rrb- easyjet .
that 's a bit less gruesome . mathis winkler interviewed lois jones send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cannibal convicted of manslaughter one of the most sensational trials in german legal history ended on friday when judges convicted self-confessed cannibal , armin meiwes , to eight years and six months in prison .

" that view is shared by 42 percent in the 10 new states which joined the union last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people enter europe illegally by ship across the bloc , nearly half of the population opposed granting legal immigrants full civil rights .
but beate winkler , head of the vienna-based european monitoring center on racism and xenophobia , eumc , says that the majority of citizens are happy to live in multi-ethnic communities .
onus on governments the eumc encourages governments to introduce appropriate policies to help avoid hostilities and potential for conflict .
however , winkler asserted that some governments have either failed to address the problems or even deny that they exist .
“ of course , you must be very concerned about negative attitudes because violence almost always starts with words , ” she said winkler said the picture of xenophobia in europe is full of contradictions , adding that attitudes can be influenced strongly by good political leadership .
one apparent contradiction is that while 50 percent of europeans " have resistance to immigrants " only 30 percent say they don ’ t want asylum seekers in their country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the survey revealed resistance to immigration in rural areas the survey shows that poor or poorly educated people are " more likely to display negative attitudes towards minorities . ” and it reflects that people from rural areas tend to be more hostile to immigration , despite the fact that most immigrants live in cities . shaye hoobanoff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government says immigrant wave receding in germany immigration into germany in the year 2003 , for the first time in many decades , dropped below 800,000 as the influx of foreigners throughout the 1990s has receded , according to government statistics released on monday .

as the third summit of interior ministers and high-ranking government officials from the 46-member council of europe enters its last day in warsaw , talks continue to focus on tackling terrorism and organized crime . polish president aleksander kwasniewski warned council of europe member states friday against paralyzing democracy in the fight against organised crime and terrorism . " we must be careful to avoid that the fight against terrorism and organized crime do not paralyze the smooth functioning of a normal democratic society .
we must not lose what constitutes the basis of a democratic society , " said kwasniewski , whose country has chaired the council 's committee of ministers since november . " given that criminal activity transcends national borders , we must reinforce cooperation among our intelligence services and better control the flow of people and merchandise , " kwasniewski told the meeting in warsaw .
but he stressed that any moves to clamp down on organized crime and terrorism must be taken with respect for individual freedoms . developing strategies ministerial-level meetings at the conference are being held behind closed doors and are focussing on special investigative techniques , the protection of witnesses , money laundering and the financing of terrorism . the officials are also debating two draft conventions aimed at nipping in the bud terrorism and other forms of serious crime in the early , preparative stages . the draft convention on the prevention of terrorism proposes criminalizing acts deemed as laying the groundwork for a terrorist attack , such as provocation of terrorism , recruitment and training . " we ca n't wait for another madrid " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british member of the council of europe terry davis , points the scoreboard after being elected as new secretary general of the council of europe , tuesday , june 22 , 2004 in strasbourg , eastern france .
terry davis will replace austria 's walter schwimmer for the next five years .
-lrb- ap photo / christian lutz -rrb- on thursday , the council 's secretary general terry davis -lrb- photo -rrb- urged delegates to move quickly and decisively against terrorism . " we ca n't wait for another madrid or beslan , " he said , calling on delegates " to provide a message of support for the new instruments " being debated at the two-day meeting . more than 340 people died , half of them children , when a standoff between law enforcement authorities and hostage-takers who had herded more than 1,000 students and teachers into a school in the southern russian town of beslan last september ended in a chaotic shootout . the bombing of four madrid commuter trains on march 11 last year killed 191 people and injured over 1,900 . fleshing out the anti-terror convention negotiating the terms of the anti-terror convention , expected to be ready by may , showed " how difficult it can be to enhance the efficiency of the fight against terrorism at the same time as safeguarding fundamental human rights , " said davis , a former british lawmaker .
" but it has also shown that it is possible to reconcile these twin objectives . " " terrorism is an attack on human rights , " he went on .
" however , while tackling terrorism , we must be careful not to undermine human rights , " he said . davis said he expected recommendations on the topics debated by the conference as well as the new conventions to be adopted by the end of the month .
they will then be presented to a summit of council of europe heads of state and government due to be held in warsaw in may . in addition to its 46 members , five states which have observer status on the council of europe were also represented at the meeting : canada , japan , mexico , the united states and the vatican . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a day of infamy in spain after a series of explosions in madrid killed close to 200 people and wounded more than 1,400 , spanish officials are still uncertain who is behind the worst terrorist attack in the country 's history . -lrb- march 12 , 2004 -rrb- madrid hosts anti-terror summit an international symposium on the fight against terrorism begins in madrid on tuesday , a year on from the devastating bombings which ripped through the spanish capital on march 11 , 2004 . -lrb- march 8 , 2005 -rrb- british labor mp elected to head council of europe british labor parliamentarian terry davis beat out two other candidates to be elected the new secretary general of europe 's top human rights organization , the 45-nation council of europe . -lrb- june 23 , 2004 -rrb- feedback do you think the fight against terror risks undermining human rights ?

the positive noises emanating from the summit suggested harmony but critics complained of issues swept under the carpet . russian president vladimir putin on friday was given a friendly reception by the leaders of france , germany and spain when they met for informal talks aimed at bolstering recently strained ties between moscow and the european union . french president jacques chirac invited german chancellor gerhard schröder and spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero to his elysee palace for the first-ever such meeting , after holding bilateral talks with putin . at a press conference after the 90-minute four-way session , the leaders said it had been a useful preparation for an eu-russian summit due in may .
" france , germany , spain and russia see in this relationship a way of ensuring ... the definitive establishment of peace , democracy and the rule of law across the whole of our continent , " chirac said . among the issues under discussion were the so-called four " common spaces " meant to guide eu-russian ties through 2007 - the economy , justice and internal security , external security , and education and culture , chirac said .
the leaders also touched on international affairs , including kosovo , iran , the middle east peace process , iraq and lebanon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder was welcomed by chirac on friday all four leaders were in agreement that iran should be prevented from developing nuclear weapons .
" we are working very closely on the iran question , " schröder said , dismissing any suggestion of differences even though russia has been supplying tehran with nuclear technology , saying it is for civilian purposes .
president chirac added that " there is no contradiction between the russian position and that of france and germany " when it came to iran . the leaders also agreed on a collective stand in favor of a complete withdrawal of syrian forces from lebanon .
" we have adopted a joint statement on lebanon , a communiqué , which , like the whole international community , insists on the compelling necessity to implement resolution 1559 , " chirac told the press conference , referring to united nations resolution 1559 which calls for a withdrawal which france co-sponsored with the united states .
putin 's agreement on the subject was particularly telling due to russia 's long-standing links with damascus . there was also unanimous agreement to maintain good contacts with the united states but chirac said the eu was " clearly for lifting the embargo " on arms sales to china .
washington wants the ban to remain . in keeping with all the positive news , which included an announcement that the four countries would meet again in the next two months , there was no explicit acknowledgement of the widespread international criticism of putin for flouting democratic norms in his handling of the chechen war , the press and business , as well as in his relations with ukraine and the baltic states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder , zapatero and chirac during a meeting in september 2004 in madrid zapatero said that in russia as elsewhere the best way to fight terrorism was " the force of reason , the force of the rule of law and international cooperation . " last month us president george w. bush publicly criticized russia 's democratic shortcomings at a meeting with putin in bratislava , indicating a new chill in the us-russian relationship . aides to chirac said the purpose of the informal gathering was to " hold out the hand of friendship to putin " to encourage him down the path of political and economic reforms . putin was making his first visit to the french capital since november 2003 , but he and chirac have seen each other several times in the interim - in 2004 at d-day commemorations in normandy and at the g8 summit , and in january at ceremonies marking the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz . the two presidents met with 35 russian writers attending the just-opened paris book fair - deemed safer than a visit to the fair itself , where putin could have faced protestors . after a private lunch , chirac accompanied putin on a visit to an air force base outside the capital , a gesture of reciprocity after the russian president took chirac to see a top secret russian space center last april . putin , chirac and schröder first forged their alliance two years ago when they spearheaded opposition to the us-led war in iraq .
chirac invited zapatero , whom he sees as a new ally in the european union , to join the group . but the meeting risked annoying leaders elsewhere in europe - notably in poland and the baltics - where any franco-german effort to set the agenda for the eu 's relations with russia would be strongly opposed . chirac 's office said other countries - and the european commission in brussels - should not feel slighted , as it was important to encourage all kinds of links with moscow . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin says he 's ready to talk in germany for a two-day visit , vladimir putin said he 's ready to work with the eu about the chechnya conflict and is prepared to answer questions about delicate subjects like ukraine and press freedom .

" i fully agree with president chirac , we ca n't allow freedom in services to open the door to social dumping and to the disregard of safety standards in germany " and in europe , schröder said in a keynote speech to the lower house of german parliament , the bundestag . " we do n't only need law and order in the interior , we also need law and order on the labour market , " the chancellor said . under the so-called bolkestein directive , named after the former eu commissioner frits bolkestein who penned it , companies offering services throughout the 25 member states will be allowed to operate under the laws and regulations of their country of origin . companies would not have to pay local rate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in concrete terms , companies - from butchers to hairdressers and construction firms - from countries with lower taxes and fewer social regulations , notably in eastern europe , will be able to operate in higher-cost economies , but without being forced to pay their workers at the local rates . the supporters of the directive argue that such reforms are necessary if europe is to have a truly free market and wants to achieve its long-held dream of becoming as dynamic an economy as the united states . but france and germany , in particular , are up in arms over the proposals , with politicians , professional guilds and unions alike claiming they would place french and german companies at a disadvantage to rivals from new eu members in eastern europe .

" i fully agree with president chirac , we ca n't allow freedom in services to open the door to social dumping and to the disregard of safety standards in germany " and in europe , schröder said in a keynote speech to the lower house of german parliament , the bundestag .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.03.2005 eu-russia summit accentuates the positive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peace and harmony , good ; russia 's iran links and chechnya , bad the leaders of germany , france , spain and russia met in paris on friday to strengthen ties .
the positive noises emanating from the summit suggested harmony but critics complained of issues swept under the carpet . russian president vladimir putin on friday was given a friendly reception by the leaders of france , germany and spain when they met for informal talks aimed at bolstering recently strained ties between moscow and the european union . french president jacques chirac invited german chancellor gerhard schröder and spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero to his elysee palace for the first-ever such meeting , after holding bilateral talks with putin . at a press conference after the 90-minute four-way session , the leaders said it had been a useful preparation for an eu-russian summit due in may .
" france , germany , spain and russia see in this relationship a way of ensuring ... the definitive establishment of peace , democracy and the rule of law across the whole of our continent , " chirac said . among the issues under discussion were the so-called four " common spaces " meant to guide eu-russian ties through 2007 - the economy , justice and internal security , external security , and education and culture , chirac said .
the leaders also touched on international affairs , including kosovo , iran , the middle east peace process , iraq and lebanon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder was welcomed by chirac on friday all four leaders were in agreement that iran should be prevented from developing nuclear weapons .
" we are working very closely on the iran question , " schröder said , dismissing any suggestion of differences even though russia has been supplying tehran with nuclear technology , saying it is for civilian purposes .
president chirac added that " there is no contradiction between the russian position and that of france and germany " when it came to iran . the leaders also agreed on a collective stand in favor of a complete withdrawal of syrian forces from lebanon .
" we have adopted a joint statement on lebanon , a communiqué , which , like the whole international community , insists on the compelling necessity to implement resolution 1559 , " chirac told the press conference , referring to united nations resolution 1559 which calls for a withdrawal which france co-sponsored with the united states .
putin 's agreement on the subject was particularly telling due to russia 's long-standing links with damascus . there was also unanimous agreement to maintain good contacts with the united states but chirac said the eu was " clearly for lifting the embargo " on arms sales to china .
washington wants the ban to remain . in keeping with all the positive news , which included an announcement that the four countries would meet again in the next two months , there was no explicit acknowledgement of the widespread international criticism of putin for flouting democratic norms in his handling of the chechen war , the press and business , as well as in his relations with ukraine and the baltic states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder , zapatero and chirac during a meeting in september 2004 in madrid zapatero said that in russia as elsewhere the best way to fight terrorism was " the force of reason , the force of the rule of law and international cooperation . " last month us president george w. bush publicly criticized russia 's democratic shortcomings at a meeting with putin in bratislava , indicating a new chill in the us-russian relationship . aides to chirac said the purpose of the informal gathering was to " hold out the hand of friendship to putin " to encourage him down the path of political and economic reforms . putin was making his first visit to the french capital since november 2003 , but he and chirac have seen each other several times in the interim - in 2004 at d-day commemorations in normandy and at the g8 summit , and in january at ceremonies marking the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz . the two presidents met with 35 russian writers attending the just-opened paris book fair - deemed safer than a visit to the fair itself , where putin could have faced protestors . after a private lunch , chirac accompanied putin on a visit to an air force base outside the capital , a gesture of reciprocity after the russian president took chirac to see a top secret russian space center last april . putin , chirac and schröder first forged their alliance two years ago when they spearheaded opposition to the us-led war in iraq .
chirac invited zapatero , whom he sees as a new ally in the european union , to join the group . but the meeting risked annoying leaders elsewhere in europe - notably in poland and the baltics - where any franco-german effort to set the agenda for the eu 's relations with russia would be strongly opposed . chirac 's office said other countries - and the european commission in brussels - should not feel slighted , as it was important to encourage all kinds of links with moscow . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin says he 's ready to talk in germany for a two-day visit , vladimir putin said he 's ready to work with the eu about the chechnya conflict and is prepared to answer questions about delicate subjects like ukraine and press freedom .

as the third summit of interior ministers and high-ranking government officials from the 46-member council of europe enters its last day in warsaw , talks continue to focus on tackling terrorism and organized crime . polish president aleksander kwasniewski warned council of europe member states friday against paralyzing democracy in the fight against organised crime and terrorism . " we must be careful to avoid that the fight against terrorism and organized crime do not paralyze the smooth functioning of a normal democratic society .
we must not lose what constitutes the basis of a democratic society , " said kwasniewski , whose country has chaired the council 's committee of ministers since november . " given that criminal activity transcends national borders , we must reinforce cooperation among our intelligence services and better control the flow of people and merchandise , " kwasniewski told the meeting in warsaw .
but he stressed that any moves to clamp down on organized crime and terrorism must be taken with respect for individual freedoms . developing strategies ministerial-level meetings at the conference are being held behind closed doors and are focussing on special investigative techniques , the protection of witnesses , money laundering and the financing of terrorism . the officials are also debating two draft conventions aimed at nipping in the bud terrorism and other forms of serious crime in the early , preparative stages . the draft convention on the prevention of terrorism proposes criminalizing acts deemed as laying the groundwork for a terrorist attack , such as provocation of terrorism , recruitment and training .

" but it has also shown that it is possible to reconcile these twin objectives . " " terrorism is an attack on human rights , " he went on .
" however , while tackling terrorism , we must be careful not to undermine human rights , " he said . davis said he expected recommendations on the topics debated by the conference as well as the new conventions to be adopted by the end of the month .

" that view is shared by 42 percent in the 10 new states which joined the union last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people enter europe illegally by ship across the bloc , nearly half of the population opposed granting legal immigrants full civil rights .
but beate winkler , head of the vienna-based european monitoring center on racism and xenophobia , eumc , says that the majority of citizens are happy to live in multi-ethnic communities .
onus on governments the eumc encourages governments to introduce appropriate policies to help avoid hostilities and potential for conflict .
however , winkler asserted that some governments have either failed to address the problems or even deny that they exist .
“ of course , you must be very concerned about negative attitudes because violence almost always starts with words , ” she said winkler said the picture of xenophobia in europe is full of contradictions , adding that attitudes can be influenced strongly by good political leadership .
one apparent contradiction is that while 50 percent of europeans " have resistance to immigrants " only 30 percent say they don ’ t want asylum seekers in their country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the survey revealed resistance to immigration in rural areas the survey shows that poor or poorly educated people are " more likely to display negative attitudes towards minorities . ” and it reflects that people from rural areas tend to be more hostile to immigration , despite the fact that most immigrants live in cities . shaye hoobanoff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government says immigrant wave receding in germany immigration into germany in the year 2003 , for the first time in many decades , dropped below 800,000 as the influx of foreigners throughout the 1990s has receded , according to government statistics released on monday .

the first-phase strategy for 2005-2008 is based on a multi-disciplinary approach that foresees reducing demand and supply and steps up the fight against international drug traffickers . the action plan gives a timetable for a set of measures to be carried out at eu level by member states , in cooperation with third countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it includes general policy measures , specific programs aimed at the prevention of drug use among young people , in the workplace and in recreational settings , as well as measures for improving access to treatment programs , both for drug use and drug-related illness .
still a widespread problem the action plan is based on the results of an annual report published by the european monitoring center for drug addiction -lrb- emcdda -rrb- in lisbon .
according to the study , drugs claimed fewer lives in 2004 , but some two million people in europe still have a problem with drug addiction .
roland simon , who worked on the emcdda report , believes the action plan is definitely a step in the right direction .
" i feel the plan has a very sound basis , " he explained .
" it 's a very sensible idea to provide prevention and treatment for people who experiment with drug consumption before they slide too deep into addiction . "
moving away from criminalization one of the main problems support schemes face is financing .
the only projects eligible for eu funding are those that promote europe-wide cooperation .
that means that an initiative such as pauke has to depend on national or even district funding .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the approach that forms the cornerstone of the action plan is that drug addicts are seen as people suffering from an illness rather than criminals .
instead of putting them behind bars , the plan is to refer them to organizations such as pauke and help them return to normal life .
karl-heinz bitzer also welcomes the eu 's new strategy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.03.2005 canvassing a cannibal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meiwes has never shown remorse for his crime armin meiwes , who admittedly killed and ate another man , made headlines around the world .
the first book on the german cannibal has just been released in english .
dw-world talked to the author . germany and the world were shocked in december 2002 , when details about meiwes ' deed first emerged : he confessed to stabbing and eating 43-year-old bernd-jürgen brandes .
what disturbed people most , however , was that brandes had agreed to his slaughter and even tried to consume his own genitals before meiwes killed him . meiwes , who has never expressed remorse over what he did , was sentenced to eight years and six months in prison for manslaughter in january 2003 .
he has declined requests for interviews as he has sold his story to a german media production company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lois jones that 's why lois jones -lrb- photo -rrb- , a munich-based journalist from wales , based her book " cannibal " on interviews with friends and relatives of both men and those involved in meiwes ' trial .
the result is the most graphic and detailed account of the case published for a general audience so far . dw-world : what was your reaction when you first heard about the case ? lois jones : i was shocked , basically .
i felt what these two men did pushed far beyond the boundaries of what is acceptable .
germany is a very civilized society .
it amazed me that something like this was going on in europe in today 's world .
i did find it revolting .
i 'm quite a squeamish person and also a strict vegetarian , which made it even more disgusting or shocking for me .
i found it almost incomprehensible .
i found meiwes more revolting and brandes more disturbing : as soon as i heard about it , i was mystified and thought , " what could drive a man , a seemingly successful man , to be eaten by another ? " what made you decide to write about it ? the publisher was looking for someone to write the story - a native english speaker , working as a journalist in germany .
i always wanted to write books and thought , " maybe now is the right time to start . "
i found the subject fascinating : what would drive someone to eat a man ?
why would his victim give his consent ? what fascinated you most about the story ? three main things : first , the psychology of the two men involved .
what shocked me about both of them was that people had no idea and thought they were relatively normal individuals .
it was very hard to believe .
secondly , i 'm a strict vegetarian , i 've consciously not eaten meat for years and was interested in the question : what do people think is acceptable to eat ?
and thirdly , the fact that the people involved were perceived as quite normal , the fact that it was n't just them , but hundreds and thousands of people worldwide who are interested in cannibalism - this something that appeals to so many people . bildunterschrift : meiwes killed brandes in his house in a hamlet called wüstefeld near rotenburg in the central german state of hesse how did you go about writing the book ? i approached meiwes in prison , he wrote back a curt , type-written letter .
it was n't particularly friendly , he basically said that he would n't agree to be interviewed because he wanted to write his own book .
it was a bit of a relief .
so i talked to friends , acquaintances , people he 'd gone to school with , policemen , lawyers - anyone who had anything to do with him .
a lot of people were willing to talk about it .
neighbors were keen to talk about it because it maybe helped them understand , being able to talk about it with someone else .
i also checked out cannibal web sites and chat rooms , which were slightly disturbing , i must admit . was it difficult for you to deal with the subject for months ? it surprised me in some ways - i am a person who does get upset when i watch a horror movie , but i was able to distance myself more than i thought .
admittedly , i did find some chapters particularly gruesome .
i was n't allowed to see the video -lrb- depicting the slaughter -rrb- , but people described what happened .
that bit particularly was gruesome , detectives had to receive counseling because it was so disturbing . you include the brandes ' thoughts in your book .
where did you get that information ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd-jügen brandes it says in the front of the book that " the events in the book are real , or as close to real as humanly possible . "

the first book on the german cannibal has just been released in english .
dw-world talked to the author . germany and the world were shocked in december 2002 , when details about meiwes ' deed first emerged : he confessed to stabbing and eating 43-year-old bernd-jürgen brandes .
what disturbed people most , however , was that brandes had agreed to his slaughter and even tried to consume his own genitals before meiwes killed him . meiwes , who has never expressed remorse over what he did , was sentenced to eight years and six months in prison for manslaughter in january 2003 .
he has declined requests for interviews as he has sold his story to a german media production company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lois jones that 's why lois jones -lrb- photo -rrb- , a munich-based journalist from wales , based her book " cannibal " on interviews with friends and relatives of both men and those involved in meiwes ' trial .
the result is the most graphic and detailed account of the case published for a general audience so far . dw-world : what was your reaction when you first heard about the case ? lois jones : i was shocked , basically .
i felt what these two men did pushed far beyond the boundaries of what is acceptable .
germany is a very civilized society .
it amazed me that something like this was going on in europe in today 's world .
i did find it revolting .
i 'm quite a squeamish person and also a strict vegetarian , which made it even more disgusting or shocking for me .
i found it almost incomprehensible .
i found meiwes more revolting and brandes more disturbing : as soon as i heard about it , i was mystified and thought , " what could drive a man , a seemingly successful man , to be eaten by another ? " what made you decide to write about it ? the publisher was looking for someone to write the story - a native english speaker , working as a journalist in germany .
i always wanted to write books and thought , " maybe now is the right time to start . "
i found the subject fascinating : what would drive someone to eat a man ?
why would his victim give his consent ? what fascinated you most about the story ? three main things : first , the psychology of the two men involved .
what shocked me about both of them was that people had no idea and thought they were relatively normal individuals .
it was very hard to believe .
secondly , i 'm a strict vegetarian , i 've consciously not eaten meat for years and was interested in the question : what do people think is acceptable to eat ?
and thirdly , the fact that the people involved were perceived as quite normal , the fact that it was n't just them , but hundreds and thousands of people worldwide who are interested in cannibalism - this something that appeals to so many people . bildunterschrift : meiwes killed brandes in his house in a hamlet called wüstefeld near rotenburg in the central german state of hesse how did you go about writing the book ? i approached meiwes in prison , he wrote back a curt , type-written letter .
it was n't particularly friendly , he basically said that he would n't agree to be interviewed because he wanted to write his own book .
it was a bit of a relief .
so i talked to friends , acquaintances , people he 'd gone to school with , policemen , lawyers - anyone who had anything to do with him .
a lot of people were willing to talk about it .
neighbors were keen to talk about it because it maybe helped them understand , being able to talk about it with someone else .
i also checked out cannibal web sites and chat rooms , which were slightly disturbing , i must admit . was it difficult for you to deal with the subject for months ? it surprised me in some ways - i am a person who does get upset when i watch a horror movie , but i was able to distance myself more than i thought .
admittedly , i did find some chapters particularly gruesome .
i was n't allowed to see the video -lrb- depicting the slaughter -rrb- , but people described what happened .
that bit particularly was gruesome , detectives had to receive counseling because it was so disturbing . you include the brandes ' thoughts in your book .
where did you get that information ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd-jügen brandes it says in the front of the book that " the events in the book are real , or as close to real as humanly possible . "
a lot of it is from what meiwes told psychologists , what he said in court , and how psychologists said -lrb- brandes -rrb- would be thinking . meiwes has sold the rights to his story .
how do you feel about that ? in his letter , meiwes told me that if i were interested in being a ghost writer for his autobiography , i should apply to his lawyer .
i did n't want to do that .
i do n't think it 's quite right that he should be making money out of what he 's done .
it 's not helping him at all - here 's someone who needs help and it 's only going to fuel his ego .
he has stated that he no longer feels the need to eat another man .
but before he was caught by police , he was looking around for other victims , which indicates that he has n't gotten over this urge .

" that view is shared by 42 percent in the 10 new states which joined the union last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people enter europe illegally by ship across the bloc , nearly half of the population opposed granting legal immigrants full civil rights .
but beate winkler , head of the vienna-based european monitoring center on racism and xenophobia , eumc , says that the majority of citizens are happy to live in multi-ethnic communities .
onus on governments the eumc encourages governments to introduce appropriate policies to help avoid hostilities and potential for conflict .
however , winkler asserted that some governments have either failed to address the problems or even deny that they exist .
“ of course , you must be very concerned about negative attitudes because violence almost always starts with words , ” she said winkler said the picture of xenophobia in europe is full of contradictions , adding that attitudes can be influenced strongly by good political leadership .
one apparent contradiction is that while 50 percent of europeans " have resistance to immigrants " only 30 percent say they don ’ t want asylum seekers in their country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the survey revealed resistance to immigration in rural areas the survey shows that poor or poorly educated people are " more likely to display negative attitudes towards minorities . ” and it reflects that people from rural areas tend to be more hostile to immigration , despite the fact that most immigrants live in cities . shaye hoobanoff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government says immigrant wave receding in germany immigration into germany in the year 2003 , for the first time in many decades , dropped below 800,000 as the influx of foreigners throughout the 1990s has receded , according to government statistics released on monday .

the positive noises emanating from the summit suggested harmony but critics complained of issues swept under the carpet . russian president vladimir putin on friday was given a friendly reception by the leaders of france , germany and spain when they met for informal talks aimed at bolstering recently strained ties between moscow and the european union . french president jacques chirac invited german chancellor gerhard schröder and spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero to his elysee palace for the first-ever such meeting , after holding bilateral talks with putin . at a press conference after the 90-minute four-way session , the leaders said it had been a useful preparation for an eu-russian summit due in may .
" france , germany , spain and russia see in this relationship a way of ensuring ... the definitive establishment of peace , democracy and the rule of law across the whole of our continent , " chirac said . among the issues under discussion were the so-called four " common spaces " meant to guide eu-russian ties through 2007 - the economy , justice and internal security , external security , and education and culture , chirac said .
the leaders also touched on international affairs , including kosovo , iran , the middle east peace process , iraq and lebanon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder was welcomed by chirac on friday all four leaders were in agreement that iran should be prevented from developing nuclear weapons .
" we are working very closely on the iran question , " schröder said , dismissing any suggestion of differences even though russia has been supplying tehran with nuclear technology , saying it is for civilian purposes .
president chirac added that " there is no contradiction between the russian position and that of france and germany " when it came to iran . the leaders also agreed on a collective stand in favor of a complete withdrawal of syrian forces from lebanon .
" we have adopted a joint statement on lebanon , a communiqué , which , like the whole international community , insists on the compelling necessity to implement resolution 1559 , " chirac told the press conference , referring to united nations resolution 1559 which calls for a withdrawal which france co-sponsored with the united states .
putin 's agreement on the subject was particularly telling due to russia 's long-standing links with damascus . there was also unanimous agreement to maintain good contacts with the united states but chirac said the eu was " clearly for lifting the embargo " on arms sales to china .
washington wants the ban to remain . in keeping with all the positive news , which included an announcement that the four countries would meet again in the next two months , there was no explicit acknowledgement of the widespread international criticism of putin for flouting democratic norms in his handling of the chechen war , the press and business , as well as in his relations with ukraine and the baltic states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder , zapatero and chirac during a meeting in september 2004 in madrid zapatero said that in russia as elsewhere the best way to fight terrorism was " the force of reason , the force of the rule of law and international cooperation . " last month us president george w. bush publicly criticized russia 's democratic shortcomings at a meeting with putin in bratislava , indicating a new chill in the us-russian relationship . aides to chirac said the purpose of the informal gathering was to " hold out the hand of friendship to putin " to encourage him down the path of political and economic reforms . putin was making his first visit to the french capital since november 2003 , but he and chirac have seen each other several times in the interim - in 2004 at d-day commemorations in normandy and at the g8 summit , and in january at ceremonies marking the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz . the two presidents met with 35 russian writers attending the just-opened paris book fair - deemed safer than a visit to the fair itself , where putin could have faced protestors . after a private lunch , chirac accompanied putin on a visit to an air force base outside the capital , a gesture of reciprocity after the russian president took chirac to see a top secret russian space center last april . putin , chirac and schröder first forged their alliance two years ago when they spearheaded opposition to the us-led war in iraq .
chirac invited zapatero , whom he sees as a new ally in the european union , to join the group . but the meeting risked annoying leaders elsewhere in europe - notably in poland and the baltics - where any franco-german effort to set the agenda for the eu 's relations with russia would be strongly opposed . chirac 's office said other countries - and the european commission in brussels - should not feel slighted , as it was important to encourage all kinds of links with moscow . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin says he 's ready to talk in germany for a two-day visit , vladimir putin said he 's ready to work with the eu about the chechnya conflict and is prepared to answer questions about delicate subjects like ukraine and press freedom .

the first-phase strategy for 2005-2008 is based on a multi-disciplinary approach that foresees reducing demand and supply and steps up the fight against international drug traffickers . the action plan gives a timetable for a set of measures to be carried out at eu level by member states , in cooperation with third countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it includes general policy measures , specific programs aimed at the prevention of drug use among young people , in the workplace and in recreational settings , as well as measures for improving access to treatment programs , both for drug use and drug-related illness .
still a widespread problem the action plan is based on the results of an annual report published by the european monitoring center for drug addiction -lrb- emcdda -rrb- in lisbon .
according to the study , drugs claimed fewer lives in 2004 , but some two million people in europe still have a problem with drug addiction .
roland simon , who worked on the emcdda report , believes the action plan is definitely a step in the right direction .
" i feel the plan has a very sound basis , " he explained .
" it 's a very sensible idea to provide prevention and treatment for people who experiment with drug consumption before they slide too deep into addiction . "
moving away from criminalization one of the main problems support schemes face is financing .
the only projects eligible for eu funding are those that promote europe-wide cooperation .
that means that an initiative such as pauke has to depend on national or even district funding .
in times of economic gloom , these subsidies are the first to feel the pinch .
even so , roland simon is convinced a pan-european drug policy makes sense .
" the advantage of a unified policy , " he said , " is that you can combine targets and develop a common approach that can be pursued on a european-wide level . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the approach that forms the cornerstone of the action plan is that drug addicts are seen as people suffering from an illness rather than criminals .
instead of putting them behind bars , the plan is to refer them to organizations such as pauke and help them return to normal life .
karl-heinz bitzer also welcomes the eu 's new strategy .

the positive noises emanating from the summit suggested harmony but critics complained of issues swept under the carpet . russian president vladimir putin on friday was given a friendly reception by the leaders of france , germany and spain when they met for informal talks aimed at bolstering recently strained ties between moscow and the european union . french president jacques chirac invited german chancellor gerhard schröder and spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero to his elysee palace for the first-ever such meeting , after holding bilateral talks with putin . at a press conference after the 90-minute four-way session , the leaders said it had been a useful preparation for an eu-russian summit due in may .
" france , germany , spain and russia see in this relationship a way of ensuring ... the definitive establishment of peace , democracy and the rule of law across the whole of our continent , " chirac said . among the issues under discussion were the so-called four " common spaces " meant to guide eu-russian ties through 2007 - the economy , justice and internal security , external security , and education and culture , chirac said .
the leaders also touched on international affairs , including kosovo , iran , the middle east peace process , iraq and lebanon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder was welcomed by chirac on friday all four leaders were in agreement that iran should be prevented from developing nuclear weapons .
" we are working very closely on the iran question , " schröder said , dismissing any suggestion of differences even though russia has been supplying tehran with nuclear technology , saying it is for civilian purposes .
president chirac added that " there is no contradiction between the russian position and that of france and germany " when it came to iran . the leaders also agreed on a collective stand in favor of a complete withdrawal of syrian forces from lebanon .
" we have adopted a joint statement on lebanon , a communiqué , which , like the whole international community , insists on the compelling necessity to implement resolution 1559 , " chirac told the press conference , referring to united nations resolution 1559 which calls for a withdrawal which france co-sponsored with the united states .
putin 's agreement on the subject was particularly telling due to russia 's long-standing links with damascus . there was also unanimous agreement to maintain good contacts with the united states but chirac said the eu was " clearly for lifting the embargo " on arms sales to china .
washington wants the ban to remain . in keeping with all the positive news , which included an announcement that the four countries would meet again in the next two months , there was no explicit acknowledgement of the widespread international criticism of putin for flouting democratic norms in his handling of the chechen war , the press and business , as well as in his relations with ukraine and the baltic states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder , zapatero and chirac during a meeting in september 2004 in madrid zapatero said that in russia as elsewhere the best way to fight terrorism was " the force of reason , the force of the rule of law and international cooperation . " last month us president george w. bush publicly criticized russia 's democratic shortcomings at a meeting with putin in bratislava , indicating a new chill in the us-russian relationship . aides to chirac said the purpose of the informal gathering was to " hold out the hand of friendship to putin " to encourage him down the path of political and economic reforms . putin was making his first visit to the french capital since november 2003 , but he and chirac have seen each other several times in the interim - in 2004 at d-day commemorations in normandy and at the g8 summit , and in january at ceremonies marking the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz . the two presidents met with 35 russian writers attending the just-opened paris book fair - deemed safer than a visit to the fair itself , where putin could have faced protestors . after a private lunch , chirac accompanied putin on a visit to an air force base outside the capital , a gesture of reciprocity after the russian president took chirac to see a top secret russian space center last april . putin , chirac and schröder first forged their alliance two years ago when they spearheaded opposition to the us-led war in iraq .
chirac invited zapatero , whom he sees as a new ally in the european union , to join the group . but the meeting risked annoying leaders elsewhere in europe - notably in poland and the baltics - where any franco-german effort to set the agenda for the eu 's relations with russia would be strongly opposed . chirac 's office said other countries - and the european commission in brussels - should not feel slighted , as it was important to encourage all kinds of links with moscow . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin says he 's ready to talk in germany for a two-day visit , vladimir putin said he 's ready to work with the eu about the chechnya conflict and is prepared to answer questions about delicate subjects like ukraine and press freedom .

the positive noises emanating from the summit suggested harmony but critics complained of issues swept under the carpet . russian president vladimir putin on friday was given a friendly reception by the leaders of france , germany and spain when they met for informal talks aimed at bolstering recently strained ties between moscow and the european union . french president jacques chirac invited german chancellor gerhard schröder and spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero to his elysee palace for the first-ever such meeting , after holding bilateral talks with putin . at a press conference after the 90-minute four-way session , the leaders said it had been a useful preparation for an eu-russian summit due in may .
" france , germany , spain and russia see in this relationship a way of ensuring ... the definitive establishment of peace , democracy and the rule of law across the whole of our continent , " chirac said . among the issues under discussion were the so-called four " common spaces " meant to guide eu-russian ties through 2007 - the economy , justice and internal security , external security , and education and culture , chirac said .
the leaders also touched on international affairs , including kosovo , iran , the middle east peace process , iraq and lebanon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder was welcomed by chirac on friday all four leaders were in agreement that iran should be prevented from developing nuclear weapons .
" we are working very closely on the iran question , " schröder said , dismissing any suggestion of differences even though russia has been supplying tehran with nuclear technology , saying it is for civilian purposes .
president chirac added that " there is no contradiction between the russian position and that of france and germany " when it came to iran . the leaders also agreed on a collective stand in favor of a complete withdrawal of syrian forces from lebanon .
" we have adopted a joint statement on lebanon , a communiqué , which , like the whole international community , insists on the compelling necessity to implement resolution 1559 , " chirac told the press conference , referring to united nations resolution 1559 which calls for a withdrawal which france co-sponsored with the united states .
putin 's agreement on the subject was particularly telling due to russia 's long-standing links with damascus . there was also unanimous agreement to maintain good contacts with the united states but chirac said the eu was " clearly for lifting the embargo " on arms sales to china .
washington wants the ban to remain . in keeping with all the positive news , which included an announcement that the four countries would meet again in the next two months , there was no explicit acknowledgement of the widespread international criticism of putin for flouting democratic norms in his handling of the chechen war , the press and business , as well as in his relations with ukraine and the baltic states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder , zapatero and chirac during a meeting in september 2004 in madrid zapatero said that in russia as elsewhere the best way to fight terrorism was " the force of reason , the force of the rule of law and international cooperation . " last month us president george w. bush publicly criticized russia 's democratic shortcomings at a meeting with putin in bratislava , indicating a new chill in the us-russian relationship . aides to chirac said the purpose of the informal gathering was to " hold out the hand of friendship to putin " to encourage him down the path of political and economic reforms . putin was making his first visit to the french capital since november 2003 , but he and chirac have seen each other several times in the interim - in 2004 at d-day commemorations in normandy and at the g8 summit , and in january at ceremonies marking the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz . the two presidents met with 35 russian writers attending the just-opened paris book fair - deemed safer than a visit to the fair itself , where putin could have faced protestors . after a private lunch , chirac accompanied putin on a visit to an air force base outside the capital , a gesture of reciprocity after the russian president took chirac to see a top secret russian space center last april . putin , chirac and schröder first forged their alliance two years ago when they spearheaded opposition to the us-led war in iraq .
chirac invited zapatero , whom he sees as a new ally in the european union , to join the group . but the meeting risked annoying leaders elsewhere in europe - notably in poland and the baltics - where any franco-german effort to set the agenda for the eu 's relations with russia would be strongly opposed . chirac 's office said other countries - and the european commission in brussels - should not feel slighted , as it was important to encourage all kinds of links with moscow . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin says he 's ready to talk in germany for a two-day visit , vladimir putin said he 's ready to work with the eu about the chechnya conflict and is prepared to answer questions about delicate subjects like ukraine and press freedom .

victims ' rights activists worry financial rewards for crimes might provoke copy cats , but government officials disagree . günter stampf 's past client include celebrities such as former soviet leader michail gorbatchev and german starlet verona feldbusch .
he recently secured another high-profile client for his media production company . after months of negotiations , stampf received exclusive rights for a television documentary about meiwes , who is serving a sentence of eight years and six months in prison for killing and eating another man .
a book is to follow and meiwes has declined requests to be interviewed as a result . " the documentary , in which mr. meiwes will talk for the first time , will be supported by a number of well known scientists and experts , " an announcement on stampf 's web site reads .
" the serious and journalistic documentary will try to explain what lead to this murder . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arno funke , also known as " dagobert , " became famous for blackmailing a german department store chain .

they also argue that rewarding convicts for their actions might entice others to follow suit . celebrity criminals ? " there 's a danger that someone only commits a crime to become famous in order to make money , " said veit schiemann , a spokesman for white ring , a german victims ' rights group .
" people might rob a bank in the most gruesome way in order to be able to sell the story afterwards . " last june , germany 's state justice ministers unanimously asked the federal government to introduce legislation that would ban criminals from selling their stories .
but neither the state ministers , who are in the midst of discussing a complete overhaul of germany 's justice system , nor the federal ministry saw a need to act swiftly on the matter . henning plöger , a spokesman for the german justice ministry , said no legislation was planned , adding that a 1998 law already gave crime victims the right to lay claim to any money criminals make from selling their story .

" our shareholder structure has radically changed in three months since we launched our bid , " breuer told the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" we now have new major shareholders who have said that they want to remain shareholders .
so the moment has come for us to invite them to take a seat on the supervisory board . " nevertheless , breuer said he would prefer if the new nominations could wait until a new supervisory board was appointed in 2006 rather than forcing current board members to leave prematurely which would make any shake-up appear unnecessarily " dramatic and spectacular . " share buy-back program ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frankfurt stock exchange is part of deutsche börse in addition , deutsche börse was considering launching a share buy-back program over a number of years , as demanded by the rebel shareholders , including funds tci , atticus capital and fidelity investment , in recent weeks , breuer hinted . asked about such a possibility in the interview , breuer replied that the management board was " drawing up a concept . " it will emerge that we 're currently overcapitalized and that the mix of own equity and outside capital is not correct , " he said .
" the management board will propose to the supervisory board what sort of capital structure it wants in the coming years . " he did not specify exactly how big the share buy-back program could be .
but the frankfurt daily suggested it could be as much as 700 million euros -lrb- $ 935 million -rrb- , which corresponds to the current level of deutsche börse 's cash reserves . börse officials tight-lipped a deutsche börse spokesman refused to be drawn on the figure . " what we have said so far is that deutsche börse will return a significant amount of cash back to its shareholders and that we have about 700 million euros in cash available , " he said .

" i fully agree with president chirac , we ca n't allow freedom in services to open the door to social dumping and to the disregard of safety standards in germany " and in europe , schröder said in a keynote speech to the lower house of german parliament , the bundestag . " we do n't only need law and order in the interior , we also need law and order on the labour market , " the chancellor said . under the so-called bolkestein directive , named after the former eu commissioner frits bolkestein who penned it , companies offering services throughout the 25 member states will be allowed to operate under the laws and regulations of their country of origin . companies would not have to pay local rate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in concrete terms , companies - from butchers to hairdressers and construction firms - from countries with lower taxes and fewer social regulations , notably in eastern europe , will be able to operate in higher-cost economies , but without being forced to pay their workers at the local rates . the supporters of the directive argue that such reforms are necessary if europe is to have a truly free market and wants to achieve its long-held dream of becoming as dynamic an economy as the united states . but france and germany , in particular , are up in arms over the proposals , with politicians , professional guilds and unions alike claiming they would place french and german companies at a disadvantage to rivals from new eu members in eastern europe .
the proposals would undermine sector-wide wage agreements and labour safety legislation , the critics argue . concern over germans being undercut bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with unemployment in germany currently at a post-war high point of 5.2 million or 12.6 percent of the workforce , opponents argue that allowing eastern european companies to undercut their western rivals with cheap labour will inevitably lead to even longer dole queues at home . in face of such arguments , chancellor schröder recently dropped his previous tacit support of the directive to suggest that the text should not only be amended , " but replaced by a new one " . the head of the eu commission , jose manuel barroso , specifically defended the country-of-origin rule on monday , accusing the directive 's critics of refusing to accept the consequences of eu enlargement . " some people think the european commission is there to protect the 15 against the new 10 - it is not , " he said .
" it is there to promote the general interest of europe . " chirac bangs the drum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but french president chirac hammered home his objections again on tuesday , saying " the draft directive on services is unacceptable to france and to other european partners and should be thoroughly reviewed . " chirac insisted that brussels must abide by its pledge to revise the text of the directive so that consensus could be reached .
" europe means the protection of social rights , it means fair conditions for competition , it means the development of public services and respect for cultural diversity , " chirac said .
in france the proposal is being used as an argument by people opposed to the european constitution . while not officially on the agenda of the upcoming eu summit in brussels next week , the issue will almost certainly be discussed by eu leaders there . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder reveals plan to boost eu economy german chancellor gerhard schröder has gone public with a plan aimed at adding fuel to the european internal market which he intends to put before fellow leaders at next week 's european union summit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.03.2005 canvassing a cannibal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meiwes has never shown remorse for his crime armin meiwes , who admittedly killed and ate another man , made headlines around the world .
the first book on the german cannibal has just been released in english .
dw-world talked to the author . germany and the world were shocked in december 2002 , when details about meiwes ' deed first emerged : he confessed to stabbing and eating 43-year-old bernd-jürgen brandes .
what disturbed people most , however , was that brandes had agreed to his slaughter and even tried to consume his own genitals before meiwes killed him . meiwes , who has never expressed remorse over what he did , was sentenced to eight years and six months in prison for manslaughter in january 2003 .
he has declined requests for interviews as he has sold his story to a german media production company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lois jones that 's why lois jones -lrb- photo -rrb- , a munich-based journalist from wales , based her book " cannibal " on interviews with friends and relatives of both men and those involved in meiwes ' trial .
the result is the most graphic and detailed account of the case published for a general audience so far . dw-world : what was your reaction when you first heard about the case ? lois jones : i was shocked , basically .
i felt what these two men did pushed far beyond the boundaries of what is acceptable .
germany is a very civilized society .
it amazed me that something like this was going on in europe in today 's world .
i did find it revolting .
i 'm quite a squeamish person and also a strict vegetarian , which made it even more disgusting or shocking for me .
i found it almost incomprehensible .
i found meiwes more revolting and brandes more disturbing : as soon as i heard about it , i was mystified and thought , " what could drive a man , a seemingly successful man , to be eaten by another ? " what made you decide to write about it ? the publisher was looking for someone to write the story - a native english speaker , working as a journalist in germany .
i always wanted to write books and thought , " maybe now is the right time to start . "
i found the subject fascinating : what would drive someone to eat a man ?
why would his victim give his consent ? what fascinated you most about the story ? three main things : first , the psychology of the two men involved .
what shocked me about both of them was that people had no idea and thought they were relatively normal individuals .
it was very hard to believe .
secondly , i 'm a strict vegetarian , i 've consciously not eaten meat for years and was interested in the question : what do people think is acceptable to eat ?
and thirdly , the fact that the people involved were perceived as quite normal , the fact that it was n't just them , but hundreds and thousands of people worldwide who are interested in cannibalism - this something that appeals to so many people . bildunterschrift : meiwes killed brandes in his house in a hamlet called wüstefeld near rotenburg in the central german state of hesse how did you go about writing the book ? i approached meiwes in prison , he wrote back a curt , type-written letter .
it was n't particularly friendly , he basically said that he would n't agree to be interviewed because he wanted to write his own book .
it was a bit of a relief .
so i talked to friends , acquaintances , people he 'd gone to school with , policemen , lawyers - anyone who had anything to do with him .
a lot of people were willing to talk about it .
neighbors were keen to talk about it because it maybe helped them understand , being able to talk about it with someone else .
i also checked out cannibal web sites and chat rooms , which were slightly disturbing , i must admit . was it difficult for you to deal with the subject for months ? it surprised me in some ways - i am a person who does get upset when i watch a horror movie , but i was able to distance myself more than i thought .
admittedly , i did find some chapters particularly gruesome .
i was n't allowed to see the video -lrb- depicting the slaughter -rrb- , but people described what happened .
that bit particularly was gruesome , detectives had to receive counseling because it was so disturbing . you include the brandes ' thoughts in your book .
where did you get that information ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd-jügen brandes it says in the front of the book that " the events in the book are real , or as close to real as humanly possible . "
a lot of it is from what meiwes told psychologists , what he said in court , and how psychologists said -lrb- brandes -rrb- would be thinking . meiwes has sold the rights to his story .
how do you feel about that ? in his letter , meiwes told me that if i were interested in being a ghost writer for his autobiography , i should apply to his lawyer .
i did n't want to do that .
i do n't think it 's quite right that he should be making money out of what he 's done .
it 's not helping him at all - here 's someone who needs help and it 's only going to fuel his ego .
he has stated that he no longer feels the need to eat another man .
but before he was caught by police , he was looking around for other victims , which indicates that he has n't gotten over this urge .
there are fans , web sites on the internet that are dedicated to him .
in a way this could encourage people out there who have similar tendencies to actually carry them out . is n't your book also helping to promote his celebrity ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : book cover - lois jones : " cannibal " what i tried to write was an objective view of what happened and not glorify what he 's done .
my book was trying to be more , look , this is what happened . your book came out as a mass-market edition , which is also sold in supermarkets in the us .
it is very graphic at times .
would you have written it differently if you 'd written it for a different publication ? the publishers were certainly keen for it to be written the way it was .
they were very liberal in giving me a free reign , but i probably would have written it a little less gruesome . do you think you 'll write another true crime book ? i think i could , but i do n't solely want to write them .
right now i 'm writing a book about -lrb- british discount airline -rrb- easyjet .

the first book on the german cannibal has just been released in english .
dw-world talked to the author . germany and the world were shocked in december 2002 , when details about meiwes ' deed first emerged : he confessed to stabbing and eating 43-year-old bernd-jürgen brandes .
what disturbed people most , however , was that brandes had agreed to his slaughter and even tried to consume his own genitals before meiwes killed him . meiwes , who has never expressed remorse over what he did , was sentenced to eight years and six months in prison for manslaughter in january 2003 .
he has declined requests for interviews as he has sold his story to a german media production company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lois jones that 's why lois jones -lrb- photo -rrb- , a munich-based journalist from wales , based her book " cannibal " on interviews with friends and relatives of both men and those involved in meiwes ' trial .
the result is the most graphic and detailed account of the case published for a general audience so far . dw-world : what was your reaction when you first heard about the case ? lois jones : i was shocked , basically .
i felt what these two men did pushed far beyond the boundaries of what is acceptable .
germany is a very civilized society .
it amazed me that something like this was going on in europe in today 's world .
i did find it revolting .
i 'm quite a squeamish person and also a strict vegetarian , which made it even more disgusting or shocking for me .
i found it almost incomprehensible .
i found meiwes more revolting and brandes more disturbing : as soon as i heard about it , i was mystified and thought , " what could drive a man , a seemingly successful man , to be eaten by another ? " what made you decide to write about it ? the publisher was looking for someone to write the story - a native english speaker , working as a journalist in germany .
i always wanted to write books and thought , " maybe now is the right time to start . "
i found the subject fascinating : what would drive someone to eat a man ?
why would his victim give his consent ? what fascinated you most about the story ? three main things : first , the psychology of the two men involved .
what shocked me about both of them was that people had no idea and thought they were relatively normal individuals .
it was very hard to believe .
secondly , i 'm a strict vegetarian , i 've consciously not eaten meat for years and was interested in the question : what do people think is acceptable to eat ?
and thirdly , the fact that the people involved were perceived as quite normal , the fact that it was n't just them , but hundreds and thousands of people worldwide who are interested in cannibalism - this something that appeals to so many people . bildunterschrift : meiwes killed brandes in his house in a hamlet called wüstefeld near rotenburg in the central german state of hesse how did you go about writing the book ? i approached meiwes in prison , he wrote back a curt , type-written letter .
it was n't particularly friendly , he basically said that he would n't agree to be interviewed because he wanted to write his own book .
it was a bit of a relief .
so i talked to friends , acquaintances , people he 'd gone to school with , policemen , lawyers - anyone who had anything to do with him .
a lot of people were willing to talk about it .
neighbors were keen to talk about it because it maybe helped them understand , being able to talk about it with someone else .
i also checked out cannibal web sites and chat rooms , which were slightly disturbing , i must admit . was it difficult for you to deal with the subject for months ? it surprised me in some ways - i am a person who does get upset when i watch a horror movie , but i was able to distance myself more than i thought .
admittedly , i did find some chapters particularly gruesome .
i was n't allowed to see the video -lrb- depicting the slaughter -rrb- , but people described what happened .
that bit particularly was gruesome , detectives had to receive counseling because it was so disturbing . you include the brandes ' thoughts in your book .
where did you get that information ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd-jügen brandes it says in the front of the book that " the events in the book are real , or as close to real as humanly possible . "
a lot of it is from what meiwes told psychologists , what he said in court , and how psychologists said -lrb- brandes -rrb- would be thinking . meiwes has sold the rights to his story .
how do you feel about that ? in his letter , meiwes told me that if i were interested in being a ghost writer for his autobiography , i should apply to his lawyer .
i did n't want to do that .
i do n't think it 's quite right that he should be making money out of what he 's done .
it 's not helping him at all - here 's someone who needs help and it 's only going to fuel his ego .
he has stated that he no longer feels the need to eat another man .

he 's a former drug user himself .
today , he gives advice to people seeking to overcome addiction .

the first-phase strategy for 2005-2008 is based on a multi-disciplinary approach that foresees reducing demand and supply and steps up the fight against international drug traffickers . the action plan gives a timetable for a set of measures to be carried out at eu level by member states , in cooperation with third countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it includes general policy measures , specific programs aimed at the prevention of drug use among young people , in the workplace and in recreational settings , as well as measures for improving access to treatment programs , both for drug use and drug-related illness .
still a widespread problem the action plan is based on the results of an annual report published by the european monitoring center for drug addiction -lrb- emcdda -rrb- in lisbon .
according to the study , drugs claimed fewer lives in 2004 , but some two million people in europe still have a problem with drug addiction .
roland simon , who worked on the emcdda report , believes the action plan is definitely a step in the right direction .
" i feel the plan has a very sound basis , " he explained .
" it 's a very sensible idea to provide prevention and treatment for people who experiment with drug consumption before they slide too deep into addiction . "
moving away from criminalization one of the main problems support schemes face is financing .
the only projects eligible for eu funding are those that promote europe-wide cooperation .
that means that an initiative such as pauke has to depend on national or even district funding .
in times of economic gloom , these subsidies are the first to feel the pinch .
even so , roland simon is convinced a pan-european drug policy makes sense .
" the advantage of a unified policy , " he said , " is that you can combine targets and develop a common approach that can be pursued on a european-wide level . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the approach that forms the cornerstone of the action plan is that drug addicts are seen as people suffering from an illness rather than criminals .
instead of putting them behind bars , the plan is to refer them to organizations such as pauke and help them return to normal life .
karl-heinz bitzer also welcomes the eu 's new strategy .
" we 're very glad to see that in the last five years there 's been a move away from criminalizing drug users , " he said .

but will it help ? it 's midday at café pauke .
almost all the tables are occupied , and the waiters have their hands full .
most of the guests are workers from the nearby offices on their lunch break .
it 's also a popular haunt with students , drawn by a menu that 's cheaper but better than what 's on offer in their university canteen . little seems to set the café apart from all the other bistros in bonn , but there 's one crucial difference : from the cooks to the waiters , all the staff are former drug addicts . a run-away success karl-heinz bitzer is the manager of pauke 's drop-in counselling service .
he 's a former drug user himself .
today , he gives advice to people seeking to overcome addiction .
his services are in such demand , he even has to turn people away . " we have unbelievably long waiting lists , " he explained .
" applicants for our in-house therapy have to wait up to six months . " the therapy and employment programs provided by pauke are precisely what the eu wants to see more of . tackling drug abuse in mid-february , the european commission outlined a plan that set out an eu strategy to combat the increasing problems caused by drug trafficking and drug use .
the first-phase strategy for 2005-2008 is based on a multi-disciplinary approach that foresees reducing demand and supply and steps up the fight against international drug traffickers . the action plan gives a timetable for a set of measures to be carried out at eu level by member states , in cooperation with third countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it includes general policy measures , specific programs aimed at the prevention of drug use among young people , in the workplace and in recreational settings , as well as measures for improving access to treatment programs , both for drug use and drug-related illness .
still a widespread problem the action plan is based on the results of an annual report published by the european monitoring center for drug addiction -lrb- emcdda -rrb- in lisbon .
according to the study , drugs claimed fewer lives in 2004 , but some two million people in europe still have a problem with drug addiction .
roland simon , who worked on the emcdda report , believes the action plan is definitely a step in the right direction .
" i feel the plan has a very sound basis , " he explained .
" it 's a very sensible idea to provide prevention and treatment for people who experiment with drug consumption before they slide too deep into addiction . "
moving away from criminalization one of the main problems support schemes face is financing .
the only projects eligible for eu funding are those that promote europe-wide cooperation .
that means that an initiative such as pauke has to depend on national or even district funding .
in times of economic gloom , these subsidies are the first to feel the pinch .
even so , roland simon is convinced a pan-european drug policy makes sense .
" the advantage of a unified policy , " he said , " is that you can combine targets and develop a common approach that can be pursued on a european-wide level . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the approach that forms the cornerstone of the action plan is that drug addicts are seen as people suffering from an illness rather than criminals .
instead of putting them behind bars , the plan is to refer them to organizations such as pauke and help them return to normal life .
karl-heinz bitzer also welcomes the eu 's new strategy .
" we 're very glad to see that in the last five years there 's been a move away from criminalizing drug users , " he said .
" there 's greater tolerance of addiction and much better support structures .

" that view is shared by 42 percent in the 10 new states which joined the union last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people enter europe illegally by ship across the bloc , nearly half of the population opposed granting legal immigrants full civil rights .
but beate winkler , head of the vienna-based european monitoring center on racism and xenophobia , eumc , says that the majority of citizens are happy to live in multi-ethnic communities .
onus on governments the eumc encourages governments to introduce appropriate policies to help avoid hostilities and potential for conflict .
however , winkler asserted that some governments have either failed to address the problems or even deny that they exist .

the positive noises emanating from the summit suggested harmony but critics complained of issues swept under the carpet . russian president vladimir putin on friday was given a friendly reception by the leaders of france , germany and spain when they met for informal talks aimed at bolstering recently strained ties between moscow and the european union . french president jacques chirac invited german chancellor gerhard schröder and spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero to his elysee palace for the first-ever such meeting , after holding bilateral talks with putin . at a press conference after the 90-minute four-way session , the leaders said it had been a useful preparation for an eu-russian summit due in may .
" france , germany , spain and russia see in this relationship a way of ensuring ... the definitive establishment of peace , democracy and the rule of law across the whole of our continent , " chirac said . among the issues under discussion were the so-called four " common spaces " meant to guide eu-russian ties through 2007 - the economy , justice and internal security , external security , and education and culture , chirac said .
the leaders also touched on international affairs , including kosovo , iran , the middle east peace process , iraq and lebanon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder was welcomed by chirac on friday all four leaders were in agreement that iran should be prevented from developing nuclear weapons .
" we are working very closely on the iran question , " schröder said , dismissing any suggestion of differences even though russia has been supplying tehran with nuclear technology , saying it is for civilian purposes .
president chirac added that " there is no contradiction between the russian position and that of france and germany " when it came to iran . the leaders also agreed on a collective stand in favor of a complete withdrawal of syrian forces from lebanon .
" we have adopted a joint statement on lebanon , a communiqué , which , like the whole international community , insists on the compelling necessity to implement resolution 1559 , " chirac told the press conference , referring to united nations resolution 1559 which calls for a withdrawal which france co-sponsored with the united states .
putin 's agreement on the subject was particularly telling due to russia 's long-standing links with damascus . there was also unanimous agreement to maintain good contacts with the united states but chirac said the eu was " clearly for lifting the embargo " on arms sales to china .
washington wants the ban to remain . in keeping with all the positive news , which included an announcement that the four countries would meet again in the next two months , there was no explicit acknowledgement of the widespread international criticism of putin for flouting democratic norms in his handling of the chechen war , the press and business , as well as in his relations with ukraine and the baltic states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder , zapatero and chirac during a meeting in september 2004 in madrid zapatero said that in russia as elsewhere the best way to fight terrorism was " the force of reason , the force of the rule of law and international cooperation . " last month us president george w. bush publicly criticized russia 's democratic shortcomings at a meeting with putin in bratislava , indicating a new chill in the us-russian relationship . aides to chirac said the purpose of the informal gathering was to " hold out the hand of friendship to putin " to encourage him down the path of political and economic reforms . putin was making his first visit to the french capital since november 2003 , but he and chirac have seen each other several times in the interim - in 2004 at d-day commemorations in normandy and at the g8 summit , and in january at ceremonies marking the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz . the two presidents met with 35 russian writers attending the just-opened paris book fair - deemed safer than a visit to the fair itself , where putin could have faced protestors . after a private lunch , chirac accompanied putin on a visit to an air force base outside the capital , a gesture of reciprocity after the russian president took chirac to see a top secret russian space center last april . putin , chirac and schröder first forged their alliance two years ago when they spearheaded opposition to the us-led war in iraq .
chirac invited zapatero , whom he sees as a new ally in the european union , to join the group . but the meeting risked annoying leaders elsewhere in europe - notably in poland and the baltics - where any franco-german effort to set the agenda for the eu 's relations with russia would be strongly opposed . chirac 's office said other countries - and the european commission in brussels - should not feel slighted , as it was important to encourage all kinds of links with moscow . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin says he 's ready to talk in germany for a two-day visit , vladimir putin said he 's ready to work with the eu about the chechnya conflict and is prepared to answer questions about delicate subjects like ukraine and press freedom .

the positive noises emanating from the summit suggested harmony but critics complained of issues swept under the carpet . russian president vladimir putin on friday was given a friendly reception by the leaders of france , germany and spain when they met for informal talks aimed at bolstering recently strained ties between moscow and the european union . french president jacques chirac invited german chancellor gerhard schröder and spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero to his elysee palace for the first-ever such meeting , after holding bilateral talks with putin . at a press conference after the 90-minute four-way session , the leaders said it had been a useful preparation for an eu-russian summit due in may .
" france , germany , spain and russia see in this relationship a way of ensuring ... the definitive establishment of peace , democracy and the rule of law across the whole of our continent , " chirac said . among the issues under discussion were the so-called four " common spaces " meant to guide eu-russian ties through 2007 - the economy , justice and internal security , external security , and education and culture , chirac said .

" we are working very closely on the iran question , " schröder said , dismissing any suggestion of differences even though russia has been supplying tehran with nuclear technology , saying it is for civilian purposes .
president chirac added that " there is no contradiction between the russian position and that of france and germany " when it came to iran . the leaders also agreed on a collective stand in favor of a complete withdrawal of syrian forces from lebanon .
" we have adopted a joint statement on lebanon , a communiqué , which , like the whole international community , insists on the compelling necessity to implement resolution 1559 , " chirac told the press conference , referring to united nations resolution 1559 which calls for a withdrawal which france co-sponsored with the united states .

" last month us president george w. bush publicly criticized russia 's democratic shortcomings at a meeting with putin in bratislava , indicating a new chill in the us-russian relationship . aides to chirac said the purpose of the informal gathering was to " hold out the hand of friendship to putin " to encourage him down the path of political and economic reforms . putin was making his first visit to the french capital since november 2003 , but he and chirac have seen each other several times in the interim - in 2004 at d-day commemorations in normandy and at the g8 summit , and in january at ceremonies marking the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz . the two presidents met with 35 russian writers attending the just-opened paris book fair - deemed safer than a visit to the fair itself , where putin could have faced protestors . after a private lunch , chirac accompanied putin on a visit to an air force base outside the capital , a gesture of reciprocity after the russian president took chirac to see a top secret russian space center last april . putin , chirac and schröder first forged their alliance two years ago when they spearheaded opposition to the us-led war in iraq .
chirac invited zapatero , whom he sees as a new ally in the european union , to join the group . but the meeting risked annoying leaders elsewhere in europe - notably in poland and the baltics - where any franco-german effort to set the agenda for the eu 's relations with russia would be strongly opposed . chirac 's office said other countries - and the european commission in brussels - should not feel slighted , as it was important to encourage all kinds of links with moscow . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin says he 's ready to talk in germany for a two-day visit , vladimir putin said he 's ready to work with the eu about the chechnya conflict and is prepared to answer questions about delicate subjects like ukraine and press freedom .

in turkey , it 's even become a surprise best-seller . adolf hitler 's infamous - and notoriously badly-written - autobiography has sold more than 50,000 copies in turkey since january , and is currently number four on the best-seller list drawn up by the d & r bookstore chain . " ' mein kampf ' has always been a sleeper , a secret best-seller , " said oguz tektas of mefisto editions , one of several publishing houses to re-release the book hitler wrote while in jail in 1925 .
" we took it out of the closet for purely commercial reasons . " his company 's sole aim , he stressed , was " to make money , " which they did - by slashing the cover price . " mein kampf , " published by about a dozen companies over the years , always sold at a fairly steady annual rate of about 20,000 at some 20 new turkish lira -lrb- 11.3 euros or $ 15 -rrb- a copy .
the mefisto edition retails at 3.3 euros -lrb- $ 4.5 -rrb- and sold 23,000 copies in two months . turkish nationalism the readership ?
" those who want to know about a man who wreaked death and destruction on the world , " tektas said . " mostly young people , " said sami kilic , owner of the emre publishing house , another company on the " mein kampf " bandwagon , which sold 26,000 copies from a run of 31,000 released in late january . " the times we live in have a definite impact on sales , " kilic said .
" it is an astonishing phenomenon . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he linked interest in the book to turkey 's bid to join the european union , seen by the right-wing as a desertion of national values , and rising sentiment against the united states and its ally israel over the treatment they are perceived here as meting out to the iraqis and the palestinians , respectively . " this book , which does not contain a single ounce of humanity , unfortunately appears to be taken seriously in this country , " political scientist dogu ergil complained in a recent newspaper interview .
he agreed that the unexpected popularity of " mein kampf " in the muslim-majority country has its roots in a rise in anti-american sentiment sparked by the occupation of iraq and anti-semitism resulting from israel 's palestinian policy . " nazism , buried in the dustbin of history in europe , is beginning to re-emerge in turkey , " he warned . a rise in anti-semitism ? silvyo ovadya , the head of turkey 's jewish community , said he was " troubled " by the book 's popularity , telling afp he was " astonished a 500-page book that sows the seeds of racism and anti-semitism can sell at such a low price . "

" i fully agree with president chirac , we ca n't allow freedom in services to open the door to social dumping and to the disregard of safety standards in germany " and in europe , schröder said in a keynote speech to the lower house of german parliament , the bundestag . " we do n't only need law and order in the interior , we also need law and order on the labour market , " the chancellor said . under the so-called bolkestein directive , named after the former eu commissioner frits bolkestein who penned it , companies offering services throughout the 25 member states will be allowed to operate under the laws and regulations of their country of origin . companies would not have to pay local rate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in concrete terms , companies - from butchers to hairdressers and construction firms - from countries with lower taxes and fewer social regulations , notably in eastern europe , will be able to operate in higher-cost economies , but without being forced to pay their workers at the local rates . the supporters of the directive argue that such reforms are necessary if europe is to have a truly free market and wants to achieve its long-held dream of becoming as dynamic an economy as the united states . but france and germany , in particular , are up in arms over the proposals , with politicians , professional guilds and unions alike claiming they would place french and german companies at a disadvantage to rivals from new eu members in eastern europe .
the proposals would undermine sector-wide wage agreements and labour safety legislation , the critics argue . concern over germans being undercut bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with unemployment in germany currently at a post-war high point of 5.2 million or 12.6 percent of the workforce , opponents argue that allowing eastern european companies to undercut their western rivals with cheap labour will inevitably lead to even longer dole queues at home . in face of such arguments , chancellor schröder recently dropped his previous tacit support of the directive to suggest that the text should not only be amended , " but replaced by a new one " . the head of the eu commission , jose manuel barroso , specifically defended the country-of-origin rule on monday , accusing the directive 's critics of refusing to accept the consequences of eu enlargement . " some people think the european commission is there to protect the 15 against the new 10 - it is not , " he said .
" it is there to promote the general interest of europe . " chirac bangs the drum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but french president chirac hammered home his objections again on tuesday , saying " the draft directive on services is unacceptable to france and to other european partners and should be thoroughly reviewed . " chirac insisted that brussels must abide by its pledge to revise the text of the directive so that consensus could be reached .
" europe means the protection of social rights , it means fair conditions for competition , it means the development of public services and respect for cultural diversity , " chirac said .
in france the proposal is being used as an argument by people opposed to the european constitution . while not officially on the agenda of the upcoming eu summit in brussels next week , the issue will almost certainly be discussed by eu leaders there . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder reveals plan to boost eu economy german chancellor gerhard schröder has gone public with a plan aimed at adding fuel to the european internal market which he intends to put before fellow leaders at next week 's european union summit .

the proposals would undermine sector-wide wage agreements and labour safety legislation , the critics argue . concern over germans being undercut bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with unemployment in germany currently at a post-war high point of 5.2 million or 12.6 percent of the workforce , opponents argue that allowing eastern european companies to undercut their western rivals with cheap labour will inevitably lead to even longer dole queues at home . in face of such arguments , chancellor schröder recently dropped his previous tacit support of the directive to suggest that the text should not only be amended , " but replaced by a new one " . the head of the eu commission , jose manuel barroso , specifically defended the country-of-origin rule on monday , accusing the directive 's critics of refusing to accept the consequences of eu enlargement . " some people think the european commission is there to protect the 15 against the new 10 - it is not , " he said .
" it is there to promote the general interest of europe . " chirac bangs the drum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but french president chirac hammered home his objections again on tuesday , saying " the draft directive on services is unacceptable to france and to other european partners and should be thoroughly reviewed . " chirac insisted that brussels must abide by its pledge to revise the text of the directive so that consensus could be reached .
" europe means the protection of social rights , it means fair conditions for competition , it means the development of public services and respect for cultural diversity , " chirac said .
in france the proposal is being used as an argument by people opposed to the european constitution . while not officially on the agenda of the upcoming eu summit in brussels next week , the issue will almost certainly be discussed by eu leaders there . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder reveals plan to boost eu economy german chancellor gerhard schröder has gone public with a plan aimed at adding fuel to the european internal market which he intends to put before fellow leaders at next week 's european union summit .

at first glance , the german government 's reform program aimed at kick-starting a comatose economy and finding work for over five million jobless looks to be a monumental failure as gerhard schröder and the spd-green coalition seemingly lurch from crisis to crisis .
however , with the first round of hartz iv labor reforms coming into being at the start of the year , things look to be slowly changing .

" i fully agree with president chirac , we ca n't allow freedom in services to open the door to social dumping and to the disregard of safety standards in germany " and in europe , schröder said in a keynote speech to the lower house of german parliament , the bundestag . " we do n't only need law and order in the interior , we also need law and order on the labour market , " the chancellor said . under the so-called bolkestein directive , named after the former eu commissioner frits bolkestein who penned it , companies offering services throughout the 25 member states will be allowed to operate under the laws and regulations of their country of origin . companies would not have to pay local rate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in concrete terms , companies - from butchers to hairdressers and construction firms - from countries with lower taxes and fewer social regulations , notably in eastern europe , will be able to operate in higher-cost economies , but without being forced to pay their workers at the local rates . the supporters of the directive argue that such reforms are necessary if europe is to have a truly free market and wants to achieve its long-held dream of becoming as dynamic an economy as the united states . but france and germany , in particular , are up in arms over the proposals , with politicians , professional guilds and unions alike claiming they would place french and german companies at a disadvantage to rivals from new eu members in eastern europe .
the proposals would undermine sector-wide wage agreements and labour safety legislation , the critics argue . concern over germans being undercut bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with unemployment in germany currently at a post-war high point of 5.2 million or 12.6 percent of the workforce , opponents argue that allowing eastern european companies to undercut their western rivals with cheap labour will inevitably lead to even longer dole queues at home . in face of such arguments , chancellor schröder recently dropped his previous tacit support of the directive to suggest that the text should not only be amended , " but replaced by a new one " . the head of the eu commission , jose manuel barroso , specifically defended the country-of-origin rule on monday , accusing the directive 's critics of refusing to accept the consequences of eu enlargement . " some people think the european commission is there to protect the 15 against the new 10 - it is not , " he said .
" it is there to promote the general interest of europe . " chirac bangs the drum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but french president chirac hammered home his objections again on tuesday , saying " the draft directive on services is unacceptable to france and to other european partners and should be thoroughly reviewed . " chirac insisted that brussels must abide by its pledge to revise the text of the directive so that consensus could be reached .
" europe means the protection of social rights , it means fair conditions for competition , it means the development of public services and respect for cultural diversity , " chirac said .

as the third summit of interior ministers and high-ranking government officials from the 46-member council of europe enters its last day in warsaw , talks continue to focus on tackling terrorism and organized crime . polish president aleksander kwasniewski warned council of europe member states friday against paralyzing democracy in the fight against organised crime and terrorism . " we must be careful to avoid that the fight against terrorism and organized crime do not paralyze the smooth functioning of a normal democratic society .
we must not lose what constitutes the basis of a democratic society , " said kwasniewski , whose country has chaired the council 's committee of ministers since november . " given that criminal activity transcends national borders , we must reinforce cooperation among our intelligence services and better control the flow of people and merchandise , " kwasniewski told the meeting in warsaw .
but he stressed that any moves to clamp down on organized crime and terrorism must be taken with respect for individual freedoms . developing strategies ministerial-level meetings at the conference are being held behind closed doors and are focussing on special investigative techniques , the protection of witnesses , money laundering and the financing of terrorism . the officials are also debating two draft conventions aimed at nipping in the bud terrorism and other forms of serious crime in the early , preparative stages . the draft convention on the prevention of terrorism proposes criminalizing acts deemed as laying the groundwork for a terrorist attack , such as provocation of terrorism , recruitment and training . " we ca n't wait for another madrid " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british member of the council of europe terry davis , points the scoreboard after being elected as new secretary general of the council of europe , tuesday , june 22 , 2004 in strasbourg , eastern france .
terry davis will replace austria 's walter schwimmer for the next five years .
-lrb- ap photo / christian lutz -rrb- on thursday , the council 's secretary general terry davis -lrb- photo -rrb- urged delegates to move quickly and decisively against terrorism . " we ca n't wait for another madrid or beslan , " he said , calling on delegates " to provide a message of support for the new instruments " being debated at the two-day meeting . more than 340 people died , half of them children , when a standoff between law enforcement authorities and hostage-takers who had herded more than 1,000 students and teachers into a school in the southern russian town of beslan last september ended in a chaotic shootout . the bombing of four madrid commuter trains on march 11 last year killed 191 people and injured over 1,900 . fleshing out the anti-terror convention negotiating the terms of the anti-terror convention , expected to be ready by may , showed " how difficult it can be to enhance the efficiency of the fight against terrorism at the same time as safeguarding fundamental human rights , " said davis , a former british lawmaker .
" but it has also shown that it is possible to reconcile these twin objectives . " " terrorism is an attack on human rights , " he went on .
" however , while tackling terrorism , we must be careful not to undermine human rights , " he said . davis said he expected recommendations on the topics debated by the conference as well as the new conventions to be adopted by the end of the month .
they will then be presented to a summit of council of europe heads of state and government due to be held in warsaw in may . in addition to its 46 members , five states which have observer status on the council of europe were also represented at the meeting : canada , japan , mexico , the united states and the vatican . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a day of infamy in spain after a series of explosions in madrid killed close to 200 people and wounded more than 1,400 , spanish officials are still uncertain who is behind the worst terrorist attack in the country 's history . -lrb- march 12 , 2004 -rrb- madrid hosts anti-terror summit an international symposium on the fight against terrorism begins in madrid on tuesday , a year on from the devastating bombings which ripped through the spanish capital on march 11 , 2004 . -lrb- march 8 , 2005 -rrb- british labor mp elected to head council of europe british labor parliamentarian terry davis beat out two other candidates to be elected the new secretary general of europe 's top human rights organization , the 45-nation council of europe . -lrb- june 23 , 2004 -rrb- feedback do you think the fight against terror risks undermining human rights ?

in turkey , it 's even become a surprise best-seller . adolf hitler 's infamous - and notoriously badly-written - autobiography has sold more than 50,000 copies in turkey since january , and is currently number four on the best-seller list drawn up by the d & r bookstore chain . " ' mein kampf ' has always been a sleeper , a secret best-seller , " said oguz tektas of mefisto editions , one of several publishing houses to re-release the book hitler wrote while in jail in 1925 .
" we took it out of the closet for purely commercial reasons . " his company 's sole aim , he stressed , was " to make money , " which they did - by slashing the cover price . " mein kampf , " published by about a dozen companies over the years , always sold at a fairly steady annual rate of about 20,000 at some 20 new turkish lira -lrb- 11.3 euros or $ 15 -rrb- a copy .
the mefisto edition retails at 3.3 euros -lrb- $ 4.5 -rrb- and sold 23,000 copies in two months . turkish nationalism the readership ?
" those who want to know about a man who wreaked death and destruction on the world , " tektas said . " mostly young people , " said sami kilic , owner of the emre publishing house , another company on the " mein kampf " bandwagon , which sold 26,000 copies from a run of 31,000 released in late january . " the times we live in have a definite impact on sales , " kilic said .
" it is an astonishing phenomenon . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he linked interest in the book to turkey 's bid to join the european union , seen by the right-wing as a desertion of national values , and rising sentiment against the united states and its ally israel over the treatment they are perceived here as meting out to the iraqis and the palestinians , respectively . " this book , which does not contain a single ounce of humanity , unfortunately appears to be taken seriously in this country , " political scientist dogu ergil complained in a recent newspaper interview .
he agreed that the unexpected popularity of " mein kampf " in the muslim-majority country has its roots in a rise in anti-american sentiment sparked by the occupation of iraq and anti-semitism resulting from israel 's palestinian policy . " nazism , buried in the dustbin of history in europe , is beginning to re-emerge in turkey , " he warned . a rise in anti-semitism ? silvyo ovadya , the head of turkey 's jewish community , said he was " troubled " by the book 's popularity , telling afp he was " astonished a 500-page book that sows the seeds of racism and anti-semitism can sell at such a low price . "
but , he said , his complaints to the publishers have gone unheeded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : * * archiv * * burnt vehicles are seen after an explosion outside of the neve shalom synagogue in istanbul , turkey , on nov .

just weeks after polish publication of the book made headlines in bavaria , which holds the rights , the czech supreme court acquitted michal zitko , a publisher who had been convicted of supporting a movement aimed at suppressing human rights by publishing a czech translation of " mein kampf . " last january , prague city court gave him a three-year suspended sentence , which was then overturned by the higher court in brno .

the editor was questioned by officials with the azeri interior ministry 's anti-organized crime department .
zeynalli said he had translated " mein kampf " into azeri from the turkish language and had placed an order with a printing house for the publication of 300 copies , 100 of which had already been printed . he argued that the publication of " mein kampf , " which openly advocates extermining the jews , was not banned in azerbaijan . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de row erupts over hitler book in poland the polish publication of hitler 's " mein kampf " has angered bavaria , which holds the rights .

" our shareholder structure has radically changed in three months since we launched our bid , " breuer told the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" we now have new major shareholders who have said that they want to remain shareholders .
so the moment has come for us to invite them to take a seat on the supervisory board . " nevertheless , breuer said he would prefer if the new nominations could wait until a new supervisory board was appointed in 2006 rather than forcing current board members to leave prematurely which would make any shake-up appear unnecessarily " dramatic and spectacular . " share buy-back program ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frankfurt stock exchange is part of deutsche börse in addition , deutsche börse was considering launching a share buy-back program over a number of years , as demanded by the rebel shareholders , including funds tci , atticus capital and fidelity investment , in recent weeks , breuer hinted . asked about such a possibility in the interview , breuer replied that the management board was " drawing up a concept . " it will emerge that we 're currently overcapitalized and that the mix of own equity and outside capital is not correct , " he said .
" the management board will propose to the supervisory board what sort of capital structure it wants in the coming years . " he did not specify exactly how big the share buy-back program could be .
but the frankfurt daily suggested it could be as much as 700 million euros -lrb- $ 935 million -rrb- , which corresponds to the current level of deutsche börse 's cash reserves . börse officials tight-lipped a deutsche börse spokesman refused to be drawn on the figure . " what we have said so far is that deutsche börse will return a significant amount of cash back to its shareholders and that we have about 700 million euros in cash available , " he said .

" our shareholder structure has radically changed in three months since we launched our bid , " breuer told the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" we now have new major shareholders who have said that they want to remain shareholders .
so the moment has come for us to invite them to take a seat on the supervisory board . " nevertheless , breuer said he would prefer if the new nominations could wait until a new supervisory board was appointed in 2006 rather than forcing current board members to leave prematurely which would make any shake-up appear unnecessarily " dramatic and spectacular . " share buy-back program ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frankfurt stock exchange is part of deutsche börse in addition , deutsche börse was considering launching a share buy-back program over a number of years , as demanded by the rebel shareholders , including funds tci , atticus capital and fidelity investment , in recent weeks , breuer hinted . asked about such a possibility in the interview , breuer replied that the management board was " drawing up a concept . " it will emerge that we 're currently overcapitalized and that the mix of own equity and outside capital is not correct , " he said .
" the management board will propose to the supervisory board what sort of capital structure it wants in the coming years . " he did not specify exactly how big the share buy-back program could be .
but the frankfurt daily suggested it could be as much as 700 million euros -lrb- $ 935 million -rrb- , which corresponds to the current level of deutsche börse 's cash reserves . börse officials tight-lipped a deutsche börse spokesman refused to be drawn on the figure . " what we have said so far is that deutsche börse will return a significant amount of cash back to its shareholders and that we have about 700 million euros in cash available , " he said .
" we have not said the amount we are returning . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new london stock exchange when deutsche börse announced that it was withdrawing its bid for the lse , it said that it had decided to transfer to shareholders " a significant proportion " of the cash reserves it has set aside to finance the takeover . but it did specify exactly how it intended to do so or exactly how much would be transferred to shareholders . speculation of a big cash payout drove deutsche börse shares higher on the frankfurt stock exchange on friday .

as the third summit of interior ministers and high-ranking government officials from the 46-member council of europe enters its last day in warsaw , talks continue to focus on tackling terrorism and organized crime . polish president aleksander kwasniewski warned council of europe member states friday against paralyzing democracy in the fight against organised crime and terrorism . " we must be careful to avoid that the fight against terrorism and organized crime do not paralyze the smooth functioning of a normal democratic society .
we must not lose what constitutes the basis of a democratic society , " said kwasniewski , whose country has chaired the council 's committee of ministers since november . " given that criminal activity transcends national borders , we must reinforce cooperation among our intelligence services and better control the flow of people and merchandise , " kwasniewski told the meeting in warsaw .
but he stressed that any moves to clamp down on organized crime and terrorism must be taken with respect for individual freedoms . developing strategies ministerial-level meetings at the conference are being held behind closed doors and are focussing on special investigative techniques , the protection of witnesses , money laundering and the financing of terrorism . the officials are also debating two draft conventions aimed at nipping in the bud terrorism and other forms of serious crime in the early , preparative stages . the draft convention on the prevention of terrorism proposes criminalizing acts deemed as laying the groundwork for a terrorist attack , such as provocation of terrorism , recruitment and training .

" but it has also shown that it is possible to reconcile these twin objectives . " " terrorism is an attack on human rights , " he went on .
" however , while tackling terrorism , we must be careful not to undermine human rights , " he said . davis said he expected recommendations on the topics debated by the conference as well as the new conventions to be adopted by the end of the month .

" our shareholder structure has radically changed in three months since we launched our bid , " breuer told the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" we now have new major shareholders who have said that they want to remain shareholders .
so the moment has come for us to invite them to take a seat on the supervisory board . " nevertheless , breuer said he would prefer if the new nominations could wait until a new supervisory board was appointed in 2006 rather than forcing current board members to leave prematurely which would make any shake-up appear unnecessarily " dramatic and spectacular . " share buy-back program ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frankfurt stock exchange is part of deutsche börse in addition , deutsche börse was considering launching a share buy-back program over a number of years , as demanded by the rebel shareholders , including funds tci , atticus capital and fidelity investment , in recent weeks , breuer hinted . asked about such a possibility in the interview , breuer replied that the management board was " drawing up a concept . " it will emerge that we 're currently overcapitalized and that the mix of own equity and outside capital is not correct , " he said .
" the management board will propose to the supervisory board what sort of capital structure it wants in the coming years . " he did not specify exactly how big the share buy-back program could be .
but the frankfurt daily suggested it could be as much as 700 million euros -lrb- $ 935 million -rrb- , which corresponds to the current level of deutsche börse 's cash reserves . börse officials tight-lipped a deutsche börse spokesman refused to be drawn on the figure . " what we have said so far is that deutsche börse will return a significant amount of cash back to its shareholders and that we have about 700 million euros in cash available , " he said .

" we must be careful to avoid that the fight against terrorism and organized crime do not paralyze the smooth functioning of a normal democratic society .
we must not lose what constitutes the basis of a democratic society , " said kwasniewski , whose country has chaired the council 's committee of ministers since november . " given that criminal activity transcends national borders , we must reinforce cooperation among our intelligence services and better control the flow of people and merchandise , " kwasniewski told the meeting in warsaw .
but he stressed that any moves to clamp down on organized crime and terrorism must be taken with respect for individual freedoms . developing strategies ministerial-level meetings at the conference are being held behind closed doors and are focussing on special investigative techniques , the protection of witnesses , money laundering and the financing of terrorism . the officials are also debating two draft conventions aimed at nipping in the bud terrorism and other forms of serious crime in the early , preparative stages . the draft convention on the prevention of terrorism proposes criminalizing acts deemed as laying the groundwork for a terrorist attack , such as provocation of terrorism , recruitment and training .

victims ' rights activists worry financial rewards for crimes might provoke copy cats , but government officials disagree . günter stampf 's past client include celebrities such as former soviet leader michail gorbatchev and german starlet verona feldbusch .
he recently secured another high-profile client for his media production company . after months of negotiations , stampf received exclusive rights for a television documentary about meiwes , who is serving a sentence of eight years and six months in prison for killing and eating another man .
a book is to follow and meiwes has declined requests to be interviewed as a result . " the documentary , in which mr. meiwes will talk for the first time , will be supported by a number of well known scientists and experts , " an announcement on stampf 's web site reads .
" the serious and journalistic documentary will try to explain what lead to this murder . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arno funke , also known as " dagobert , " became famous for blackmailing a german department store chain .
he said book sales did n't even cover trial costs sensationalist coverage of meiwes ' cannibalism , however , is n't the only reason victims ' rights advocates in germany have called for legislation to prevent other criminals , such as german blackmailer " dagobert " -lrb- photo -rrb- , from cashing in on their story .
they also argue that rewarding convicts for their actions might entice others to follow suit . celebrity criminals ? " there 's a danger that someone only commits a crime to become famous in order to make money , " said veit schiemann , a spokesman for white ring , a german victims ' rights group .
" people might rob a bank in the most gruesome way in order to be able to sell the story afterwards . " last june , germany 's state justice ministers unanimously asked the federal government to introduce legislation that would ban criminals from selling their stories .
but neither the state ministers , who are in the midst of discussing a complete overhaul of germany 's justice system , nor the federal ministry saw a need to act swiftly on the matter . henning plöger , a spokesman for the german justice ministry , said no legislation was planned , adding that a 1998 law already gave crime victims the right to lay claim to any money criminals make from selling their story . " sometimes it 's desirable that a criminal finds a way to make money lawfully in order to be able to compensate victims , " plöger said . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cannibal convicted of manslaughter one of the most sensational trials in german legal history ended on friday when judges convicted self-confessed cannibal , armin meiwes , to eight years and six months in prison .

the positive noises emanating from the summit suggested harmony but critics complained of issues swept under the carpet . russian president vladimir putin on friday was given a friendly reception by the leaders of france , germany and spain when they met for informal talks aimed at bolstering recently strained ties between moscow and the european union . french president jacques chirac invited german chancellor gerhard schröder and spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero to his elysee palace for the first-ever such meeting , after holding bilateral talks with putin . at a press conference after the 90-minute four-way session , the leaders said it had been a useful preparation for an eu-russian summit due in may .
" france , germany , spain and russia see in this relationship a way of ensuring ... the definitive establishment of peace , democracy and the rule of law across the whole of our continent , " chirac said . among the issues under discussion were the so-called four " common spaces " meant to guide eu-russian ties through 2007 - the economy , justice and internal security , external security , and education and culture , chirac said .
the leaders also touched on international affairs , including kosovo , iran , the middle east peace process , iraq and lebanon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder was welcomed by chirac on friday all four leaders were in agreement that iran should be prevented from developing nuclear weapons .
" we are working very closely on the iran question , " schröder said , dismissing any suggestion of differences even though russia has been supplying tehran with nuclear technology , saying it is for civilian purposes .
president chirac added that " there is no contradiction between the russian position and that of france and germany " when it came to iran . the leaders also agreed on a collective stand in favor of a complete withdrawal of syrian forces from lebanon .
" we have adopted a joint statement on lebanon , a communiqué , which , like the whole international community , insists on the compelling necessity to implement resolution 1559 , " chirac told the press conference , referring to united nations resolution 1559 which calls for a withdrawal which france co-sponsored with the united states .
putin 's agreement on the subject was particularly telling due to russia 's long-standing links with damascus . there was also unanimous agreement to maintain good contacts with the united states but chirac said the eu was " clearly for lifting the embargo " on arms sales to china .
washington wants the ban to remain . in keeping with all the positive news , which included an announcement that the four countries would meet again in the next two months , there was no explicit acknowledgement of the widespread international criticism of putin for flouting democratic norms in his handling of the chechen war , the press and business , as well as in his relations with ukraine and the baltic states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder , zapatero and chirac during a meeting in september 2004 in madrid zapatero said that in russia as elsewhere the best way to fight terrorism was " the force of reason , the force of the rule of law and international cooperation . " last month us president george w. bush publicly criticized russia 's democratic shortcomings at a meeting with putin in bratislava , indicating a new chill in the us-russian relationship . aides to chirac said the purpose of the informal gathering was to " hold out the hand of friendship to putin " to encourage him down the path of political and economic reforms . putin was making his first visit to the french capital since november 2003 , but he and chirac have seen each other several times in the interim - in 2004 at d-day commemorations in normandy and at the g8 summit , and in january at ceremonies marking the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz . the two presidents met with 35 russian writers attending the just-opened paris book fair - deemed safer than a visit to the fair itself , where putin could have faced protestors . after a private lunch , chirac accompanied putin on a visit to an air force base outside the capital , a gesture of reciprocity after the russian president took chirac to see a top secret russian space center last april . putin , chirac and schröder first forged their alliance two years ago when they spearheaded opposition to the us-led war in iraq .
chirac invited zapatero , whom he sees as a new ally in the european union , to join the group . but the meeting risked annoying leaders elsewhere in europe - notably in poland and the baltics - where any franco-german effort to set the agenda for the eu 's relations with russia would be strongly opposed . chirac 's office said other countries - and the european commission in brussels - should not feel slighted , as it was important to encourage all kinds of links with moscow . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin says he 's ready to talk in germany for a two-day visit , vladimir putin said he 's ready to work with the eu about the chechnya conflict and is prepared to answer questions about delicate subjects like ukraine and press freedom .

the positive noises emanating from the summit suggested harmony but critics complained of issues swept under the carpet . russian president vladimir putin on friday was given a friendly reception by the leaders of france , germany and spain when they met for informal talks aimed at bolstering recently strained ties between moscow and the european union . french president jacques chirac invited german chancellor gerhard schröder and spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero to his elysee palace for the first-ever such meeting , after holding bilateral talks with putin . at a press conference after the 90-minute four-way session , the leaders said it had been a useful preparation for an eu-russian summit due in may .
" france , germany , spain and russia see in this relationship a way of ensuring ... the definitive establishment of peace , democracy and the rule of law across the whole of our continent , " chirac said . among the issues under discussion were the so-called four " common spaces " meant to guide eu-russian ties through 2007 - the economy , justice and internal security , external security , and education and culture , chirac said .
the leaders also touched on international affairs , including kosovo , iran , the middle east peace process , iraq and lebanon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder was welcomed by chirac on friday all four leaders were in agreement that iran should be prevented from developing nuclear weapons .
" we are working very closely on the iran question , " schröder said , dismissing any suggestion of differences even though russia has been supplying tehran with nuclear technology , saying it is for civilian purposes .
president chirac added that " there is no contradiction between the russian position and that of france and germany " when it came to iran . the leaders also agreed on a collective stand in favor of a complete withdrawal of syrian forces from lebanon .
" we have adopted a joint statement on lebanon , a communiqué , which , like the whole international community , insists on the compelling necessity to implement resolution 1559 , " chirac told the press conference , referring to united nations resolution 1559 which calls for a withdrawal which france co-sponsored with the united states .
putin 's agreement on the subject was particularly telling due to russia 's long-standing links with damascus . there was also unanimous agreement to maintain good contacts with the united states but chirac said the eu was " clearly for lifting the embargo " on arms sales to china .
washington wants the ban to remain . in keeping with all the positive news , which included an announcement that the four countries would meet again in the next two months , there was no explicit acknowledgement of the widespread international criticism of putin for flouting democratic norms in his handling of the chechen war , the press and business , as well as in his relations with ukraine and the baltic states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder , zapatero and chirac during a meeting in september 2004 in madrid zapatero said that in russia as elsewhere the best way to fight terrorism was " the force of reason , the force of the rule of law and international cooperation . " last month us president george w. bush publicly criticized russia 's democratic shortcomings at a meeting with putin in bratislava , indicating a new chill in the us-russian relationship . aides to chirac said the purpose of the informal gathering was to " hold out the hand of friendship to putin " to encourage him down the path of political and economic reforms . putin was making his first visit to the french capital since november 2003 , but he and chirac have seen each other several times in the interim - in 2004 at d-day commemorations in normandy and at the g8 summit , and in january at ceremonies marking the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz . the two presidents met with 35 russian writers attending the just-opened paris book fair - deemed safer than a visit to the fair itself , where putin could have faced protestors . after a private lunch , chirac accompanied putin on a visit to an air force base outside the capital , a gesture of reciprocity after the russian president took chirac to see a top secret russian space center last april . putin , chirac and schröder first forged their alliance two years ago when they spearheaded opposition to the us-led war in iraq .
chirac invited zapatero , whom he sees as a new ally in the european union , to join the group . but the meeting risked annoying leaders elsewhere in europe - notably in poland and the baltics - where any franco-german effort to set the agenda for the eu 's relations with russia would be strongly opposed . chirac 's office said other countries - and the european commission in brussels - should not feel slighted , as it was important to encourage all kinds of links with moscow . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin says he 's ready to talk in germany for a two-day visit , vladimir putin said he 's ready to work with the eu about the chechnya conflict and is prepared to answer questions about delicate subjects like ukraine and press freedom .

" i fully agree with president chirac , we ca n't allow freedom in services to open the door to social dumping and to the disregard of safety standards in germany " and in europe , schröder said in a keynote speech to the lower house of german parliament , the bundestag . " we do n't only need law and order in the interior , we also need law and order on the labour market , " the chancellor said . under the so-called bolkestein directive , named after the former eu commissioner frits bolkestein who penned it , companies offering services throughout the 25 member states will be allowed to operate under the laws and regulations of their country of origin . companies would not have to pay local rate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in concrete terms , companies - from butchers to hairdressers and construction firms - from countries with lower taxes and fewer social regulations , notably in eastern europe , will be able to operate in higher-cost economies , but without being forced to pay their workers at the local rates . the supporters of the directive argue that such reforms are necessary if europe is to have a truly free market and wants to achieve its long-held dream of becoming as dynamic an economy as the united states . but france and germany , in particular , are up in arms over the proposals , with politicians , professional guilds and unions alike claiming they would place french and german companies at a disadvantage to rivals from new eu members in eastern europe .
the proposals would undermine sector-wide wage agreements and labour safety legislation , the critics argue . concern over germans being undercut bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with unemployment in germany currently at a post-war high point of 5.2 million or 12.6 percent of the workforce , opponents argue that allowing eastern european companies to undercut their western rivals with cheap labour will inevitably lead to even longer dole queues at home . in face of such arguments , chancellor schröder recently dropped his previous tacit support of the directive to suggest that the text should not only be amended , " but replaced by a new one " . the head of the eu commission , jose manuel barroso , specifically defended the country-of-origin rule on monday , accusing the directive 's critics of refusing to accept the consequences of eu enlargement . " some people think the european commission is there to protect the 15 against the new 10 - it is not , " he said .
" it is there to promote the general interest of europe . " chirac bangs the drum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but french president chirac hammered home his objections again on tuesday , saying " the draft directive on services is unacceptable to france and to other european partners and should be thoroughly reviewed . " chirac insisted that brussels must abide by its pledge to revise the text of the directive so that consensus could be reached .
" europe means the protection of social rights , it means fair conditions for competition , it means the development of public services and respect for cultural diversity , " chirac said .
in france the proposal is being used as an argument by people opposed to the european constitution . while not officially on the agenda of the upcoming eu summit in brussels next week , the issue will almost certainly be discussed by eu leaders there . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder reveals plan to boost eu economy german chancellor gerhard schröder has gone public with a plan aimed at adding fuel to the european internal market which he intends to put before fellow leaders at next week 's european union summit .

" our shareholder structure has radically changed in three months since we launched our bid , " breuer told the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" we now have new major shareholders who have said that they want to remain shareholders .
so the moment has come for us to invite them to take a seat on the supervisory board . " nevertheless , breuer said he would prefer if the new nominations could wait until a new supervisory board was appointed in 2006 rather than forcing current board members to leave prematurely which would make any shake-up appear unnecessarily " dramatic and spectacular . " share buy-back program ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frankfurt stock exchange is part of deutsche börse in addition , deutsche börse was considering launching a share buy-back program over a number of years , as demanded by the rebel shareholders , including funds tci , atticus capital and fidelity investment , in recent weeks , breuer hinted . asked about such a possibility in the interview , breuer replied that the management board was " drawing up a concept . " it will emerge that we 're currently overcapitalized and that the mix of own equity and outside capital is not correct , " he said .
" the management board will propose to the supervisory board what sort of capital structure it wants in the coming years . " he did not specify exactly how big the share buy-back program could be .
but the frankfurt daily suggested it could be as much as 700 million euros -lrb- $ 935 million -rrb- , which corresponds to the current level of deutsche börse 's cash reserves . börse officials tight-lipped a deutsche börse spokesman refused to be drawn on the figure . " what we have said so far is that deutsche börse will return a significant amount of cash back to its shareholders and that we have about 700 million euros in cash available , " he said .
" we have not said the amount we are returning . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new london stock exchange when deutsche börse announced that it was withdrawing its bid for the lse , it said that it had decided to transfer to shareholders " a significant proportion " of the cash reserves it has set aside to finance the takeover . but it did specify exactly how it intended to do so or exactly how much would be transferred to shareholders . speculation of a big cash payout drove deutsche börse shares higher on the frankfurt stock exchange on friday .

as the third summit of interior ministers and high-ranking government officials from the 46-member council of europe enters its last day in warsaw , talks continue to focus on tackling terrorism and organized crime . polish president aleksander kwasniewski warned council of europe member states friday against paralyzing democracy in the fight against organised crime and terrorism . " we must be careful to avoid that the fight against terrorism and organized crime do not paralyze the smooth functioning of a normal democratic society .
we must not lose what constitutes the basis of a democratic society , " said kwasniewski , whose country has chaired the council 's committee of ministers since november . " given that criminal activity transcends national borders , we must reinforce cooperation among our intelligence services and better control the flow of people and merchandise , " kwasniewski told the meeting in warsaw .
but he stressed that any moves to clamp down on organized crime and terrorism must be taken with respect for individual freedoms . developing strategies ministerial-level meetings at the conference are being held behind closed doors and are focussing on special investigative techniques , the protection of witnesses , money laundering and the financing of terrorism . the officials are also debating two draft conventions aimed at nipping in the bud terrorism and other forms of serious crime in the early , preparative stages . the draft convention on the prevention of terrorism proposes criminalizing acts deemed as laying the groundwork for a terrorist attack , such as provocation of terrorism , recruitment and training . " we ca n't wait for another madrid " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british member of the council of europe terry davis , points the scoreboard after being elected as new secretary general of the council of europe , tuesday , june 22 , 2004 in strasbourg , eastern france .
terry davis will replace austria 's walter schwimmer for the next five years .
-lrb- ap photo / christian lutz -rrb- on thursday , the council 's secretary general terry davis -lrb- photo -rrb- urged delegates to move quickly and decisively against terrorism . " we ca n't wait for another madrid or beslan , " he said , calling on delegates " to provide a message of support for the new instruments " being debated at the two-day meeting . more than 340 people died , half of them children , when a standoff between law enforcement authorities and hostage-takers who had herded more than 1,000 students and teachers into a school in the southern russian town of beslan last september ended in a chaotic shootout . the bombing of four madrid commuter trains on march 11 last year killed 191 people and injured over 1,900 . fleshing out the anti-terror convention negotiating the terms of the anti-terror convention , expected to be ready by may , showed " how difficult it can be to enhance the efficiency of the fight against terrorism at the same time as safeguarding fundamental human rights , " said davis , a former british lawmaker .
" but it has also shown that it is possible to reconcile these twin objectives . " " terrorism is an attack on human rights , " he went on .
" however , while tackling terrorism , we must be careful not to undermine human rights , " he said . davis said he expected recommendations on the topics debated by the conference as well as the new conventions to be adopted by the end of the month .
they will then be presented to a summit of council of europe heads of state and government due to be held in warsaw in may . in addition to its 46 members , five states which have observer status on the council of europe were also represented at the meeting : canada , japan , mexico , the united states and the vatican . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a day of infamy in spain after a series of explosions in madrid killed close to 200 people and wounded more than 1,400 , spanish officials are still uncertain who is behind the worst terrorist attack in the country 's history . -lrb- march 12 , 2004 -rrb- madrid hosts anti-terror summit an international symposium on the fight against terrorism begins in madrid on tuesday , a year on from the devastating bombings which ripped through the spanish capital on march 11 , 2004 . -lrb- march 8 , 2005 -rrb- british labor mp elected to head council of europe british labor parliamentarian terry davis beat out two other candidates to be elected the new secretary general of europe 's top human rights organization , the 45-nation council of europe . -lrb- june 23 , 2004 -rrb- 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

victims ' rights activists worry financial rewards for crimes might provoke copy cats , but government officials disagree . günter stampf 's past client include celebrities such as former soviet leader michail gorbatchev and german starlet verona feldbusch .
he recently secured another high-profile client for his media production company . after months of negotiations , stampf received exclusive rights for a television documentary about meiwes , who is serving a sentence of eight years and six months in prison for killing and eating another man .
a book is to follow and meiwes has declined requests to be interviewed as a result . " the documentary , in which mr. meiwes will talk for the first time , will be supported by a number of well known scientists and experts , " an announcement on stampf 's web site reads .
" the serious and journalistic documentary will try to explain what lead to this murder . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arno funke , also known as " dagobert , " became famous for blackmailing a german department store chain .
he said book sales did n't even cover trial costs sensationalist coverage of meiwes ' cannibalism , however , is n't the only reason victims ' rights advocates in germany have called for legislation to prevent other criminals , such as german blackmailer " dagobert " -lrb- photo -rrb- , from cashing in on their story .
they also argue that rewarding convicts for their actions might entice others to follow suit . celebrity criminals ? " there 's a danger that someone only commits a crime to become famous in order to make money , " said veit schiemann , a spokesman for white ring , a german victims ' rights group .
" people might rob a bank in the most gruesome way in order to be able to sell the story afterwards . " last june , germany 's state justice ministers unanimously asked the federal government to introduce legislation that would ban criminals from selling their stories .
but neither the state ministers , who are in the midst of discussing a complete overhaul of germany 's justice system , nor the federal ministry saw a need to act swiftly on the matter . henning plöger , a spokesman for the german justice ministry , said no legislation was planned , adding that a 1998 law already gave crime victims the right to lay claim to any money criminals make from selling their story . " sometimes it 's desirable that a criminal finds a way to make money lawfully in order to be able to compensate victims , " plöger said . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cannibal convicted of manslaughter one of the most sensational trials in german legal history ended on friday when judges convicted self-confessed cannibal , armin meiwes , to eight years and six months in prison .

as the third summit of interior ministers and high-ranking government officials from the 46-member council of europe enters its last day in warsaw , talks continue to focus on tackling terrorism and organized crime . polish president aleksander kwasniewski warned council of europe member states friday against paralyzing democracy in the fight against organised crime and terrorism . " we must be careful to avoid that the fight against terrorism and organized crime do not paralyze the smooth functioning of a normal democratic society .
we must not lose what constitutes the basis of a democratic society , " said kwasniewski , whose country has chaired the council 's committee of ministers since november . " given that criminal activity transcends national borders , we must reinforce cooperation among our intelligence services and better control the flow of people and merchandise , " kwasniewski told the meeting in warsaw .
but he stressed that any moves to clamp down on organized crime and terrorism must be taken with respect for individual freedoms . developing strategies ministerial-level meetings at the conference are being held behind closed doors and are focussing on special investigative techniques , the protection of witnesses , money laundering and the financing of terrorism . the officials are also debating two draft conventions aimed at nipping in the bud terrorism and other forms of serious crime in the early , preparative stages . the draft convention on the prevention of terrorism proposes criminalizing acts deemed as laying the groundwork for a terrorist attack , such as provocation of terrorism , recruitment and training . " we ca n't wait for another madrid " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british member of the council of europe terry davis , points the scoreboard after being elected as new secretary general of the council of europe , tuesday , june 22 , 2004 in strasbourg , eastern france .
terry davis will replace austria 's walter schwimmer for the next five years .
-lrb- ap photo / christian lutz -rrb- on thursday , the council 's secretary general terry davis -lrb- photo -rrb- urged delegates to move quickly and decisively against terrorism . " we ca n't wait for another madrid or beslan , " he said , calling on delegates " to provide a message of support for the new instruments " being debated at the two-day meeting . more than 340 people died , half of them children , when a standoff between law enforcement authorities and hostage-takers who had herded more than 1,000 students and teachers into a school in the southern russian town of beslan last september ended in a chaotic shootout . the bombing of four madrid commuter trains on march 11 last year killed 191 people and injured over 1,900 . fleshing out the anti-terror convention negotiating the terms of the anti-terror convention , expected to be ready by may , showed " how difficult it can be to enhance the efficiency of the fight against terrorism at the same time as safeguarding fundamental human rights , " said davis , a former british lawmaker .
" but it has also shown that it is possible to reconcile these twin objectives . " " terrorism is an attack on human rights , " he went on .
" however , while tackling terrorism , we must be careful not to undermine human rights , " he said . davis said he expected recommendations on the topics debated by the conference as well as the new conventions to be adopted by the end of the month .
they will then be presented to a summit of council of europe heads of state and government due to be held in warsaw in may . in addition to its 46 members , five states which have observer status on the council of europe were also represented at the meeting : canada , japan , mexico , the united states and the vatican . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a day of infamy in spain after a series of explosions in madrid killed close to 200 people and wounded more than 1,400 , spanish officials are still uncertain who is behind the worst terrorist attack in the country 's history . -lrb- march 12 , 2004 -rrb- madrid hosts anti-terror summit an international symposium on the fight against terrorism begins in madrid on tuesday , a year on from the devastating bombings which ripped through the spanish capital on march 11 , 2004 . -lrb- march 8 , 2005 -rrb- british labor mp elected to head council of europe british labor parliamentarian terry davis beat out two other candidates to be elected the new secretary general of europe 's top human rights organization , the 45-nation council of europe . -lrb- june 23 , 2004 -rrb- feedback do you think the fight against terror risks undermining human rights ?

victims ' rights activists worry financial rewards for crimes might provoke copy cats , but government officials disagree . günter stampf 's past client include celebrities such as former soviet leader michail gorbatchev and german starlet verona feldbusch .
he recently secured another high-profile client for his media production company . after months of negotiations , stampf received exclusive rights for a television documentary about meiwes , who is serving a sentence of eight years and six months in prison for killing and eating another man .
a book is to follow and meiwes has declined requests to be interviewed as a result . " the documentary , in which mr. meiwes will talk for the first time , will be supported by a number of well known scientists and experts , " an announcement on stampf 's web site reads .
" the serious and journalistic documentary will try to explain what lead to this murder . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arno funke , also known as " dagobert , " became famous for blackmailing a german department store chain .
he said book sales did n't even cover trial costs sensationalist coverage of meiwes ' cannibalism , however , is n't the only reason victims ' rights advocates in germany have called for legislation to prevent other criminals , such as german blackmailer " dagobert " -lrb- photo -rrb- , from cashing in on their story .
they also argue that rewarding convicts for their actions might entice others to follow suit . celebrity criminals ? " there 's a danger that someone only commits a crime to become famous in order to make money , " said veit schiemann , a spokesman for white ring , a german victims ' rights group .
" people might rob a bank in the most gruesome way in order to be able to sell the story afterwards . " last june , germany 's state justice ministers unanimously asked the federal government to introduce legislation that would ban criminals from selling their stories .
but neither the state ministers , who are in the midst of discussing a complete overhaul of germany 's justice system , nor the federal ministry saw a need to act swiftly on the matter . henning plöger , a spokesman for the german justice ministry , said no legislation was planned , adding that a 1998 law already gave crime victims the right to lay claim to any money criminals make from selling their story .

" i fully agree with president chirac , we ca n't allow freedom in services to open the door to social dumping and to the disregard of safety standards in germany " and in europe , schröder said in a keynote speech to the lower house of german parliament , the bundestag . " we do n't only need law and order in the interior , we also need law and order on the labour market , " the chancellor said . under the so-called bolkestein directive , named after the former eu commissioner frits bolkestein who penned it , companies offering services throughout the 25 member states will be allowed to operate under the laws and regulations of their country of origin . companies would not have to pay local rate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in concrete terms , companies - from butchers to hairdressers and construction firms - from countries with lower taxes and fewer social regulations , notably in eastern europe , will be able to operate in higher-cost economies , but without being forced to pay their workers at the local rates . the supporters of the directive argue that such reforms are necessary if europe is to have a truly free market and wants to achieve its long-held dream of becoming as dynamic an economy as the united states . but france and germany , in particular , are up in arms over the proposals , with politicians , professional guilds and unions alike claiming they would place french and german companies at a disadvantage to rivals from new eu members in eastern europe .
the proposals would undermine sector-wide wage agreements and labour safety legislation , the critics argue . concern over germans being undercut bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with unemployment in germany currently at a post-war high point of 5.2 million or 12.6 percent of the workforce , opponents argue that allowing eastern european companies to undercut their western rivals with cheap labour will inevitably lead to even longer dole queues at home . in face of such arguments , chancellor schröder recently dropped his previous tacit support of the directive to suggest that the text should not only be amended , " but replaced by a new one " . the head of the eu commission , jose manuel barroso , specifically defended the country-of-origin rule on monday , accusing the directive 's critics of refusing to accept the consequences of eu enlargement . " some people think the european commission is there to protect the 15 against the new 10 - it is not , " he said .
" it is there to promote the general interest of europe . " chirac bangs the drum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but french president chirac hammered home his objections again on tuesday , saying " the draft directive on services is unacceptable to france and to other european partners and should be thoroughly reviewed . " chirac insisted that brussels must abide by its pledge to revise the text of the directive so that consensus could be reached .
" europe means the protection of social rights , it means fair conditions for competition , it means the development of public services and respect for cultural diversity , " chirac said .
in france the proposal is being used as an argument by people opposed to the european constitution . while not officially on the agenda of the upcoming eu summit in brussels next week , the issue will almost certainly be discussed by eu leaders there . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder reveals plan to boost eu economy german chancellor gerhard schröder has gone public with a plan aimed at adding fuel to the european internal market which he intends to put before fellow leaders at next week 's european union summit .

victims ' rights activists worry financial rewards for crimes might provoke copy cats , but government officials disagree . günter stampf 's past client include celebrities such as former soviet leader michail gorbatchev and german starlet verona feldbusch .
he recently secured another high-profile client for his media production company . after months of negotiations , stampf received exclusive rights for a television documentary about meiwes , who is serving a sentence of eight years and six months in prison for killing and eating another man .
a book is to follow and meiwes has declined requests to be interviewed as a result . " the documentary , in which mr. meiwes will talk for the first time , will be supported by a number of well known scientists and experts , " an announcement on stampf 's web site reads .
" the serious and journalistic documentary will try to explain what lead to this murder . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arno funke , also known as " dagobert , " became famous for blackmailing a german department store chain .
he said book sales did n't even cover trial costs sensationalist coverage of meiwes ' cannibalism , however , is n't the only reason victims ' rights advocates in germany have called for legislation to prevent other criminals , such as german blackmailer " dagobert " -lrb- photo -rrb- , from cashing in on their story .
they also argue that rewarding convicts for their actions might entice others to follow suit . celebrity criminals ? " there 's a danger that someone only commits a crime to become famous in order to make money , " said veit schiemann , a spokesman for white ring , a german victims ' rights group .
" people might rob a bank in the most gruesome way in order to be able to sell the story afterwards . " last june , germany 's state justice ministers unanimously asked the federal government to introduce legislation that would ban criminals from selling their stories .
but neither the state ministers , who are in the midst of discussing a complete overhaul of germany 's justice system , nor the federal ministry saw a need to act swiftly on the matter . henning plöger , a spokesman for the german justice ministry , said no legislation was planned , adding that a 1998 law already gave crime victims the right to lay claim to any money criminals make from selling their story .

in turkey , it 's even become a surprise best-seller . adolf hitler 's infamous - and notoriously badly-written - autobiography has sold more than 50,000 copies in turkey since january , and is currently number four on the best-seller list drawn up by the d & r bookstore chain . " ' mein kampf ' has always been a sleeper , a secret best-seller , " said oguz tektas of mefisto editions , one of several publishing houses to re-release the book hitler wrote while in jail in 1925 .
" we took it out of the closet for purely commercial reasons . " his company 's sole aim , he stressed , was " to make money , " which they did - by slashing the cover price . " mein kampf , " published by about a dozen companies over the years , always sold at a fairly steady annual rate of about 20,000 at some 20 new turkish lira -lrb- 11.3 euros or $ 15 -rrb- a copy .
the mefisto edition retails at 3.3 euros -lrb- $ 4.5 -rrb- and sold 23,000 copies in two months . turkish nationalism the readership ?
" those who want to know about a man who wreaked death and destruction on the world , " tektas said . " mostly young people , " said sami kilic , owner of the emre publishing house , another company on the " mein kampf " bandwagon , which sold 26,000 copies from a run of 31,000 released in late january . " the times we live in have a definite impact on sales , " kilic said .
" it is an astonishing phenomenon . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he linked interest in the book to turkey 's bid to join the european union , seen by the right-wing as a desertion of national values , and rising sentiment against the united states and its ally israel over the treatment they are perceived here as meting out to the iraqis and the palestinians , respectively . " this book , which does not contain a single ounce of humanity , unfortunately appears to be taken seriously in this country , " political scientist dogu ergil complained in a recent newspaper interview .
he agreed that the unexpected popularity of " mein kampf " in the muslim-majority country has its roots in a rise in anti-american sentiment sparked by the occupation of iraq and anti-semitism resulting from israel 's palestinian policy . " nazism , buried in the dustbin of history in europe , is beginning to re-emerge in turkey , " he warned . a rise in anti-semitism ? silvyo ovadya , the head of turkey 's jewish community , said he was " troubled " by the book 's popularity , telling afp he was " astonished a 500-page book that sows the seeds of racism and anti-semitism can sell at such a low price . "

the first book on the german cannibal has just been released in english .
dw-world talked to the author . germany and the world were shocked in december 2002 , when details about meiwes ' deed first emerged : he confessed to stabbing and eating 43-year-old bernd-jürgen brandes .
what disturbed people most , however , was that brandes had agreed to his slaughter and even tried to consume his own genitals before meiwes killed him . meiwes , who has never expressed remorse over what he did , was sentenced to eight years and six months in prison for manslaughter in january 2003 .
he has declined requests for interviews as he has sold his story to a german media production company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lois jones that 's why lois jones -lrb- photo -rrb- , a munich-based journalist from wales , based her book " cannibal " on interviews with friends and relatives of both men and those involved in meiwes ' trial .
the result is the most graphic and detailed account of the case published for a general audience so far . dw-world : what was your reaction when you first heard about the case ? lois jones : i was shocked , basically .
i felt what these two men did pushed far beyond the boundaries of what is acceptable .
germany is a very civilized society .
it amazed me that something like this was going on in europe in today 's world .
i did find it revolting .
i 'm quite a squeamish person and also a strict vegetarian , which made it even more disgusting or shocking for me .
i found it almost incomprehensible .
i found meiwes more revolting and brandes more disturbing : as soon as i heard about it , i was mystified and thought , " what could drive a man , a seemingly successful man , to be eaten by another ? " what made you decide to write about it ? the publisher was looking for someone to write the story - a native english speaker , working as a journalist in germany .
i always wanted to write books and thought , " maybe now is the right time to start . "
i found the subject fascinating : what would drive someone to eat a man ?
why would his victim give his consent ? what fascinated you most about the story ? three main things : first , the psychology of the two men involved .
what shocked me about both of them was that people had no idea and thought they were relatively normal individuals .
it was very hard to believe .
secondly , i 'm a strict vegetarian , i 've consciously not eaten meat for years and was interested in the question : what do people think is acceptable to eat ?
and thirdly , the fact that the people involved were perceived as quite normal , the fact that it was n't just them , but hundreds and thousands of people worldwide who are interested in cannibalism - this something that appeals to so many people . bildunterschrift : meiwes killed brandes in his house in a hamlet called wüstefeld near rotenburg in the central german state of hesse how did you go about writing the book ? i approached meiwes in prison , he wrote back a curt , type-written letter .
it was n't particularly friendly , he basically said that he would n't agree to be interviewed because he wanted to write his own book .
it was a bit of a relief .
so i talked to friends , acquaintances , people he 'd gone to school with , policemen , lawyers - anyone who had anything to do with him .
a lot of people were willing to talk about it .
neighbors were keen to talk about it because it maybe helped them understand , being able to talk about it with someone else .
i also checked out cannibal web sites and chat rooms , which were slightly disturbing , i must admit . was it difficult for you to deal with the subject for months ? it surprised me in some ways - i am a person who does get upset when i watch a horror movie , but i was able to distance myself more than i thought .
admittedly , i did find some chapters particularly gruesome .
i was n't allowed to see the video -lrb- depicting the slaughter -rrb- , but people described what happened .
that bit particularly was gruesome , detectives had to receive counseling because it was so disturbing . you include the brandes ' thoughts in your book .
where did you get that information ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd-jügen brandes it says in the front of the book that " the events in the book are real , or as close to real as humanly possible . "
a lot of it is from what meiwes told psychologists , what he said in court , and how psychologists said -lrb- brandes -rrb- would be thinking . meiwes has sold the rights to his story .
how do you feel about that ? in his letter , meiwes told me that if i were interested in being a ghost writer for his autobiography , i should apply to his lawyer .
i did n't want to do that .
i do n't think it 's quite right that he should be making money out of what he 's done .
it 's not helping him at all - here 's someone who needs help and it 's only going to fuel his ego .
he has stated that he no longer feels the need to eat another man .
but before he was caught by police , he was looking around for other victims , which indicates that he has n't gotten over this urge .
there are fans , web sites on the internet that are dedicated to him .
in a way this could encourage people out there who have similar tendencies to actually carry them out . is n't your book also helping to promote his celebrity ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : book cover - lois jones : " cannibal " what i tried to write was an objective view of what happened and not glorify what he 's done .
my book was trying to be more , look , this is what happened . your book came out as a mass-market edition , which is also sold in supermarkets in the us .
it is very graphic at times .
would you have written it differently if you 'd written it for a different publication ? the publishers were certainly keen for it to be written the way it was .
they were very liberal in giving me a free reign , but i probably would have written it a little less gruesome . do you think you 'll write another true crime book ? i think i could , but i do n't solely want to write them .
right now i 'm writing a book about -lrb- british discount airline -rrb- easyjet .
that 's a bit less gruesome . mathis winkler interviewed lois jones send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cannibal convicted of manslaughter one of the most sensational trials in german legal history ended on friday when judges convicted self-confessed cannibal , armin meiwes , to eight years and six months in prison .

the first book on the german cannibal has just been released in english .
dw-world talked to the author . germany and the world were shocked in december 2002 , when details about meiwes ' deed first emerged : he confessed to stabbing and eating 43-year-old bernd-jürgen brandes .
what disturbed people most , however , was that brandes had agreed to his slaughter and even tried to consume his own genitals before meiwes killed him . meiwes , who has never expressed remorse over what he did , was sentenced to eight years and six months in prison for manslaughter in january 2003 .
he has declined requests for interviews as he has sold his story to a german media production company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lois jones that 's why lois jones -lrb- photo -rrb- , a munich-based journalist from wales , based her book " cannibal " on interviews with friends and relatives of both men and those involved in meiwes ' trial .
the result is the most graphic and detailed account of the case published for a general audience so far . dw-world : what was your reaction when you first heard about the case ? lois jones : i was shocked , basically .
i felt what these two men did pushed far beyond the boundaries of what is acceptable .
germany is a very civilized society .
it amazed me that something like this was going on in europe in today 's world .
i did find it revolting .
i 'm quite a squeamish person and also a strict vegetarian , which made it even more disgusting or shocking for me .
i found it almost incomprehensible .
i found meiwes more revolting and brandes more disturbing : as soon as i heard about it , i was mystified and thought , " what could drive a man , a seemingly successful man , to be eaten by another ? " what made you decide to write about it ? the publisher was looking for someone to write the story - a native english speaker , working as a journalist in germany .
i always wanted to write books and thought , " maybe now is the right time to start . "
i found the subject fascinating : what would drive someone to eat a man ?
why would his victim give his consent ? what fascinated you most about the story ? three main things : first , the psychology of the two men involved .
what shocked me about both of them was that people had no idea and thought they were relatively normal individuals .
it was very hard to believe .
secondly , i 'm a strict vegetarian , i 've consciously not eaten meat for years and was interested in the question : what do people think is acceptable to eat ?
and thirdly , the fact that the people involved were perceived as quite normal , the fact that it was n't just them , but hundreds and thousands of people worldwide who are interested in cannibalism - this something that appeals to so many people . bildunterschrift : meiwes killed brandes in his house in a hamlet called wüstefeld near rotenburg in the central german state of hesse how did you go about writing the book ? i approached meiwes in prison , he wrote back a curt , type-written letter .
it was n't particularly friendly , he basically said that he would n't agree to be interviewed because he wanted to write his own book .
it was a bit of a relief .
so i talked to friends , acquaintances , people he 'd gone to school with , policemen , lawyers - anyone who had anything to do with him .
a lot of people were willing to talk about it .
neighbors were keen to talk about it because it maybe helped them understand , being able to talk about it with someone else .
i also checked out cannibal web sites and chat rooms , which were slightly disturbing , i must admit . was it difficult for you to deal with the subject for months ? it surprised me in some ways - i am a person who does get upset when i watch a horror movie , but i was able to distance myself more than i thought .
admittedly , i did find some chapters particularly gruesome .
i was n't allowed to see the video -lrb- depicting the slaughter -rrb- , but people described what happened .
that bit particularly was gruesome , detectives had to receive counseling because it was so disturbing . you include the brandes ' thoughts in your book .
where did you get that information ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd-jügen brandes it says in the front of the book that " the events in the book are real , or as close to real as humanly possible . "
a lot of it is from what meiwes told psychologists , what he said in court , and how psychologists said -lrb- brandes -rrb- would be thinking . meiwes has sold the rights to his story .
how do you feel about that ? in his letter , meiwes told me that if i were interested in being a ghost writer for his autobiography , i should apply to his lawyer .
i did n't want to do that .
i do n't think it 's quite right that he should be making money out of what he 's done .
it 's not helping him at all - here 's someone who needs help and it 's only going to fuel his ego .
he has stated that he no longer feels the need to eat another man .
but before he was caught by police , he was looking around for other victims , which indicates that he has n't gotten over this urge .
there are fans , web sites on the internet that are dedicated to him .
in a way this could encourage people out there who have similar tendencies to actually carry them out . is n't your book also helping to promote his celebrity ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : book cover - lois jones : " cannibal " what i tried to write was an objective view of what happened and not glorify what he 's done .
my book was trying to be more , look , this is what happened . your book came out as a mass-market edition , which is also sold in supermarkets in the us .
it is very graphic at times .
would you have written it differently if you 'd written it for a different publication ? the publishers were certainly keen for it to be written the way it was .
they were very liberal in giving me a free reign , but i probably would have written it a little less gruesome . do you think you 'll write another true crime book ? i think i could , but i do n't solely want to write them .
right now i 'm writing a book about -lrb- british discount airline -rrb- easyjet .

the first book on the german cannibal has just been released in english .
dw-world talked to the author . germany and the world were shocked in december 2002 , when details about meiwes ' deed first emerged : he confessed to stabbing and eating 43-year-old bernd-jürgen brandes .
what disturbed people most , however , was that brandes had agreed to his slaughter and even tried to consume his own genitals before meiwes killed him . meiwes , who has never expressed remorse over what he did , was sentenced to eight years and six months in prison for manslaughter in january 2003 .
he has declined requests for interviews as he has sold his story to a german media production company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lois jones that 's why lois jones -lrb- photo -rrb- , a munich-based journalist from wales , based her book " cannibal " on interviews with friends and relatives of both men and those involved in meiwes ' trial .
the result is the most graphic and detailed account of the case published for a general audience so far . dw-world : what was your reaction when you first heard about the case ? lois jones : i was shocked , basically .
i felt what these two men did pushed far beyond the boundaries of what is acceptable .
germany is a very civilized society .
it amazed me that something like this was going on in europe in today 's world .
i did find it revolting .
i 'm quite a squeamish person and also a strict vegetarian , which made it even more disgusting or shocking for me .
i found it almost incomprehensible .
i found meiwes more revolting and brandes more disturbing : as soon as i heard about it , i was mystified and thought , " what could drive a man , a seemingly successful man , to be eaten by another ? " what made you decide to write about it ? the publisher was looking for someone to write the story - a native english speaker , working as a journalist in germany .
i always wanted to write books and thought , " maybe now is the right time to start . "
i found the subject fascinating : what would drive someone to eat a man ?
why would his victim give his consent ? what fascinated you most about the story ? three main things : first , the psychology of the two men involved .
what shocked me about both of them was that people had no idea and thought they were relatively normal individuals .
it was very hard to believe .
secondly , i 'm a strict vegetarian , i 've consciously not eaten meat for years and was interested in the question : what do people think is acceptable to eat ?
and thirdly , the fact that the people involved were perceived as quite normal , the fact that it was n't just them , but hundreds and thousands of people worldwide who are interested in cannibalism - this something that appeals to so many people . bildunterschrift : meiwes killed brandes in his house in a hamlet called wüstefeld near rotenburg in the central german state of hesse how did you go about writing the book ? i approached meiwes in prison , he wrote back a curt , type-written letter .
it was n't particularly friendly , he basically said that he would n't agree to be interviewed because he wanted to write his own book .
it was a bit of a relief .
so i talked to friends , acquaintances , people he 'd gone to school with , policemen , lawyers - anyone who had anything to do with him .
a lot of people were willing to talk about it .
neighbors were keen to talk about it because it maybe helped them understand , being able to talk about it with someone else .
i also checked out cannibal web sites and chat rooms , which were slightly disturbing , i must admit . was it difficult for you to deal with the subject for months ? it surprised me in some ways - i am a person who does get upset when i watch a horror movie , but i was able to distance myself more than i thought .
admittedly , i did find some chapters particularly gruesome .
i was n't allowed to see the video -lrb- depicting the slaughter -rrb- , but people described what happened .
that bit particularly was gruesome , detectives had to receive counseling because it was so disturbing . you include the brandes ' thoughts in your book .
where did you get that information ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd-jügen brandes it says in the front of the book that " the events in the book are real , or as close to real as humanly possible . "
a lot of it is from what meiwes told psychologists , what he said in court , and how psychologists said -lrb- brandes -rrb- would be thinking . meiwes has sold the rights to his story .
how do you feel about that ? in his letter , meiwes told me that if i were interested in being a ghost writer for his autobiography , i should apply to his lawyer .
i did n't want to do that .
i do n't think it 's quite right that he should be making money out of what he 's done .
it 's not helping him at all - here 's someone who needs help and it 's only going to fuel his ego .
he has stated that he no longer feels the need to eat another man .
but before he was caught by police , he was looking around for other victims , which indicates that he has n't gotten over this urge .
there are fans , web sites on the internet that are dedicated to him .
in a way this could encourage people out there who have similar tendencies to actually carry them out . is n't your book also helping to promote his celebrity ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : book cover - lois jones : " cannibal " what i tried to write was an objective view of what happened and not glorify what he 's done .
my book was trying to be more , look , this is what happened . your book came out as a mass-market edition , which is also sold in supermarkets in the us .
it is very graphic at times .
would you have written it differently if you 'd written it for a different publication ? the publishers were certainly keen for it to be written the way it was .
they were very liberal in giving me a free reign , but i probably would have written it a little less gruesome . do you think you 'll write another true crime book ? i think i could , but i do n't solely want to write them .

the positive noises emanating from the summit suggested harmony but critics complained of issues swept under the carpet . russian president vladimir putin on friday was given a friendly reception by the leaders of france , germany and spain when they met for informal talks aimed at bolstering recently strained ties between moscow and the european union . french president jacques chirac invited german chancellor gerhard schröder and spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero to his elysee palace for the first-ever such meeting , after holding bilateral talks with putin . at a press conference after the 90-minute four-way session , the leaders said it had been a useful preparation for an eu-russian summit due in may .
" france , germany , spain and russia see in this relationship a way of ensuring ... the definitive establishment of peace , democracy and the rule of law across the whole of our continent , " chirac said . among the issues under discussion were the so-called four " common spaces " meant to guide eu-russian ties through 2007 - the economy , justice and internal security , external security , and education and culture , chirac said .
the leaders also touched on international affairs , including kosovo , iran , the middle east peace process , iraq and lebanon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder was welcomed by chirac on friday all four leaders were in agreement that iran should be prevented from developing nuclear weapons .
" we are working very closely on the iran question , " schröder said , dismissing any suggestion of differences even though russia has been supplying tehran with nuclear technology , saying it is for civilian purposes .
president chirac added that " there is no contradiction between the russian position and that of france and germany " when it came to iran . the leaders also agreed on a collective stand in favor of a complete withdrawal of syrian forces from lebanon .
" we have adopted a joint statement on lebanon , a communiqué , which , like the whole international community , insists on the compelling necessity to implement resolution 1559 , " chirac told the press conference , referring to united nations resolution 1559 which calls for a withdrawal which france co-sponsored with the united states .
putin 's agreement on the subject was particularly telling due to russia 's long-standing links with damascus . there was also unanimous agreement to maintain good contacts with the united states but chirac said the eu was " clearly for lifting the embargo " on arms sales to china .
washington wants the ban to remain . in keeping with all the positive news , which included an announcement that the four countries would meet again in the next two months , there was no explicit acknowledgement of the widespread international criticism of putin for flouting democratic norms in his handling of the chechen war , the press and business , as well as in his relations with ukraine and the baltic states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder , zapatero and chirac during a meeting in september 2004 in madrid zapatero said that in russia as elsewhere the best way to fight terrorism was " the force of reason , the force of the rule of law and international cooperation . " last month us president george w. bush publicly criticized russia 's democratic shortcomings at a meeting with putin in bratislava , indicating a new chill in the us-russian relationship . aides to chirac said the purpose of the informal gathering was to " hold out the hand of friendship to putin " to encourage him down the path of political and economic reforms . putin was making his first visit to the french capital since november 2003 , but he and chirac have seen each other several times in the interim - in 2004 at d-day commemorations in normandy and at the g8 summit , and in january at ceremonies marking the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz . the two presidents met with 35 russian writers attending the just-opened paris book fair - deemed safer than a visit to the fair itself , where putin could have faced protestors . after a private lunch , chirac accompanied putin on a visit to an air force base outside the capital , a gesture of reciprocity after the russian president took chirac to see a top secret russian space center last april . putin , chirac and schröder first forged their alliance two years ago when they spearheaded opposition to the us-led war in iraq .
chirac invited zapatero , whom he sees as a new ally in the european union , to join the group . but the meeting risked annoying leaders elsewhere in europe - notably in poland and the baltics - where any franco-german effort to set the agenda for the eu 's relations with russia would be strongly opposed . chirac 's office said other countries - and the european commission in brussels - should not feel slighted , as it was important to encourage all kinds of links with moscow . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin says he 's ready to talk in germany for a two-day visit , vladimir putin said he 's ready to work with the eu about the chechnya conflict and is prepared to answer questions about delicate subjects like ukraine and press freedom .

the first-phase strategy for 2005-2008 is based on a multi-disciplinary approach that foresees reducing demand and supply and steps up the fight against international drug traffickers . the action plan gives a timetable for a set of measures to be carried out at eu level by member states , in cooperation with third countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it includes general policy measures , specific programs aimed at the prevention of drug use among young people , in the workplace and in recreational settings , as well as measures for improving access to treatment programs , both for drug use and drug-related illness .

roland simon , who worked on the emcdda report , believes the action plan is definitely a step in the right direction .

moving away from criminalization one of the main problems support schemes face is financing .

the positive noises emanating from the summit suggested harmony but critics complained of issues swept under the carpet . russian president vladimir putin on friday was given a friendly reception by the leaders of france , germany and spain when they met for informal talks aimed at bolstering recently strained ties between moscow and the european union . french president jacques chirac invited german chancellor gerhard schröder and spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero to his elysee palace for the first-ever such meeting , after holding bilateral talks with putin . at a press conference after the 90-minute four-way session , the leaders said it had been a useful preparation for an eu-russian summit due in may .
" france , germany , spain and russia see in this relationship a way of ensuring ... the definitive establishment of peace , democracy and the rule of law across the whole of our continent , " chirac said . among the issues under discussion were the so-called four " common spaces " meant to guide eu-russian ties through 2007 - the economy , justice and internal security , external security , and education and culture , chirac said .
the leaders also touched on international affairs , including kosovo , iran , the middle east peace process , iraq and lebanon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder was welcomed by chirac on friday all four leaders were in agreement that iran should be prevented from developing nuclear weapons .
" we are working very closely on the iran question , " schröder said , dismissing any suggestion of differences even though russia has been supplying tehran with nuclear technology , saying it is for civilian purposes .
president chirac added that " there is no contradiction between the russian position and that of france and germany " when it came to iran . the leaders also agreed on a collective stand in favor of a complete withdrawal of syrian forces from lebanon .
" we have adopted a joint statement on lebanon , a communiqué , which , like the whole international community , insists on the compelling necessity to implement resolution 1559 , " chirac told the press conference , referring to united nations resolution 1559 which calls for a withdrawal which france co-sponsored with the united states .
putin 's agreement on the subject was particularly telling due to russia 's long-standing links with damascus . there was also unanimous agreement to maintain good contacts with the united states but chirac said the eu was " clearly for lifting the embargo " on arms sales to china .
washington wants the ban to remain . in keeping with all the positive news , which included an announcement that the four countries would meet again in the next two months , there was no explicit acknowledgement of the widespread international criticism of putin for flouting democratic norms in his handling of the chechen war , the press and business , as well as in his relations with ukraine and the baltic states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder , zapatero and chirac during a meeting in september 2004 in madrid zapatero said that in russia as elsewhere the best way to fight terrorism was " the force of reason , the force of the rule of law and international cooperation . " last month us president george w. bush publicly criticized russia 's democratic shortcomings at a meeting with putin in bratislava , indicating a new chill in the us-russian relationship . aides to chirac said the purpose of the informal gathering was to " hold out the hand of friendship to putin " to encourage him down the path of political and economic reforms . putin was making his first visit to the french capital since november 2003 , but he and chirac have seen each other several times in the interim - in 2004 at d-day commemorations in normandy and at the g8 summit , and in january at ceremonies marking the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz . the two presidents met with 35 russian writers attending the just-opened paris book fair - deemed safer than a visit to the fair itself , where putin could have faced protestors . after a private lunch , chirac accompanied putin on a visit to an air force base outside the capital , a gesture of reciprocity after the russian president took chirac to see a top secret russian space center last april . putin , chirac and schröder first forged their alliance two years ago when they spearheaded opposition to the us-led war in iraq .
chirac invited zapatero , whom he sees as a new ally in the european union , to join the group . but the meeting risked annoying leaders elsewhere in europe - notably in poland and the baltics - where any franco-german effort to set the agenda for the eu 's relations with russia would be strongly opposed . chirac 's office said other countries - and the european commission in brussels - should not feel slighted , as it was important to encourage all kinds of links with moscow . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin says he 's ready to talk in germany for a two-day visit , vladimir putin said he 's ready to work with the eu about the chechnya conflict and is prepared to answer questions about delicate subjects like ukraine and press freedom .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.03.2005 eu steps up battle against drugs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants people to just say no the european commission recently adopted a new drugs action plan , marking the launch of the first of two implementation phases of the eu 's anti-drug strategy for 2004 - 2012 .
but will it help ? it 's midday at café pauke .
almost all the tables are occupied , and the waiters have their hands full .
most of the guests are workers from the nearby offices on their lunch break .
it 's also a popular haunt with students , drawn by a menu that 's cheaper but better than what 's on offer in their university canteen . little seems to set the café apart from all the other bistros in bonn , but there 's one crucial difference : from the cooks to the waiters , all the staff are former drug addicts . a run-away success karl-heinz bitzer is the manager of pauke 's drop-in counselling service .
he 's a former drug user himself .
today , he gives advice to people seeking to overcome addiction .
his services are in such demand , he even has to turn people away . " we have unbelievably long waiting lists , " he explained .
" applicants for our in-house therapy have to wait up to six months . " the therapy and employment programs provided by pauke are precisely what the eu wants to see more of . tackling drug abuse in mid-february , the european commission outlined a plan that set out an eu strategy to combat the increasing problems caused by drug trafficking and drug use .
the first-phase strategy for 2005-2008 is based on a multi-disciplinary approach that foresees reducing demand and supply and steps up the fight against international drug traffickers . the action plan gives a timetable for a set of measures to be carried out at eu level by member states , in cooperation with third countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it includes general policy measures , specific programs aimed at the prevention of drug use among young people , in the workplace and in recreational settings , as well as measures for improving access to treatment programs , both for drug use and drug-related illness .
still a widespread problem the action plan is based on the results of an annual report published by the european monitoring center for drug addiction -lrb- emcdda -rrb- in lisbon .
according to the study , drugs claimed fewer lives in 2004 , but some two million people in europe still have a problem with drug addiction .
roland simon , who worked on the emcdda report , believes the action plan is definitely a step in the right direction .
" i feel the plan has a very sound basis , " he explained .
" it 's a very sensible idea to provide prevention and treatment for people who experiment with drug consumption before they slide too deep into addiction . "
moving away from criminalization one of the main problems support schemes face is financing .
the only projects eligible for eu funding are those that promote europe-wide cooperation .
that means that an initiative such as pauke has to depend on national or even district funding .
in times of economic gloom , these subsidies are the first to feel the pinch .
even so , roland simon is convinced a pan-european drug policy makes sense .
" the advantage of a unified policy , " he said , " is that you can combine targets and develop a common approach that can be pursued on a european-wide level . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the approach that forms the cornerstone of the action plan is that drug addicts are seen as people suffering from an illness rather than criminals .
instead of putting them behind bars , the plan is to refer them to organizations such as pauke and help them return to normal life .
karl-heinz bitzer also welcomes the eu 's new strategy .
" we 're very glad to see that in the last five years there 's been a move away from criminalizing drug users , " he said .
" there 's greater tolerance of addiction and much better support structures .

the positive noises emanating from the summit suggested harmony but critics complained of issues swept under the carpet . russian president vladimir putin on friday was given a friendly reception by the leaders of france , germany and spain when they met for informal talks aimed at bolstering recently strained ties between moscow and the european union . french president jacques chirac invited german chancellor gerhard schröder and spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero to his elysee palace for the first-ever such meeting , after holding bilateral talks with putin . at a press conference after the 90-minute four-way session , the leaders said it had been a useful preparation for an eu-russian summit due in may .
" france , germany , spain and russia see in this relationship a way of ensuring ... the definitive establishment of peace , democracy and the rule of law across the whole of our continent , " chirac said . among the issues under discussion were the so-called four " common spaces " meant to guide eu-russian ties through 2007 - the economy , justice and internal security , external security , and education and culture , chirac said .

" i fully agree with president chirac , we ca n't allow freedom in services to open the door to social dumping and to the disregard of safety standards in germany " and in europe , schröder said in a keynote speech to the lower house of german parliament , the bundestag . " we do n't only need law and order in the interior , we also need law and order on the labour market , " the chancellor said . under the so-called bolkestein directive , named after the former eu commissioner frits bolkestein who penned it , companies offering services throughout the 25 member states will be allowed to operate under the laws and regulations of their country of origin . companies would not have to pay local rate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in concrete terms , companies - from butchers to hairdressers and construction firms - from countries with lower taxes and fewer social regulations , notably in eastern europe , will be able to operate in higher-cost economies , but without being forced to pay their workers at the local rates . the supporters of the directive argue that such reforms are necessary if europe is to have a truly free market and wants to achieve its long-held dream of becoming as dynamic an economy as the united states . but france and germany , in particular , are up in arms over the proposals , with politicians , professional guilds and unions alike claiming they would place french and german companies at a disadvantage to rivals from new eu members in eastern europe .

but will it help ? it 's midday at café pauke .
almost all the tables are occupied , and the waiters have their hands full .
most of the guests are workers from the nearby offices on their lunch break .
it 's also a popular haunt with students , drawn by a menu that 's cheaper but better than what 's on offer in their university canteen . little seems to set the café apart from all the other bistros in bonn , but there 's one crucial difference : from the cooks to the waiters , all the staff are former drug addicts . a run-away success karl-heinz bitzer is the manager of pauke 's drop-in counselling service .
he 's a former drug user himself .
today , he gives advice to people seeking to overcome addiction .
his services are in such demand , he even has to turn people away . " we have unbelievably long waiting lists , " he explained .
" applicants for our in-house therapy have to wait up to six months . " the therapy and employment programs provided by pauke are precisely what the eu wants to see more of . tackling drug abuse in mid-february , the european commission outlined a plan that set out an eu strategy to combat the increasing problems caused by drug trafficking and drug use .
the first-phase strategy for 2005-2008 is based on a multi-disciplinary approach that foresees reducing demand and supply and steps up the fight against international drug traffickers . the action plan gives a timetable for a set of measures to be carried out at eu level by member states , in cooperation with third countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it includes general policy measures , specific programs aimed at the prevention of drug use among young people , in the workplace and in recreational settings , as well as measures for improving access to treatment programs , both for drug use and drug-related illness .
still a widespread problem the action plan is based on the results of an annual report published by the european monitoring center for drug addiction -lrb- emcdda -rrb- in lisbon .
according to the study , drugs claimed fewer lives in 2004 , but some two million people in europe still have a problem with drug addiction .
roland simon , who worked on the emcdda report , believes the action plan is definitely a step in the right direction .
" i feel the plan has a very sound basis , " he explained .
" it 's a very sensible idea to provide prevention and treatment for people who experiment with drug consumption before they slide too deep into addiction . "
moving away from criminalization one of the main problems support schemes face is financing .
the only projects eligible for eu funding are those that promote europe-wide cooperation .
that means that an initiative such as pauke has to depend on national or even district funding .
in times of economic gloom , these subsidies are the first to feel the pinch .
even so , roland simon is convinced a pan-european drug policy makes sense .
" the advantage of a unified policy , " he said , " is that you can combine targets and develop a common approach that can be pursued on a european-wide level . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the approach that forms the cornerstone of the action plan is that drug addicts are seen as people suffering from an illness rather than criminals .
instead of putting them behind bars , the plan is to refer them to organizations such as pauke and help them return to normal life .
karl-heinz bitzer also welcomes the eu 's new strategy .
" we 're very glad to see that in the last five years there 's been a move away from criminalizing drug users , " he said .
" there 's greater tolerance of addiction and much better support structures .

but will it help ? it 's midday at café pauke .
almost all the tables are occupied , and the waiters have their hands full .
most of the guests are workers from the nearby offices on their lunch break .
it 's also a popular haunt with students , drawn by a menu that 's cheaper but better than what 's on offer in their university canteen . little seems to set the café apart from all the other bistros in bonn , but there 's one crucial difference : from the cooks to the waiters , all the staff are former drug addicts . a run-away success karl-heinz bitzer is the manager of pauke 's drop-in counselling service .
he 's a former drug user himself .
today , he gives advice to people seeking to overcome addiction .
his services are in such demand , he even has to turn people away . " we have unbelievably long waiting lists , " he explained .
" applicants for our in-house therapy have to wait up to six months . " the therapy and employment programs provided by pauke are precisely what the eu wants to see more of . tackling drug abuse in mid-february , the european commission outlined a plan that set out an eu strategy to combat the increasing problems caused by drug trafficking and drug use .
the first-phase strategy for 2005-2008 is based on a multi-disciplinary approach that foresees reducing demand and supply and steps up the fight against international drug traffickers . the action plan gives a timetable for a set of measures to be carried out at eu level by member states , in cooperation with third countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it includes general policy measures , specific programs aimed at the prevention of drug use among young people , in the workplace and in recreational settings , as well as measures for improving access to treatment programs , both for drug use and drug-related illness .
still a widespread problem the action plan is based on the results of an annual report published by the european monitoring center for drug addiction -lrb- emcdda -rrb- in lisbon .
according to the study , drugs claimed fewer lives in 2004 , but some two million people in europe still have a problem with drug addiction .
roland simon , who worked on the emcdda report , believes the action plan is definitely a step in the right direction .
" i feel the plan has a very sound basis , " he explained .
" it 's a very sensible idea to provide prevention and treatment for people who experiment with drug consumption before they slide too deep into addiction . "
moving away from criminalization one of the main problems support schemes face is financing .
the only projects eligible for eu funding are those that promote europe-wide cooperation .
that means that an initiative such as pauke has to depend on national or even district funding .
in times of economic gloom , these subsidies are the first to feel the pinch .
even so , roland simon is convinced a pan-european drug policy makes sense .
" the advantage of a unified policy , " he said , " is that you can combine targets and develop a common approach that can be pursued on a european-wide level . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the approach that forms the cornerstone of the action plan is that drug addicts are seen as people suffering from an illness rather than criminals .
instead of putting them behind bars , the plan is to refer them to organizations such as pauke and help them return to normal life .
karl-heinz bitzer also welcomes the eu 's new strategy .
" we 're very glad to see that in the last five years there 's been a move away from criminalizing drug users , " he said .
" there 's greater tolerance of addiction and much better support structures .

" i fully agree with president chirac , we ca n't allow freedom in services to open the door to social dumping and to the disregard of safety standards in germany " and in europe , schröder said in a keynote speech to the lower house of german parliament , the bundestag . " we do n't only need law and order in the interior , we also need law and order on the labour market , " the chancellor said . under the so-called bolkestein directive , named after the former eu commissioner frits bolkestein who penned it , companies offering services throughout the 25 member states will be allowed to operate under the laws and regulations of their country of origin . companies would not have to pay local rate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in concrete terms , companies - from butchers to hairdressers and construction firms - from countries with lower taxes and fewer social regulations , notably in eastern europe , will be able to operate in higher-cost economies , but without being forced to pay their workers at the local rates . the supporters of the directive argue that such reforms are necessary if europe is to have a truly free market and wants to achieve its long-held dream of becoming as dynamic an economy as the united states . but france and germany , in particular , are up in arms over the proposals , with politicians , professional guilds and unions alike claiming they would place french and german companies at a disadvantage to rivals from new eu members in eastern europe .
the proposals would undermine sector-wide wage agreements and labour safety legislation , the critics argue . concern over germans being undercut bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with unemployment in germany currently at a post-war high point of 5.2 million or 12.6 percent of the workforce , opponents argue that allowing eastern european companies to undercut their western rivals with cheap labour will inevitably lead to even longer dole queues at home . in face of such arguments , chancellor schröder recently dropped his previous tacit support of the directive to suggest that the text should not only be amended , " but replaced by a new one " . the head of the eu commission , jose manuel barroso , specifically defended the country-of-origin rule on monday , accusing the directive 's critics of refusing to accept the consequences of eu enlargement . " some people think the european commission is there to protect the 15 against the new 10 - it is not , " he said .
" it is there to promote the general interest of europe . " chirac bangs the drum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but french president chirac hammered home his objections again on tuesday , saying " the draft directive on services is unacceptable to france and to other european partners and should be thoroughly reviewed . " chirac insisted that brussels must abide by its pledge to revise the text of the directive so that consensus could be reached .
" europe means the protection of social rights , it means fair conditions for competition , it means the development of public services and respect for cultural diversity , " chirac said .
in france the proposal is being used as an argument by people opposed to the european constitution . while not officially on the agenda of the upcoming eu summit in brussels next week , the issue will almost certainly be discussed by eu leaders there . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder reveals plan to boost eu economy german chancellor gerhard schröder has gone public with a plan aimed at adding fuel to the european internal market which he intends to put before fellow leaders at next week 's european union summit .

" our shareholder structure has radically changed in three months since we launched our bid , " breuer told the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" we now have new major shareholders who have said that they want to remain shareholders .
so the moment has come for us to invite them to take a seat on the supervisory board . " nevertheless , breuer said he would prefer if the new nominations could wait until a new supervisory board was appointed in 2006 rather than forcing current board members to leave prematurely which would make any shake-up appear unnecessarily " dramatic and spectacular . " share buy-back program ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frankfurt stock exchange is part of deutsche börse in addition , deutsche börse was considering launching a share buy-back program over a number of years , as demanded by the rebel shareholders , including funds tci , atticus capital and fidelity investment , in recent weeks , breuer hinted . asked about such a possibility in the interview , breuer replied that the management board was " drawing up a concept . " it will emerge that we 're currently overcapitalized and that the mix of own equity and outside capital is not correct , " he said .
" the management board will propose to the supervisory board what sort of capital structure it wants in the coming years . " he did not specify exactly how big the share buy-back program could be .
but the frankfurt daily suggested it could be as much as 700 million euros -lrb- $ 935 million -rrb- , which corresponds to the current level of deutsche börse 's cash reserves . börse officials tight-lipped a deutsche börse spokesman refused to be drawn on the figure . " what we have said so far is that deutsche börse will return a significant amount of cash back to its shareholders and that we have about 700 million euros in cash available , " he said .
" we have not said the amount we are returning . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new london stock exchange when deutsche börse announced that it was withdrawing its bid for the lse , it said that it had decided to transfer to shareholders " a significant proportion " of the cash reserves it has set aside to finance the takeover . but it did specify exactly how it intended to do so or exactly how much would be transferred to shareholders . speculation of a big cash payout drove deutsche börse shares higher on the frankfurt stock exchange on friday .
shares were changing hands at 57.95 euros in late morning trade , a gain of 0.40 euros or 0.70 percent on the day in a slightly firmer market . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche börse keeps its lse options open deutsche börse said monday it had asked the competition authorities in britain and germany to continue examining a possible merger .

" our shareholder structure has radically changed in three months since we launched our bid , " breuer told the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" we now have new major shareholders who have said that they want to remain shareholders .
so the moment has come for us to invite them to take a seat on the supervisory board . " nevertheless , breuer said he would prefer if the new nominations could wait until a new supervisory board was appointed in 2006 rather than forcing current board members to leave prematurely which would make any shake-up appear unnecessarily " dramatic and spectacular . " share buy-back program ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frankfurt stock exchange is part of deutsche börse in addition , deutsche börse was considering launching a share buy-back program over a number of years , as demanded by the rebel shareholders , including funds tci , atticus capital and fidelity investment , in recent weeks , breuer hinted . asked about such a possibility in the interview , breuer replied that the management board was " drawing up a concept . " it will emerge that we 're currently overcapitalized and that the mix of own equity and outside capital is not correct , " he said .
" the management board will propose to the supervisory board what sort of capital structure it wants in the coming years . " he did not specify exactly how big the share buy-back program could be .
but the frankfurt daily suggested it could be as much as 700 million euros -lrb- $ 935 million -rrb- , which corresponds to the current level of deutsche börse 's cash reserves . börse officials tight-lipped a deutsche börse spokesman refused to be drawn on the figure . " what we have said so far is that deutsche börse will return a significant amount of cash back to its shareholders and that we have about 700 million euros in cash available , " he said .
" we have not said the amount we are returning . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new london stock exchange when deutsche börse announced that it was withdrawing its bid for the lse , it said that it had decided to transfer to shareholders " a significant proportion " of the cash reserves it has set aside to finance the takeover . but it did specify exactly how it intended to do so or exactly how much would be transferred to shareholders . speculation of a big cash payout drove deutsche börse shares higher on the frankfurt stock exchange on friday .
shares were changing hands at 57.95 euros in late morning trade , a gain of 0.40 euros or 0.70 percent on the day in a slightly firmer market . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche börse keeps its lse options open deutsche börse said monday it had asked the competition authorities in britain and germany to continue examining a possible merger .

the positive noises emanating from the summit suggested harmony but critics complained of issues swept under the carpet . russian president vladimir putin on friday was given a friendly reception by the leaders of france , germany and spain when they met for informal talks aimed at bolstering recently strained ties between moscow and the european union . french president jacques chirac invited german chancellor gerhard schröder and spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero to his elysee palace for the first-ever such meeting , after holding bilateral talks with putin . at a press conference after the 90-minute four-way session , the leaders said it had been a useful preparation for an eu-russian summit due in may .
" france , germany , spain and russia see in this relationship a way of ensuring ... the definitive establishment of peace , democracy and the rule of law across the whole of our continent , " chirac said . among the issues under discussion were the so-called four " common spaces " meant to guide eu-russian ties through 2007 - the economy , justice and internal security , external security , and education and culture , chirac said .

" that view is shared by 42 percent in the 10 new states which joined the union last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people enter europe illegally by ship across the bloc , nearly half of the population opposed granting legal immigrants full civil rights .
but beate winkler , head of the vienna-based european monitoring center on racism and xenophobia , eumc , says that the majority of citizens are happy to live in multi-ethnic communities .
onus on governments the eumc encourages governments to introduce appropriate policies to help avoid hostilities and potential for conflict .
however , winkler asserted that some governments have either failed to address the problems or even deny that they exist .
“ of course , you must be very concerned about negative attitudes because violence almost always starts with words , ” she said winkler said the picture of xenophobia in europe is full of contradictions , adding that attitudes can be influenced strongly by good political leadership .
one apparent contradiction is that while 50 percent of europeans " have resistance to immigrants " only 30 percent say they don ’ t want asylum seekers in their country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the survey revealed resistance to immigration in rural areas the survey shows that poor or poorly educated people are " more likely to display negative attitudes towards minorities . ” and it reflects that people from rural areas tend to be more hostile to immigration , despite the fact that most immigrants live in cities . shaye hoobanoff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government says immigrant wave receding in germany immigration into germany in the year 2003 , for the first time in many decades , dropped below 800,000 as the influx of foreigners throughout the 1990s has receded , according to government statistics released on monday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.03.2005 eu steps up battle against drugs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants people to just say no the european commission recently adopted a new drugs action plan , marking the launch of the first of two implementation phases of the eu 's anti-drug strategy for 2004 - 2012 .
but will it help ? it 's midday at café pauke .
almost all the tables are occupied , and the waiters have their hands full .
most of the guests are workers from the nearby offices on their lunch break .
it 's also a popular haunt with students , drawn by a menu that 's cheaper but better than what 's on offer in their university canteen . little seems to set the café apart from all the other bistros in bonn , but there 's one crucial difference : from the cooks to the waiters , all the staff are former drug addicts . a run-away success karl-heinz bitzer is the manager of pauke 's drop-in counselling service .
he 's a former drug user himself .
today , he gives advice to people seeking to overcome addiction .
his services are in such demand , he even has to turn people away . " we have unbelievably long waiting lists , " he explained .
" applicants for our in-house therapy have to wait up to six months . " the therapy and employment programs provided by pauke are precisely what the eu wants to see more of . tackling drug abuse in mid-february , the european commission outlined a plan that set out an eu strategy to combat the increasing problems caused by drug trafficking and drug use .
the first-phase strategy for 2005-2008 is based on a multi-disciplinary approach that foresees reducing demand and supply and steps up the fight against international drug traffickers . the action plan gives a timetable for a set of measures to be carried out at eu level by member states , in cooperation with third countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it includes general policy measures , specific programs aimed at the prevention of drug use among young people , in the workplace and in recreational settings , as well as measures for improving access to treatment programs , both for drug use and drug-related illness .
still a widespread problem the action plan is based on the results of an annual report published by the european monitoring center for drug addiction -lrb- emcdda -rrb- in lisbon .
according to the study , drugs claimed fewer lives in 2004 , but some two million people in europe still have a problem with drug addiction .
roland simon , who worked on the emcdda report , believes the action plan is definitely a step in the right direction .
" i feel the plan has a very sound basis , " he explained .
" it 's a very sensible idea to provide prevention and treatment for people who experiment with drug consumption before they slide too deep into addiction . "
moving away from criminalization one of the main problems support schemes face is financing .
the only projects eligible for eu funding are those that promote europe-wide cooperation .
that means that an initiative such as pauke has to depend on national or even district funding .
in times of economic gloom , these subsidies are the first to feel the pinch .
even so , roland simon is convinced a pan-european drug policy makes sense .
" the advantage of a unified policy , " he said , " is that you can combine targets and develop a common approach that can be pursued on a european-wide level . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the approach that forms the cornerstone of the action plan is that drug addicts are seen as people suffering from an illness rather than criminals .
instead of putting them behind bars , the plan is to refer them to organizations such as pauke and help them return to normal life .
karl-heinz bitzer also welcomes the eu 's new strategy .
" we 're very glad to see that in the last five years there 's been a move away from criminalizing drug users , " he said .
" there 's greater tolerance of addiction and much better support structures .

he 's a former drug user himself .
today , he gives advice to people seeking to overcome addiction .
his services are in such demand , he even has to turn people away . " we have unbelievably long waiting lists , " he explained .
" applicants for our in-house therapy have to wait up to six months . " the therapy and employment programs provided by pauke are precisely what the eu wants to see more of . tackling drug abuse in mid-february , the european commission outlined a plan that set out an eu strategy to combat the increasing problems caused by drug trafficking and drug use .
the first-phase strategy for 2005-2008 is based on a multi-disciplinary approach that foresees reducing demand and supply and steps up the fight against international drug traffickers . the action plan gives a timetable for a set of measures to be carried out at eu level by member states , in cooperation with third countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it includes general policy measures , specific programs aimed at the prevention of drug use among young people , in the workplace and in recreational settings , as well as measures for improving access to treatment programs , both for drug use and drug-related illness .
still a widespread problem the action plan is based on the results of an annual report published by the european monitoring center for drug addiction -lrb- emcdda -rrb- in lisbon .
according to the study , drugs claimed fewer lives in 2004 , but some two million people in europe still have a problem with drug addiction .
roland simon , who worked on the emcdda report , believes the action plan is definitely a step in the right direction .
" i feel the plan has a very sound basis , " he explained .
" it 's a very sensible idea to provide prevention and treatment for people who experiment with drug consumption before they slide too deep into addiction . "
moving away from criminalization one of the main problems support schemes face is financing .
the only projects eligible for eu funding are those that promote europe-wide cooperation .
that means that an initiative such as pauke has to depend on national or even district funding .
in times of economic gloom , these subsidies are the first to feel the pinch .
even so , roland simon is convinced a pan-european drug policy makes sense .
" the advantage of a unified policy , " he said , " is that you can combine targets and develop a common approach that can be pursued on a european-wide level . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the approach that forms the cornerstone of the action plan is that drug addicts are seen as people suffering from an illness rather than criminals .
instead of putting them behind bars , the plan is to refer them to organizations such as pauke and help them return to normal life .
karl-heinz bitzer also welcomes the eu 's new strategy .
" we 're very glad to see that in the last five years there 's been a move away from criminalizing drug users , " he said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it includes general policy measures , specific programs aimed at the prevention of drug use among young people , in the workplace and in recreational settings , as well as measures for improving access to treatment programs , both for drug use and drug-related illness .
still a widespread problem the action plan is based on the results of an annual report published by the european monitoring center for drug addiction -lrb- emcdda -rrb- in lisbon .
according to the study , drugs claimed fewer lives in 2004 , but some two million people in europe still have a problem with drug addiction .
roland simon , who worked on the emcdda report , believes the action plan is definitely a step in the right direction .
" i feel the plan has a very sound basis , " he explained .
" it 's a very sensible idea to provide prevention and treatment for people who experiment with drug consumption before they slide too deep into addiction . "
moving away from criminalization one of the main problems support schemes face is financing .
the only projects eligible for eu funding are those that promote europe-wide cooperation .
that means that an initiative such as pauke has to depend on national or even district funding .
in times of economic gloom , these subsidies are the first to feel the pinch .
even so , roland simon is convinced a pan-european drug policy makes sense .
" the advantage of a unified policy , " he said , " is that you can combine targets and develop a common approach that can be pursued on a european-wide level . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the approach that forms the cornerstone of the action plan is that drug addicts are seen as people suffering from an illness rather than criminals .
instead of putting them behind bars , the plan is to refer them to organizations such as pauke and help them return to normal life .
karl-heinz bitzer also welcomes the eu 's new strategy .
" we 're very glad to see that in the last five years there 's been a move away from criminalizing drug users , " he said .
" there 's greater tolerance of addiction and much better support structures .

victims ' rights activists worry financial rewards for crimes might provoke copy cats , but government officials disagree . günter stampf 's past client include celebrities such as former soviet leader michail gorbatchev and german starlet verona feldbusch .
he recently secured another high-profile client for his media production company . after months of negotiations , stampf received exclusive rights for a television documentary about meiwes , who is serving a sentence of eight years and six months in prison for killing and eating another man .
a book is to follow and meiwes has declined requests to be interviewed as a result . " the documentary , in which mr. meiwes will talk for the first time , will be supported by a number of well known scientists and experts , " an announcement on stampf 's web site reads .
" the serious and journalistic documentary will try to explain what lead to this murder . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arno funke , also known as " dagobert , " became famous for blackmailing a german department store chain .

they also argue that rewarding convicts for their actions might entice others to follow suit . celebrity criminals ? " there 's a danger that someone only commits a crime to become famous in order to make money , " said veit schiemann , a spokesman for white ring , a german victims ' rights group .
" people might rob a bank in the most gruesome way in order to be able to sell the story afterwards . " last june , germany 's state justice ministers unanimously asked the federal government to introduce legislation that would ban criminals from selling their stories .
but neither the state ministers , who are in the midst of discussing a complete overhaul of germany 's justice system , nor the federal ministry saw a need to act swiftly on the matter . henning plöger , a spokesman for the german justice ministry , said no legislation was planned , adding that a 1998 law already gave crime victims the right to lay claim to any money criminals make from selling their story . " sometimes it 's desirable that a criminal finds a way to make money lawfully in order to be able to compensate victims , " plöger said . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cannibal convicted of manslaughter one of the most sensational trials in german legal history ended on friday when judges convicted self-confessed cannibal , armin meiwes , to eight years and six months in prison .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.03.2005 canvassing a cannibal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meiwes has never shown remorse for his crime armin meiwes , who admittedly killed and ate another man , made headlines around the world .
the first book on the german cannibal has just been released in english .
dw-world talked to the author . germany and the world were shocked in december 2002 , when details about meiwes ' deed first emerged : he confessed to stabbing and eating 43-year-old bernd-jürgen brandes .
what disturbed people most , however , was that brandes had agreed to his slaughter and even tried to consume his own genitals before meiwes killed him . meiwes , who has never expressed remorse over what he did , was sentenced to eight years and six months in prison for manslaughter in january 2003 .
he has declined requests for interviews as he has sold his story to a german media production company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lois jones that 's why lois jones -lrb- photo -rrb- , a munich-based journalist from wales , based her book " cannibal " on interviews with friends and relatives of both men and those involved in meiwes ' trial .
the result is the most graphic and detailed account of the case published for a general audience so far . dw-world : what was your reaction when you first heard about the case ? lois jones : i was shocked , basically .
i felt what these two men did pushed far beyond the boundaries of what is acceptable .
germany is a very civilized society .
it amazed me that something like this was going on in europe in today 's world .
i did find it revolting .
i 'm quite a squeamish person and also a strict vegetarian , which made it even more disgusting or shocking for me .
i found it almost incomprehensible .
i found meiwes more revolting and brandes more disturbing : as soon as i heard about it , i was mystified and thought , " what could drive a man , a seemingly successful man , to be eaten by another ? " what made you decide to write about it ? the publisher was looking for someone to write the story - a native english speaker , working as a journalist in germany .
i always wanted to write books and thought , " maybe now is the right time to start . "
i found the subject fascinating : what would drive someone to eat a man ?
why would his victim give his consent ? what fascinated you most about the story ? three main things : first , the psychology of the two men involved .
what shocked me about both of them was that people had no idea and thought they were relatively normal individuals .
it was very hard to believe .
secondly , i 'm a strict vegetarian , i 've consciously not eaten meat for years and was interested in the question : what do people think is acceptable to eat ?
and thirdly , the fact that the people involved were perceived as quite normal , the fact that it was n't just them , but hundreds and thousands of people worldwide who are interested in cannibalism - this something that appeals to so many people . bildunterschrift : meiwes killed brandes in his house in a hamlet called wüstefeld near rotenburg in the central german state of hesse how did you go about writing the book ? i approached meiwes in prison , he wrote back a curt , type-written letter .
it was n't particularly friendly , he basically said that he would n't agree to be interviewed because he wanted to write his own book .
it was a bit of a relief .
so i talked to friends , acquaintances , people he 'd gone to school with , policemen , lawyers - anyone who had anything to do with him .
a lot of people were willing to talk about it .
neighbors were keen to talk about it because it maybe helped them understand , being able to talk about it with someone else .
i also checked out cannibal web sites and chat rooms , which were slightly disturbing , i must admit . was it difficult for you to deal with the subject for months ? it surprised me in some ways - i am a person who does get upset when i watch a horror movie , but i was able to distance myself more than i thought .
admittedly , i did find some chapters particularly gruesome .
i was n't allowed to see the video -lrb- depicting the slaughter -rrb- , but people described what happened .
that bit particularly was gruesome , detectives had to receive counseling because it was so disturbing . you include the brandes ' thoughts in your book .
where did you get that information ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd-jügen brandes it says in the front of the book that " the events in the book are real , or as close to real as humanly possible . "
a lot of it is from what meiwes told psychologists , what he said in court , and how psychologists said -lrb- brandes -rrb- would be thinking . meiwes has sold the rights to his story .
how do you feel about that ? in his letter , meiwes told me that if i were interested in being a ghost writer for his autobiography , i should apply to his lawyer .
i did n't want to do that .
i do n't think it 's quite right that he should be making money out of what he 's done .
it 's not helping him at all - here 's someone who needs help and it 's only going to fuel his ego .
he has stated that he no longer feels the need to eat another man .
but before he was caught by police , he was looking around for other victims , which indicates that he has n't gotten over this urge .
there are fans , web sites on the internet that are dedicated to him .
in a way this could encourage people out there who have similar tendencies to actually carry them out . is n't your book also helping to promote his celebrity ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : book cover - lois jones : " cannibal " what i tried to write was an objective view of what happened and not glorify what he 's done .
my book was trying to be more , look , this is what happened . your book came out as a mass-market edition , which is also sold in supermarkets in the us .
it is very graphic at times .
would you have written it differently if you 'd written it for a different publication ? the publishers were certainly keen for it to be written the way it was .
they were very liberal in giving me a free reign , but i probably would have written it a little less gruesome . do you think you 'll write another true crime book ? i think i could , but i do n't solely want to write them .
right now i 'm writing a book about -lrb- british discount airline -rrb- easyjet .
that 's a bit less gruesome . mathis winkler interviewed lois jones send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cannibal convicted of manslaughter one of the most sensational trials in german legal history ended on friday when judges convicted self-confessed cannibal , armin meiwes , to eight years and six months in prison .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.03.2005 hitler book more sought after than ever großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flying off the shelves in turkey 80 years after publication , hitler 's " mein kampf " - widely seen as the main source of nazi ideology - has been ruffling feathers all over europe in recent months .
in turkey , it 's even become a surprise best-seller . adolf hitler 's infamous - and notoriously badly-written - autobiography has sold more than 50,000 copies in turkey since january , and is currently number four on the best-seller list drawn up by the d & r bookstore chain . " ' mein kampf ' has always been a sleeper , a secret best-seller , " said oguz tektas of mefisto editions , one of several publishing houses to re-release the book hitler wrote while in jail in 1925 .
" we took it out of the closet for purely commercial reasons . " his company 's sole aim , he stressed , was " to make money , " which they did - by slashing the cover price . " mein kampf , " published by about a dozen companies over the years , always sold at a fairly steady annual rate of about 20,000 at some 20 new turkish lira -lrb- 11.3 euros or $ 15 -rrb- a copy .
the mefisto edition retails at 3.3 euros -lrb- $ 4.5 -rrb- and sold 23,000 copies in two months . turkish nationalism the readership ?
" those who want to know about a man who wreaked death and destruction on the world , " tektas said . " mostly young people , " said sami kilic , owner of the emre publishing house , another company on the " mein kampf " bandwagon , which sold 26,000 copies from a run of 31,000 released in late january . " the times we live in have a definite impact on sales , " kilic said .
" it is an astonishing phenomenon . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he linked interest in the book to turkey 's bid to join the european union , seen by the right-wing as a desertion of national values , and rising sentiment against the united states and its ally israel over the treatment they are perceived here as meting out to the iraqis and the palestinians , respectively . " this book , which does not contain a single ounce of humanity , unfortunately appears to be taken seriously in this country , " political scientist dogu ergil complained in a recent newspaper interview .
he agreed that the unexpected popularity of " mein kampf " in the muslim-majority country has its roots in a rise in anti-american sentiment sparked by the occupation of iraq and anti-semitism resulting from israel 's palestinian policy . " nazism , buried in the dustbin of history in europe , is beginning to re-emerge in turkey , " he warned . a rise in anti-semitism ? silvyo ovadya , the head of turkey 's jewish community , said he was " troubled " by the book 's popularity , telling afp he was " astonished a 500-page book that sows the seeds of racism and anti-semitism can sell at such a low price . "
but , he said , his complaints to the publishers have gone unheeded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : * * archiv * * burnt vehicles are seen after an explosion outside of the neve shalom synagogue in istanbul , turkey , on nov .

just weeks after polish publication of the book made headlines in bavaria , which holds the rights , the czech supreme court acquitted michal zitko , a publisher who had been convicted of supporting a movement aimed at suppressing human rights by publishing a czech translation of " mein kampf . " last january , prague city court gave him a three-year suspended sentence , which was then overturned by the higher court in brno .
supreme court chairman eduard teschler concluded there was no evidence that zitko actively supported the movement , for example , by recruiting supporters . jewish anger in azerbaijan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meanwhile , the general prosecutor 's office of azerbaijan last december investigated the publication of " mein kampf " by avaz zeynalli , the editor of an azeri newspaper . according to zeynalli , the investigation was prompted by a complaint by the israeli embassy in baku and the azeri jewish community .
the editor was questioned by officials with the azeri interior ministry 's anti-organized crime department .
zeynalli said he had translated " mein kampf " into azeri from the turkish language and had placed an order with a printing house for the publication of 300 copies , 100 of which had already been printed . he argued that the publication of " mein kampf , " which openly advocates extermining the jews , was not banned in azerbaijan . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de row erupts over hitler book in poland the polish publication of hitler 's " mein kampf " has angered bavaria , which holds the rights .

the first book on the german cannibal has just been released in english .
dw-world talked to the author . germany and the world were shocked in december 2002 , when details about meiwes ' deed first emerged : he confessed to stabbing and eating 43-year-old bernd-jürgen brandes .
what disturbed people most , however , was that brandes had agreed to his slaughter and even tried to consume his own genitals before meiwes killed him . meiwes , who has never expressed remorse over what he did , was sentenced to eight years and six months in prison for manslaughter in january 2003 .
he has declined requests for interviews as he has sold his story to a german media production company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lois jones that 's why lois jones -lrb- photo -rrb- , a munich-based journalist from wales , based her book " cannibal " on interviews with friends and relatives of both men and those involved in meiwes ' trial .
the result is the most graphic and detailed account of the case published for a general audience so far . dw-world : what was your reaction when you first heard about the case ? lois jones : i was shocked , basically .
i felt what these two men did pushed far beyond the boundaries of what is acceptable .
germany is a very civilized society .
it amazed me that something like this was going on in europe in today 's world .
i did find it revolting .
i 'm quite a squeamish person and also a strict vegetarian , which made it even more disgusting or shocking for me .
i found it almost incomprehensible .
i found meiwes more revolting and brandes more disturbing : as soon as i heard about it , i was mystified and thought , " what could drive a man , a seemingly successful man , to be eaten by another ? " what made you decide to write about it ? the publisher was looking for someone to write the story - a native english speaker , working as a journalist in germany .
i always wanted to write books and thought , " maybe now is the right time to start . "
i found the subject fascinating : what would drive someone to eat a man ?
why would his victim give his consent ? what fascinated you most about the story ? three main things : first , the psychology of the two men involved .
what shocked me about both of them was that people had no idea and thought they were relatively normal individuals .
it was very hard to believe .
secondly , i 'm a strict vegetarian , i 've consciously not eaten meat for years and was interested in the question : what do people think is acceptable to eat ?
and thirdly , the fact that the people involved were perceived as quite normal , the fact that it was n't just them , but hundreds and thousands of people worldwide who are interested in cannibalism - this something that appeals to so many people . bildunterschrift : meiwes killed brandes in his house in a hamlet called wüstefeld near rotenburg in the central german state of hesse how did you go about writing the book ? i approached meiwes in prison , he wrote back a curt , type-written letter .
it was n't particularly friendly , he basically said that he would n't agree to be interviewed because he wanted to write his own book .
it was a bit of a relief .
so i talked to friends , acquaintances , people he 'd gone to school with , policemen , lawyers - anyone who had anything to do with him .
a lot of people were willing to talk about it .
neighbors were keen to talk about it because it maybe helped them understand , being able to talk about it with someone else .
i also checked out cannibal web sites and chat rooms , which were slightly disturbing , i must admit . was it difficult for you to deal with the subject for months ? it surprised me in some ways - i am a person who does get upset when i watch a horror movie , but i was able to distance myself more than i thought .
admittedly , i did find some chapters particularly gruesome .
i was n't allowed to see the video -lrb- depicting the slaughter -rrb- , but people described what happened .
that bit particularly was gruesome , detectives had to receive counseling because it was so disturbing . you include the brandes ' thoughts in your book .
where did you get that information ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd-jügen brandes it says in the front of the book that " the events in the book are real , or as close to real as humanly possible . "
a lot of it is from what meiwes told psychologists , what he said in court , and how psychologists said -lrb- brandes -rrb- would be thinking . meiwes has sold the rights to his story .
how do you feel about that ? in his letter , meiwes told me that if i were interested in being a ghost writer for his autobiography , i should apply to his lawyer .
i did n't want to do that .
i do n't think it 's quite right that he should be making money out of what he 's done .
it 's not helping him at all - here 's someone who needs help and it 's only going to fuel his ego .
he has stated that he no longer feels the need to eat another man .
but before he was caught by police , he was looking around for other victims , which indicates that he has n't gotten over this urge .
there are fans , web sites on the internet that are dedicated to him .
in a way this could encourage people out there who have similar tendencies to actually carry them out . is n't your book also helping to promote his celebrity ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : book cover - lois jones : " cannibal " what i tried to write was an objective view of what happened and not glorify what he 's done .
my book was trying to be more , look , this is what happened . your book came out as a mass-market edition , which is also sold in supermarkets in the us .
it is very graphic at times .
would you have written it differently if you 'd written it for a different publication ? the publishers were certainly keen for it to be written the way it was .
they were very liberal in giving me a free reign , but i probably would have written it a little less gruesome . do you think you 'll write another true crime book ? i think i could , but i do n't solely want to write them .
right now i 'm writing a book about -lrb- british discount airline -rrb- easyjet .

the first book on the german cannibal has just been released in english .
dw-world talked to the author . germany and the world were shocked in december 2002 , when details about meiwes ' deed first emerged : he confessed to stabbing and eating 43-year-old bernd-jürgen brandes .
what disturbed people most , however , was that brandes had agreed to his slaughter and even tried to consume his own genitals before meiwes killed him . meiwes , who has never expressed remorse over what he did , was sentenced to eight years and six months in prison for manslaughter in january 2003 .
he has declined requests for interviews as he has sold his story to a german media production company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lois jones that 's why lois jones -lrb- photo -rrb- , a munich-based journalist from wales , based her book " cannibal " on interviews with friends and relatives of both men and those involved in meiwes ' trial .
the result is the most graphic and detailed account of the case published for a general audience so far . dw-world : what was your reaction when you first heard about the case ? lois jones : i was shocked , basically .
i felt what these two men did pushed far beyond the boundaries of what is acceptable .
germany is a very civilized society .
it amazed me that something like this was going on in europe in today 's world .
i did find it revolting .
i 'm quite a squeamish person and also a strict vegetarian , which made it even more disgusting or shocking for me .
i found it almost incomprehensible .
i found meiwes more revolting and brandes more disturbing : as soon as i heard about it , i was mystified and thought , " what could drive a man , a seemingly successful man , to be eaten by another ? " what made you decide to write about it ? the publisher was looking for someone to write the story - a native english speaker , working as a journalist in germany .
i always wanted to write books and thought , " maybe now is the right time to start . "
i found the subject fascinating : what would drive someone to eat a man ?
why would his victim give his consent ? what fascinated you most about the story ? three main things : first , the psychology of the two men involved .
what shocked me about both of them was that people had no idea and thought they were relatively normal individuals .
it was very hard to believe .
secondly , i 'm a strict vegetarian , i 've consciously not eaten meat for years and was interested in the question : what do people think is acceptable to eat ?
and thirdly , the fact that the people involved were perceived as quite normal , the fact that it was n't just them , but hundreds and thousands of people worldwide who are interested in cannibalism - this something that appeals to so many people . bildunterschrift : meiwes killed brandes in his house in a hamlet called wüstefeld near rotenburg in the central german state of hesse how did you go about writing the book ? i approached meiwes in prison , he wrote back a curt , type-written letter .
it was n't particularly friendly , he basically said that he would n't agree to be interviewed because he wanted to write his own book .
it was a bit of a relief .
so i talked to friends , acquaintances , people he 'd gone to school with , policemen , lawyers - anyone who had anything to do with him .
a lot of people were willing to talk about it .
neighbors were keen to talk about it because it maybe helped them understand , being able to talk about it with someone else .
i also checked out cannibal web sites and chat rooms , which were slightly disturbing , i must admit . was it difficult for you to deal with the subject for months ? it surprised me in some ways - i am a person who does get upset when i watch a horror movie , but i was able to distance myself more than i thought .
admittedly , i did find some chapters particularly gruesome .
i was n't allowed to see the video -lrb- depicting the slaughter -rrb- , but people described what happened .
that bit particularly was gruesome , detectives had to receive counseling because it was so disturbing . you include the brandes ' thoughts in your book .
where did you get that information ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd-jügen brandes it says in the front of the book that " the events in the book are real , or as close to real as humanly possible . "
a lot of it is from what meiwes told psychologists , what he said in court , and how psychologists said -lrb- brandes -rrb- would be thinking . meiwes has sold the rights to his story .
how do you feel about that ? in his letter , meiwes told me that if i were interested in being a ghost writer for his autobiography , i should apply to his lawyer .
i did n't want to do that .
i do n't think it 's quite right that he should be making money out of what he 's done .
it 's not helping him at all - here 's someone who needs help and it 's only going to fuel his ego .
he has stated that he no longer feels the need to eat another man .
but before he was caught by police , he was looking around for other victims , which indicates that he has n't gotten over this urge .
there are fans , web sites on the internet that are dedicated to him .
in a way this could encourage people out there who have similar tendencies to actually carry them out . is n't your book also helping to promote his celebrity ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : book cover - lois jones : " cannibal " what i tried to write was an objective view of what happened and not glorify what he 's done .
my book was trying to be more , look , this is what happened . your book came out as a mass-market edition , which is also sold in supermarkets in the us .
it is very graphic at times .
would you have written it differently if you 'd written it for a different publication ? the publishers were certainly keen for it to be written the way it was .
they were very liberal in giving me a free reign , but i probably would have written it a little less gruesome . do you think you 'll write another true crime book ? i think i could , but i do n't solely want to write them .
right now i 'm writing a book about -lrb- british discount airline -rrb- easyjet .
that 's a bit less gruesome . mathis winkler interviewed lois jones send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cannibal convicted of manslaughter one of the most sensational trials in german legal history ended on friday when judges convicted self-confessed cannibal , armin meiwes , to eight years and six months in prison .

as the third summit of interior ministers and high-ranking government officials from the 46-member council of europe enters its last day in warsaw , talks continue to focus on tackling terrorism and organized crime . polish president aleksander kwasniewski warned council of europe member states friday against paralyzing democracy in the fight against organised crime and terrorism . " we must be careful to avoid that the fight against terrorism and organized crime do not paralyze the smooth functioning of a normal democratic society .
we must not lose what constitutes the basis of a democratic society , " said kwasniewski , whose country has chaired the council 's committee of ministers since november . " given that criminal activity transcends national borders , we must reinforce cooperation among our intelligence services and better control the flow of people and merchandise , " kwasniewski told the meeting in warsaw .
but he stressed that any moves to clamp down on organized crime and terrorism must be taken with respect for individual freedoms . developing strategies ministerial-level meetings at the conference are being held behind closed doors and are focussing on special investigative techniques , the protection of witnesses , money laundering and the financing of terrorism . the officials are also debating two draft conventions aimed at nipping in the bud terrorism and other forms of serious crime in the early , preparative stages . the draft convention on the prevention of terrorism proposes criminalizing acts deemed as laying the groundwork for a terrorist attack , such as provocation of terrorism , recruitment and training .

" we ca n't wait for another madrid or beslan , " he said , calling on delegates " to provide a message of support for the new instruments " being debated at the two-day meeting . more than 340 people died , half of them children , when a standoff between law enforcement authorities and hostage-takers who had herded more than 1,000 students and teachers into a school in the southern russian town of beslan last september ended in a chaotic shootout . the bombing of four madrid commuter trains on march 11 last year killed 191 people and injured over 1,900 . fleshing out the anti-terror convention negotiating the terms of the anti-terror convention , expected to be ready by may , showed " how difficult it can be to enhance the efficiency of the fight against terrorism at the same time as safeguarding fundamental human rights , " said davis , a former british lawmaker .
" but it has also shown that it is possible to reconcile these twin objectives . " " terrorism is an attack on human rights , " he went on .
" however , while tackling terrorism , we must be careful not to undermine human rights , " he said . davis said he expected recommendations on the topics debated by the conference as well as the new conventions to be adopted by the end of the month .

as the third summit of interior ministers and high-ranking government officials from the 46-member council of europe enters its last day in warsaw , talks continue to focus on tackling terrorism and organized crime . polish president aleksander kwasniewski warned council of europe member states friday against paralyzing democracy in the fight against organised crime and terrorism . " we must be careful to avoid that the fight against terrorism and organized crime do not paralyze the smooth functioning of a normal democratic society .
we must not lose what constitutes the basis of a democratic society , " said kwasniewski , whose country has chaired the council 's committee of ministers since november . " given that criminal activity transcends national borders , we must reinforce cooperation among our intelligence services and better control the flow of people and merchandise , " kwasniewski told the meeting in warsaw .
but he stressed that any moves to clamp down on organized crime and terrorism must be taken with respect for individual freedoms . developing strategies ministerial-level meetings at the conference are being held behind closed doors and are focussing on special investigative techniques , the protection of witnesses , money laundering and the financing of terrorism . the officials are also debating two draft conventions aimed at nipping in the bud terrorism and other forms of serious crime in the early , preparative stages . the draft convention on the prevention of terrorism proposes criminalizing acts deemed as laying the groundwork for a terrorist attack , such as provocation of terrorism , recruitment and training .

" we ca n't wait for another madrid or beslan , " he said , calling on delegates " to provide a message of support for the new instruments " being debated at the two-day meeting . more than 340 people died , half of them children , when a standoff between law enforcement authorities and hostage-takers who had herded more than 1,000 students and teachers into a school in the southern russian town of beslan last september ended in a chaotic shootout . the bombing of four madrid commuter trains on march 11 last year killed 191 people and injured over 1,900 . fleshing out the anti-terror convention negotiating the terms of the anti-terror convention , expected to be ready by may , showed " how difficult it can be to enhance the efficiency of the fight against terrorism at the same time as safeguarding fundamental human rights , " said davis , a former british lawmaker .
" but it has also shown that it is possible to reconcile these twin objectives . " " terrorism is an attack on human rights , " he went on .
" however , while tackling terrorism , we must be careful not to undermine human rights , " he said . davis said he expected recommendations on the topics debated by the conference as well as the new conventions to be adopted by the end of the month .

the positive noises emanating from the summit suggested harmony but critics complained of issues swept under the carpet . russian president vladimir putin on friday was given a friendly reception by the leaders of france , germany and spain when they met for informal talks aimed at bolstering recently strained ties between moscow and the european union . french president jacques chirac invited german chancellor gerhard schröder and spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero to his elysee palace for the first-ever such meeting , after holding bilateral talks with putin . at a press conference after the 90-minute four-way session , the leaders said it had been a useful preparation for an eu-russian summit due in may .
" france , germany , spain and russia see in this relationship a way of ensuring ... the definitive establishment of peace , democracy and the rule of law across the whole of our continent , " chirac said . among the issues under discussion were the so-called four " common spaces " meant to guide eu-russian ties through 2007 - the economy , justice and internal security , external security , and education and culture , chirac said .
the leaders also touched on international affairs , including kosovo , iran , the middle east peace process , iraq and lebanon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder was welcomed by chirac on friday all four leaders were in agreement that iran should be prevented from developing nuclear weapons .
" we are working very closely on the iran question , " schröder said , dismissing any suggestion of differences even though russia has been supplying tehran with nuclear technology , saying it is for civilian purposes .
president chirac added that " there is no contradiction between the russian position and that of france and germany " when it came to iran . the leaders also agreed on a collective stand in favor of a complete withdrawal of syrian forces from lebanon .
" we have adopted a joint statement on lebanon , a communiqué , which , like the whole international community , insists on the compelling necessity to implement resolution 1559 , " chirac told the press conference , referring to united nations resolution 1559 which calls for a withdrawal which france co-sponsored with the united states .
putin 's agreement on the subject was particularly telling due to russia 's long-standing links with damascus . there was also unanimous agreement to maintain good contacts with the united states but chirac said the eu was " clearly for lifting the embargo " on arms sales to china .
washington wants the ban to remain . in keeping with all the positive news , which included an announcement that the four countries would meet again in the next two months , there was no explicit acknowledgement of the widespread international criticism of putin for flouting democratic norms in his handling of the chechen war , the press and business , as well as in his relations with ukraine and the baltic states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder , zapatero and chirac during a meeting in september 2004 in madrid zapatero said that in russia as elsewhere the best way to fight terrorism was " the force of reason , the force of the rule of law and international cooperation . " last month us president george w. bush publicly criticized russia 's democratic shortcomings at a meeting with putin in bratislava , indicating a new chill in the us-russian relationship . aides to chirac said the purpose of the informal gathering was to " hold out the hand of friendship to putin " to encourage him down the path of political and economic reforms . putin was making his first visit to the french capital since november 2003 , but he and chirac have seen each other several times in the interim - in 2004 at d-day commemorations in normandy and at the g8 summit , and in january at ceremonies marking the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz . the two presidents met with 35 russian writers attending the just-opened paris book fair - deemed safer than a visit to the fair itself , where putin could have faced protestors . after a private lunch , chirac accompanied putin on a visit to an air force base outside the capital , a gesture of reciprocity after the russian president took chirac to see a top secret russian space center last april . putin , chirac and schröder first forged their alliance two years ago when they spearheaded opposition to the us-led war in iraq .
chirac invited zapatero , whom he sees as a new ally in the european union , to join the group . but the meeting risked annoying leaders elsewhere in europe - notably in poland and the baltics - where any franco-german effort to set the agenda for the eu 's relations with russia would be strongly opposed . chirac 's office said other countries - and the european commission in brussels - should not feel slighted , as it was important to encourage all kinds of links with moscow . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin says he 's ready to talk in germany for a two-day visit , vladimir putin said he 's ready to work with the eu about the chechnya conflict and is prepared to answer questions about delicate subjects like ukraine and press freedom .

chirac invited zapatero , whom he sees as a new ally in the european union , to join the group . but the meeting risked annoying leaders elsewhere in europe - notably in poland and the baltics - where any franco-german effort to set the agenda for the eu 's relations with russia would be strongly opposed . chirac 's office said other countries - and the european commission in brussels - should not feel slighted , as it was important to encourage all kinds of links with moscow . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin says he 's ready to talk in germany for a two-day visit , vladimir putin said he 's ready to work with the eu about the chechnya conflict and is prepared to answer questions about delicate subjects like ukraine and press freedom .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.03.2005 canvassing a cannibal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meiwes has never shown remorse for his crime armin meiwes , who admittedly killed and ate another man , made headlines around the world .
the first book on the german cannibal has just been released in english .
dw-world talked to the author . germany and the world were shocked in december 2002 , when details about meiwes ' deed first emerged : he confessed to stabbing and eating 43-year-old bernd-jürgen brandes .
what disturbed people most , however , was that brandes had agreed to his slaughter and even tried to consume his own genitals before meiwes killed him . meiwes , who has never expressed remorse over what he did , was sentenced to eight years and six months in prison for manslaughter in january 2003 .
he has declined requests for interviews as he has sold his story to a german media production company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lois jones that 's why lois jones -lrb- photo -rrb- , a munich-based journalist from wales , based her book " cannibal " on interviews with friends and relatives of both men and those involved in meiwes ' trial .
the result is the most graphic and detailed account of the case published for a general audience so far . dw-world : what was your reaction when you first heard about the case ? lois jones : i was shocked , basically .
i felt what these two men did pushed far beyond the boundaries of what is acceptable .
germany is a very civilized society .
it amazed me that something like this was going on in europe in today 's world .
i did find it revolting .
i 'm quite a squeamish person and also a strict vegetarian , which made it even more disgusting or shocking for me .
i found it almost incomprehensible .
i found meiwes more revolting and brandes more disturbing : as soon as i heard about it , i was mystified and thought , " what could drive a man , a seemingly successful man , to be eaten by another ? " what made you decide to write about it ? the publisher was looking for someone to write the story - a native english speaker , working as a journalist in germany .
i always wanted to write books and thought , " maybe now is the right time to start . "
i found the subject fascinating : what would drive someone to eat a man ?
why would his victim give his consent ? what fascinated you most about the story ? three main things : first , the psychology of the two men involved .
what shocked me about both of them was that people had no idea and thought they were relatively normal individuals .
it was very hard to believe .
secondly , i 'm a strict vegetarian , i 've consciously not eaten meat for years and was interested in the question : what do people think is acceptable to eat ?
and thirdly , the fact that the people involved were perceived as quite normal , the fact that it was n't just them , but hundreds and thousands of people worldwide who are interested in cannibalism - this something that appeals to so many people . bildunterschrift : meiwes killed brandes in his house in a hamlet called wüstefeld near rotenburg in the central german state of hesse how did you go about writing the book ? i approached meiwes in prison , he wrote back a curt , type-written letter .
it was n't particularly friendly , he basically said that he would n't agree to be interviewed because he wanted to write his own book .
it was a bit of a relief .
so i talked to friends , acquaintances , people he 'd gone to school with , policemen , lawyers - anyone who had anything to do with him .
a lot of people were willing to talk about it .
neighbors were keen to talk about it because it maybe helped them understand , being able to talk about it with someone else .
i also checked out cannibal web sites and chat rooms , which were slightly disturbing , i must admit . was it difficult for you to deal with the subject for months ? it surprised me in some ways - i am a person who does get upset when i watch a horror movie , but i was able to distance myself more than i thought .
admittedly , i did find some chapters particularly gruesome .
i was n't allowed to see the video -lrb- depicting the slaughter -rrb- , but people described what happened .
that bit particularly was gruesome , detectives had to receive counseling because it was so disturbing . you include the brandes ' thoughts in your book .
where did you get that information ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd-jügen brandes it says in the front of the book that " the events in the book are real , or as close to real as humanly possible . "
a lot of it is from what meiwes told psychologists , what he said in court , and how psychologists said -lrb- brandes -rrb- would be thinking . meiwes has sold the rights to his story .
how do you feel about that ? in his letter , meiwes told me that if i were interested in being a ghost writer for his autobiography , i should apply to his lawyer .
i did n't want to do that .
i do n't think it 's quite right that he should be making money out of what he 's done .
it 's not helping him at all - here 's someone who needs help and it 's only going to fuel his ego .
he has stated that he no longer feels the need to eat another man .
but before he was caught by police , he was looking around for other victims , which indicates that he has n't gotten over this urge .
there are fans , web sites on the internet that are dedicated to him .
in a way this could encourage people out there who have similar tendencies to actually carry them out . is n't your book also helping to promote his celebrity ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : book cover - lois jones : " cannibal " what i tried to write was an objective view of what happened and not glorify what he 's done .
my book was trying to be more , look , this is what happened . your book came out as a mass-market edition , which is also sold in supermarkets in the us .
it is very graphic at times .
would you have written it differently if you 'd written it for a different publication ? the publishers were certainly keen for it to be written the way it was .
they were very liberal in giving me a free reign , but i probably would have written it a little less gruesome . do you think you 'll write another true crime book ? i think i could , but i do n't solely want to write them .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.03.2005 canvassing a cannibal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meiwes has never shown remorse for his crime armin meiwes , who admittedly killed and ate another man , made headlines around the world .
the first book on the german cannibal has just been released in english .
dw-world talked to the author . germany and the world were shocked in december 2002 , when details about meiwes ' deed first emerged : he confessed to stabbing and eating 43-year-old bernd-jürgen brandes .
what disturbed people most , however , was that brandes had agreed to his slaughter and even tried to consume his own genitals before meiwes killed him . meiwes , who has never expressed remorse over what he did , was sentenced to eight years and six months in prison for manslaughter in january 2003 .
he has declined requests for interviews as he has sold his story to a german media production company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lois jones that 's why lois jones -lrb- photo -rrb- , a munich-based journalist from wales , based her book " cannibal " on interviews with friends and relatives of both men and those involved in meiwes ' trial .
the result is the most graphic and detailed account of the case published for a general audience so far . dw-world : what was your reaction when you first heard about the case ? lois jones : i was shocked , basically .
i felt what these two men did pushed far beyond the boundaries of what is acceptable .
germany is a very civilized society .
it amazed me that something like this was going on in europe in today 's world .
i did find it revolting .
i 'm quite a squeamish person and also a strict vegetarian , which made it even more disgusting or shocking for me .
i found it almost incomprehensible .
i found meiwes more revolting and brandes more disturbing : as soon as i heard about it , i was mystified and thought , " what could drive a man , a seemingly successful man , to be eaten by another ? " what made you decide to write about it ? the publisher was looking for someone to write the story - a native english speaker , working as a journalist in germany .
i always wanted to write books and thought , " maybe now is the right time to start . "
i found the subject fascinating : what would drive someone to eat a man ?
why would his victim give his consent ? what fascinated you most about the story ? three main things : first , the psychology of the two men involved .
what shocked me about both of them was that people had no idea and thought they were relatively normal individuals .
it was very hard to believe .
secondly , i 'm a strict vegetarian , i 've consciously not eaten meat for years and was interested in the question : what do people think is acceptable to eat ?
and thirdly , the fact that the people involved were perceived as quite normal , the fact that it was n't just them , but hundreds and thousands of people worldwide who are interested in cannibalism - this something that appeals to so many people . bildunterschrift : meiwes killed brandes in his house in a hamlet called wüstefeld near rotenburg in the central german state of hesse how did you go about writing the book ? i approached meiwes in prison , he wrote back a curt , type-written letter .
it was n't particularly friendly , he basically said that he would n't agree to be interviewed because he wanted to write his own book .
it was a bit of a relief .
so i talked to friends , acquaintances , people he 'd gone to school with , policemen , lawyers - anyone who had anything to do with him .
a lot of people were willing to talk about it .
neighbors were keen to talk about it because it maybe helped them understand , being able to talk about it with someone else .
i also checked out cannibal web sites and chat rooms , which were slightly disturbing , i must admit . was it difficult for you to deal with the subject for months ? it surprised me in some ways - i am a person who does get upset when i watch a horror movie , but i was able to distance myself more than i thought .
admittedly , i did find some chapters particularly gruesome .
i was n't allowed to see the video -lrb- depicting the slaughter -rrb- , but people described what happened .
that bit particularly was gruesome , detectives had to receive counseling because it was so disturbing . you include the brandes ' thoughts in your book .
where did you get that information ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd-jügen brandes it says in the front of the book that " the events in the book are real , or as close to real as humanly possible . "
a lot of it is from what meiwes told psychologists , what he said in court , and how psychologists said -lrb- brandes -rrb- would be thinking . meiwes has sold the rights to his story .
how do you feel about that ? in his letter , meiwes told me that if i were interested in being a ghost writer for his autobiography , i should apply to his lawyer .
i did n't want to do that .
i do n't think it 's quite right that he should be making money out of what he 's done .
it 's not helping him at all - here 's someone who needs help and it 's only going to fuel his ego .
he has stated that he no longer feels the need to eat another man .
but before he was caught by police , he was looking around for other victims , which indicates that he has n't gotten over this urge .
there are fans , web sites on the internet that are dedicated to him .
in a way this could encourage people out there who have similar tendencies to actually carry them out . is n't your book also helping to promote his celebrity ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : book cover - lois jones : " cannibal " what i tried to write was an objective view of what happened and not glorify what he 's done .
my book was trying to be more , look , this is what happened . your book came out as a mass-market edition , which is also sold in supermarkets in the us .
it is very graphic at times .
would you have written it differently if you 'd written it for a different publication ? the publishers were certainly keen for it to be written the way it was .
they were very liberal in giving me a free reign , but i probably would have written it a little less gruesome . do you think you 'll write another true crime book ? i think i could , but i do n't solely want to write them .
right now i 'm writing a book about -lrb- british discount airline -rrb- easyjet .
that 's a bit less gruesome . mathis winkler interviewed lois jones send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cannibal convicted of manslaughter one of the most sensational trials in german legal history ended on friday when judges convicted self-confessed cannibal , armin meiwes , to eight years and six months in prison .

we must not lose what constitutes the basis of a democratic society , " said kwasniewski , whose country has chaired the council 's committee of ministers since november . " given that criminal activity transcends national borders , we must reinforce cooperation among our intelligence services and better control the flow of people and merchandise , " kwasniewski told the meeting in warsaw .
but he stressed that any moves to clamp down on organized crime and terrorism must be taken with respect for individual freedoms . developing strategies ministerial-level meetings at the conference are being held behind closed doors and are focussing on special investigative techniques , the protection of witnesses , money laundering and the financing of terrorism . the officials are also debating two draft conventions aimed at nipping in the bud terrorism and other forms of serious crime in the early , preparative stages . the draft convention on the prevention of terrorism proposes criminalizing acts deemed as laying the groundwork for a terrorist attack , such as provocation of terrorism , recruitment and training .

as the third summit of interior ministers and high-ranking government officials from the 46-member council of europe enters its last day in warsaw , talks continue to focus on tackling terrorism and organized crime . polish president aleksander kwasniewski warned council of europe member states friday against paralyzing democracy in the fight against organised crime and terrorism . " we must be careful to avoid that the fight against terrorism and organized crime do not paralyze the smooth functioning of a normal democratic society .
we must not lose what constitutes the basis of a democratic society , " said kwasniewski , whose country has chaired the council 's committee of ministers since november . " given that criminal activity transcends national borders , we must reinforce cooperation among our intelligence services and better control the flow of people and merchandise , " kwasniewski told the meeting in warsaw .
but he stressed that any moves to clamp down on organized crime and terrorism must be taken with respect for individual freedoms . developing strategies ministerial-level meetings at the conference are being held behind closed doors and are focussing on special investigative techniques , the protection of witnesses , money laundering and the financing of terrorism . the officials are also debating two draft conventions aimed at nipping in the bud terrorism and other forms of serious crime in the early , preparative stages . the draft convention on the prevention of terrorism proposes criminalizing acts deemed as laying the groundwork for a terrorist attack , such as provocation of terrorism , recruitment and training .

as the third summit of interior ministers and high-ranking government officials from the 46-member council of europe enters its last day in warsaw , talks continue to focus on tackling terrorism and organized crime . polish president aleksander kwasniewski warned council of europe member states friday against paralyzing democracy in the fight against organised crime and terrorism . " we must be careful to avoid that the fight against terrorism and organized crime do not paralyze the smooth functioning of a normal democratic society .
we must not lose what constitutes the basis of a democratic society , " said kwasniewski , whose country has chaired the council 's committee of ministers since november . " given that criminal activity transcends national borders , we must reinforce cooperation among our intelligence services and better control the flow of people and merchandise , " kwasniewski told the meeting in warsaw .
but he stressed that any moves to clamp down on organized crime and terrorism must be taken with respect for individual freedoms . developing strategies ministerial-level meetings at the conference are being held behind closed doors and are focussing on special investigative techniques , the protection of witnesses , money laundering and the financing of terrorism . the officials are also debating two draft conventions aimed at nipping in the bud terrorism and other forms of serious crime in the early , preparative stages . the draft convention on the prevention of terrorism proposes criminalizing acts deemed as laying the groundwork for a terrorist attack , such as provocation of terrorism , recruitment and training .

in turkey , it 's even become a surprise best-seller . adolf hitler 's infamous - and notoriously badly-written - autobiography has sold more than 50,000 copies in turkey since january , and is currently number four on the best-seller list drawn up by the d & r bookstore chain . " ' mein kampf ' has always been a sleeper , a secret best-seller , " said oguz tektas of mefisto editions , one of several publishing houses to re-release the book hitler wrote while in jail in 1925 .
" we took it out of the closet for purely commercial reasons . " his company 's sole aim , he stressed , was " to make money , " which they did - by slashing the cover price . " mein kampf , " published by about a dozen companies over the years , always sold at a fairly steady annual rate of about 20,000 at some 20 new turkish lira -lrb- 11.3 euros or $ 15 -rrb- a copy .
the mefisto edition retails at 3.3 euros -lrb- $ 4.5 -rrb- and sold 23,000 copies in two months . turkish nationalism the readership ?
" those who want to know about a man who wreaked death and destruction on the world , " tektas said . " mostly young people , " said sami kilic , owner of the emre publishing house , another company on the " mein kampf " bandwagon , which sold 26,000 copies from a run of 31,000 released in late january . " the times we live in have a definite impact on sales , " kilic said .
" it is an astonishing phenomenon . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he linked interest in the book to turkey 's bid to join the european union , seen by the right-wing as a desertion of national values , and rising sentiment against the united states and its ally israel over the treatment they are perceived here as meting out to the iraqis and the palestinians , respectively . " this book , which does not contain a single ounce of humanity , unfortunately appears to be taken seriously in this country , " political scientist dogu ergil complained in a recent newspaper interview .
he agreed that the unexpected popularity of " mein kampf " in the muslim-majority country has its roots in a rise in anti-american sentiment sparked by the occupation of iraq and anti-semitism resulting from israel 's palestinian policy . " nazism , buried in the dustbin of history in europe , is beginning to re-emerge in turkey , " he warned . a rise in anti-semitism ? silvyo ovadya , the head of turkey 's jewish community , said he was " troubled " by the book 's popularity , telling afp he was " astonished a 500-page book that sows the seeds of racism and anti-semitism can sell at such a low price . "
but , he said , his complaints to the publishers have gone unheeded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : * * archiv * * burnt vehicles are seen after an explosion outside of the neve shalom synagogue in istanbul , turkey , on nov .

just weeks after polish publication of the book made headlines in bavaria , which holds the rights , the czech supreme court acquitted michal zitko , a publisher who had been convicted of supporting a movement aimed at suppressing human rights by publishing a czech translation of " mein kampf . " last january , prague city court gave him a three-year suspended sentence , which was then overturned by the higher court in brno .
supreme court chairman eduard teschler concluded there was no evidence that zitko actively supported the movement , for example , by recruiting supporters . jewish anger in azerbaijan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meanwhile , the general prosecutor 's office of azerbaijan last december investigated the publication of " mein kampf " by avaz zeynalli , the editor of an azeri newspaper . according to zeynalli , the investigation was prompted by a complaint by the israeli embassy in baku and the azeri jewish community .
the editor was questioned by officials with the azeri interior ministry 's anti-organized crime department .
zeynalli said he had translated " mein kampf " into azeri from the turkish language and had placed an order with a printing house for the publication of 300 copies , 100 of which had already been printed . he argued that the publication of " mein kampf , " which openly advocates extermining the jews , was not banned in azerbaijan . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de row erupts over hitler book in poland the polish publication of hitler 's " mein kampf " has angered bavaria , which holds the rights .

the first book on the german cannibal has just been released in english .
dw-world talked to the author . germany and the world were shocked in december 2002 , when details about meiwes ' deed first emerged : he confessed to stabbing and eating 43-year-old bernd-jürgen brandes .
what disturbed people most , however , was that brandes had agreed to his slaughter and even tried to consume his own genitals before meiwes killed him . meiwes , who has never expressed remorse over what he did , was sentenced to eight years and six months in prison for manslaughter in january 2003 .
he has declined requests for interviews as he has sold his story to a german media production company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lois jones that 's why lois jones -lrb- photo -rrb- , a munich-based journalist from wales , based her book " cannibal " on interviews with friends and relatives of both men and those involved in meiwes ' trial .
the result is the most graphic and detailed account of the case published for a general audience so far . dw-world : what was your reaction when you first heard about the case ? lois jones : i was shocked , basically .
i felt what these two men did pushed far beyond the boundaries of what is acceptable .
germany is a very civilized society .
it amazed me that something like this was going on in europe in today 's world .
i did find it revolting .
i 'm quite a squeamish person and also a strict vegetarian , which made it even more disgusting or shocking for me .
i found it almost incomprehensible .
i found meiwes more revolting and brandes more disturbing : as soon as i heard about it , i was mystified and thought , " what could drive a man , a seemingly successful man , to be eaten by another ? " what made you decide to write about it ? the publisher was looking for someone to write the story - a native english speaker , working as a journalist in germany .
i always wanted to write books and thought , " maybe now is the right time to start . "
i found the subject fascinating : what would drive someone to eat a man ?
why would his victim give his consent ? what fascinated you most about the story ? three main things : first , the psychology of the two men involved .
what shocked me about both of them was that people had no idea and thought they were relatively normal individuals .
it was very hard to believe .
secondly , i 'm a strict vegetarian , i 've consciously not eaten meat for years and was interested in the question : what do people think is acceptable to eat ?
and thirdly , the fact that the people involved were perceived as quite normal , the fact that it was n't just them , but hundreds and thousands of people worldwide who are interested in cannibalism - this something that appeals to so many people . bildunterschrift : meiwes killed brandes in his house in a hamlet called wüstefeld near rotenburg in the central german state of hesse how did you go about writing the book ? i approached meiwes in prison , he wrote back a curt , type-written letter .
it was n't particularly friendly , he basically said that he would n't agree to be interviewed because he wanted to write his own book .
it was a bit of a relief .
so i talked to friends , acquaintances , people he 'd gone to school with , policemen , lawyers - anyone who had anything to do with him .
a lot of people were willing to talk about it .
neighbors were keen to talk about it because it maybe helped them understand , being able to talk about it with someone else .
i also checked out cannibal web sites and chat rooms , which were slightly disturbing , i must admit . was it difficult for you to deal with the subject for months ? it surprised me in some ways - i am a person who does get upset when i watch a horror movie , but i was able to distance myself more than i thought .
admittedly , i did find some chapters particularly gruesome .
i was n't allowed to see the video -lrb- depicting the slaughter -rrb- , but people described what happened .
that bit particularly was gruesome , detectives had to receive counseling because it was so disturbing . you include the brandes ' thoughts in your book .
where did you get that information ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd-jügen brandes it says in the front of the book that " the events in the book are real , or as close to real as humanly possible . "
a lot of it is from what meiwes told psychologists , what he said in court , and how psychologists said -lrb- brandes -rrb- would be thinking . meiwes has sold the rights to his story .
how do you feel about that ? in his letter , meiwes told me that if i were interested in being a ghost writer for his autobiography , i should apply to his lawyer .
i did n't want to do that .
i do n't think it 's quite right that he should be making money out of what he 's done .
it 's not helping him at all - here 's someone who needs help and it 's only going to fuel his ego .
he has stated that he no longer feels the need to eat another man .
but before he was caught by police , he was looking around for other victims , which indicates that he has n't gotten over this urge .
there are fans , web sites on the internet that are dedicated to him .
in a way this could encourage people out there who have similar tendencies to actually carry them out . is n't your book also helping to promote his celebrity ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : book cover - lois jones : " cannibal " what i tried to write was an objective view of what happened and not glorify what he 's done .
my book was trying to be more , look , this is what happened . your book came out as a mass-market edition , which is also sold in supermarkets in the us .
it is very graphic at times .
would you have written it differently if you 'd written it for a different publication ? the publishers were certainly keen for it to be written the way it was .
they were very liberal in giving me a free reign , but i probably would have written it a little less gruesome . do you think you 'll write another true crime book ? i think i could , but i do n't solely want to write them .
right now i 'm writing a book about -lrb- british discount airline -rrb- easyjet .
that 's a bit less gruesome . mathis winkler interviewed lois jones send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cannibal convicted of manslaughter one of the most sensational trials in german legal history ended on friday when judges convicted self-confessed cannibal , armin meiwes , to eight years and six months in prison .

in turkey , it 's even become a surprise best-seller . adolf hitler 's infamous - and notoriously badly-written - autobiography has sold more than 50,000 copies in turkey since january , and is currently number four on the best-seller list drawn up by the d & r bookstore chain . " ' mein kampf ' has always been a sleeper , a secret best-seller , " said oguz tektas of mefisto editions , one of several publishing houses to re-release the book hitler wrote while in jail in 1925 .
" we took it out of the closet for purely commercial reasons . " his company 's sole aim , he stressed , was " to make money , " which they did - by slashing the cover price . " mein kampf , " published by about a dozen companies over the years , always sold at a fairly steady annual rate of about 20,000 at some 20 new turkish lira -lrb- 11.3 euros or $ 15 -rrb- a copy .
the mefisto edition retails at 3.3 euros -lrb- $ 4.5 -rrb- and sold 23,000 copies in two months . turkish nationalism the readership ?
" those who want to know about a man who wreaked death and destruction on the world , " tektas said . " mostly young people , " said sami kilic , owner of the emre publishing house , another company on the " mein kampf " bandwagon , which sold 26,000 copies from a run of 31,000 released in late january . " the times we live in have a definite impact on sales , " kilic said .
" it is an astonishing phenomenon . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he linked interest in the book to turkey 's bid to join the european union , seen by the right-wing as a desertion of national values , and rising sentiment against the united states and its ally israel over the treatment they are perceived here as meting out to the iraqis and the palestinians , respectively . " this book , which does not contain a single ounce of humanity , unfortunately appears to be taken seriously in this country , " political scientist dogu ergil complained in a recent newspaper interview .
he agreed that the unexpected popularity of " mein kampf " in the muslim-majority country has its roots in a rise in anti-american sentiment sparked by the occupation of iraq and anti-semitism resulting from israel 's palestinian policy . " nazism , buried in the dustbin of history in europe , is beginning to re-emerge in turkey , " he warned . a rise in anti-semitism ? silvyo ovadya , the head of turkey 's jewish community , said he was " troubled " by the book 's popularity , telling afp he was " astonished a 500-page book that sows the seeds of racism and anti-semitism can sell at such a low price . "

he 's a former drug user himself .
today , he gives advice to people seeking to overcome addiction .
his services are in such demand , he even has to turn people away . " we have unbelievably long waiting lists , " he explained .
" applicants for our in-house therapy have to wait up to six months . " the therapy and employment programs provided by pauke are precisely what the eu wants to see more of . tackling drug abuse in mid-february , the european commission outlined a plan that set out an eu strategy to combat the increasing problems caused by drug trafficking and drug use .
the first-phase strategy for 2005-2008 is based on a multi-disciplinary approach that foresees reducing demand and supply and steps up the fight against international drug traffickers . the action plan gives a timetable for a set of measures to be carried out at eu level by member states , in cooperation with third countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it includes general policy measures , specific programs aimed at the prevention of drug use among young people , in the workplace and in recreational settings , as well as measures for improving access to treatment programs , both for drug use and drug-related illness .
still a widespread problem the action plan is based on the results of an annual report published by the european monitoring center for drug addiction -lrb- emcdda -rrb- in lisbon .
according to the study , drugs claimed fewer lives in 2004 , but some two million people in europe still have a problem with drug addiction .
roland simon , who worked on the emcdda report , believes the action plan is definitely a step in the right direction .
" i feel the plan has a very sound basis , " he explained .
" it 's a very sensible idea to provide prevention and treatment for people who experiment with drug consumption before they slide too deep into addiction . "
moving away from criminalization one of the main problems support schemes face is financing .
the only projects eligible for eu funding are those that promote europe-wide cooperation .
that means that an initiative such as pauke has to depend on national or even district funding .
in times of economic gloom , these subsidies are the first to feel the pinch .
even so , roland simon is convinced a pan-european drug policy makes sense .
" the advantage of a unified policy , " he said , " is that you can combine targets and develop a common approach that can be pursued on a european-wide level . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the approach that forms the cornerstone of the action plan is that drug addicts are seen as people suffering from an illness rather than criminals .
instead of putting them behind bars , the plan is to refer them to organizations such as pauke and help them return to normal life .
karl-heinz bitzer also welcomes the eu 's new strategy .
" we 're very glad to see that in the last five years there 's been a move away from criminalizing drug users , " he said .

the first book on the german cannibal has just been released in english .
dw-world talked to the author . germany and the world were shocked in december 2002 , when details about meiwes ' deed first emerged : he confessed to stabbing and eating 43-year-old bernd-jürgen brandes .
what disturbed people most , however , was that brandes had agreed to his slaughter and even tried to consume his own genitals before meiwes killed him . meiwes , who has never expressed remorse over what he did , was sentenced to eight years and six months in prison for manslaughter in january 2003 .
he has declined requests for interviews as he has sold his story to a german media production company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lois jones that 's why lois jones -lrb- photo -rrb- , a munich-based journalist from wales , based her book " cannibal " on interviews with friends and relatives of both men and those involved in meiwes ' trial .
the result is the most graphic and detailed account of the case published for a general audience so far . dw-world : what was your reaction when you first heard about the case ? lois jones : i was shocked , basically .
i felt what these two men did pushed far beyond the boundaries of what is acceptable .
germany is a very civilized society .
it amazed me that something like this was going on in europe in today 's world .
i did find it revolting .
i 'm quite a squeamish person and also a strict vegetarian , which made it even more disgusting or shocking for me .
i found it almost incomprehensible .
i found meiwes more revolting and brandes more disturbing : as soon as i heard about it , i was mystified and thought , " what could drive a man , a seemingly successful man , to be eaten by another ? " what made you decide to write about it ? the publisher was looking for someone to write the story - a native english speaker , working as a journalist in germany .
i always wanted to write books and thought , " maybe now is the right time to start . "
i found the subject fascinating : what would drive someone to eat a man ?
why would his victim give his consent ? what fascinated you most about the story ? three main things : first , the psychology of the two men involved .
what shocked me about both of them was that people had no idea and thought they were relatively normal individuals .
it was very hard to believe .
secondly , i 'm a strict vegetarian , i 've consciously not eaten meat for years and was interested in the question : what do people think is acceptable to eat ?
and thirdly , the fact that the people involved were perceived as quite normal , the fact that it was n't just them , but hundreds and thousands of people worldwide who are interested in cannibalism - this something that appeals to so many people . bildunterschrift : meiwes killed brandes in his house in a hamlet called wüstefeld near rotenburg in the central german state of hesse how did you go about writing the book ? i approached meiwes in prison , he wrote back a curt , type-written letter .
it was n't particularly friendly , he basically said that he would n't agree to be interviewed because he wanted to write his own book .
it was a bit of a relief .
so i talked to friends , acquaintances , people he 'd gone to school with , policemen , lawyers - anyone who had anything to do with him .
a lot of people were willing to talk about it .
neighbors were keen to talk about it because it maybe helped them understand , being able to talk about it with someone else .
i also checked out cannibal web sites and chat rooms , which were slightly disturbing , i must admit . was it difficult for you to deal with the subject for months ? it surprised me in some ways - i am a person who does get upset when i watch a horror movie , but i was able to distance myself more than i thought .
admittedly , i did find some chapters particularly gruesome .
i was n't allowed to see the video -lrb- depicting the slaughter -rrb- , but people described what happened .
that bit particularly was gruesome , detectives had to receive counseling because it was so disturbing . you include the brandes ' thoughts in your book .
where did you get that information ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd-jügen brandes it says in the front of the book that " the events in the book are real , or as close to real as humanly possible . "
a lot of it is from what meiwes told psychologists , what he said in court , and how psychologists said -lrb- brandes -rrb- would be thinking . meiwes has sold the rights to his story .
how do you feel about that ? in his letter , meiwes told me that if i were interested in being a ghost writer for his autobiography , i should apply to his lawyer .
i did n't want to do that .
i do n't think it 's quite right that he should be making money out of what he 's done .
it 's not helping him at all - here 's someone who needs help and it 's only going to fuel his ego .
he has stated that he no longer feels the need to eat another man .
but before he was caught by police , he was looking around for other victims , which indicates that he has n't gotten over this urge .
there are fans , web sites on the internet that are dedicated to him .
in a way this could encourage people out there who have similar tendencies to actually carry them out . is n't your book also helping to promote his celebrity ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : book cover - lois jones : " cannibal " what i tried to write was an objective view of what happened and not glorify what he 's done .
my book was trying to be more , look , this is what happened . your book came out as a mass-market edition , which is also sold in supermarkets in the us .
it is very graphic at times .
would you have written it differently if you 'd written it for a different publication ? the publishers were certainly keen for it to be written the way it was .
they were very liberal in giving me a free reign , but i probably would have written it a little less gruesome . do you think you 'll write another true crime book ? i think i could , but i do n't solely want to write them .

and thirdly , the fact that the people involved were perceived as quite normal , the fact that it was n't just them , but hundreds and thousands of people worldwide who are interested in cannibalism - this something that appeals to so many people . bildunterschrift : meiwes killed brandes in his house in a hamlet called wüstefeld near rotenburg in the central german state of hesse how did you go about writing the book ? i approached meiwes in prison , he wrote back a curt , type-written letter .
it was n't particularly friendly , he basically said that he would n't agree to be interviewed because he wanted to write his own book .
it was a bit of a relief .
so i talked to friends , acquaintances , people he 'd gone to school with , policemen , lawyers - anyone who had anything to do with him .
a lot of people were willing to talk about it .
neighbors were keen to talk about it because it maybe helped them understand , being able to talk about it with someone else .
i also checked out cannibal web sites and chat rooms , which were slightly disturbing , i must admit . was it difficult for you to deal with the subject for months ? it surprised me in some ways - i am a person who does get upset when i watch a horror movie , but i was able to distance myself more than i thought .
admittedly , i did find some chapters particularly gruesome .
i was n't allowed to see the video -lrb- depicting the slaughter -rrb- , but people described what happened .
that bit particularly was gruesome , detectives had to receive counseling because it was so disturbing . you include the brandes ' thoughts in your book .
where did you get that information ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd-jügen brandes it says in the front of the book that " the events in the book are real , or as close to real as humanly possible . "
a lot of it is from what meiwes told psychologists , what he said in court , and how psychologists said -lrb- brandes -rrb- would be thinking . meiwes has sold the rights to his story .
how do you feel about that ? in his letter , meiwes told me that if i were interested in being a ghost writer for his autobiography , i should apply to his lawyer .
i did n't want to do that .
i do n't think it 's quite right that he should be making money out of what he 's done .
it 's not helping him at all - here 's someone who needs help and it 's only going to fuel his ego .
he has stated that he no longer feels the need to eat another man .
but before he was caught by police , he was looking around for other victims , which indicates that he has n't gotten over this urge .
there are fans , web sites on the internet that are dedicated to him .
in a way this could encourage people out there who have similar tendencies to actually carry them out . is n't your book also helping to promote his celebrity ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : book cover - lois jones : " cannibal " what i tried to write was an objective view of what happened and not glorify what he 's done .
my book was trying to be more , look , this is what happened . your book came out as a mass-market edition , which is also sold in supermarkets in the us .
it is very graphic at times .
would you have written it differently if you 'd written it for a different publication ? the publishers were certainly keen for it to be written the way it was .
they were very liberal in giving me a free reign , but i probably would have written it a little less gruesome . do you think you 'll write another true crime book ? i think i could , but i do n't solely want to write them .
right now i 'm writing a book about -lrb- british discount airline -rrb- easyjet .
that 's a bit less gruesome . mathis winkler interviewed lois jones send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cannibal convicted of manslaughter one of the most sensational trials in german legal history ended on friday when judges convicted self-confessed cannibal , armin meiwes , to eight years and six months in prison .

the bundesrat approved the bill with a large majority after it had received the backing of deputies in the bundestag lower house of parliament last week .
the measures are intended to keep neo-nazi demonstrations away from sites dedicated to victims of the nazi regime .
the new holocaust memorial in central berlin will be specially protected and legal action will be taken against anyone who breaks the laws .
the far-right , led by the neo-nazi national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , is planning to march past the holocaust memorial and to the brandenburg gate on may 8 , the 60th anniversary of germany 's capitulation .
last month , 4,000 right-wing extremists rallied in dresden on the 60th anniversary of the allied bombing of the eastern city . dw-world.de germany moves to curb neo-nazi protests germany 's lower house of parliament friday voted by a large majority to tighten the right of assembly , thus making it easier in future to ban neo-nazi demonstrations at historic landmarks .

the positive noises emanating from the summit suggested harmony but critics complained of issues swept under the carpet . russian president vladimir putin on friday was given a friendly reception by the leaders of france , germany and spain when they met for informal talks aimed at bolstering recently strained ties between moscow and the european union . french president jacques chirac invited german chancellor gerhard schröder and spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero to his elysee palace for the first-ever such meeting , after holding bilateral talks with putin . at a press conference after the 90-minute four-way session , the leaders said it had been a useful preparation for an eu-russian summit due in may .
" france , germany , spain and russia see in this relationship a way of ensuring ... the definitive establishment of peace , democracy and the rule of law across the whole of our continent , " chirac said . among the issues under discussion were the so-called four " common spaces " meant to guide eu-russian ties through 2007 - the economy , justice and internal security , external security , and education and culture , chirac said .
the leaders also touched on international affairs , including kosovo , iran , the middle east peace process , iraq and lebanon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder was welcomed by chirac on friday all four leaders were in agreement that iran should be prevented from developing nuclear weapons .
" we are working very closely on the iran question , " schröder said , dismissing any suggestion of differences even though russia has been supplying tehran with nuclear technology , saying it is for civilian purposes .
president chirac added that " there is no contradiction between the russian position and that of france and germany " when it came to iran . the leaders also agreed on a collective stand in favor of a complete withdrawal of syrian forces from lebanon .
" we have adopted a joint statement on lebanon , a communiqué , which , like the whole international community , insists on the compelling necessity to implement resolution 1559 , " chirac told the press conference , referring to united nations resolution 1559 which calls for a withdrawal which france co-sponsored with the united states .
putin 's agreement on the subject was particularly telling due to russia 's long-standing links with damascus . there was also unanimous agreement to maintain good contacts with the united states but chirac said the eu was " clearly for lifting the embargo " on arms sales to china .
washington wants the ban to remain . in keeping with all the positive news , which included an announcement that the four countries would meet again in the next two months , there was no explicit acknowledgement of the widespread international criticism of putin for flouting democratic norms in his handling of the chechen war , the press and business , as well as in his relations with ukraine and the baltic states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder , zapatero and chirac during a meeting in september 2004 in madrid zapatero said that in russia as elsewhere the best way to fight terrorism was " the force of reason , the force of the rule of law and international cooperation . " last month us president george w. bush publicly criticized russia 's democratic shortcomings at a meeting with putin in bratislava , indicating a new chill in the us-russian relationship . aides to chirac said the purpose of the informal gathering was to " hold out the hand of friendship to putin " to encourage him down the path of political and economic reforms . putin was making his first visit to the french capital since november 2003 , but he and chirac have seen each other several times in the interim - in 2004 at d-day commemorations in normandy and at the g8 summit , and in january at ceremonies marking the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz . the two presidents met with 35 russian writers attending the just-opened paris book fair - deemed safer than a visit to the fair itself , where putin could have faced protestors . after a private lunch , chirac accompanied putin on a visit to an air force base outside the capital , a gesture of reciprocity after the russian president took chirac to see a top secret russian space center last april . putin , chirac and schröder first forged their alliance two years ago when they spearheaded opposition to the us-led war in iraq .
chirac invited zapatero , whom he sees as a new ally in the european union , to join the group . but the meeting risked annoying leaders elsewhere in europe - notably in poland and the baltics - where any franco-german effort to set the agenda for the eu 's relations with russia would be strongly opposed . chirac 's office said other countries - and the european commission in brussels - should not feel slighted , as it was important to encourage all kinds of links with moscow . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin says he 's ready to talk in germany for a two-day visit , vladimir putin said he 's ready to work with the eu about the chechnya conflict and is prepared to answer questions about delicate subjects like ukraine and press freedom .

the positive noises emanating from the summit suggested harmony but critics complained of issues swept under the carpet . russian president vladimir putin on friday was given a friendly reception by the leaders of france , germany and spain when they met for informal talks aimed at bolstering recently strained ties between moscow and the european union . french president jacques chirac invited german chancellor gerhard schröder and spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero to his elysee palace for the first-ever such meeting , after holding bilateral talks with putin . at a press conference after the 90-minute four-way session , the leaders said it had been a useful preparation for an eu-russian summit due in may .
" france , germany , spain and russia see in this relationship a way of ensuring ... the definitive establishment of peace , democracy and the rule of law across the whole of our continent , " chirac said . among the issues under discussion were the so-called four " common spaces " meant to guide eu-russian ties through 2007 - the economy , justice and internal security , external security , and education and culture , chirac said .
the leaders also touched on international affairs , including kosovo , iran , the middle east peace process , iraq and lebanon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder was welcomed by chirac on friday all four leaders were in agreement that iran should be prevented from developing nuclear weapons .
" we are working very closely on the iran question , " schröder said , dismissing any suggestion of differences even though russia has been supplying tehran with nuclear technology , saying it is for civilian purposes .
president chirac added that " there is no contradiction between the russian position and that of france and germany " when it came to iran . the leaders also agreed on a collective stand in favor of a complete withdrawal of syrian forces from lebanon .
" we have adopted a joint statement on lebanon , a communiqué , which , like the whole international community , insists on the compelling necessity to implement resolution 1559 , " chirac told the press conference , referring to united nations resolution 1559 which calls for a withdrawal which france co-sponsored with the united states .
putin 's agreement on the subject was particularly telling due to russia 's long-standing links with damascus . there was also unanimous agreement to maintain good contacts with the united states but chirac said the eu was " clearly for lifting the embargo " on arms sales to china .
washington wants the ban to remain . in keeping with all the positive news , which included an announcement that the four countries would meet again in the next two months , there was no explicit acknowledgement of the widespread international criticism of putin for flouting democratic norms in his handling of the chechen war , the press and business , as well as in his relations with ukraine and the baltic states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder , zapatero and chirac during a meeting in september 2004 in madrid zapatero said that in russia as elsewhere the best way to fight terrorism was " the force of reason , the force of the rule of law and international cooperation .

" our shareholder structure has radically changed in three months since we launched our bid , " breuer told the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" we now have new major shareholders who have said that they want to remain shareholders .
so the moment has come for us to invite them to take a seat on the supervisory board . " nevertheless , breuer said he would prefer if the new nominations could wait until a new supervisory board was appointed in 2006 rather than forcing current board members to leave prematurely which would make any shake-up appear unnecessarily " dramatic and spectacular . " share buy-back program ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frankfurt stock exchange is part of deutsche börse in addition , deutsche börse was considering launching a share buy-back program over a number of years , as demanded by the rebel shareholders , including funds tci , atticus capital and fidelity investment , in recent weeks , breuer hinted . asked about such a possibility in the interview , breuer replied that the management board was " drawing up a concept . " it will emerge that we 're currently overcapitalized and that the mix of own equity and outside capital is not correct , " he said .
" the management board will propose to the supervisory board what sort of capital structure it wants in the coming years . " he did not specify exactly how big the share buy-back program could be .
but the frankfurt daily suggested it could be as much as 700 million euros -lrb- $ 935 million -rrb- , which corresponds to the current level of deutsche börse 's cash reserves . börse officials tight-lipped a deutsche börse spokesman refused to be drawn on the figure . " what we have said so far is that deutsche börse will return a significant amount of cash back to its shareholders and that we have about 700 million euros in cash available , " he said .
" we have not said the amount we are returning . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new london stock exchange when deutsche börse announced that it was withdrawing its bid for the lse , it said that it had decided to transfer to shareholders " a significant proportion " of the cash reserves it has set aside to finance the takeover . but it did specify exactly how it intended to do so or exactly how much would be transferred to shareholders . speculation of a big cash payout drove deutsche börse shares higher on the frankfurt stock exchange on friday .
shares were changing hands at 57.95 euros in late morning trade , a gain of 0.40 euros or 0.70 percent on the day in a slightly firmer market . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche börse keeps its lse options open deutsche börse said monday it had asked the competition authorities in britain and germany to continue examining a possible merger .

" our shareholder structure has radically changed in three months since we launched our bid , " breuer told the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" we now have new major shareholders who have said that they want to remain shareholders .
so the moment has come for us to invite them to take a seat on the supervisory board .

" the management board will propose to the supervisory board what sort of capital structure it wants in the coming years . " he did not specify exactly how big the share buy-back program could be .

pat leppard , 57 , from powys , was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 1998 .
she has joined a campaign urging women to go to their gps if they have persistent symptoms like bloating .
campaigners say that up to 90 % of women could survive if they received treatment quickly enough .
" women need to be assertive with their gps , " said pat , who added that her own family doctor had acted quickly and effectively .
" i had started to put it -lrb- bloating -rrb- down to middle aged spread , and i needed to go to the loo more frequently . "
" those two things made me think ' i must check it out ' . "
ovarian cancer symptoms bloating need to urinate more often swollen abdomen change in bowel habits pain in abdomen or back indigestion irregular bleeding within weeks , she underwent surgery and was puzzled by the surgeon 's words after he operated to remove the parts of her body affected by the cancer .
" i remember him saying ' it 's ovarian cancer , and you have been really lucky ' .
" when he went on to explain what happens more often than not , i realised i had been lucky , " said pat , who lives in machynlleth .
the disease has claimed some high-profile victims .
actor pierce brosnan 's first wife cassie and american comedian gilda radner both died of it .
in her home town , pat is part of the ovarian cancer action campaign , which has designated march as its action month .
the campaigners have said that new research reported in the journal of the american medical association showed 90 % of women had experienced persistent signs of the disease when it was in its early stages .
" for too long , ovarian cancer has been known as the silent killer , but ... even in the early stages , most women do experience some symptoms , " said a spokeswoman for the campaign .
" very frequent , sudden-onset or persistent symptoms should alert doctors to include ovarian cancer as a possible diagnosis .
" by very frequent , the researchers meant between 20 and 30 times a month , " she added .
the campaigners also said that it was important for women not to worry unduly if they experienced the symptoms , which could also indicate other conditions like irritable bowel syndrome .
however , they said women should talk to their doctors again if treatments for conditions with similar symptoms were not working .

pat leppard , 57 , from powys , was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 1998 .
she has joined a campaign urging women to go to their gps if they have persistent symptoms like bloating .
campaigners say that up to 90 % of women could survive if they received treatment quickly enough .
" women need to be assertive with their gps , " said pat , who added that her own family doctor had acted quickly and effectively .
" i had started to put it -lrb- bloating -rrb- down to middle aged spread , and i needed to go to the loo more frequently . "
" those two things made me think ' i must check it out ' . "
ovarian cancer symptoms bloating need to urinate more often swollen abdomen change in bowel habits pain in abdomen or back indigestion irregular bleeding within weeks , she underwent surgery and was puzzled by the surgeon 's words after he operated to remove the parts of her body affected by the cancer .
" i remember him saying ' it 's ovarian cancer , and you have been really lucky ' .
" when he went on to explain what happens more often than not , i realised i had been lucky , " said pat , who lives in machynlleth .
the disease has claimed some high-profile victims .
actor pierce brosnan 's first wife cassie and american comedian gilda radner both died of it .
in her home town , pat is part of the ovarian cancer action campaign , which has designated march as its action month .
the campaigners have said that new research reported in the journal of the american medical association showed 90 % of women had experienced persistent signs of the disease when it was in its early stages .
" for too long , ovarian cancer has been known as the silent killer , but ... even in the early stages , most women do experience some symptoms , " said a spokeswoman for the campaign .
" very frequent , sudden-onset or persistent symptoms should alert doctors to include ovarian cancer as a possible diagnosis .
" by very frequent , the researchers meant between 20 and 30 times a month , " she added .
the campaigners also said that it was important for women not to worry unduly if they experienced the symptoms , which could also indicate other conditions like irritable bowel syndrome .
however , they said women should talk to their doctors again if treatments for conditions with similar symptoms were not working .

more software and games are being sold overseas than are imported , a good sign for the economy , said the report .
it shows the interactive entertainment industry is doing financially better than film and television industries .
the rising cost of making games has meant many studios have closed however , sending talent overseas .
the games industry employed 7.5 % more people than in 2000 , but the number of actual developers fell by 6 % .
most of the gain was made in publishing , distribution , and retail jobs .
roger bennett , director general of elspa -lrb- entertainment and leisure software publishers association -rrb- which commissioned the report , said the financial success was a " marvellous achievement " .
more support but he warned more government help was needed if the industry 's future was to stay healthy .
" our greatest asset is our creativity and in recent times we have seen this talent being leeched away through lack of funding and more attractive prospects overseas , " he said .
as a result , the uk risks losing its position as the source of global blockbuster titles , he added , and as the first european destination for global funding .
the cost of developing titles for the current generation of consoles has already meant some studios have had to shut .
in october , one of the largest and oldest independent games developers in the uk , argonaut - responsible for the harry potter games - went into administration after a severe cash crisis .
next generation costs the global games market is worth some $ 28bn -lrb- £ 14.5bn -rrb- .
gamers spent more than £ 1.34bn in 2004 , with grand theft auto : san andreas the top biggest seller .

pte johnson beharry , honoured for his actions in iraq , became the twelfth recipient of the award since the end of world war ii .
a total of 1,355 vcs have been awarded since they were introduced in 1856 .
pte beharry 's award came 23 years after the previous award - a posthumous honour to sgt ian mckay who died storming an argentinean machine-gun post during the falklands war .
witnesses required at least three witnesses have to attest to acts of valour to ensure nominees are worthy of the award .
the vc was first bestowed to recognise bravery during the crimean war of 1854 and 1855 .
the medal is made by london jewellers messrs hancock from the bronze of chinese cannons captured from russian troops at the siege of sevastopol during the crimean war .
a 358oz chunk of the metal is stored at the army 's central ordnance depot at donnington , shropshire , and it is thought there is enough metal left to make about 85 more medals .

before his surrender to australian-led peacekeepers in august 2003 , he was responsible for a four-year reign of terror around his base in the remote weathercoast region of the main island , guadalcanal .
just a week before giving himself up , he said that six anglican missionaries he had held hostage were no longer with him ; they were all mysteriously dead .
now he faces a life behind bars , after a court found him and two associates guilty of the 2002 murder of catholic priest father augustine geve .
harold keke , a 34-year-old one-time choirboy and former policeman , first came to public notice in the late 1990s as ethnic unrest enveloped the solomons .
fighting broke out between the isatabu , the indigenous people of guadalcanal , and the increasing number of economic migrants from the neighbouring island of malaita .
mr keke led a december 1998 raid on a police armoury , and was arrested and charged with attempted murder and robbery .
he escaped and shortly afterwards became one of the leaders of the newly-formed guadalcanal liberation army - an organisation which sought to drive malaitans off the island .
in response , a hastily-formed malaita eagle force counter-attacked , and in june 2000 it took over the solomons ' capital , honiara , and turned it into a malaitan enclave .
while the guadalcanal liberation army changed name several times during the following years , it did not change its raison d 'etre , and hundreds of people died , and an estimated 20,000 were made homeless , in the ensuing violence .
over the years , mr keke and his supporters refused to sign any of the proposed peace deals put forward to end the violence .
from his weathercoast stronghold he financed his group 's activities through corruption , hostage-taking and raids on local villages .
mr keke himself was blamed for dozens of deaths the warlord was even rumoured to have beaten his father to death and killed his nephew in a ritual sacrifice - although few people have been willing to go to the region to attempt to verify such reports .
a missionary from the anglican church of melanesia was a regular visitor , before he was killed in 2003 .
the church sent nine brothers to investigate the case , but they were all taken hostage .
three were released , but mr keke told australian peacekeepers the remaining six were dead , without providing any explanation .

before his surrender to australian-led peacekeepers in august 2003 , he was responsible for a four-year reign of terror around his base in the remote weathercoast region of the main island , guadalcanal .
just a week before giving himself up , he said that six anglican missionaries he had held hostage were no longer with him ; they were all mysteriously dead .
now he faces a life behind bars , after a court found him and two associates guilty of the 2002 murder of catholic priest father augustine geve .
harold keke , a 34-year-old one-time choirboy and former policeman , first came to public notice in the late 1990s as ethnic unrest enveloped the solomons .
fighting broke out between the isatabu , the indigenous people of guadalcanal , and the increasing number of economic migrants from the neighbouring island of malaita .
mr keke led a december 1998 raid on a police armoury , and was arrested and charged with attempted murder and robbery .
he escaped and shortly afterwards became one of the leaders of the newly-formed guadalcanal liberation army - an organisation which sought to drive malaitans off the island .
in response , a hastily-formed malaita eagle force counter-attacked , and in june 2000 it took over the solomons ' capital , honiara , and turned it into a malaitan enclave .
while the guadalcanal liberation army changed name several times during the following years , it did not change its raison d 'etre , and hundreds of people died , and an estimated 20,000 were made homeless , in the ensuing violence .
over the years , mr keke and his supporters refused to sign any of the proposed peace deals put forward to end the violence .
from his weathercoast stronghold he financed his group 's activities through corruption , hostage-taking and raids on local villages .
mr keke himself was blamed for dozens of deaths the warlord was even rumoured to have beaten his father to death and killed his nephew in a ritual sacrifice - although few people have been willing to go to the region to attempt to verify such reports .
a missionary from the anglican church of melanesia was a regular visitor , before he was killed in 2003 .
the church sent nine brothers to investigate the case , but they were all taken hostage .
three were released , but mr keke told australian peacekeepers the remaining six were dead , without providing any explanation .

the full citation reads as follows : " private beharry carried out two individual acts of great heroism by which he saved the lives of his comrades .
both were in direct face of the enemy , under intense fire , at great personal risk to himself -lrb- one leading to him sustaining very serious injuries -rrb- .
his valour is worthy of the highest recognition .
in the early hours of the 1st may 2004 beharry 's company was ordered to replenish an isolated coalition forces ' outpost located in the centre of the troubled city of al amarah .
he was the driver of a platoon commander 's warrior armoured fighting vehicle .
his platoon was the company 's reserve force and was placed on immediate notice to move . "
the vehicle was hit again by sustained rocket-propelled grenade attack from insurgent fighters in the alleyways and on rooftops around his vehicle " as the main elements of his company were moving into the city to carry out the replenishment , they were re-tasked to fight through a series of enemy ambushes in order to extract a foot patrol that had become pinned down under sustained small arms and heavy machine-gun fire and improvised explosive device and rocket-propelled grenade attack .
beharry 's platoon was tasked over the radio to come to the assistance of the remainder of the company , who were attempting to extract the isolated foot patrol .
insurgent ambush as his platoon passed a roundabout , en route to the pinned-down patrol , they became aware that the road to the front was empty of all civilians and traffic - an indicator of a potential ambush ahead .
the platoon commander ordered the vehicle to halt , so that he could assess the situation .
the vehicle was then immediately hit by multiple rocket-propelled grenades .
eyewitnesses report that the vehicle was engulfed in a number of violent explosions , which physically rocked the 30-tonne warrior . "
he did not know if his commander or crewmen were still alive , or how serious their injuries may be " as a result of this ferocious initial volley of fire , both the platoon commander and the vehicle 's gunner were incapacitated by concussion and other wounds , and a number of the soldiers in the rear of the vehicle were also wounded .
due to damage sustained in the blast to the vehicle 's radio systems , beharry had no means of communication with either his turret crew or any of the other warrior vehicles deployed around him .
he did not know if his commander or crewmen were still alive , or how serious their injuries may be .
own initiative in this confusing and dangerous situation , on his own initiative , he closed his driver 's hatch and moved forward through the ambush position to try to establish some form of communications , halting just short of a barricade placed across the road .
the vehicle was hit again by sustained rocket-propelled grenade attack from insurgent fighters in the alleyways and on rooftops around his vehicle .
further damage to the warrior from these explosions caused it to catch fire and fill rapidly with thick , noxious smoke .
beharry opened up his armoured hatch cover to clear his view and orientate himself to the situation .
he still had no radio communications and was now acting on his own initiative , as the lead vehicle of a six warrior convoy in an enemy-controlled area of the city at night . "
as the smoke in his driver 's tunnel cleared , he was just able to make out the shape of another rocket-propelled grenade in flight heading directly towards him " he assessed that his best course of action to save the lives of his crew was to push through , out of the ambush .
he drove his warrior directly through the barricade , not knowing if there were mines or improvised explosive devices placed there to destroy his vehicle .
by doing this he was able to lead the remaining five warriors behind him towards safety .
as the smoke in his driver 's tunnel cleared , he was just able to make out the shape of another rocket-propelled grenade in flight heading directly towards him .
he pulled the heavy armoured hatch down with one hand , whilst still controlling his vehicle with the other .
head exposed however , the overpressure from the explosion of the rocket wrenched the hatch out of his grip , and the flames and force of the blast passed directly over him , down the driver 's tunnel , further wounding the semi-conscious gunner in the turret .
the impact of this rocket destroyed beharry 's armoured periscope , so he was forced to drive the vehicle through the remainder of the ambushed route , some 1,500 metres long , with his hatch opened up and his head exposed to enemy fire , all the time with no communications with any other vehicle .
during this long surge through the ambushes the vehicle was again struck by rocket-propelled grenades and small arms fire .
while his head remained out of the hatch , to enable him to see the route ahead , he was directly exposed to much of this fire , and was himself hit by a 7.62mm bullet , which penetrated his helmet and remained lodged on its inner surface .
despite this harrowing weight of incoming fire beharry continued to push through the extended ambush , still leading his platoon until he broke clean . "
exposing himself yet again to enemy fire he returned to the rear of the burning vehicle to lead the disorientated and shocked dismounts and casualties to safety " he then visually identified another warrior from his company and followed it through the streets of al amarah to the outside of the cimic house outpost , which was receiving small arms fire from the surrounding area .
once he had brought his vehicle to a halt outside , without thought for his own personal safety , he climbed onto the turret of the still-burning vehicle and , seemingly oblivious to the incoming enemy small arms fire , manhandled his wounded platoon commander out of the turret , off the vehicle and to the safety of a nearby warrior .
led to safety he then returned once again to his vehicle and again mounted the exposed turret to lift out the vehicle 's gunner and move him to a position of safety .
exposing himself yet again to enemy fire he returned to the rear of the burning vehicle to lead the disorientated and shocked dismounts and casualties to safety .
remounting his burning vehicle for the third time , he drove it through a complex chicane and into the security of the defended perimeter of the outpost , thus denying it to the enemy . "
once inside beharry collapsed from the sheer physical and mental exhaustion of his efforts and was subsequently himself evacuated " only at this stage did beharry pull the fire extinguisher handles , immobilising the engine of the vehicle , dismounted and then moved himself into the relative safety of the back of another warrior .
once inside beharry collapsed from the sheer physical and mental exhaustion of his efforts and was subsequently himself evacuated .
having returned to duty following medical treatment , on 11 june 2004 beharry 's warrior was part of a quick reaction force tasked to attempt to cut off a mortar team that had attacked a coalition force base in al amarah .
as the lead vehicle of the platoon he was moving rapidly through the dark city streets towards the suspected firing point , when his vehicle was ambushed by the enemy from a series of rooftop positions .
during this initial heavy weight of enemy fire , a rocket-propelled grenade detonated on the vehicle 's frontal armour , just six inches from beharry 's head , resulting in a serious head injury . "
beharry then lost consciousness as a result of his wounds " other rockets struck the turret and sides of the vehicle , incapacitating his commander and injuring several of the crew .
with the blood from his head injury obscuring his vision , beharry managed to continue to control his vehicle , and forcefully reversed the warrior out of the ambush area .
the vehicle continued to move until it struck the wall of a nearby building and came to rest .
beharry then lost consciousness as a result of his wounds .
by moving the vehicle out of the enemy 's chosen killing area he enabled other warrior crews to be able to extract his crew from his vehicle , with a greatly reduced risk from incoming fire .
despite receiving a serious head injury , which later saw him being listed as very seriously injured and in a coma for some time , his level-headed actions in the face of heavy and accurate enemy fire at short range again almost certainly saved the lives of his crew and provided the conditions for their safe evacuation to medical treatment .
beharry displayed repeated extreme gallantry and unquestioned valour , despite intense direct attacks , personal injury and damage to his vehicle in the face of relentless enemy action . "

both were in direct face of the enemy , under intense fire , at great personal risk to himself -lrb- one leading to him sustaining very serious injuries -rrb- .
his valour is worthy of the highest recognition .
in the early hours of the 1st may 2004 beharry 's company was ordered to replenish an isolated coalition forces ' outpost located in the centre of the troubled city of al amarah .
he was the driver of a platoon commander 's warrior armoured fighting vehicle .
his platoon was the company 's reserve force and was placed on immediate notice to move .
the vehicle was hit again by sustained rocket-propelled grenade attack from insurgent fighters in the alleyways and on rooftops around his vehicle as the main elements of his company were moving into the city to carry out the replenishment , they were re-tasked to fight through a series of enemy ambushes in order to extract a foot patrol that had become pinned down under sustained small arms and heavy machine-gun fire and improvised explosive device and rocket-propelled grenade attack .
beharry 's platoon was tasked over the radio to come to the assistance of the remainder of the company , who were attempting to extract the isolated foot patrol .
insurgent ambush as his platoon passed a roundabout , en route to the pinned-down patrol , they became aware that the road to the front was empty of all civilians and traffic - an indicator of a potential ambush ahead .
the platoon commander ordered the vehicle to halt , so that he could assess the situation .
the vehicle was then immediately hit by multiple rocket-propelled grenades .
eyewitnesses report that the vehicle was engulfed in a number of violent explosions , which physically rocked the 30-tonne warrior .
he did not know if his commander or crewmen were still alive , or how serious their injuries may be as a result of this ferocious initial volley of fire , both the platoon commander and the vehicle 's gunner were incapacitated by concussion and other wounds , and a number of the soldiers in the rear of the vehicle were also wounded .
due to damage sustained in the blast to the vehicle 's radio systems , beharry had no means of communication with either his turret crew or any of the other warrior vehicles deployed around him .
he did not know if his commander or crewmen were still alive , or how serious their injuries may be .
own initiative in this confusing and dangerous situation , on his own initiative , he closed his driver 's hatch and moved forward through the ambush position to try to establish some form of communications , halting just short of a barricade placed across the road .
the vehicle was hit again by sustained rocket-propelled grenade attack from insurgent fighters in the alleyways and on rooftops around his vehicle .
further damage to the warrior from these explosions caused it to catch fire and fill rapidly with thick , noxious smoke .
beharry opened up his armoured hatch cover to clear his view and orientate himself to the situation .
he still had no radio communications and was now acting on his own initiative , as the lead vehicle of a six warrior convoy in an enemy-controlled area of the city at night .
as the smoke in his driver 's tunnel cleared , he was just able to make out the shape of another rocket-propelled grenade in flight heading directly towards him he assessed that his best course of action to save the lives of his crew was to push through , out of the ambush .
he drove his warrior directly through the barricade , not knowing if there were mines or improvised explosive devices placed there to destroy his vehicle .
by doing this he was able to lead the remaining five warriors behind him towards safety .
as the smoke in his driver 's tunnel cleared , he was just able to make out the shape of another rocket-propelled grenade in flight heading directly towards him .
he pulled the heavy armoured hatch down with one hand , whilst still controlling his vehicle with the other .
head exposed however , the overpressure from the explosion of the rocket wrenched the hatch out of his grip , and the flames and force of the blast passed directly over him , down the driver 's tunnel , further wounding the semi-conscious gunner in the turret .
the impact of this rocket destroyed beharry 's armoured periscope , so he was forced to drive the vehicle through the remainder of the ambushed route , some 1,500 metres long , with his hatch opened up and his head exposed to enemy fire , all the time with no communications with any other vehicle .
during this long surge through the ambushes the vehicle was again struck by rocket-propelled grenades and small arms fire .
while his head remained out of the hatch , to enable him to see the route ahead , he was directly exposed to much of this fire , and was himself hit by a 7.62mm bullet , which penetrated his helmet and remained lodged on its inner surface .
despite this harrowing weight of incoming fire beharry continued to push through the extended ambush , still leading his platoon until he broke clean .
exposing himself yet again to enemy fire he returned to the rear of the burning vehicle to lead the disorientated and shocked dismounts and casualties to safety he then visually identified another warrior from his company and followed it through the streets of al amarah to the outside of the cimic house outpost , which was receiving small arms fire from the surrounding area .
once he had brought his vehicle to a halt outside , without thought for his own personal safety , he climbed onto the turret of the still-burning vehicle and , seemingly oblivious to the incoming enemy small arms fire , manhandled his wounded platoon commander out of the turret , off the vehicle and to the safety of a nearby warrior .

his valour is worthy of the highest recognition .
in the early hours of the 1st may 2004 beharry 's company was ordered to replenish an isolated coalition forces ' outpost located in the centre of the troubled city of al amarah .
he was the driver of a platoon commander 's warrior armoured fighting vehicle .
his platoon was the company 's reserve force and was placed on immediate notice to move .
the vehicle was hit again by sustained rocket-propelled grenade attack from insurgent fighters in the alleyways and on rooftops around his vehicle as the main elements of his company were moving into the city to carry out the replenishment , they were re-tasked to fight through a series of enemy ambushes in order to extract a foot patrol that had become pinned down under sustained small arms and heavy machine-gun fire and improvised explosive device and rocket-propelled grenade attack .
beharry 's platoon was tasked over the radio to come to the assistance of the remainder of the company , who were attempting to extract the isolated foot patrol .
insurgent ambush as his platoon passed a roundabout , en route to the pinned-down patrol , they became aware that the road to the front was empty of all civilians and traffic - an indicator of a potential ambush ahead .
the platoon commander ordered the vehicle to halt , so that he could assess the situation .
the vehicle was then immediately hit by multiple rocket-propelled grenades .
eyewitnesses report that the vehicle was engulfed in a number of violent explosions , which physically rocked the 30-tonne warrior .
he did not know if his commander or crewmen were still alive , or how serious their injuries may be as a result of this ferocious initial volley of fire , both the platoon commander and the vehicle 's gunner were incapacitated by concussion and other wounds , and a number of the soldiers in the rear of the vehicle were also wounded .
due to damage sustained in the blast to the vehicle 's radio systems , beharry had no means of communication with either his turret crew or any of the other warrior vehicles deployed around him .

the vehicle was hit again by sustained rocket-propelled grenade attack from insurgent fighters in the alleyways and on rooftops around his vehicle .
further damage to the warrior from these explosions caused it to catch fire and fill rapidly with thick , noxious smoke .

the vehicle was hit again by sustained rocket-propelled grenade attack from insurgent fighters in the alleyways and on rooftops around his vehicle as the main elements of his company were moving into the city to carry out the replenishment , they were re-tasked to fight through a series of enemy ambushes in order to extract a foot patrol that had become pinned down under sustained small arms and heavy machine-gun fire and improvised explosive device and rocket-propelled grenade attack .
beharry 's platoon was tasked over the radio to come to the assistance of the remainder of the company , who were attempting to extract the isolated foot patrol .
insurgent ambush as his platoon passed a roundabout , en route to the pinned-down patrol , they became aware that the road to the front was empty of all civilians and traffic - an indicator of a potential ambush ahead .
the platoon commander ordered the vehicle to halt , so that he could assess the situation .
the vehicle was then immediately hit by multiple rocket-propelled grenades .
eyewitnesses report that the vehicle was engulfed in a number of violent explosions , which physically rocked the 30-tonne warrior .
he did not know if his commander or crewmen were still alive , or how serious their injuries may be as a result of this ferocious initial volley of fire , both the platoon commander and the vehicle 's gunner were incapacitated by concussion and other wounds , and a number of the soldiers in the rear of the vehicle were also wounded .
due to damage sustained in the blast to the vehicle 's radio systems , beharry had no means of communication with either his turret crew or any of the other warrior vehicles deployed around him .
he did not know if his commander or crewmen were still alive , or how serious their injuries may be .
own initiative in this confusing and dangerous situation , on his own initiative , he closed his driver 's hatch and moved forward through the ambush position to try to establish some form of communications , halting just short of a barricade placed across the road .
the vehicle was hit again by sustained rocket-propelled grenade attack from insurgent fighters in the alleyways and on rooftops around his vehicle .
further damage to the warrior from these explosions caused it to catch fire and fill rapidly with thick , noxious smoke .
beharry opened up his armoured hatch cover to clear his view and orientate himself to the situation .
he still had no radio communications and was now acting on his own initiative , as the lead vehicle of a six warrior convoy in an enemy-controlled area of the city at night .
as the smoke in his driver 's tunnel cleared , he was just able to make out the shape of another rocket-propelled grenade in flight heading directly towards him he assessed that his best course of action to save the lives of his crew was to push through , out of the ambush .
he drove his warrior directly through the barricade , not knowing if there were mines or improvised explosive devices placed there to destroy his vehicle .
by doing this he was able to lead the remaining five warriors behind him towards safety .
as the smoke in his driver 's tunnel cleared , he was just able to make out the shape of another rocket-propelled grenade in flight heading directly towards him .
he pulled the heavy armoured hatch down with one hand , whilst still controlling his vehicle with the other .
head exposed however , the overpressure from the explosion of the rocket wrenched the hatch out of his grip , and the flames and force of the blast passed directly over him , down the driver 's tunnel , further wounding the semi-conscious gunner in the turret .
the impact of this rocket destroyed beharry 's armoured periscope , so he was forced to drive the vehicle through the remainder of the ambushed route , some 1,500 metres long , with his hatch opened up and his head exposed to enemy fire , all the time with no communications with any other vehicle .
during this long surge through the ambushes the vehicle was again struck by rocket-propelled grenades and small arms fire .
while his head remained out of the hatch , to enable him to see the route ahead , he was directly exposed to much of this fire , and was himself hit by a 7.62mm bullet , which penetrated his helmet and remained lodged on its inner surface .
despite this harrowing weight of incoming fire beharry continued to push through the extended ambush , still leading his platoon until he broke clean .
exposing himself yet again to enemy fire he returned to the rear of the burning vehicle to lead the disorientated and shocked dismounts and casualties to safety he then visually identified another warrior from his company and followed it through the streets of al amarah to the outside of the cimic house outpost , which was receiving small arms fire from the surrounding area .
once he had brought his vehicle to a halt outside , without thought for his own personal safety , he climbed onto the turret of the still-burning vehicle and , seemingly oblivious to the incoming enemy small arms fire , manhandled his wounded platoon commander out of the turret , off the vehicle and to the safety of a nearby warrior .
led to safety he then returned once again to his vehicle and again mounted the exposed turret to lift out the vehicle 's gunner and move him to a position of safety .
exposing himself yet again to enemy fire he returned to the rear of the burning vehicle to lead the disorientated and shocked dismounts and casualties to safety .
remounting his burning vehicle for the third time , he drove it through a complex chicane and into the security of the defended perimeter of the outpost , thus denying it to the enemy .
once inside beharry collapsed from the sheer physical and mental exhaustion of his efforts and was subsequently himself evacuated only at this stage did beharry pull the fire extinguisher handles , immobilising the engine of the vehicle , dismounted and then moved himself into the relative safety of the back of another warrior .
once inside beharry collapsed from the sheer physical and mental exhaustion of his efforts and was subsequently himself evacuated .
having returned to duty following medical treatment , on 11 june 2004 beharry 's warrior was part of a quick reaction force tasked to attempt to cut off a mortar team that had attacked a coalition force base in al amarah .
as the lead vehicle of the platoon he was moving rapidly through the dark city streets towards the suspected firing point , when his vehicle was ambushed by the enemy from a series of rooftop positions .
during this initial heavy weight of enemy fire , a rocket-propelled grenade detonated on the vehicle 's frontal armour , just six inches from beharry 's head , resulting in a serious head injury .
beharry then lost consciousness as a result of his wounds other rockets struck the turret and sides of the vehicle , incapacitating his commander and injuring several of the crew .
with the blood from his head injury obscuring his vision , beharry managed to continue to control his vehicle , and forcefully reversed the warrior out of the ambush area .
the vehicle continued to move until it struck the wall of a nearby building and came to rest .
beharry then lost consciousness as a result of his wounds .
by moving the vehicle out of the enemy 's chosen killing area he enabled other warrior crews to be able to extract his crew from his vehicle , with a greatly reduced risk from incoming fire .
despite receiving a serious head injury , which later saw him being listed as very seriously injured and in a coma for some time , his level-headed actions in the face of heavy and accurate enemy fire at short range again almost certainly saved the lives of his crew and provided the conditions for their safe evacuation to medical treatment .
beharry displayed repeated extreme gallantry and unquestioned valour , despite intense direct attacks , personal injury and damage to his vehicle in the face of relentless enemy action .

the welsh national opera is thought to be among companies which will be hit .
last month , assembly culture minister alun pugh announced a £ 2m increase in funding for the arts council of wales .
but the council said much of the money had been earmarked to finance a few projects .
mr pugh said it was up to the council how to spend its funding .
mr pugh said the recent funding rise had been at four times the rate of inflation .
" we have given the arts council a 9.7 % increase in its cash , but how that cash is spent is entirely a matter for the arts council , " he said .
" that 's why we have an arts council - to make those judgements .
" the ear-marking is a very small proportion of the budget . "
funds earmarked include £ 800,000 for the extra costs of companies now resident in cardiff bay 's wales millennium centre , £ 1m for a fund designed to boost venues outside cardiff , £ 90,000 for the brecon jazz festival and £ 1.16m for capital funding .
the arts council has told client organisations there will be a freeze in their core funding next year and it is planning one for the next three years .
tours threatened in a statement to bbc wales ' dragon 's eye programme , the council 's chief executive peter tyndall admitted some companies ' finances were so fragile the freeze could " precipitate them into closure " .
he also said that companies affected could be ones which " otherwise would merit continued funding " .
the welsh national opera , the dance company earthfall and theatre company hijinx confirmed to dragon 's eye that they expect to have to cut back production , reduce cast sizes or curtail tours .
while speaking to dragon 's eye , mr pugh also defended his decision to direct the council to support the clwyd theatre cymru 's mobile theatre .
