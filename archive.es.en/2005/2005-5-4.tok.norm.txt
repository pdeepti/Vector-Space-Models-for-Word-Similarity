" this year 's ' march of the living ' will be the largest ever , with 18,000 to 20,000 people coming to auschwitz on may 5 , which is holocaust remembrance day , " the event 's director aaron tamir told reporters in warsaw last week .
" it is going to be a huge and complicated event because this year marks the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz-birkenau and death camps in other countries , and the whole world is paying attention , " tamir said . at least 1.1 million men , women and children , most of them jews , died at auschwitz-birkenau , one of the key extermination sites for nazi germany 's " final solution , " which aimed to wipe out europe 's 11 million jews .
the nazis succeeded in exterminating six million european jews , half of them from poland , home to europe 's largest jewish community before world war ii . israeli prime minister ariel sharon , his polish counterpart marek belka and prime minister ferenc gyurcsany of hungary , which lost 450,000 jews at auschwitz , will be among dignitaries who will attend the event .

in light of the huge numbers taking part this year , the organizers have arranged for thousands of people to set off thursday morning for the three-kilometer -lrb- two-mile -rrb- walk from the train station at oswiecim - the polish town which tragically gave its germanized name to the auschwitz camp - to the birkenau sector of the death camp .
the main march , which will group around 10,000 people , including many international officials , will leave from the original camp at auschwitz in the early afternoon . " we 've hired six special trains to bring participants to oswiecim , " tamir said . auschwitz was set up by the nazis in 1940 on the site of a former polish army barracks on the outskirts of oswiecim and expanded later to the village of brzezinka - birkenau in german - three kilometers away , to allow hitler 's germany to more efficiently kill jews , sinti , roma , poles and others considered inferior human beings . at birkenau , near the rubble of two interconnecting gas chambers and crematoria the marchers will gather in mid-afternoon for a memorial ceremony , held near the train track that carried jews and other deportees to almost certain death more than 60 years ago .

27 , 1945 by soviet troops . belka , sharon , professor , writer and former auschwitz inmate elie wiesel will be among those to give speeches to the gathering , which this year will include as many holocaust survivors and their descendants as possible , according to tamir .
countering holocaust deniers " the survivors will not be with us forever , and when they are gone , it will be easier for those who deny the holocaust to spread untruths , " tamir said .
" the idea for the march came some 20 years ago when there were voices saying the holocaust never existed , " he said .
the denials " were heard by students and young people around the world and the founders of the march of the living decided the best way to stop the debate was to bring youths from all countries to see with their own eyes what happened .

" participants see and feel the holocaust with their own eyes , " tamir said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 04.05.2005 auschwitz march to recall holocaust victims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the march of the living was started to counter holocaust denial thousands of people from some 50 countries have begun converging on southern poland to take part thursday in a march in memory of holocaust victims at auschwitz-birkenau , the most grimly efficient of nazi death camps . " this year 's ' march of the living ' will be the largest ever , with 18,000 to 20,000 people coming to auschwitz on may 5 , which is holocaust remembrance day , " the event 's director aaron tamir told reporters in warsaw last week .
" it is going to be a huge and complicated event because this year marks the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz-birkenau and death camps in other countries , and the whole world is paying attention , " tamir said . at least 1.1 million men , women and children , most of them jews , died at auschwitz-birkenau , one of the key extermination sites for nazi germany 's " final solution , " which aimed to wipe out europe 's 11 million jews .
the nazis succeeded in exterminating six million european jews , half of them from poland , home to europe 's largest jewish community before world war ii . israeli prime minister ariel sharon , his polish counterpart marek belka and prime minister ferenc gyurcsany of hungary , which lost 450,000 jews at auschwitz , will be among dignitaries who will attend the event .
sharon was " unlikely to march , " the organizers told afp .
march of the living bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young israeli participants at the nazi auschwitz-birkenau death camp during the march of the living in 2002 .
in light of the huge numbers taking part this year , the organizers have arranged for thousands of people to set off thursday morning for the three-kilometer -lrb- two-mile -rrb- walk from the train station at oswiecim - the polish town which tragically gave its germanized name to the auschwitz camp - to the birkenau sector of the death camp .
the main march , which will group around 10,000 people , including many international officials , will leave from the original camp at auschwitz in the early afternoon . " we 've hired six special trains to bring participants to oswiecim , " tamir said . auschwitz was set up by the nazis in 1940 on the site of a former polish army barracks on the outskirts of oswiecim and expanded later to the village of brzezinka - birkenau in german - three kilometers away , to allow hitler 's germany to more efficiently kill jews , sinti , roma , poles and others considered inferior human beings . at birkenau , near the rubble of two interconnecting gas chambers and crematoria the marchers will gather in mid-afternoon for a memorial ceremony , held near the train track that carried jews and other deportees to almost certain death more than 60 years ago .
the camp was liberated on jan .
27 , 1945 by soviet troops . belka , sharon , professor , writer and former auschwitz inmate elie wiesel will be among those to give speeches to the gathering , which this year will include as many holocaust survivors and their descendants as possible , according to tamir .
countering holocaust deniers " the survivors will not be with us forever , and when they are gone , it will be easier for those who deny the holocaust to spread untruths , " tamir said .
" the idea for the march came some 20 years ago when there were voices saying the holocaust never existed , " he said .
the denials " were heard by students and young people around the world and the founders of the march of the living decided the best way to stop the debate was to bring youths from all countries to see with their own eyes what happened .

27 , 2005 .
from its start in 1988 , when it gathered small groups of young jewish people , the march of the living has grown to include " adults , survivors , students , youngsters , pupils " and , for the past few years , non-jews . " our project is to take people ' from holocaust to revival , " ' tamir said . some participants come to poland just for the day of the march while others spend a week in the central european country , which lost six million civilians in world war ii , half of them jews , visiting sites linked to the holocaust . " participants see and feel the holocaust with their own eyes , " tamir said .
" then many young people fly to israel for the ' revival ' part of our project . " the principal aim of the march remains " to make sure that what happened more than 60 years ago never happens again , " he added . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dealing a blow to holocaust deniers deborah lipstadt never took the stand during the landmark libel case she won against british holocaust denier david irving .

and on tuesday , the opening day of the congress , desperate doctors took their protest to the streets of german capital .
among them was ravindra gujullah , an indian-born general practitioner in the town of landsberg . " when you become a doctor , you have such zeal to be a good doctor and to serve people , " gujullah said .
" but these things are not so important today .
now , you have to fight just to survive . " medical brain drain german hospitals are coming under increasing pressure to cut costs , and are seeking concessions from their medical staff .
doctors working in hospitals are paid roughly the same salary as an elementary school teacher , despite having to endure work weeks that often amount to more than 60 hours . in recent years , hospitals have cut staff numbers , holiday pay and christmas bonuses in an attempt to meet government demands for more efficiency .
the president of the german medical association , jörg dietrich hoppe , has predicted that more and more well-trained doctors will seek better-paid jobs in the pharmaceutical industry , or even leave germany for better opportunities abroad . " our young doctors do n't see any prospects for advancement and better pay in german clinics , " hoppe said .

consumer advocate thomas isenburg accused the government of making savings on the back of patients . " patients fall by the wayside in a health machinery subject to cost-cutting and maximizing efficiency , " isenburg said .
" more than 15,000 people die in germany every year due to medical mistakes and faulty treatment , which is why it 's important for german doctors to find ways at this congress to avoid such mistakes and reduce the cost pressure .
a good health service can not be had for nothing . " in a speech on tuesday to open the annual congress , health minister ulla schmidt vowed that affordable treatment for all would remain the german government 's ultimate goal .

" this year 's ' march of the living ' will be the largest ever , with 18,000 to 20,000 people coming to auschwitz on may 5 , which is holocaust remembrance day , " the event 's director aaron tamir told reporters in warsaw last week .
" it is going to be a huge and complicated event because this year marks the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz-birkenau and death camps in other countries , and the whole world is paying attention , " tamir said . at least 1.1 million men , women and children , most of them jews , died at auschwitz-birkenau , one of the key extermination sites for nazi germany 's " final solution , " which aimed to wipe out europe 's 11 million jews .
the nazis succeeded in exterminating six million european jews , half of them from poland , home to europe 's largest jewish community before world war ii . israeli prime minister ariel sharon , his polish counterpart marek belka and prime minister ferenc gyurcsany of hungary , which lost 450,000 jews at auschwitz , will be among dignitaries who will attend the event .
sharon was " unlikely to march , " the organizers told afp .
march of the living bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young israeli participants at the nazi auschwitz-birkenau death camp during the march of the living in 2002 .
in light of the huge numbers taking part this year , the organizers have arranged for thousands of people to set off thursday morning for the three-kilometer -lrb- two-mile -rrb- walk from the train station at oswiecim - the polish town which tragically gave its germanized name to the auschwitz camp - to the birkenau sector of the death camp .
the main march , which will group around 10,000 people , including many international officials , will leave from the original camp at auschwitz in the early afternoon . " we 've hired six special trains to bring participants to oswiecim , " tamir said . auschwitz was set up by the nazis in 1940 on the site of a former polish army barracks on the outskirts of oswiecim and expanded later to the village of brzezinka - birkenau in german - three kilometers away , to allow hitler 's germany to more efficiently kill jews , sinti , roma , poles and others considered inferior human beings . at birkenau , near the rubble of two interconnecting gas chambers and crematoria the marchers will gather in mid-afternoon for a memorial ceremony , held near the train track that carried jews and other deportees to almost certain death more than 60 years ago .
the camp was liberated on jan .
27 , 1945 by soviet troops . belka , sharon , professor , writer and former auschwitz inmate elie wiesel will be among those to give speeches to the gathering , which this year will include as many holocaust survivors and their descendants as possible , according to tamir .
countering holocaust deniers " the survivors will not be with us forever , and when they are gone , it will be easier for those who deny the holocaust to spread untruths , " tamir said .
" the idea for the march came some 20 years ago when there were voices saying the holocaust never existed , " he said .
the denials " were heard by students and young people around the world and the founders of the march of the living decided the best way to stop the debate was to bring youths from all countries to see with their own eyes what happened . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : candles lit to remember the holocaust victims at the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the nazi-era auschwitz death camp at a loading ramp of former german railway company deutsche reichsbahn on jan .

from its start in 1988 , when it gathered small groups of young jewish people , the march of the living has grown to include " adults , survivors , students , youngsters , pupils " and , for the past few years , non-jews . " our project is to take people ' from holocaust to revival , " ' tamir said . some participants come to poland just for the day of the march while others spend a week in the central european country , which lost six million civilians in world war ii , half of them jews , visiting sites linked to the holocaust . " participants see and feel the holocaust with their own eyes , " tamir said .
" then many young people fly to israel for the ' revival ' part of our project .

she noted that parliament had already passed a law outlawing the use of cell phones for drivers , and that she and others want to push for similar legislation regarding mobile phones . " cigarettes are just as much of a distraction as cell phones , " she said .
" we urgently need ban on them along with fines . " another conservative politician , gerlinde kaupa , a health policy expert for the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , backed the anti-smoking proposal . according to bild , accident researchers found that a car going 50 kilometers -lrb- 31 miles -rrb- an hour continues to travel 14 meters -lrb- 16 yards -rrb- per second while a driver searches for a cigarette that has fallen out of his or her hand . the road safety organization traffic watch welcomed the proposal . " driving demands the driver 's 100-percent attention and any kind of distraction presents a danger , " said the organization 's director , michael hartje .
he criticized the presence of ashtrays and drink holders that he said turn driving into a " sideline job . " government against the idea but germany 's transport ministry does n't see the issue in quite so serious terms and has rejected the idea of putting a legal ban in place . " there is no scientific proof that smoking drastically increases the risk of having an accident , " said a ministry spokeswoman .
she added that such legislation would be a case of " overregulation . " her boss agreed .
manfred stolpe , the transport minister , said the proposal would do nothing to increase traffic safety . germany 's largest automotive club , adac , also dismissed the idea . " eating chocolate bars , bananas or fish sandwiches while driving is also dangerous , " said the group 's spokesman , rainer hillgärtner . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans agree to curb smoking moving to protect non-smokers in germany , the federal government and the country 's association of hotels and restaurants have signed an agreement which obliges owners to create non-smoking sections for their customers .

and on tuesday , the opening day of the congress , desperate doctors took their protest to the streets of german capital .
among them was ravindra gujullah , an indian-born general practitioner in the town of landsberg . " when you become a doctor , you have such zeal to be a good doctor and to serve people , " gujullah said .
" but these things are not so important today .
now , you have to fight just to survive . " medical brain drain german hospitals are coming under increasing pressure to cut costs , and are seeking concessions from their medical staff .
doctors working in hospitals are paid roughly the same salary as an elementary school teacher , despite having to endure work weeks that often amount to more than 60 hours . in recent years , hospitals have cut staff numbers , holiday pay and christmas bonuses in an attempt to meet government demands for more efficiency .
the president of the german medical association , jörg dietrich hoppe , has predicted that more and more well-trained doctors will seek better-paid jobs in the pharmaceutical industry , or even leave germany for better opportunities abroad . " our young doctors do n't see any prospects for advancement and better pay in german clinics , " hoppe said .

" more than 15,000 people die in germany every year due to medical mistakes and faulty treatment , which is why it 's important for german doctors to find ways at this congress to avoid such mistakes and reduce the cost pressure .

" this year 's ' march of the living ' will be the largest ever , with 18,000 to 20,000 people coming to auschwitz on may 5 , which is holocaust remembrance day , " the event 's director aaron tamir told reporters in warsaw last week .
" it is going to be a huge and complicated event because this year marks the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz-birkenau and death camps in other countries , and the whole world is paying attention , " tamir said . at least 1.1 million men , women and children , most of them jews , died at auschwitz-birkenau , one of the key extermination sites for nazi germany 's " final solution , " which aimed to wipe out europe 's 11 million jews .
the nazis succeeded in exterminating six million european jews , half of them from poland , home to europe 's largest jewish community before world war ii . israeli prime minister ariel sharon , his polish counterpart marek belka and prime minister ferenc gyurcsany of hungary , which lost 450,000 jews at auschwitz , will be among dignitaries who will attend the event .
sharon was " unlikely to march , " the organizers told afp .
march of the living bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young israeli participants at the nazi auschwitz-birkenau death camp during the march of the living in 2002 .
in light of the huge numbers taking part this year , the organizers have arranged for thousands of people to set off thursday morning for the three-kilometer -lrb- two-mile -rrb- walk from the train station at oswiecim - the polish town which tragically gave its germanized name to the auschwitz camp - to the birkenau sector of the death camp .
the main march , which will group around 10,000 people , including many international officials , will leave from the original camp at auschwitz in the early afternoon . " we 've hired six special trains to bring participants to oswiecim , " tamir said . auschwitz was set up by the nazis in 1940 on the site of a former polish army barracks on the outskirts of oswiecim and expanded later to the village of brzezinka - birkenau in german - three kilometers away , to allow hitler 's germany to more efficiently kill jews , sinti , roma , poles and others considered inferior human beings . at birkenau , near the rubble of two interconnecting gas chambers and crematoria the marchers will gather in mid-afternoon for a memorial ceremony , held near the train track that carried jews and other deportees to almost certain death more than 60 years ago .
the camp was liberated on jan .
27 , 1945 by soviet troops . belka , sharon , professor , writer and former auschwitz inmate elie wiesel will be among those to give speeches to the gathering , which this year will include as many holocaust survivors and their descendants as possible , according to tamir .
countering holocaust deniers " the survivors will not be with us forever , and when they are gone , it will be easier for those who deny the holocaust to spread untruths , " tamir said .
" the idea for the march came some 20 years ago when there were voices saying the holocaust never existed , " he said .
the denials " were heard by students and young people around the world and the founders of the march of the living decided the best way to stop the debate was to bring youths from all countries to see with their own eyes what happened . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : candles lit to remember the holocaust victims at the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the nazi-era auschwitz death camp at a loading ramp of former german railway company deutsche reichsbahn on jan .
27 , 2005 .
from its start in 1988 , when it gathered small groups of young jewish people , the march of the living has grown to include " adults , survivors , students , youngsters , pupils " and , for the past few years , non-jews . " our project is to take people ' from holocaust to revival , " ' tamir said . some participants come to poland just for the day of the march while others spend a week in the central european country , which lost six million civilians in world war ii , half of them jews , visiting sites linked to the holocaust . " participants see and feel the holocaust with their own eyes , " tamir said .
" then many young people fly to israel for the ' revival ' part of our project . " the principal aim of the march remains " to make sure that what happened more than 60 years ago never happens again , " he added . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dealing a blow to holocaust deniers deborah lipstadt never took the stand during the landmark libel case she won against british holocaust denier david irving .

they want security , comfort and social contacts ; they don ’ t want a nursing home .
senior flat shares fit that bill . on the eighth floor of a dresden high-rise , 72-year-old karl-heinz röttjer can look out from his small , one-bedroom apartment and see a good portion of the city and the hills that spill over into the czech republic .
to him , the wide-open vista represents freedom , and the new lease on life he has gotten since moving in with five retired women to share his sunset years . " here i feel much better , i can spend my time how i want , " he said .
" i feel free , and it 's like i have a family around me . " he cherishes that freedom since it was taken away from him for a while .
he was put in a nursing home after an illness made him unable to live alone anymore several years ago .
his wife had died and his children had moved away .
but for this spry , independent septuagenarian , it was like being put in prison . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young medic helps an old man " in a nursing home , you 're not your own master , " he said .
" there are rules to follow and you 've subject to strict schedules .
everything 's planned out and you feel almost trapped . " so he escaped , not by climbing out an open window , but by answering an ad for a living arrangement that experts say could become a common alternative for older people in the future : a senior flat share .
not long after , he moved into the specially modified suite of apartments and has n't looked back . communal living but privacy , too the senior flat share , however , is generally not like the basic college-age roommate situation .

" this year 's ' march of the living ' will be the largest ever , with 18,000 to 20,000 people coming to auschwitz on may 5 , which is holocaust remembrance day , " the event 's director aaron tamir told reporters in warsaw last week .
" it is going to be a huge and complicated event because this year marks the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz-birkenau and death camps in other countries , and the whole world is paying attention , " tamir said . at least 1.1 million men , women and children , most of them jews , died at auschwitz-birkenau , one of the key extermination sites for nazi germany 's " final solution , " which aimed to wipe out europe 's 11 million jews .
the nazis succeeded in exterminating six million european jews , half of them from poland , home to europe 's largest jewish community before world war ii . israeli prime minister ariel sharon , his polish counterpart marek belka and prime minister ferenc gyurcsany of hungary , which lost 450,000 jews at auschwitz , will be among dignitaries who will attend the event .
sharon was " unlikely to march , " the organizers told afp .
march of the living bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young israeli participants at the nazi auschwitz-birkenau death camp during the march of the living in 2002 .
in light of the huge numbers taking part this year , the organizers have arranged for thousands of people to set off thursday morning for the three-kilometer -lrb- two-mile -rrb- walk from the train station at oswiecim - the polish town which tragically gave its germanized name to the auschwitz camp - to the birkenau sector of the death camp .
the main march , which will group around 10,000 people , including many international officials , will leave from the original camp at auschwitz in the early afternoon . " we 've hired six special trains to bring participants to oswiecim , " tamir said . auschwitz was set up by the nazis in 1940 on the site of a former polish army barracks on the outskirts of oswiecim and expanded later to the village of brzezinka - birkenau in german - three kilometers away , to allow hitler 's germany to more efficiently kill jews , sinti , roma , poles and others considered inferior human beings . at birkenau , near the rubble of two interconnecting gas chambers and crematoria the marchers will gather in mid-afternoon for a memorial ceremony , held near the train track that carried jews and other deportees to almost certain death more than 60 years ago .
the camp was liberated on jan .
27 , 1945 by soviet troops . belka , sharon , professor , writer and former auschwitz inmate elie wiesel will be among those to give speeches to the gathering , which this year will include as many holocaust survivors and their descendants as possible , according to tamir .
countering holocaust deniers " the survivors will not be with us forever , and when they are gone , it will be easier for those who deny the holocaust to spread untruths , " tamir said .
" the idea for the march came some 20 years ago when there were voices saying the holocaust never existed , " he said .
the denials " were heard by students and young people around the world and the founders of the march of the living decided the best way to stop the debate was to bring youths from all countries to see with their own eyes what happened .

27 , 2005 .
from its start in 1988 , when it gathered small groups of young jewish people , the march of the living has grown to include " adults , survivors , students , youngsters , pupils " and , for the past few years , non-jews . " our project is to take people ' from holocaust to revival , " ' tamir said . some participants come to poland just for the day of the march while others spend a week in the central european country , which lost six million civilians in world war ii , half of them jews , visiting sites linked to the holocaust . " participants see and feel the holocaust with their own eyes , " tamir said .
" then many young people fly to israel for the ' revival ' part of our project .

and on tuesday , the opening day of the congress , desperate doctors took their protest to the streets of german capital .
among them was ravindra gujullah , an indian-born general practitioner in the town of landsberg . " when you become a doctor , you have such zeal to be a good doctor and to serve people , " gujullah said .
" but these things are not so important today .
now , you have to fight just to survive . " medical brain drain german hospitals are coming under increasing pressure to cut costs , and are seeking concessions from their medical staff .
doctors working in hospitals are paid roughly the same salary as an elementary school teacher , despite having to endure work weeks that often amount to more than 60 hours . in recent years , hospitals have cut staff numbers , holiday pay and christmas bonuses in an attempt to meet government demands for more efficiency .
the president of the german medical association , jörg dietrich hoppe , has predicted that more and more well-trained doctors will seek better-paid jobs in the pharmaceutical industry , or even leave germany for better opportunities abroad . " our young doctors do n't see any prospects for advancement and better pay in german clinics , " hoppe said .
" headhunters , especially from britain , are currently looking for german doctors - specialists in particular - and offering them wages that are three times as high , plus working hours that do n't go beyond 50 hours a week . " patients bearing the brunt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : federal health minister ulla schmidt is overseeing germany 's health services reform .
experts are warning of a severe crisis in health services as the brain drain is already leaving rural regions in economically depressed eastern germany without enough doctors .
consumer advocate thomas isenburg accused the government of making savings on the back of patients . " patients fall by the wayside in a health machinery subject to cost-cutting and maximizing efficiency , " isenburg said .
" more than 15,000 people die in germany every year due to medical mistakes and faulty treatment , which is why it 's important for german doctors to find ways at this congress to avoid such mistakes and reduce the cost pressure .
a good health service can not be had for nothing . " in a speech on tuesday to open the annual congress , health minister ulla schmidt vowed that affordable treatment for all would remain the german government 's ultimate goal .

they want security , comfort and social contacts ; they don ’ t want a nursing home .
senior flat shares fit that bill . on the eighth floor of a dresden high-rise , 72-year-old karl-heinz röttjer can look out from his small , one-bedroom apartment and see a good portion of the city and the hills that spill over into the czech republic .
to him , the wide-open vista represents freedom , and the new lease on life he has gotten since moving in with five retired women to share his sunset years . " here i feel much better , i can spend my time how i want , " he said .
" i feel free , and it 's like i have a family around me . " he cherishes that freedom since it was taken away from him for a while .
he was put in a nursing home after an illness made him unable to live alone anymore several years ago .
his wife had died and his children had moved away .
but for this spry , independent septuagenarian , it was like being put in prison . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young medic helps an old man " in a nursing home , you 're not your own master , " he said .
" there are rules to follow and you 've subject to strict schedules .
everything 's planned out and you feel almost trapped . " so he escaped , not by climbing out an open window , but by answering an ad for a living arrangement that experts say could become a common alternative for older people in the future : a senior flat share .
not long after , he moved into the specially modified suite of apartments and has n't looked back . communal living but privacy , too the senior flat share , however , is generally not like the basic college-age roommate situation .
röttjer has his own apartment with a kitchen and bathroom , as does each of his five flatmates .
they provide privacy and independence which are important to older people . but there is also a common room with comfortable furniture , a dining table and a tv , plus a communal kitchen and dining table where people can prepare and eat shared meals if they want .
the dresden suite also has a large bathroom that has been outfitted with special aid devices for when age makes getting around , or in and out of the bathtub , more difficult . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are at least 200 similar experiments in senior living across germany as the older generation rethinks how they want to live out their sunset years and more are popping up all the time . the senior living arrangement was even the topic of a reality tv show on the german-french channel arte , which brought five women between 60 and 70 together in a berlin apartment and followed the ups and downs of their new lives there .
surveys have found that more than two-thirds of people now over the age of 40 have no interest in going into an old age home in the future . " my generation does not want to go into these so-called social institutions for old , helpless people , " said heike grünewald , who heads projekt 50 plus , a berlin-based group which tries to match up seniors and communal living arrangements .
" we do not want the state looking after us .
besides , the state will not have any money to do it , so we have to look after ourselves . " greying society germany 's older population is set to skyrocket over the next decades .
demographers forecast that by 2050 , more than one in three germans will be over 60 .
while most european societies are getting older , in 30 years , due to low birth rates and longer life spans , it is predicted that germany will have the oldest population in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " that means we have to look at and encourage these different models of senior living , " said irmingard schewe-gerigk , a parliamentarian for the green party who looks at aging issues . germany 's system for financing care for older people is fast running short of cash .
the government pays for part or all of nursing home care , which is expensive , so it 's beginning to show interest in the alternatives .
one study has shown that having a senior in an apartment share can save the government more than 51,000 euros -lrb- $ 66,000 -rrb- a year .
in the dresden flat share , each resident pays between 270 to 390 euros rent to a real estate developer who renovated the apartment . " in a flat share , people do just fine with their own money , they 're able to manage , " said sieglinde wartenberg , who arranges senior apartment shares in dresden .
" they can get by on just a little money , and age with dignity . " social connection besides the financial aspect , there 's a social element of living with others that is just as , if not more , important for older people .
one of the greatest fears of the elderly is social isolation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many seniors fear social isolation " at some point , you feel that you just are n't needed , " said irene rostalskie , 72 .
" hardly anyone has time for you anymore . " she raised six children , but one by one they moved away until she was alone in her ground-floor apartment .
one day someone broke her window and she felt not only alone , but insecure .
the flat share solves both of those problems . " it 's one of the main advantages to this living arrangement , there 's always someone there who i can ring up or go see , " said richard palm , head of the forum for communal living .

they want security , comfort and social contacts ; they don ’ t want a nursing home .
senior flat shares fit that bill . on the eighth floor of a dresden high-rise , 72-year-old karl-heinz röttjer can look out from his small , one-bedroom apartment and see a good portion of the city and the hills that spill over into the czech republic .
to him , the wide-open vista represents freedom , and the new lease on life he has gotten since moving in with five retired women to share his sunset years . " here i feel much better , i can spend my time how i want , " he said .
" i feel free , and it 's like i have a family around me . " he cherishes that freedom since it was taken away from him for a while .
he was put in a nursing home after an illness made him unable to live alone anymore several years ago .
his wife had died and his children had moved away .
but for this spry , independent septuagenarian , it was like being put in prison . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young medic helps an old man " in a nursing home , you 're not your own master , " he said .
" there are rules to follow and you 've subject to strict schedules .
everything 's planned out and you feel almost trapped . " so he escaped , not by climbing out an open window , but by answering an ad for a living arrangement that experts say could become a common alternative for older people in the future : a senior flat share .
not long after , he moved into the specially modified suite of apartments and has n't looked back . communal living but privacy , too the senior flat share , however , is generally not like the basic college-age roommate situation .
röttjer has his own apartment with a kitchen and bathroom , as does each of his five flatmates .
they provide privacy and independence which are important to older people . but there is also a common room with comfortable furniture , a dining table and a tv , plus a communal kitchen and dining table where people can prepare and eat shared meals if they want .
the dresden suite also has a large bathroom that has been outfitted with special aid devices for when age makes getting around , or in and out of the bathtub , more difficult . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are at least 200 similar experiments in senior living across germany as the older generation rethinks how they want to live out their sunset years and more are popping up all the time . the senior living arrangement was even the topic of a reality tv show on the german-french channel arte , which brought five women between 60 and 70 together in a berlin apartment and followed the ups and downs of their new lives there .
surveys have found that more than two-thirds of people now over the age of 40 have no interest in going into an old age home in the future . " my generation does not want to go into these so-called social institutions for old , helpless people , " said heike grünewald , who heads projekt 50 plus , a berlin-based group which tries to match up seniors and communal living arrangements .
" we do not want the state looking after us .
besides , the state will not have any money to do it , so we have to look after ourselves . " greying society germany 's older population is set to skyrocket over the next decades .
demographers forecast that by 2050 , more than one in three germans will be over 60 .
while most european societies are getting older , in 30 years , due to low birth rates and longer life spans , it is predicted that germany will have the oldest population in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " that means we have to look at and encourage these different models of senior living , " said irmingard schewe-gerigk , a parliamentarian for the green party who looks at aging issues . germany 's system for financing care for older people is fast running short of cash .
the government pays for part or all of nursing home care , which is expensive , so it 's beginning to show interest in the alternatives .
one study has shown that having a senior in an apartment share can save the government more than 51,000 euros -lrb- $ 66,000 -rrb- a year .
in the dresden flat share , each resident pays between 270 to 390 euros rent to a real estate developer who renovated the apartment . " in a flat share , people do just fine with their own money , they 're able to manage , " said sieglinde wartenberg , who arranges senior apartment shares in dresden .
" they can get by on just a little money , and age with dignity . " social connection besides the financial aspect , there 's a social element of living with others that is just as , if not more , important for older people .
one of the greatest fears of the elderly is social isolation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many seniors fear social isolation " at some point , you feel that you just are n't needed , " said irene rostalskie , 72 .
" hardly anyone has time for you anymore . " she raised six children , but one by one they moved away until she was alone in her ground-floor apartment .
one day someone broke her window and she felt not only alone , but insecure .
the flat share solves both of those problems . " it 's one of the main advantages to this living arrangement , there 's always someone there who i can ring up or go see , " said richard palm , head of the forum for communal living .

" this year 's ' march of the living ' will be the largest ever , with 18,000 to 20,000 people coming to auschwitz on may 5 , which is holocaust remembrance day , " the event 's director aaron tamir told reporters in warsaw last week .
" it is going to be a huge and complicated event because this year marks the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz-birkenau and death camps in other countries , and the whole world is paying attention , " tamir said . at least 1.1 million men , women and children , most of them jews , died at auschwitz-birkenau , one of the key extermination sites for nazi germany 's " final solution , " which aimed to wipe out europe 's 11 million jews .
the nazis succeeded in exterminating six million european jews , half of them from poland , home to europe 's largest jewish community before world war ii . israeli prime minister ariel sharon , his polish counterpart marek belka and prime minister ferenc gyurcsany of hungary , which lost 450,000 jews at auschwitz , will be among dignitaries who will attend the event .
sharon was " unlikely to march , " the organizers told afp .
march of the living bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young israeli participants at the nazi auschwitz-birkenau death camp during the march of the living in 2002 .
in light of the huge numbers taking part this year , the organizers have arranged for thousands of people to set off thursday morning for the three-kilometer -lrb- two-mile -rrb- walk from the train station at oswiecim - the polish town which tragically gave its germanized name to the auschwitz camp - to the birkenau sector of the death camp .
the main march , which will group around 10,000 people , including many international officials , will leave from the original camp at auschwitz in the early afternoon . " we 've hired six special trains to bring participants to oswiecim , " tamir said . auschwitz was set up by the nazis in 1940 on the site of a former polish army barracks on the outskirts of oswiecim and expanded later to the village of brzezinka - birkenau in german - three kilometers away , to allow hitler 's germany to more efficiently kill jews , sinti , roma , poles and others considered inferior human beings . at birkenau , near the rubble of two interconnecting gas chambers and crematoria the marchers will gather in mid-afternoon for a memorial ceremony , held near the train track that carried jews and other deportees to almost certain death more than 60 years ago .
the camp was liberated on jan .
27 , 1945 by soviet troops . belka , sharon , professor , writer and former auschwitz inmate elie wiesel will be among those to give speeches to the gathering , which this year will include as many holocaust survivors and their descendants as possible , according to tamir .
countering holocaust deniers " the survivors will not be with us forever , and when they are gone , it will be easier for those who deny the holocaust to spread untruths , " tamir said .
" the idea for the march came some 20 years ago when there were voices saying the holocaust never existed , " he said .
the denials " were heard by students and young people around the world and the founders of the march of the living decided the best way to stop the debate was to bring youths from all countries to see with their own eyes what happened .

from its start in 1988 , when it gathered small groups of young jewish people , the march of the living has grown to include " adults , survivors , students , youngsters , pupils " and , for the past few years , non-jews . " our project is to take people ' from holocaust to revival , " ' tamir said . some participants come to poland just for the day of the march while others spend a week in the central european country , which lost six million civilians in world war ii , half of them jews , visiting sites linked to the holocaust . " participants see and feel the holocaust with their own eyes , " tamir said .
" then many young people fly to israel for the ' revival ' part of our project .

9 , 2003 . the court found that wiese was the head of a right-wing extremist terror organization known as kameradschaft süd -lrb- comeradeship south -rrb- aimed at undermining the german democratic system . the then german president johannes rau , bavaria 's state premier edmund stoiber and leading representatives of the jewish community were among guests at the event but authorities uncovered the plot in time to thwart it . prosecutors said wiese had long been active in far-right groups in germany , has a nazi swastika tattooed on his chest and signs letters with " heil hitler . " accomplices sentenced three of wiese 's accomplices , aged between 22 and 28 , were also given prison sentences at the conclusion of the five-month trial , which was conducted under high security .

" accomplices sentenced three of wiese 's accomplices , aged between 22 and 28 , were also given prison sentences at the conclusion of the five-month trial , which was conducted under high security .

they want security , comfort and social contacts ; they don ’ t want a nursing home .
senior flat shares fit that bill . on the eighth floor of a dresden high-rise , 72-year-old karl-heinz röttjer can look out from his small , one-bedroom apartment and see a good portion of the city and the hills that spill over into the czech republic .
to him , the wide-open vista represents freedom , and the new lease on life he has gotten since moving in with five retired women to share his sunset years . " here i feel much better , i can spend my time how i want , " he said .
" i feel free , and it 's like i have a family around me . " he cherishes that freedom since it was taken away from him for a while .
he was put in a nursing home after an illness made him unable to live alone anymore several years ago .
his wife had died and his children had moved away .
but for this spry , independent septuagenarian , it was like being put in prison . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young medic helps an old man " in a nursing home , you 're not your own master , " he said .
" there are rules to follow and you 've subject to strict schedules .
everything 's planned out and you feel almost trapped . " so he escaped , not by climbing out an open window , but by answering an ad for a living arrangement that experts say could become a common alternative for older people in the future : a senior flat share .
not long after , he moved into the specially modified suite of apartments and has n't looked back . communal living but privacy , too the senior flat share , however , is generally not like the basic college-age roommate situation .
röttjer has his own apartment with a kitchen and bathroom , as does each of his five flatmates .
they provide privacy and independence which are important to older people . but there is also a common room with comfortable furniture , a dining table and a tv , plus a communal kitchen and dining table where people can prepare and eat shared meals if they want .
the dresden suite also has a large bathroom that has been outfitted with special aid devices for when age makes getting around , or in and out of the bathtub , more difficult . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are at least 200 similar experiments in senior living across germany as the older generation rethinks how they want to live out their sunset years and more are popping up all the time . the senior living arrangement was even the topic of a reality tv show on the german-french channel arte , which brought five women between 60 and 70 together in a berlin apartment and followed the ups and downs of their new lives there .
surveys have found that more than two-thirds of people now over the age of 40 have no interest in going into an old age home in the future . " my generation does not want to go into these so-called social institutions for old , helpless people , " said heike grünewald , who heads projekt 50 plus , a berlin-based group which tries to match up seniors and communal living arrangements .
" we do not want the state looking after us .
besides , the state will not have any money to do it , so we have to look after ourselves . " greying society germany 's older population is set to skyrocket over the next decades .
demographers forecast that by 2050 , more than one in three germans will be over 60 .
while most european societies are getting older , in 30 years , due to low birth rates and longer life spans , it is predicted that germany will have the oldest population in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " that means we have to look at and encourage these different models of senior living , " said irmingard schewe-gerigk , a parliamentarian for the green party who looks at aging issues . germany 's system for financing care for older people is fast running short of cash .
the government pays for part or all of nursing home care , which is expensive , so it 's beginning to show interest in the alternatives .
one study has shown that having a senior in an apartment share can save the government more than 51,000 euros -lrb- $ 66,000 -rrb- a year .
in the dresden flat share , each resident pays between 270 to 390 euros rent to a real estate developer who renovated the apartment . " in a flat share , people do just fine with their own money , they 're able to manage , " said sieglinde wartenberg , who arranges senior apartment shares in dresden .
" they can get by on just a little money , and age with dignity . " social connection besides the financial aspect , there 's a social element of living with others that is just as , if not more , important for older people .
one of the greatest fears of the elderly is social isolation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many seniors fear social isolation " at some point , you feel that you just are n't needed , " said irene rostalskie , 72 .
" hardly anyone has time for you anymore . " she raised six children , but one by one they moved away until she was alone in her ground-floor apartment .
one day someone broke her window and she felt not only alone , but insecure .
the flat share solves both of those problems . " it 's one of the main advantages to this living arrangement , there 's always someone there who i can ring up or go see , " said richard palm , head of the forum for communal living .
" if i 'm feeling sick , there will be someone coming and saying , should i get you a newspaper or call a doctor . " around the common table in the suite , the flatmates joke and laugh like teenagers while they offer visitors coffee and cake .
they make sure all guests write their names in a black notebook they keep ; last year , there were 47 entries .
the flatmates often take group day trips around the regions , visiting neighboring towns or going to the theater . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in a nursing home , you get old very quickly , " said sylvia behrens , who at 57 is the youngest of the group , but who suffers from parkinson 's disease and has been in several living arrangements since she was diagnosed .

they want security , comfort and social contacts ; they don ’ t want a nursing home .
senior flat shares fit that bill . on the eighth floor of a dresden high-rise , 72-year-old karl-heinz röttjer can look out from his small , one-bedroom apartment and see a good portion of the city and the hills that spill over into the czech republic .
to him , the wide-open vista represents freedom , and the new lease on life he has gotten since moving in with five retired women to share his sunset years . " here i feel much better , i can spend my time how i want , " he said .
" i feel free , and it 's like i have a family around me . " he cherishes that freedom since it was taken away from him for a while .
he was put in a nursing home after an illness made him unable to live alone anymore several years ago .
his wife had died and his children had moved away .
but for this spry , independent septuagenarian , it was like being put in prison . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young medic helps an old man " in a nursing home , you 're not your own master , " he said .
" there are rules to follow and you 've subject to strict schedules .
everything 's planned out and you feel almost trapped . " so he escaped , not by climbing out an open window , but by answering an ad for a living arrangement that experts say could become a common alternative for older people in the future : a senior flat share .
not long after , he moved into the specially modified suite of apartments and has n't looked back . communal living but privacy , too the senior flat share , however , is generally not like the basic college-age roommate situation .
röttjer has his own apartment with a kitchen and bathroom , as does each of his five flatmates .
they provide privacy and independence which are important to older people . but there is also a common room with comfortable furniture , a dining table and a tv , plus a communal kitchen and dining table where people can prepare and eat shared meals if they want .
the dresden suite also has a large bathroom that has been outfitted with special aid devices for when age makes getting around , or in and out of the bathtub , more difficult . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are at least 200 similar experiments in senior living across germany as the older generation rethinks how they want to live out their sunset years and more are popping up all the time . the senior living arrangement was even the topic of a reality tv show on the german-french channel arte , which brought five women between 60 and 70 together in a berlin apartment and followed the ups and downs of their new lives there .
surveys have found that more than two-thirds of people now over the age of 40 have no interest in going into an old age home in the future . " my generation does not want to go into these so-called social institutions for old , helpless people , " said heike grünewald , who heads projekt 50 plus , a berlin-based group which tries to match up seniors and communal living arrangements .
" we do not want the state looking after us .
besides , the state will not have any money to do it , so we have to look after ourselves . " greying society germany 's older population is set to skyrocket over the next decades .
demographers forecast that by 2050 , more than one in three germans will be over 60 .
while most european societies are getting older , in 30 years , due to low birth rates and longer life spans , it is predicted that germany will have the oldest population in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " that means we have to look at and encourage these different models of senior living , " said irmingard schewe-gerigk , a parliamentarian for the green party who looks at aging issues . germany 's system for financing care for older people is fast running short of cash .
the government pays for part or all of nursing home care , which is expensive , so it 's beginning to show interest in the alternatives .
one study has shown that having a senior in an apartment share can save the government more than 51,000 euros -lrb- $ 66,000 -rrb- a year .
in the dresden flat share , each resident pays between 270 to 390 euros rent to a real estate developer who renovated the apartment . " in a flat share , people do just fine with their own money , they 're able to manage , " said sieglinde wartenberg , who arranges senior apartment shares in dresden .
" they can get by on just a little money , and age with dignity . " social connection besides the financial aspect , there 's a social element of living with others that is just as , if not more , important for older people .
one of the greatest fears of the elderly is social isolation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many seniors fear social isolation " at some point , you feel that you just are n't needed , " said irene rostalskie , 72 .

it might soon be illegal .
several politicians want to ban smoking behind the wheel , saying it ’ s a distraction and increases the risk of having an accident . " the dangers of causing an accident rise drastically when you smoke and drive , " peter danckert of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- told the best-selling newspaper bild .
" i want a complete ban on smoking for drivers . " danckert was joined in his push for smoke-free driving by several politicians on the other side of the political spectrum .
katherina reiche of the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- also told bild she wanted to put an end to puffing behind the wheel .
she noted that parliament had already passed a law outlawing the use of cell phones for drivers , and that she and others want to push for similar legislation regarding mobile phones . " cigarettes are just as much of a distraction as cell phones , " she said .
" we urgently need ban on them along with fines . " another conservative politician , gerlinde kaupa , a health policy expert for the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , backed the anti-smoking proposal . according to bild , accident researchers found that a car going 50 kilometers -lrb- 31 miles -rrb- an hour continues to travel 14 meters -lrb- 16 yards -rrb- per second while a driver searches for a cigarette that has fallen out of his or her hand . the road safety organization traffic watch welcomed the proposal . " driving demands the driver 's 100-percent attention and any kind of distraction presents a danger , " said the organization 's director , michael hartje .
he criticized the presence of ashtrays and drink holders that he said turn driving into a " sideline job . " government against the idea but germany 's transport ministry does n't see the issue in quite so serious terms and has rejected the idea of putting a legal ban in place . " there is no scientific proof that smoking drastically increases the risk of having an accident , " said a ministry spokeswoman .
she added that such legislation would be a case of " overregulation . " her boss agreed .
manfred stolpe , the transport minister , said the proposal would do nothing to increase traffic safety . germany 's largest automotive club , adac , also dismissed the idea . " eating chocolate bars , bananas or fish sandwiches while driving is also dangerous , " said the group 's spokesman , rainer hillgärtner . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans agree to curb smoking moving to protect non-smokers in germany , the federal government and the country 's association of hotels and restaurants have signed an agreement which obliges owners to create non-smoking sections for their customers .

" it is going to be a huge and complicated event because this year marks the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz-birkenau and death camps in other countries , and the whole world is paying attention , " tamir said . at least 1.1 million men , women and children , most of them jews , died at auschwitz-birkenau , one of the key extermination sites for nazi germany 's " final solution , " which aimed to wipe out europe 's 11 million jews .

" this year 's ' march of the living ' will be the largest ever , with 18,000 to 20,000 people coming to auschwitz on may 5 , which is holocaust remembrance day , " the event 's director aaron tamir told reporters in warsaw last week .
" it is going to be a huge and complicated event because this year marks the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz-birkenau and death camps in other countries , and the whole world is paying attention , " tamir said . at least 1.1 million men , women and children , most of them jews , died at auschwitz-birkenau , one of the key extermination sites for nazi germany 's " final solution , " which aimed to wipe out europe 's 11 million jews .
the nazis succeeded in exterminating six million european jews , half of them from poland , home to europe 's largest jewish community before world war ii . israeli prime minister ariel sharon , his polish counterpart marek belka and prime minister ferenc gyurcsany of hungary , which lost 450,000 jews at auschwitz , will be among dignitaries who will attend the event .
sharon was " unlikely to march , " the organizers told afp .
march of the living bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young israeli participants at the nazi auschwitz-birkenau death camp during the march of the living in 2002 .
in light of the huge numbers taking part this year , the organizers have arranged for thousands of people to set off thursday morning for the three-kilometer -lrb- two-mile -rrb- walk from the train station at oswiecim - the polish town which tragically gave its germanized name to the auschwitz camp - to the birkenau sector of the death camp .
the main march , which will group around 10,000 people , including many international officials , will leave from the original camp at auschwitz in the early afternoon . " we 've hired six special trains to bring participants to oswiecim , " tamir said . auschwitz was set up by the nazis in 1940 on the site of a former polish army barracks on the outskirts of oswiecim and expanded later to the village of brzezinka - birkenau in german - three kilometers away , to allow hitler 's germany to more efficiently kill jews , sinti , roma , poles and others considered inferior human beings . at birkenau , near the rubble of two interconnecting gas chambers and crematoria the marchers will gather in mid-afternoon for a memorial ceremony , held near the train track that carried jews and other deportees to almost certain death more than 60 years ago .
the camp was liberated on jan .
27 , 1945 by soviet troops . belka , sharon , professor , writer and former auschwitz inmate elie wiesel will be among those to give speeches to the gathering , which this year will include as many holocaust survivors and their descendants as possible , according to tamir .
countering holocaust deniers " the survivors will not be with us forever , and when they are gone , it will be easier for those who deny the holocaust to spread untruths , " tamir said .
" the idea for the march came some 20 years ago when there were voices saying the holocaust never existed , " he said .
the denials " were heard by students and young people around the world and the founders of the march of the living decided the best way to stop the debate was to bring youths from all countries to see with their own eyes what happened .

from its start in 1988 , when it gathered small groups of young jewish people , the march of the living has grown to include " adults , survivors , students , youngsters , pupils " and , for the past few years , non-jews . " our project is to take people ' from holocaust to revival , " ' tamir said . some participants come to poland just for the day of the march while others spend a week in the central european country , which lost six million civilians in world war ii , half of them jews , visiting sites linked to the holocaust . " participants see and feel the holocaust with their own eyes , " tamir said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 04.05.2005 schröder criticizes turkish democracy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish journalist protesting threats to press freedom german chancellor gerhard schröder on wednesday criticized turkey for a string of deficiencies in its democracy , urging the country to correct them if it wants to join the european union . " mistreatment by security forces , limits on freedom of expression and discrimination against women are incompatible with our common values , " schröder said at a speech at marmara university after official talks in ankara . the german leader also spoke of the " necessity of reform " in religious freedoms in this mainly muslim country , specifically mentioning a meeting earlier in the day with the istanbul-based spiritual leader of the orthodox church , ecumenical patriarch bartholomew i. turkey is under pressure to remove legal obstacles for non-muslim religious foundations to fully exercise their property rights and to reopen a greek orthodox seminary in istanbul closed down more than 30 years ago . schröder , who was receiving an honorary doctorate from the university , called on ankara to address problem areas before it begins accession talks with the european bloc on oct .
3 and urged it to swiftly implement reforms it has already adopted to achieve european norms . turkey " should not diminish its efforts , " he said .
" turkey has achieved many reforms so far but there is still much to do . " investigating armenian killings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder -lrb- l -rrb- and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan -lrb- r -rrb- earlier on wednesday , schröder told reporters after meeting turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan that the eu is determined to open accession talks with turkey on time . he brushed aside concerns that a may 29 referendum in france on the european constitution could undermine turkey 's bid . " no referendum anywhere in europe will affect turkey 's eu process , " he said . schröder also backed a turkish proposal to armenia to create a joint commission of historians to study allegations that the ottoman turks committed genocide against their armenian subjects during world war i. " we want turkish-armenian relations to improve , " schröder said .

the debate has taken on a particularly strident tone in germany , but it also rages on in many other european countries . the discussion re-ignited two weeks ago when the leader of germany 's ruling social democrat party , franz müntefering -lrb- photo -rrb- , said international investors who buy up companies , slash jobs and disappear with the profits were like a " swarm of locusts " besetting germany .

his criticisms caused an uproar from politicians and the media , and started an intense debate about whether profit-oriented companies and globalization are at fault for germany 's own plague : frighteningly high unemployment .

" mistreatment by security forces , limits on freedom of expression and discrimination against women are incompatible with our common values , " schröder said at a speech at marmara university after official talks in ankara . the german leader also spoke of the " necessity of reform " in religious freedoms in this mainly muslim country , specifically mentioning a meeting earlier in the day with the istanbul-based spiritual leader of the orthodox church , ecumenical patriarch bartholomew i. turkey is under pressure to remove legal obstacles for non-muslim religious foundations to fully exercise their property rights and to reopen a greek orthodox seminary in istanbul closed down more than 30 years ago . schröder , who was receiving an honorary doctorate from the university , called on ankara to address problem areas before it begins accession talks with the european bloc on oct .

" no referendum anywhere in europe will affect turkey 's eu process , " he said . schröder also backed a turkish proposal to armenia to create a joint commission of historians to study allegations that the ottoman turks committed genocide against their armenian subjects during world war i. " we want turkish-armenian relations to improve , " schröder said .
" germany is ready to do its best to help in this issue and open its archives . " germany and the ottoman empire , from which the present-day turkish republic was born , were allies during world war i , when the armenian massacres occurred . turkey has come under mounting international pressure to recognize the 1915-1917 killings as genocide ; some eu politicians , including the german opposition , argue that ankara should address the genocide claims if it wants to join the european bloc . erdogan , meanwhile , denounced an appeal issued by the german parliament last month calling on ankara to face up to its history .

" mistreatment by security forces , limits on freedom of expression and discrimination against women are incompatible with our common values , " schröder said at a speech at marmara university after official talks in ankara . the german leader also spoke of the " necessity of reform " in religious freedoms in this mainly muslim country , specifically mentioning a meeting earlier in the day with the istanbul-based spiritual leader of the orthodox church , ecumenical patriarch bartholomew i. turkey is under pressure to remove legal obstacles for non-muslim religious foundations to fully exercise their property rights and to reopen a greek orthodox seminary in istanbul closed down more than 30 years ago . schröder , who was receiving an honorary doctorate from the university , called on ankara to address problem areas before it begins accession talks with the european bloc on oct .

" turkey has achieved many reforms so far but there is still much to do . " investigating armenian killings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder -lrb- l -rrb- and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan -lrb- r -rrb- earlier on wednesday , schröder told reporters after meeting turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan that the eu is determined to open accession talks with turkey on time . he brushed aside concerns that a may 29 referendum in france on the european constitution could undermine turkey 's bid . " no referendum anywhere in europe will affect turkey 's eu process , " he said . schröder also backed a turkish proposal to armenia to create a joint commission of historians to study allegations that the ottoman turks committed genocide against their armenian subjects during world war i. " we want turkish-armenian relations to improve , " schröder said .
" germany is ready to do its best to help in this issue and open its archives . " germany and the ottoman empire , from which the present-day turkish republic was born , were allies during world war i , when the armenian massacres occurred . turkey has come under mounting international pressure to recognize the 1915-1917 killings as genocide ; some eu politicians , including the german opposition , argue that ankara should address the genocide claims if it wants to join the european bloc . erdogan , meanwhile , denounced an appeal issued by the german parliament last month calling on ankara to face up to its history .
he said he " conveyed our serious concerns and expectations " on the issue to schröder . support in cyprus conflict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish cypriot policeman stands next to a referendum banner that reads : " yes " in the turkish part of nicosia , cyprus , april 22 , 2004 .
greek cypriots , however , voted overwhelmingly against a un-sponsored reunification plan .
the two leaders said they also discussed the cyprus conflict , a major stumbling block to turkey 's eu membership bid .
schröder pledged he would work for the release of a 259-million euro -lrb- 335-million dollar -rrb- eu aid package earmarked for the breakaway turkish cypriot community and the activation of measures aimed at easing trade restrictions imposed on the island 's turkish sector . the eu promised the aid last year as a reward for the strong support turkish cypriots gave to a un peace plan , which was killed off due to an overwhelming " no " by the internationally-recognized greek cypriot side .
the measures have been blocked , however , because of opposition by the greek cypriots , who joined the eu last year . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder focuses on eu in turkey german chancellor gerhard schröder held talks with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan on wednesday .

" it is going to be a huge and complicated event because this year marks the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz-birkenau and death camps in other countries , and the whole world is paying attention , " tamir said . at least 1.1 million men , women and children , most of them jews , died at auschwitz-birkenau , one of the key extermination sites for nazi germany 's " final solution , " which aimed to wipe out europe 's 11 million jews .

and on tuesday , the opening day of the congress , desperate doctors took their protest to the streets of german capital .
among them was ravindra gujullah , an indian-born general practitioner in the town of landsberg . " when you become a doctor , you have such zeal to be a good doctor and to serve people , " gujullah said .
" but these things are not so important today .
now , you have to fight just to survive . " medical brain drain german hospitals are coming under increasing pressure to cut costs , and are seeking concessions from their medical staff .
doctors working in hospitals are paid roughly the same salary as an elementary school teacher , despite having to endure work weeks that often amount to more than 60 hours . in recent years , hospitals have cut staff numbers , holiday pay and christmas bonuses in an attempt to meet government demands for more efficiency .
the president of the german medical association , jörg dietrich hoppe , has predicted that more and more well-trained doctors will seek better-paid jobs in the pharmaceutical industry , or even leave germany for better opportunities abroad . " our young doctors do n't see any prospects for advancement and better pay in german clinics , " hoppe said .
" headhunters , especially from britain , are currently looking for german doctors - specialists in particular - and offering them wages that are three times as high , plus working hours that do n't go beyond 50 hours a week .

they want security , comfort and social contacts ; they don ’ t want a nursing home .
senior flat shares fit that bill . on the eighth floor of a dresden high-rise , 72-year-old karl-heinz röttjer can look out from his small , one-bedroom apartment and see a good portion of the city and the hills that spill over into the czech republic .
to him , the wide-open vista represents freedom , and the new lease on life he has gotten since moving in with five retired women to share his sunset years . " here i feel much better , i can spend my time how i want , " he said .
" i feel free , and it 's like i have a family around me . " he cherishes that freedom since it was taken away from him for a while .
he was put in a nursing home after an illness made him unable to live alone anymore several years ago .
his wife had died and his children had moved away .
but for this spry , independent septuagenarian , it was like being put in prison . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young medic helps an old man " in a nursing home , you 're not your own master , " he said .
" there are rules to follow and you 've subject to strict schedules .
everything 's planned out and you feel almost trapped . " so he escaped , not by climbing out an open window , but by answering an ad for a living arrangement that experts say could become a common alternative for older people in the future : a senior flat share .
not long after , he moved into the specially modified suite of apartments and has n't looked back . communal living but privacy , too the senior flat share , however , is generally not like the basic college-age roommate situation .
röttjer has his own apartment with a kitchen and bathroom , as does each of his five flatmates .
they provide privacy and independence which are important to older people . but there is also a common room with comfortable furniture , a dining table and a tv , plus a communal kitchen and dining table where people can prepare and eat shared meals if they want .
the dresden suite also has a large bathroom that has been outfitted with special aid devices for when age makes getting around , or in and out of the bathtub , more difficult . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are at least 200 similar experiments in senior living across germany as the older generation rethinks how they want to live out their sunset years and more are popping up all the time . the senior living arrangement was even the topic of a reality tv show on the german-french channel arte , which brought five women between 60 and 70 together in a berlin apartment and followed the ups and downs of their new lives there .
surveys have found that more than two-thirds of people now over the age of 40 have no interest in going into an old age home in the future . " my generation does not want to go into these so-called social institutions for old , helpless people , " said heike grünewald , who heads projekt 50 plus , a berlin-based group which tries to match up seniors and communal living arrangements .
" we do not want the state looking after us .
besides , the state will not have any money to do it , so we have to look after ourselves . " greying society germany 's older population is set to skyrocket over the next decades .
demographers forecast that by 2050 , more than one in three germans will be over 60 .
while most european societies are getting older , in 30 years , due to low birth rates and longer life spans , it is predicted that germany will have the oldest population in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " that means we have to look at and encourage these different models of senior living , " said irmingard schewe-gerigk , a parliamentarian for the green party who looks at aging issues . germany 's system for financing care for older people is fast running short of cash .
the government pays for part or all of nursing home care , which is expensive , so it 's beginning to show interest in the alternatives .
one study has shown that having a senior in an apartment share can save the government more than 51,000 euros -lrb- $ 66,000 -rrb- a year .
in the dresden flat share , each resident pays between 270 to 390 euros rent to a real estate developer who renovated the apartment . " in a flat share , people do just fine with their own money , they 're able to manage , " said sieglinde wartenberg , who arranges senior apartment shares in dresden .
" they can get by on just a little money , and age with dignity . " social connection besides the financial aspect , there 's a social element of living with others that is just as , if not more , important for older people .
one of the greatest fears of the elderly is social isolation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many seniors fear social isolation " at some point , you feel that you just are n't needed , " said irene rostalskie , 72 .
" hardly anyone has time for you anymore . " she raised six children , but one by one they moved away until she was alone in her ground-floor apartment .
one day someone broke her window and she felt not only alone , but insecure .
the flat share solves both of those problems . " it 's one of the main advantages to this living arrangement , there 's always someone there who i can ring up or go see , " said richard palm , head of the forum for communal living .
" if i 'm feeling sick , there will be someone coming and saying , should i get you a newspaper or call a doctor . " around the common table in the suite , the flatmates joke and laugh like teenagers while they offer visitors coffee and cake .
they make sure all guests write their names in a black notebook they keep ; last year , there were 47 entries .
the flatmates often take group day trips around the regions , visiting neighboring towns or going to the theater . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in a nursing home , you get old very quickly , " said sylvia behrens , who at 57 is the youngest of the group , but who suffers from parkinson 's disease and has been in several living arrangements since she was diagnosed .

they want security , comfort and social contacts ; they don ’ t want a nursing home .
senior flat shares fit that bill . on the eighth floor of a dresden high-rise , 72-year-old karl-heinz röttjer can look out from his small , one-bedroom apartment and see a good portion of the city and the hills that spill over into the czech republic .
to him , the wide-open vista represents freedom , and the new lease on life he has gotten since moving in with five retired women to share his sunset years . " here i feel much better , i can spend my time how i want , " he said .
" i feel free , and it 's like i have a family around me . " he cherishes that freedom since it was taken away from him for a while .
he was put in a nursing home after an illness made him unable to live alone anymore several years ago .
his wife had died and his children had moved away .
but for this spry , independent septuagenarian , it was like being put in prison . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young medic helps an old man " in a nursing home , you 're not your own master , " he said .
" there are rules to follow and you 've subject to strict schedules .

not long after , he moved into the specially modified suite of apartments and has n't looked back . communal living but privacy , too the senior flat share , however , is generally not like the basic college-age roommate situation .
röttjer has his own apartment with a kitchen and bathroom , as does each of his five flatmates .
they provide privacy and independence which are important to older people . but there is also a common room with comfortable furniture , a dining table and a tv , plus a communal kitchen and dining table where people can prepare and eat shared meals if they want .
the dresden suite also has a large bathroom that has been outfitted with special aid devices for when age makes getting around , or in and out of the bathtub , more difficult . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are at least 200 similar experiments in senior living across germany as the older generation rethinks how they want to live out their sunset years and more are popping up all the time . the senior living arrangement was even the topic of a reality tv show on the german-french channel arte , which brought five women between 60 and 70 together in a berlin apartment and followed the ups and downs of their new lives there .
surveys have found that more than two-thirds of people now over the age of 40 have no interest in going into an old age home in the future . " my generation does not want to go into these so-called social institutions for old , helpless people , " said heike grünewald , who heads projekt 50 plus , a berlin-based group which tries to match up seniors and communal living arrangements .

the debate has taken on a particularly strident tone in germany , but it also rages on in many other european countries . the discussion re-ignited two weeks ago when the leader of germany 's ruling social democrat party , franz müntefering -lrb- photo -rrb- , said international investors who buy up companies , slash jobs and disappear with the profits were like a " swarm of locusts " besetting germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd chief muentefering some charged that the incumbent politician was just using the issue to gain sympathy from his traditional voter base , ahead of state elections . private equity funds in focus müntefering was referring foremost to private equity funds , foreign investment groups made up of private share capital .
his criticisms caused an uproar from politicians and the media , and started an intense debate about whether profit-oriented companies and globalization are at fault for germany 's own plague : frighteningly high unemployment .
" the uproar is noticeably great in germany , " said henning klodt , who heads the department of growth and structural change at the kiel institute for world economics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers during a protest in turin , italy but the debate is also taking place in other european countries - albeit at a lower volume .
doubts about the capitalist system are growing elsewhere as well , said ronald janssen , economics expert at the european trade union confederation -lrb- etuc -rrb- .
" with the threat of outsourcing or job displacement , job seekers are forced to accept low pay and job cuts , in order to increase profits that are already high , " he said .
the french way for the time being , the french seem to be as critical of globalization as the germans are .
" it is a debate that has been active in france even longer than in germany , " said henrik uterwedde , deputy chief of the german-french institute , a group that studies social problems in france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attac-led anti-wto demonstration , in frankfurt , germany critics say economic liberalism has an eve broader base in france than in germany , taking into account the strength of its unions , the anti-globalization umbrella group attac and the communist party .
the french have also had exposure to tough subjects like mass job cuts and globalization for a long time .
in france , " of the 40 most important companies , 40 percent of the capital is in the hands of foreign shareholders , " uterwedde said .
" in germany , that number lies between 10 and 15 percent . "
the economic experts say the french take on the capitalism debate is more critical - and more open .
" we do n't know where it is going , in terms of the economy , " he said .
" in germany , we deal with these issues in roundtable talks with unions .
in french , these discussions take place on the streets . "
the positive side of this is that " the growing pains are public when any changes take place " in france , uterwedde added .
and the french government is more likely to manipulate the economy .
britain made the leap in other industrial countries , the capitalism critics are quieter .
klodt , from the institute of world economy , noted that rather than fearing capitalism , scandinavia and the netherlands pushed reforms through earlier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margaret thatcher in the case of britain , the reforms were already pushed through during the1980s under margaret thatcher , said joachim volz , western europe expert a the german institute for ecnomic research -lrb- diw -rrb- .
" now , it 's the country with the least fluctuation in growth , " he said .
italy is currently having a lively public debate over young people working for low wages and without a social net beneath them , etuc 's janssen said .
management on the coals a big point of contention in many countries is wages for management .
in belgium , the manager of a weaving machine manufacture nearly ran a firm into insolvency by taking such a big slice of the pie .
and even in great britain , capitalism has caused trouble .
" people are worried about service jobs leaving the country , like banks or call centers - although they are already making good profits , " janssen said . rafael heiling -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de green leader defends capitalism in the debate over capitalism that has sprung up in germany , the parliamentary floor leader of the environmentalist green party , not known for its extremely business-friendly stance , has stepped in to defend corporate interests from excessive criticism .
-lrb- may 2 , 2005 -rrb- germans protest against corporate greed more than half a million people across germany on sunday took part in traditional labor day rallies to protest against large-scale unemployment and greedy managers .
riots expected in berlin failed to materialize .
-lrb- may 2 , 2005 -rrb- capitalism debate raises eyebrows when the head of the ruling social democrats hit out at the capitalism of the business community , he struck a chord with his party 's traditional base .

they want security , comfort and social contacts ; they don ’ t want a nursing home .
senior flat shares fit that bill . on the eighth floor of a dresden high-rise , 72-year-old karl-heinz röttjer can look out from his small , one-bedroom apartment and see a good portion of the city and the hills that spill over into the czech republic .
to him , the wide-open vista represents freedom , and the new lease on life he has gotten since moving in with five retired women to share his sunset years . " here i feel much better , i can spend my time how i want , " he said .
" i feel free , and it 's like i have a family around me . " he cherishes that freedom since it was taken away from him for a while .
he was put in a nursing home after an illness made him unable to live alone anymore several years ago .
his wife had died and his children had moved away .
but for this spry , independent septuagenarian , it was like being put in prison . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young medic helps an old man " in a nursing home , you 're not your own master , " he said .
" there are rules to follow and you 've subject to strict schedules .
everything 's planned out and you feel almost trapped . " so he escaped , not by climbing out an open window , but by answering an ad for a living arrangement that experts say could become a common alternative for older people in the future : a senior flat share .
not long after , he moved into the specially modified suite of apartments and has n't looked back . communal living but privacy , too the senior flat share , however , is generally not like the basic college-age roommate situation .
röttjer has his own apartment with a kitchen and bathroom , as does each of his five flatmates .
they provide privacy and independence which are important to older people . but there is also a common room with comfortable furniture , a dining table and a tv , plus a communal kitchen and dining table where people can prepare and eat shared meals if they want .
the dresden suite also has a large bathroom that has been outfitted with special aid devices for when age makes getting around , or in and out of the bathtub , more difficult . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are at least 200 similar experiments in senior living across germany as the older generation rethinks how they want to live out their sunset years and more are popping up all the time . the senior living arrangement was even the topic of a reality tv show on the german-french channel arte , which brought five women between 60 and 70 together in a berlin apartment and followed the ups and downs of their new lives there .
surveys have found that more than two-thirds of people now over the age of 40 have no interest in going into an old age home in the future . " my generation does not want to go into these so-called social institutions for old , helpless people , " said heike grünewald , who heads projekt 50 plus , a berlin-based group which tries to match up seniors and communal living arrangements .
" we do not want the state looking after us .
besides , the state will not have any money to do it , so we have to look after ourselves . " greying society germany 's older population is set to skyrocket over the next decades .
demographers forecast that by 2050 , more than one in three germans will be over 60 .
while most european societies are getting older , in 30 years , due to low birth rates and longer life spans , it is predicted that germany will have the oldest population in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " that means we have to look at and encourage these different models of senior living , " said irmingard schewe-gerigk , a parliamentarian for the green party who looks at aging issues . germany 's system for financing care for older people is fast running short of cash .
the government pays for part or all of nursing home care , which is expensive , so it 's beginning to show interest in the alternatives .
one study has shown that having a senior in an apartment share can save the government more than 51,000 euros -lrb- $ 66,000 -rrb- a year .
in the dresden flat share , each resident pays between 270 to 390 euros rent to a real estate developer who renovated the apartment . " in a flat share , people do just fine with their own money , they 're able to manage , " said sieglinde wartenberg , who arranges senior apartment shares in dresden .
" they can get by on just a little money , and age with dignity . " social connection besides the financial aspect , there 's a social element of living with others that is just as , if not more , important for older people .
one of the greatest fears of the elderly is social isolation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many seniors fear social isolation " at some point , you feel that you just are n't needed , " said irene rostalskie , 72 .
" hardly anyone has time for you anymore . " she raised six children , but one by one they moved away until she was alone in her ground-floor apartment .
one day someone broke her window and she felt not only alone , but insecure .
the flat share solves both of those problems . " it 's one of the main advantages to this living arrangement , there 's always someone there who i can ring up or go see , " said richard palm , head of the forum for communal living .
" if i 'm feeling sick , there will be someone coming and saying , should i get you a newspaper or call a doctor . " around the common table in the suite , the flatmates joke and laugh like teenagers while they offer visitors coffee and cake .
they make sure all guests write their names in a black notebook they keep ; last year , there were 47 entries .
the flatmates often take group day trips around the regions , visiting neighboring towns or going to the theater . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in a nursing home , you get old very quickly , " said sylvia behrens , who at 57 is the youngest of the group , but who suffers from parkinson 's disease and has been in several living arrangements since she was diagnosed . " here , you feel young again , " she said . kyle james , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a germany without children ?
germany is waking up to the fact that a demographic revolution is underway .
not only are people living longer , but germans are having fewer babies , meaning the population is both shrinking and ageing .

" this year 's ' march of the living ' will be the largest ever , with 18,000 to 20,000 people coming to auschwitz on may 5 , which is holocaust remembrance day , " the event 's director aaron tamir told reporters in warsaw last week .
" it is going to be a huge and complicated event because this year marks the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz-birkenau and death camps in other countries , and the whole world is paying attention , " tamir said . at least 1.1 million men , women and children , most of them jews , died at auschwitz-birkenau , one of the key extermination sites for nazi germany 's " final solution , " which aimed to wipe out europe 's 11 million jews .
the nazis succeeded in exterminating six million european jews , half of them from poland , home to europe 's largest jewish community before world war ii . israeli prime minister ariel sharon , his polish counterpart marek belka and prime minister ferenc gyurcsany of hungary , which lost 450,000 jews at auschwitz , will be among dignitaries who will attend the event .
sharon was " unlikely to march , " the organizers told afp .
march of the living bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young israeli participants at the nazi auschwitz-birkenau death camp during the march of the living in 2002 .
in light of the huge numbers taking part this year , the organizers have arranged for thousands of people to set off thursday morning for the three-kilometer -lrb- two-mile -rrb- walk from the train station at oswiecim - the polish town which tragically gave its germanized name to the auschwitz camp - to the birkenau sector of the death camp .
the main march , which will group around 10,000 people , including many international officials , will leave from the original camp at auschwitz in the early afternoon . " we 've hired six special trains to bring participants to oswiecim , " tamir said . auschwitz was set up by the nazis in 1940 on the site of a former polish army barracks on the outskirts of oswiecim and expanded later to the village of brzezinka - birkenau in german - three kilometers away , to allow hitler 's germany to more efficiently kill jews , sinti , roma , poles and others considered inferior human beings . at birkenau , near the rubble of two interconnecting gas chambers and crematoria the marchers will gather in mid-afternoon for a memorial ceremony , held near the train track that carried jews and other deportees to almost certain death more than 60 years ago .
the camp was liberated on jan .
27 , 1945 by soviet troops . belka , sharon , professor , writer and former auschwitz inmate elie wiesel will be among those to give speeches to the gathering , which this year will include as many holocaust survivors and their descendants as possible , according to tamir .
countering holocaust deniers " the survivors will not be with us forever , and when they are gone , it will be easier for those who deny the holocaust to spread untruths , " tamir said .
" the idea for the march came some 20 years ago when there were voices saying the holocaust never existed , " he said .
the denials " were heard by students and young people around the world and the founders of the march of the living decided the best way to stop the debate was to bring youths from all countries to see with their own eyes what happened . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : candles lit to remember the holocaust victims at the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the nazi-era auschwitz death camp at a loading ramp of former german railway company deutsche reichsbahn on jan .
27 , 2005 .
from its start in 1988 , when it gathered small groups of young jewish people , the march of the living has grown to include " adults , survivors , students , youngsters , pupils " and , for the past few years , non-jews . " our project is to take people ' from holocaust to revival , " ' tamir said . some participants come to poland just for the day of the march while others spend a week in the central european country , which lost six million civilians in world war ii , half of them jews , visiting sites linked to the holocaust . " participants see and feel the holocaust with their own eyes , " tamir said .
" then many young people fly to israel for the ' revival ' part of our project . " the principal aim of the march remains " to make sure that what happened more than 60 years ago never happens again , " he added . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dealing a blow to holocaust deniers deborah lipstadt never took the stand during the landmark libel case she won against british holocaust denier david irving .

it might soon be illegal .
several politicians want to ban smoking behind the wheel , saying it ’ s a distraction and increases the risk of having an accident . " the dangers of causing an accident rise drastically when you smoke and drive , " peter danckert of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- told the best-selling newspaper bild .
" i want a complete ban on smoking for drivers . " danckert was joined in his push for smoke-free driving by several politicians on the other side of the political spectrum .
katherina reiche of the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- also told bild she wanted to put an end to puffing behind the wheel .
she noted that parliament had already passed a law outlawing the use of cell phones for drivers , and that she and others want to push for similar legislation regarding mobile phones . " cigarettes are just as much of a distraction as cell phones , " she said .
" we urgently need ban on them along with fines . " another conservative politician , gerlinde kaupa , a health policy expert for the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , backed the anti-smoking proposal . according to bild , accident researchers found that a car going 50 kilometers -lrb- 31 miles -rrb- an hour continues to travel 14 meters -lrb- 16 yards -rrb- per second while a driver searches for a cigarette that has fallen out of his or her hand . the road safety organization traffic watch welcomed the proposal . " driving demands the driver 's 100-percent attention and any kind of distraction presents a danger , " said the organization 's director , michael hartje .
he criticized the presence of ashtrays and drink holders that he said turn driving into a " sideline job . " government against the idea but germany 's transport ministry does n't see the issue in quite so serious terms and has rejected the idea of putting a legal ban in place . " there is no scientific proof that smoking drastically increases the risk of having an accident , " said a ministry spokeswoman .
she added that such legislation would be a case of " overregulation . " her boss agreed .
manfred stolpe , the transport minister , said the proposal would do nothing to increase traffic safety . germany 's largest automotive club , adac , also dismissed the idea . " eating chocolate bars , bananas or fish sandwiches while driving is also dangerous , " said the group 's spokesman , rainer hillgärtner . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans agree to curb smoking moving to protect non-smokers in germany , the federal government and the country 's association of hotels and restaurants have signed an agreement which obliges owners to create non-smoking sections for their customers .

they want security , comfort and social contacts ; they don ’ t want a nursing home .
senior flat shares fit that bill . on the eighth floor of a dresden high-rise , 72-year-old karl-heinz röttjer can look out from his small , one-bedroom apartment and see a good portion of the city and the hills that spill over into the czech republic .
to him , the wide-open vista represents freedom , and the new lease on life he has gotten since moving in with five retired women to share his sunset years . " here i feel much better , i can spend my time how i want , " he said .
" i feel free , and it 's like i have a family around me . " he cherishes that freedom since it was taken away from him for a while .
he was put in a nursing home after an illness made him unable to live alone anymore several years ago .
his wife had died and his children had moved away .
but for this spry , independent septuagenarian , it was like being put in prison . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young medic helps an old man " in a nursing home , you 're not your own master , " he said .
" there are rules to follow and you 've subject to strict schedules .
everything 's planned out and you feel almost trapped . " so he escaped , not by climbing out an open window , but by answering an ad for a living arrangement that experts say could become a common alternative for older people in the future : a senior flat share .
not long after , he moved into the specially modified suite of apartments and has n't looked back . communal living but privacy , too the senior flat share , however , is generally not like the basic college-age roommate situation .
röttjer has his own apartment with a kitchen and bathroom , as does each of his five flatmates .
they provide privacy and independence which are important to older people . but there is also a common room with comfortable furniture , a dining table and a tv , plus a communal kitchen and dining table where people can prepare and eat shared meals if they want .
the dresden suite also has a large bathroom that has been outfitted with special aid devices for when age makes getting around , or in and out of the bathtub , more difficult . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are at least 200 similar experiments in senior living across germany as the older generation rethinks how they want to live out their sunset years and more are popping up all the time . the senior living arrangement was even the topic of a reality tv show on the german-french channel arte , which brought five women between 60 and 70 together in a berlin apartment and followed the ups and downs of their new lives there .
surveys have found that more than two-thirds of people now over the age of 40 have no interest in going into an old age home in the future . " my generation does not want to go into these so-called social institutions for old , helpless people , " said heike grünewald , who heads projekt 50 plus , a berlin-based group which tries to match up seniors and communal living arrangements .
" we do not want the state looking after us .
besides , the state will not have any money to do it , so we have to look after ourselves . " greying society germany 's older population is set to skyrocket over the next decades .
demographers forecast that by 2050 , more than one in three germans will be over 60 .
while most european societies are getting older , in 30 years , due to low birth rates and longer life spans , it is predicted that germany will have the oldest population in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " that means we have to look at and encourage these different models of senior living , " said irmingard schewe-gerigk , a parliamentarian for the green party who looks at aging issues . germany 's system for financing care for older people is fast running short of cash .
the government pays for part or all of nursing home care , which is expensive , so it 's beginning to show interest in the alternatives .
one study has shown that having a senior in an apartment share can save the government more than 51,000 euros -lrb- $ 66,000 -rrb- a year .
in the dresden flat share , each resident pays between 270 to 390 euros rent to a real estate developer who renovated the apartment . " in a flat share , people do just fine with their own money , they 're able to manage , " said sieglinde wartenberg , who arranges senior apartment shares in dresden .
" they can get by on just a little money , and age with dignity . " social connection besides the financial aspect , there 's a social element of living with others that is just as , if not more , important for older people .
one of the greatest fears of the elderly is social isolation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many seniors fear social isolation " at some point , you feel that you just are n't needed , " said irene rostalskie , 72 .
" hardly anyone has time for you anymore . " she raised six children , but one by one they moved away until she was alone in her ground-floor apartment .
one day someone broke her window and she felt not only alone , but insecure .
the flat share solves both of those problems . " it 's one of the main advantages to this living arrangement , there 's always someone there who i can ring up or go see , " said richard palm , head of the forum for communal living .
" if i 'm feeling sick , there will be someone coming and saying , should i get you a newspaper or call a doctor . " around the common table in the suite , the flatmates joke and laugh like teenagers while they offer visitors coffee and cake .
they make sure all guests write their names in a black notebook they keep ; last year , there were 47 entries .
the flatmates often take group day trips around the regions , visiting neighboring towns or going to the theater . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in a nursing home , you get old very quickly , " said sylvia behrens , who at 57 is the youngest of the group , but who suffers from parkinson 's disease and has been in several living arrangements since she was diagnosed . " here , you feel young again , " she said . kyle james , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a germany without children ?

several politicians want to ban smoking behind the wheel , saying it ’ s a distraction and increases the risk of having an accident . " the dangers of causing an accident rise drastically when you smoke and drive , " peter danckert of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- told the best-selling newspaper bild .
" i want a complete ban on smoking for drivers . " danckert was joined in his push for smoke-free driving by several politicians on the other side of the political spectrum .
katherina reiche of the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- also told bild she wanted to put an end to puffing behind the wheel .
she noted that parliament had already passed a law outlawing the use of cell phones for drivers , and that she and others want to push for similar legislation regarding mobile phones . " cigarettes are just as much of a distraction as cell phones , " she said .

she added that such legislation would be a case of " overregulation . " her boss agreed .
manfred stolpe , the transport minister , said the proposal would do nothing to increase traffic safety . germany 's largest automotive club , adac , also dismissed the idea .

in france , " of the 40 most important companies , 40 percent of the capital is in the hands of foreign shareholders , " uterwedde said .

" we do n't know where it is going , in terms of the economy , " he said .
" in germany , we deal with these issues in roundtable talks with unions .

they want security , comfort and social contacts ; they don ’ t want a nursing home .
senior flat shares fit that bill . on the eighth floor of a dresden high-rise , 72-year-old karl-heinz röttjer can look out from his small , one-bedroom apartment and see a good portion of the city and the hills that spill over into the czech republic .
to him , the wide-open vista represents freedom , and the new lease on life he has gotten since moving in with five retired women to share his sunset years . " here i feel much better , i can spend my time how i want , " he said .
" i feel free , and it 's like i have a family around me . " he cherishes that freedom since it was taken away from him for a while .
he was put in a nursing home after an illness made him unable to live alone anymore several years ago .
his wife had died and his children had moved away .
but for this spry , independent septuagenarian , it was like being put in prison . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young medic helps an old man " in a nursing home , you 're not your own master , " he said .
" there are rules to follow and you 've subject to strict schedules .
everything 's planned out and you feel almost trapped . " so he escaped , not by climbing out an open window , but by answering an ad for a living arrangement that experts say could become a common alternative for older people in the future : a senior flat share .
not long after , he moved into the specially modified suite of apartments and has n't looked back . communal living but privacy , too the senior flat share , however , is generally not like the basic college-age roommate situation .
röttjer has his own apartment with a kitchen and bathroom , as does each of his five flatmates .

" this year 's ' march of the living ' will be the largest ever , with 18,000 to 20,000 people coming to auschwitz on may 5 , which is holocaust remembrance day , " the event 's director aaron tamir told reporters in warsaw last week .
" it is going to be a huge and complicated event because this year marks the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz-birkenau and death camps in other countries , and the whole world is paying attention , " tamir said . at least 1.1 million men , women and children , most of them jews , died at auschwitz-birkenau , one of the key extermination sites for nazi germany 's " final solution , " which aimed to wipe out europe 's 11 million jews .
the nazis succeeded in exterminating six million european jews , half of them from poland , home to europe 's largest jewish community before world war ii . israeli prime minister ariel sharon , his polish counterpart marek belka and prime minister ferenc gyurcsany of hungary , which lost 450,000 jews at auschwitz , will be among dignitaries who will attend the event .
sharon was " unlikely to march , " the organizers told afp .
march of the living bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young israeli participants at the nazi auschwitz-birkenau death camp during the march of the living in 2002 .
in light of the huge numbers taking part this year , the organizers have arranged for thousands of people to set off thursday morning for the three-kilometer -lrb- two-mile -rrb- walk from the train station at oswiecim - the polish town which tragically gave its germanized name to the auschwitz camp - to the birkenau sector of the death camp .
the main march , which will group around 10,000 people , including many international officials , will leave from the original camp at auschwitz in the early afternoon . " we 've hired six special trains to bring participants to oswiecim , " tamir said . auschwitz was set up by the nazis in 1940 on the site of a former polish army barracks on the outskirts of oswiecim and expanded later to the village of brzezinka - birkenau in german - three kilometers away , to allow hitler 's germany to more efficiently kill jews , sinti , roma , poles and others considered inferior human beings . at birkenau , near the rubble of two interconnecting gas chambers and crematoria the marchers will gather in mid-afternoon for a memorial ceremony , held near the train track that carried jews and other deportees to almost certain death more than 60 years ago .
the camp was liberated on jan .
27 , 1945 by soviet troops . belka , sharon , professor , writer and former auschwitz inmate elie wiesel will be among those to give speeches to the gathering , which this year will include as many holocaust survivors and their descendants as possible , according to tamir .
countering holocaust deniers " the survivors will not be with us forever , and when they are gone , it will be easier for those who deny the holocaust to spread untruths , " tamir said .
" the idea for the march came some 20 years ago when there were voices saying the holocaust never existed , " he said .
the denials " were heard by students and young people around the world and the founders of the march of the living decided the best way to stop the debate was to bring youths from all countries to see with their own eyes what happened .

27 , 2005 .
from its start in 1988 , when it gathered small groups of young jewish people , the march of the living has grown to include " adults , survivors , students , youngsters , pupils " and , for the past few years , non-jews . " our project is to take people ' from holocaust to revival , " ' tamir said . some participants come to poland just for the day of the march while others spend a week in the central european country , which lost six million civilians in world war ii , half of them jews , visiting sites linked to the holocaust . " participants see and feel the holocaust with their own eyes , " tamir said .
" then many young people fly to israel for the ' revival ' part of our project . " the principal aim of the march remains " to make sure that what happened more than 60 years ago never happens again , " he added . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dealing a blow to holocaust deniers deborah lipstadt never took the stand during the landmark libel case she won against british holocaust denier david irving .

the debate has taken on a particularly strident tone in germany , but it also rages on in many other european countries . the discussion re-ignited two weeks ago when the leader of germany 's ruling social democrat party , franz müntefering -lrb- photo -rrb- , said international investors who buy up companies , slash jobs and disappear with the profits were like a " swarm of locusts " besetting germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd chief muentefering some charged that the incumbent politician was just using the issue to gain sympathy from his traditional voter base , ahead of state elections . private equity funds in focus müntefering was referring foremost to private equity funds , foreign investment groups made up of private share capital .
his criticisms caused an uproar from politicians and the media , and started an intense debate about whether profit-oriented companies and globalization are at fault for germany 's own plague : frighteningly high unemployment .
" the uproar is noticeably great in germany , " said henning klodt , who heads the department of growth and structural change at the kiel institute for world economics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers during a protest in turin , italy but the debate is also taking place in other european countries - albeit at a lower volume .
doubts about the capitalist system are growing elsewhere as well , said ronald janssen , economics expert at the european trade union confederation -lrb- etuc -rrb- .
" with the threat of outsourcing or job displacement , job seekers are forced to accept low pay and job cuts , in order to increase profits that are already high , " he said .
the french way for the time being , the french seem to be as critical of globalization as the germans are .
" it is a debate that has been active in france even longer than in germany , " said henrik uterwedde , deputy chief of the german-french institute , a group that studies social problems in france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attac-led anti-wto demonstration , in frankfurt , germany critics say economic liberalism has an eve broader base in france than in germany , taking into account the strength of its unions , the anti-globalization umbrella group attac and the communist party .
the french have also had exposure to tough subjects like mass job cuts and globalization for a long time .
in france , " of the 40 most important companies , 40 percent of the capital is in the hands of foreign shareholders , " uterwedde said .
" in germany , that number lies between 10 and 15 percent . "
the economic experts say the french take on the capitalism debate is more critical - and more open .
" we do n't know where it is going , in terms of the economy , " he said .
" in germany , we deal with these issues in roundtable talks with unions .
in french , these discussions take place on the streets . "
the positive side of this is that " the growing pains are public when any changes take place " in france , uterwedde added .
and the french government is more likely to manipulate the economy .
britain made the leap in other industrial countries , the capitalism critics are quieter .
klodt , from the institute of world economy , noted that rather than fearing capitalism , scandinavia and the netherlands pushed reforms through earlier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margaret thatcher in the case of britain , the reforms were already pushed through during the1980s under margaret thatcher , said joachim volz , western europe expert a the german institute for ecnomic research -lrb- diw -rrb- .
" now , it 's the country with the least fluctuation in growth , " he said .
italy is currently having a lively public debate over young people working for low wages and without a social net beneath them , etuc 's janssen said .
management on the coals a big point of contention in many countries is wages for management .
in belgium , the manager of a weaving machine manufacture nearly ran a firm into insolvency by taking such a big slice of the pie .
and even in great britain , capitalism has caused trouble .
" people are worried about service jobs leaving the country , like banks or call centers - although they are already making good profits , " janssen said . rafael heiling -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de green leader defends capitalism in the debate over capitalism that has sprung up in germany , the parliamentary floor leader of the environmentalist green party , not known for its extremely business-friendly stance , has stepped in to defend corporate interests from excessive criticism .
-lrb- may 2 , 2005 -rrb- germans protest against corporate greed more than half a million people across germany on sunday took part in traditional labor day rallies to protest against large-scale unemployment and greedy managers .
riots expected in berlin failed to materialize .
-lrb- may 2 , 2005 -rrb- capitalism debate raises eyebrows when the head of the ruling social democrats hit out at the capitalism of the business community , he struck a chord with his party 's traditional base .
but many are suspicious of his motives ahead of crucial state polls .

the debate has taken on a particularly strident tone in germany , but it also rages on in many other european countries . the discussion re-ignited two weeks ago when the leader of germany 's ruling social democrat party , franz müntefering -lrb- photo -rrb- , said international investors who buy up companies , slash jobs and disappear with the profits were like a " swarm of locusts " besetting germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd chief muentefering some charged that the incumbent politician was just using the issue to gain sympathy from his traditional voter base , ahead of state elections . private equity funds in focus müntefering was referring foremost to private equity funds , foreign investment groups made up of private share capital .
his criticisms caused an uproar from politicians and the media , and started an intense debate about whether profit-oriented companies and globalization are at fault for germany 's own plague : frighteningly high unemployment .
" the uproar is noticeably great in germany , " said henning klodt , who heads the department of growth and structural change at the kiel institute for world economics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers during a protest in turin , italy but the debate is also taking place in other european countries - albeit at a lower volume .
doubts about the capitalist system are growing elsewhere as well , said ronald janssen , economics expert at the european trade union confederation -lrb- etuc -rrb- .
" with the threat of outsourcing or job displacement , job seekers are forced to accept low pay and job cuts , in order to increase profits that are already high , " he said .
the french way for the time being , the french seem to be as critical of globalization as the germans are .
" it is a debate that has been active in france even longer than in germany , " said henrik uterwedde , deputy chief of the german-french institute , a group that studies social problems in france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attac-led anti-wto demonstration , in frankfurt , germany critics say economic liberalism has an eve broader base in france than in germany , taking into account the strength of its unions , the anti-globalization umbrella group attac and the communist party .
the french have also had exposure to tough subjects like mass job cuts and globalization for a long time .
in france , " of the 40 most important companies , 40 percent of the capital is in the hands of foreign shareholders , " uterwedde said .
" in germany , that number lies between 10 and 15 percent . "
the economic experts say the french take on the capitalism debate is more critical - and more open .
" we do n't know where it is going , in terms of the economy , " he said .
" in germany , we deal with these issues in roundtable talks with unions .
in french , these discussions take place on the streets . "
the positive side of this is that " the growing pains are public when any changes take place " in france , uterwedde added .
and the french government is more likely to manipulate the economy .
britain made the leap in other industrial countries , the capitalism critics are quieter .
klodt , from the institute of world economy , noted that rather than fearing capitalism , scandinavia and the netherlands pushed reforms through earlier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margaret thatcher in the case of britain , the reforms were already pushed through during the1980s under margaret thatcher , said joachim volz , western europe expert a the german institute for ecnomic research -lrb- diw -rrb- .
" now , it 's the country with the least fluctuation in growth , " he said .
italy is currently having a lively public debate over young people working for low wages and without a social net beneath them , etuc 's janssen said .
management on the coals a big point of contention in many countries is wages for management .
in belgium , the manager of a weaving machine manufacture nearly ran a firm into insolvency by taking such a big slice of the pie .
and even in great britain , capitalism has caused trouble .
" people are worried about service jobs leaving the country , like banks or call centers - although they are already making good profits , " janssen said . rafael heiling -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de green leader defends capitalism in the debate over capitalism that has sprung up in germany , the parliamentary floor leader of the environmentalist green party , not known for its extremely business-friendly stance , has stepped in to defend corporate interests from excessive criticism .

among them was ravindra gujullah , an indian-born general practitioner in the town of landsberg . " when you become a doctor , you have such zeal to be a good doctor and to serve people , " gujullah said .

doctors working in hospitals are paid roughly the same salary as an elementary school teacher , despite having to endure work weeks that often amount to more than 60 hours . in recent years , hospitals have cut staff numbers , holiday pay and christmas bonuses in an attempt to meet government demands for more efficiency .
the president of the german medical association , jörg dietrich hoppe , has predicted that more and more well-trained doctors will seek better-paid jobs in the pharmaceutical industry , or even leave germany for better opportunities abroad .

" this year 's ' march of the living ' will be the largest ever , with 18,000 to 20,000 people coming to auschwitz on may 5 , which is holocaust remembrance day , " the event 's director aaron tamir told reporters in warsaw last week .
" it is going to be a huge and complicated event because this year marks the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz-birkenau and death camps in other countries , and the whole world is paying attention , " tamir said . at least 1.1 million men , women and children , most of them jews , died at auschwitz-birkenau , one of the key extermination sites for nazi germany 's " final solution , " which aimed to wipe out europe 's 11 million jews .
the nazis succeeded in exterminating six million european jews , half of them from poland , home to europe 's largest jewish community before world war ii . israeli prime minister ariel sharon , his polish counterpart marek belka and prime minister ferenc gyurcsany of hungary , which lost 450,000 jews at auschwitz , will be among dignitaries who will attend the event .
sharon was " unlikely to march , " the organizers told afp .
march of the living bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young israeli participants at the nazi auschwitz-birkenau death camp during the march of the living in 2002 .
in light of the huge numbers taking part this year , the organizers have arranged for thousands of people to set off thursday morning for the three-kilometer -lrb- two-mile -rrb- walk from the train station at oswiecim - the polish town which tragically gave its germanized name to the auschwitz camp - to the birkenau sector of the death camp .
the main march , which will group around 10,000 people , including many international officials , will leave from the original camp at auschwitz in the early afternoon . " we 've hired six special trains to bring participants to oswiecim , " tamir said . auschwitz was set up by the nazis in 1940 on the site of a former polish army barracks on the outskirts of oswiecim and expanded later to the village of brzezinka - birkenau in german - three kilometers away , to allow hitler 's germany to more efficiently kill jews , sinti , roma , poles and others considered inferior human beings . at birkenau , near the rubble of two interconnecting gas chambers and crematoria the marchers will gather in mid-afternoon for a memorial ceremony , held near the train track that carried jews and other deportees to almost certain death more than 60 years ago .
the camp was liberated on jan .
27 , 1945 by soviet troops . belka , sharon , professor , writer and former auschwitz inmate elie wiesel will be among those to give speeches to the gathering , which this year will include as many holocaust survivors and their descendants as possible , according to tamir .
countering holocaust deniers " the survivors will not be with us forever , and when they are gone , it will be easier for those who deny the holocaust to spread untruths , " tamir said .
" the idea for the march came some 20 years ago when there were voices saying the holocaust never existed , " he said .
the denials " were heard by students and young people around the world and the founders of the march of the living decided the best way to stop the debate was to bring youths from all countries to see with their own eyes what happened .

27 , 2005 .
from its start in 1988 , when it gathered small groups of young jewish people , the march of the living has grown to include " adults , survivors , students , youngsters , pupils " and , for the past few years , non-jews . " our project is to take people ' from holocaust to revival , " ' tamir said . some participants come to poland just for the day of the march while others spend a week in the central european country , which lost six million civilians in world war ii , half of them jews , visiting sites linked to the holocaust . " participants see and feel the holocaust with their own eyes , " tamir said .
" then many young people fly to israel for the ' revival ' part of our project . " the principal aim of the march remains " to make sure that what happened more than 60 years ago never happens again , " he added . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dealing a blow to holocaust deniers deborah lipstadt never took the stand during the landmark libel case she won against british holocaust denier david irving .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 04.05.2005 auschwitz march to recall holocaust victims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the march of the living was started to counter holocaust denial thousands of people from some 50 countries have begun converging on southern poland to take part thursday in a march in memory of holocaust victims at auschwitz-birkenau , the most grimly efficient of nazi death camps . " this year 's ' march of the living ' will be the largest ever , with 18,000 to 20,000 people coming to auschwitz on may 5 , which is holocaust remembrance day , " the event 's director aaron tamir told reporters in warsaw last week .
" it is going to be a huge and complicated event because this year marks the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz-birkenau and death camps in other countries , and the whole world is paying attention , " tamir said . at least 1.1 million men , women and children , most of them jews , died at auschwitz-birkenau , one of the key extermination sites for nazi germany 's " final solution , " which aimed to wipe out europe 's 11 million jews .
the nazis succeeded in exterminating six million european jews , half of them from poland , home to europe 's largest jewish community before world war ii . israeli prime minister ariel sharon , his polish counterpart marek belka and prime minister ferenc gyurcsany of hungary , which lost 450,000 jews at auschwitz , will be among dignitaries who will attend the event .
sharon was " unlikely to march , " the organizers told afp .
march of the living bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young israeli participants at the nazi auschwitz-birkenau death camp during the march of the living in 2002 .
in light of the huge numbers taking part this year , the organizers have arranged for thousands of people to set off thursday morning for the three-kilometer -lrb- two-mile -rrb- walk from the train station at oswiecim - the polish town which tragically gave its germanized name to the auschwitz camp - to the birkenau sector of the death camp .
the main march , which will group around 10,000 people , including many international officials , will leave from the original camp at auschwitz in the early afternoon . " we 've hired six special trains to bring participants to oswiecim , " tamir said . auschwitz was set up by the nazis in 1940 on the site of a former polish army barracks on the outskirts of oswiecim and expanded later to the village of brzezinka - birkenau in german - three kilometers away , to allow hitler 's germany to more efficiently kill jews , sinti , roma , poles and others considered inferior human beings . at birkenau , near the rubble of two interconnecting gas chambers and crematoria the marchers will gather in mid-afternoon for a memorial ceremony , held near the train track that carried jews and other deportees to almost certain death more than 60 years ago .
the camp was liberated on jan .
27 , 1945 by soviet troops . belka , sharon , professor , writer and former auschwitz inmate elie wiesel will be among those to give speeches to the gathering , which this year will include as many holocaust survivors and their descendants as possible , according to tamir .
countering holocaust deniers " the survivors will not be with us forever , and when they are gone , it will be easier for those who deny the holocaust to spread untruths , " tamir said .
" the idea for the march came some 20 years ago when there were voices saying the holocaust never existed , " he said .
the denials " were heard by students and young people around the world and the founders of the march of the living decided the best way to stop the debate was to bring youths from all countries to see with their own eyes what happened . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : candles lit to remember the holocaust victims at the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the nazi-era auschwitz death camp at a loading ramp of former german railway company deutsche reichsbahn on jan .

from its start in 1988 , when it gathered small groups of young jewish people , the march of the living has grown to include " adults , survivors , students , youngsters , pupils " and , for the past few years , non-jews . " our project is to take people ' from holocaust to revival , " ' tamir said . some participants come to poland just for the day of the march while others spend a week in the central european country , which lost six million civilians in world war ii , half of them jews , visiting sites linked to the holocaust . " participants see and feel the holocaust with their own eyes , " tamir said .
" then many young people fly to israel for the ' revival ' part of our project .

several politicians want to ban smoking behind the wheel , saying it ’ s a distraction and increases the risk of having an accident . " the dangers of causing an accident rise drastically when you smoke and drive , " peter danckert of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- told the best-selling newspaper bild .
" i want a complete ban on smoking for drivers . " danckert was joined in his push for smoke-free driving by several politicians on the other side of the political spectrum .
katherina reiche of the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- also told bild she wanted to put an end to puffing behind the wheel .
she noted that parliament had already passed a law outlawing the use of cell phones for drivers , and that she and others want to push for similar legislation regarding mobile phones . " cigarettes are just as much of a distraction as cell phones , " she said .
" we urgently need ban on them along with fines . " another conservative politician , gerlinde kaupa , a health policy expert for the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , backed the anti-smoking proposal . according to bild , accident researchers found that a car going 50 kilometers -lrb- 31 miles -rrb- an hour continues to travel 14 meters -lrb- 16 yards -rrb- per second while a driver searches for a cigarette that has fallen out of his or her hand . the road safety organization traffic watch welcomed the proposal . " driving demands the driver 's 100-percent attention and any kind of distraction presents a danger , " said the organization 's director , michael hartje .
he criticized the presence of ashtrays and drink holders that he said turn driving into a " sideline job . " government against the idea but germany 's transport ministry does n't see the issue in quite so serious terms and has rejected the idea of putting a legal ban in place . " there is no scientific proof that smoking drastically increases the risk of having an accident , " said a ministry spokeswoman .
she added that such legislation would be a case of " overregulation . " her boss agreed .
manfred stolpe , the transport minister , said the proposal would do nothing to increase traffic safety . germany 's largest automotive club , adac , also dismissed the idea . " eating chocolate bars , bananas or fish sandwiches while driving is also dangerous , " said the group 's spokesman , rainer hillgärtner . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans agree to curb smoking moving to protect non-smokers in germany , the federal government and the country 's association of hotels and restaurants have signed an agreement which obliges owners to create non-smoking sections for their customers .

they want security , comfort and social contacts ; they don ’ t want a nursing home .
senior flat shares fit that bill . on the eighth floor of a dresden high-rise , 72-year-old karl-heinz röttjer can look out from his small , one-bedroom apartment and see a good portion of the city and the hills that spill over into the czech republic .
to him , the wide-open vista represents freedom , and the new lease on life he has gotten since moving in with five retired women to share his sunset years . " here i feel much better , i can spend my time how i want , " he said .
" i feel free , and it 's like i have a family around me . " he cherishes that freedom since it was taken away from him for a while .
he was put in a nursing home after an illness made him unable to live alone anymore several years ago .
his wife had died and his children had moved away .
but for this spry , independent septuagenarian , it was like being put in prison . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young medic helps an old man " in a nursing home , you 're not your own master , " he said .
" there are rules to follow and you 've subject to strict schedules .
everything 's planned out and you feel almost trapped . " so he escaped , not by climbing out an open window , but by answering an ad for a living arrangement that experts say could become a common alternative for older people in the future : a senior flat share .
not long after , he moved into the specially modified suite of apartments and has n't looked back . communal living but privacy , too the senior flat share , however , is generally not like the basic college-age roommate situation .
röttjer has his own apartment with a kitchen and bathroom , as does each of his five flatmates .
they provide privacy and independence which are important to older people . but there is also a common room with comfortable furniture , a dining table and a tv , plus a communal kitchen and dining table where people can prepare and eat shared meals if they want .
the dresden suite also has a large bathroom that has been outfitted with special aid devices for when age makes getting around , or in and out of the bathtub , more difficult . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are at least 200 similar experiments in senior living across germany as the older generation rethinks how they want to live out their sunset years and more are popping up all the time . the senior living arrangement was even the topic of a reality tv show on the german-french channel arte , which brought five women between 60 and 70 together in a berlin apartment and followed the ups and downs of their new lives there .
surveys have found that more than two-thirds of people now over the age of 40 have no interest in going into an old age home in the future . " my generation does not want to go into these so-called social institutions for old , helpless people , " said heike grünewald , who heads projekt 50 plus , a berlin-based group which tries to match up seniors and communal living arrangements .
" we do not want the state looking after us .
besides , the state will not have any money to do it , so we have to look after ourselves . " greying society germany 's older population is set to skyrocket over the next decades .
demographers forecast that by 2050 , more than one in three germans will be over 60 .
while most european societies are getting older , in 30 years , due to low birth rates and longer life spans , it is predicted that germany will have the oldest population in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " that means we have to look at and encourage these different models of senior living , " said irmingard schewe-gerigk , a parliamentarian for the green party who looks at aging issues . germany 's system for financing care for older people is fast running short of cash .
the government pays for part or all of nursing home care , which is expensive , so it 's beginning to show interest in the alternatives .
one study has shown that having a senior in an apartment share can save the government more than 51,000 euros -lrb- $ 66,000 -rrb- a year .
in the dresden flat share , each resident pays between 270 to 390 euros rent to a real estate developer who renovated the apartment . " in a flat share , people do just fine with their own money , they 're able to manage , " said sieglinde wartenberg , who arranges senior apartment shares in dresden .
" they can get by on just a little money , and age with dignity . " social connection besides the financial aspect , there 's a social element of living with others that is just as , if not more , important for older people .
one of the greatest fears of the elderly is social isolation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many seniors fear social isolation " at some point , you feel that you just are n't needed , " said irene rostalskie , 72 .
" hardly anyone has time for you anymore . " she raised six children , but one by one they moved away until she was alone in her ground-floor apartment .
one day someone broke her window and she felt not only alone , but insecure .
the flat share solves both of those problems . " it 's one of the main advantages to this living arrangement , there 's always someone there who i can ring up or go see , " said richard palm , head of the forum for communal living .
" if i 'm feeling sick , there will be someone coming and saying , should i get you a newspaper or call a doctor . " around the common table in the suite , the flatmates joke and laugh like teenagers while they offer visitors coffee and cake .
they make sure all guests write their names in a black notebook they keep ; last year , there were 47 entries .
the flatmates often take group day trips around the regions , visiting neighboring towns or going to the theater . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in a nursing home , you get old very quickly , " said sylvia behrens , who at 57 is the youngest of the group , but who suffers from parkinson 's disease and has been in several living arrangements since she was diagnosed .

they want security , comfort and social contacts ; they don ’ t want a nursing home .
senior flat shares fit that bill . on the eighth floor of a dresden high-rise , 72-year-old karl-heinz röttjer can look out from his small , one-bedroom apartment and see a good portion of the city and the hills that spill over into the czech republic .
to him , the wide-open vista represents freedom , and the new lease on life he has gotten since moving in with five retired women to share his sunset years . " here i feel much better , i can spend my time how i want , " he said .
" i feel free , and it 's like i have a family around me . " he cherishes that freedom since it was taken away from him for a while .
he was put in a nursing home after an illness made him unable to live alone anymore several years ago .
his wife had died and his children had moved away .
but for this spry , independent septuagenarian , it was like being put in prison . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young medic helps an old man " in a nursing home , you 're not your own master , " he said .
" there are rules to follow and you 've subject to strict schedules .
everything 's planned out and you feel almost trapped . " so he escaped , not by climbing out an open window , but by answering an ad for a living arrangement that experts say could become a common alternative for older people in the future : a senior flat share .
not long after , he moved into the specially modified suite of apartments and has n't looked back . communal living but privacy , too the senior flat share , however , is generally not like the basic college-age roommate situation .
röttjer has his own apartment with a kitchen and bathroom , as does each of his five flatmates .
they provide privacy and independence which are important to older people . but there is also a common room with comfortable furniture , a dining table and a tv , plus a communal kitchen and dining table where people can prepare and eat shared meals if they want .
the dresden suite also has a large bathroom that has been outfitted with special aid devices for when age makes getting around , or in and out of the bathtub , more difficult . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are at least 200 similar experiments in senior living across germany as the older generation rethinks how they want to live out their sunset years and more are popping up all the time . the senior living arrangement was even the topic of a reality tv show on the german-french channel arte , which brought five women between 60 and 70 together in a berlin apartment and followed the ups and downs of their new lives there .
surveys have found that more than two-thirds of people now over the age of 40 have no interest in going into an old age home in the future . " my generation does not want to go into these so-called social institutions for old , helpless people , " said heike grünewald , who heads projekt 50 plus , a berlin-based group which tries to match up seniors and communal living arrangements .
" we do not want the state looking after us .
besides , the state will not have any money to do it , so we have to look after ourselves . " greying society germany 's older population is set to skyrocket over the next decades .
demographers forecast that by 2050 , more than one in three germans will be over 60 .
while most european societies are getting older , in 30 years , due to low birth rates and longer life spans , it is predicted that germany will have the oldest population in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " that means we have to look at and encourage these different models of senior living , " said irmingard schewe-gerigk , a parliamentarian for the green party who looks at aging issues . germany 's system for financing care for older people is fast running short of cash .
the government pays for part or all of nursing home care , which is expensive , so it 's beginning to show interest in the alternatives .
one study has shown that having a senior in an apartment share can save the government more than 51,000 euros -lrb- $ 66,000 -rrb- a year .
in the dresden flat share , each resident pays between 270 to 390 euros rent to a real estate developer who renovated the apartment . " in a flat share , people do just fine with their own money , they 're able to manage , " said sieglinde wartenberg , who arranges senior apartment shares in dresden .
" they can get by on just a little money , and age with dignity . " social connection besides the financial aspect , there 's a social element of living with others that is just as , if not more , important for older people .
one of the greatest fears of the elderly is social isolation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many seniors fear social isolation " at some point , you feel that you just are n't needed , " said irene rostalskie , 72 .
" hardly anyone has time for you anymore . " she raised six children , but one by one they moved away until she was alone in her ground-floor apartment .
one day someone broke her window and she felt not only alone , but insecure .
the flat share solves both of those problems . " it 's one of the main advantages to this living arrangement , there 's always someone there who i can ring up or go see , " said richard palm , head of the forum for communal living .
" if i 'm feeling sick , there will be someone coming and saying , should i get you a newspaper or call a doctor . " around the common table in the suite , the flatmates joke and laugh like teenagers while they offer visitors coffee and cake .
they make sure all guests write their names in a black notebook they keep ; last year , there were 47 entries .
the flatmates often take group day trips around the regions , visiting neighboring towns or going to the theater . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in a nursing home , you get old very quickly , " said sylvia behrens , who at 57 is the youngest of the group , but who suffers from parkinson 's disease and has been in several living arrangements since she was diagnosed . " here , you feel young again , " she said . kyle james , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a germany without children ?
germany is waking up to the fact that a demographic revolution is underway .
not only are people living longer , but germans are having fewer babies , meaning the population is both shrinking and ageing .

it might soon be illegal .
several politicians want to ban smoking behind the wheel , saying it ’ s a distraction and increases the risk of having an accident . " the dangers of causing an accident rise drastically when you smoke and drive , " peter danckert of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- told the best-selling newspaper bild .
" i want a complete ban on smoking for drivers . " danckert was joined in his push for smoke-free driving by several politicians on the other side of the political spectrum .
katherina reiche of the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- also told bild she wanted to put an end to puffing behind the wheel .
she noted that parliament had already passed a law outlawing the use of cell phones for drivers , and that she and others want to push for similar legislation regarding mobile phones . " cigarettes are just as much of a distraction as cell phones , " she said .
" we urgently need ban on them along with fines . " another conservative politician , gerlinde kaupa , a health policy expert for the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , backed the anti-smoking proposal . according to bild , accident researchers found that a car going 50 kilometers -lrb- 31 miles -rrb- an hour continues to travel 14 meters -lrb- 16 yards -rrb- per second while a driver searches for a cigarette that has fallen out of his or her hand . the road safety organization traffic watch welcomed the proposal . " driving demands the driver 's 100-percent attention and any kind of distraction presents a danger , " said the organization 's director , michael hartje .
he criticized the presence of ashtrays and drink holders that he said turn driving into a " sideline job . " government against the idea but germany 's transport ministry does n't see the issue in quite so serious terms and has rejected the idea of putting a legal ban in place . " there is no scientific proof that smoking drastically increases the risk of having an accident , " said a ministry spokeswoman .
she added that such legislation would be a case of " overregulation . " her boss agreed .
manfred stolpe , the transport minister , said the proposal would do nothing to increase traffic safety . germany 's largest automotive club , adac , also dismissed the idea . " eating chocolate bars , bananas or fish sandwiches while driving is also dangerous , " said the group 's spokesman , rainer hillgärtner . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans agree to curb smoking moving to protect non-smokers in germany , the federal government and the country 's association of hotels and restaurants have signed an agreement which obliges owners to create non-smoking sections for their customers .

and on tuesday , the opening day of the congress , desperate doctors took their protest to the streets of german capital .
among them was ravindra gujullah , an indian-born general practitioner in the town of landsberg . " when you become a doctor , you have such zeal to be a good doctor and to serve people , " gujullah said .
" but these things are not so important today .
now , you have to fight just to survive . " medical brain drain german hospitals are coming under increasing pressure to cut costs , and are seeking concessions from their medical staff .
doctors working in hospitals are paid roughly the same salary as an elementary school teacher , despite having to endure work weeks that often amount to more than 60 hours . in recent years , hospitals have cut staff numbers , holiday pay and christmas bonuses in an attempt to meet government demands for more efficiency .
the president of the german medical association , jörg dietrich hoppe , has predicted that more and more well-trained doctors will seek better-paid jobs in the pharmaceutical industry , or even leave germany for better opportunities abroad . " our young doctors do n't see any prospects for advancement and better pay in german clinics , " hoppe said .

consumer advocate thomas isenburg accused the government of making savings on the back of patients . " patients fall by the wayside in a health machinery subject to cost-cutting and maximizing efficiency , " isenburg said .
" more than 15,000 people die in germany every year due to medical mistakes and faulty treatment , which is why it 's important for german doctors to find ways at this congress to avoid such mistakes and reduce the cost pressure .
a good health service can not be had for nothing . " in a speech on tuesday to open the annual congress , health minister ulla schmidt vowed that affordable treatment for all would remain the german government 's ultimate goal .
but in view of an ageing population on the one hand and the rapid advancement of medical science on the other , more efficiency was inevitable , schmidt said . uwe hessler -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de young german dentists head north poor prospects in germany and an eu labor market that makes mobility easy has increased the incidence of " brain drain , " where specialists leave home to work abroad .

and on tuesday , the opening day of the congress , desperate doctors took their protest to the streets of german capital .
among them was ravindra gujullah , an indian-born general practitioner in the town of landsberg . " when you become a doctor , you have such zeal to be a good doctor and to serve people , " gujullah said .
" but these things are not so important today .
now , you have to fight just to survive . " medical brain drain german hospitals are coming under increasing pressure to cut costs , and are seeking concessions from their medical staff .
doctors working in hospitals are paid roughly the same salary as an elementary school teacher , despite having to endure work weeks that often amount to more than 60 hours . in recent years , hospitals have cut staff numbers , holiday pay and christmas bonuses in an attempt to meet government demands for more efficiency .
the president of the german medical association , jörg dietrich hoppe , has predicted that more and more well-trained doctors will seek better-paid jobs in the pharmaceutical industry , or even leave germany for better opportunities abroad . " our young doctors do n't see any prospects for advancement and better pay in german clinics , " hoppe said .
" headhunters , especially from britain , are currently looking for german doctors - specialists in particular - and offering them wages that are three times as high , plus working hours that do n't go beyond 50 hours a week . " patients bearing the brunt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : federal health minister ulla schmidt is overseeing germany 's health services reform .
experts are warning of a severe crisis in health services as the brain drain is already leaving rural regions in economically depressed eastern germany without enough doctors .
consumer advocate thomas isenburg accused the government of making savings on the back of patients . " patients fall by the wayside in a health machinery subject to cost-cutting and maximizing efficiency , " isenburg said .
" more than 15,000 people die in germany every year due to medical mistakes and faulty treatment , which is why it 's important for german doctors to find ways at this congress to avoid such mistakes and reduce the cost pressure .
a good health service can not be had for nothing . " in a speech on tuesday to open the annual congress , health minister ulla schmidt vowed that affordable treatment for all would remain the german government 's ultimate goal .
but in view of an ageing population on the one hand and the rapid advancement of medical science on the other , more efficiency was inevitable , schmidt said . uwe hessler -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de young german dentists head north poor prospects in germany and an eu labor market that makes mobility easy has increased the incidence of " brain drain , " where specialists leave home to work abroad .

they want security , comfort and social contacts ; they don ’ t want a nursing home .
senior flat shares fit that bill . on the eighth floor of a dresden high-rise , 72-year-old karl-heinz röttjer can look out from his small , one-bedroom apartment and see a good portion of the city and the hills that spill over into the czech republic .
to him , the wide-open vista represents freedom , and the new lease on life he has gotten since moving in with five retired women to share his sunset years . " here i feel much better , i can spend my time how i want , " he said .
" i feel free , and it 's like i have a family around me . " he cherishes that freedom since it was taken away from him for a while .
he was put in a nursing home after an illness made him unable to live alone anymore several years ago .
his wife had died and his children had moved away .
but for this spry , independent septuagenarian , it was like being put in prison . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young medic helps an old man " in a nursing home , you 're not your own master , " he said .
" there are rules to follow and you 've subject to strict schedules .
everything 's planned out and you feel almost trapped . " so he escaped , not by climbing out an open window , but by answering an ad for a living arrangement that experts say could become a common alternative for older people in the future : a senior flat share .
not long after , he moved into the specially modified suite of apartments and has n't looked back . communal living but privacy , too the senior flat share , however , is generally not like the basic college-age roommate situation .
röttjer has his own apartment with a kitchen and bathroom , as does each of his five flatmates .
they provide privacy and independence which are important to older people . but there is also a common room with comfortable furniture , a dining table and a tv , plus a communal kitchen and dining table where people can prepare and eat shared meals if they want .
the dresden suite also has a large bathroom that has been outfitted with special aid devices for when age makes getting around , or in and out of the bathtub , more difficult . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are at least 200 similar experiments in senior living across germany as the older generation rethinks how they want to live out their sunset years and more are popping up all the time . the senior living arrangement was even the topic of a reality tv show on the german-french channel arte , which brought five women between 60 and 70 together in a berlin apartment and followed the ups and downs of their new lives there .
surveys have found that more than two-thirds of people now over the age of 40 have no interest in going into an old age home in the future . " my generation does not want to go into these so-called social institutions for old , helpless people , " said heike grünewald , who heads projekt 50 plus , a berlin-based group which tries to match up seniors and communal living arrangements .
" we do not want the state looking after us .
besides , the state will not have any money to do it , so we have to look after ourselves . " greying society germany 's older population is set to skyrocket over the next decades .

the government pays for part or all of nursing home care , which is expensive , so it 's beginning to show interest in the alternatives .
one study has shown that having a senior in an apartment share can save the government more than 51,000 euros -lrb- $ 66,000 -rrb- a year .
in the dresden flat share , each resident pays between 270 to 390 euros rent to a real estate developer who renovated the apartment . " in a flat share , people do just fine with their own money , they 're able to manage , " said sieglinde wartenberg , who arranges senior apartment shares in dresden .
" they can get by on just a little money , and age with dignity . " social connection besides the financial aspect , there 's a social element of living with others that is just as , if not more , important for older people .

they want security , comfort and social contacts ; they don ’ t want a nursing home .
senior flat shares fit that bill . on the eighth floor of a dresden high-rise , 72-year-old karl-heinz röttjer can look out from his small , one-bedroom apartment and see a good portion of the city and the hills that spill over into the czech republic .
to him , the wide-open vista represents freedom , and the new lease on life he has gotten since moving in with five retired women to share his sunset years . " here i feel much better , i can spend my time how i want , " he said .
" i feel free , and it 's like i have a family around me . " he cherishes that freedom since it was taken away from him for a while .
he was put in a nursing home after an illness made him unable to live alone anymore several years ago .
his wife had died and his children had moved away .
but for this spry , independent septuagenarian , it was like being put in prison . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young medic helps an old man " in a nursing home , you 're not your own master , " he said .
" there are rules to follow and you 've subject to strict schedules .
everything 's planned out and you feel almost trapped . " so he escaped , not by climbing out an open window , but by answering an ad for a living arrangement that experts say could become a common alternative for older people in the future : a senior flat share .
not long after , he moved into the specially modified suite of apartments and has n't looked back . communal living but privacy , too the senior flat share , however , is generally not like the basic college-age roommate situation .
röttjer has his own apartment with a kitchen and bathroom , as does each of his five flatmates .
they provide privacy and independence which are important to older people . but there is also a common room with comfortable furniture , a dining table and a tv , plus a communal kitchen and dining table where people can prepare and eat shared meals if they want .
the dresden suite also has a large bathroom that has been outfitted with special aid devices for when age makes getting around , or in and out of the bathtub , more difficult . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are at least 200 similar experiments in senior living across germany as the older generation rethinks how they want to live out their sunset years and more are popping up all the time . the senior living arrangement was even the topic of a reality tv show on the german-french channel arte , which brought five women between 60 and 70 together in a berlin apartment and followed the ups and downs of their new lives there .
surveys have found that more than two-thirds of people now over the age of 40 have no interest in going into an old age home in the future . " my generation does not want to go into these so-called social institutions for old , helpless people , " said heike grünewald , who heads projekt 50 plus , a berlin-based group which tries to match up seniors and communal living arrangements .
" we do not want the state looking after us .
besides , the state will not have any money to do it , so we have to look after ourselves . " greying society germany 's older population is set to skyrocket over the next decades .
demographers forecast that by 2050 , more than one in three germans will be over 60 .
while most european societies are getting older , in 30 years , due to low birth rates and longer life spans , it is predicted that germany will have the oldest population in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " that means we have to look at and encourage these different models of senior living , " said irmingard schewe-gerigk , a parliamentarian for the green party who looks at aging issues . germany 's system for financing care for older people is fast running short of cash .
the government pays for part or all of nursing home care , which is expensive , so it 's beginning to show interest in the alternatives .
one study has shown that having a senior in an apartment share can save the government more than 51,000 euros -lrb- $ 66,000 -rrb- a year .
in the dresden flat share , each resident pays between 270 to 390 euros rent to a real estate developer who renovated the apartment . " in a flat share , people do just fine with their own money , they 're able to manage , " said sieglinde wartenberg , who arranges senior apartment shares in dresden .
" they can get by on just a little money , and age with dignity . " social connection besides the financial aspect , there 's a social element of living with others that is just as , if not more , important for older people .
one of the greatest fears of the elderly is social isolation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many seniors fear social isolation " at some point , you feel that you just are n't needed , " said irene rostalskie , 72 .
" hardly anyone has time for you anymore . " she raised six children , but one by one they moved away until she was alone in her ground-floor apartment .
one day someone broke her window and she felt not only alone , but insecure .
the flat share solves both of those problems . " it 's one of the main advantages to this living arrangement , there 's always someone there who i can ring up or go see , " said richard palm , head of the forum for communal living .
" if i 'm feeling sick , there will be someone coming and saying , should i get you a newspaper or call a doctor . " around the common table in the suite , the flatmates joke and laugh like teenagers while they offer visitors coffee and cake .
they make sure all guests write their names in a black notebook they keep ; last year , there were 47 entries .

" this year 's ' march of the living ' will be the largest ever , with 18,000 to 20,000 people coming to auschwitz on may 5 , which is holocaust remembrance day , " the event 's director aaron tamir told reporters in warsaw last week .
" it is going to be a huge and complicated event because this year marks the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz-birkenau and death camps in other countries , and the whole world is paying attention , " tamir said . at least 1.1 million men , women and children , most of them jews , died at auschwitz-birkenau , one of the key extermination sites for nazi germany 's " final solution , " which aimed to wipe out europe 's 11 million jews .
the nazis succeeded in exterminating six million european jews , half of them from poland , home to europe 's largest jewish community before world war ii . israeli prime minister ariel sharon , his polish counterpart marek belka and prime minister ferenc gyurcsany of hungary , which lost 450,000 jews at auschwitz , will be among dignitaries who will attend the event .
sharon was " unlikely to march , " the organizers told afp .
march of the living bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young israeli participants at the nazi auschwitz-birkenau death camp during the march of the living in 2002 .
in light of the huge numbers taking part this year , the organizers have arranged for thousands of people to set off thursday morning for the three-kilometer -lrb- two-mile -rrb- walk from the train station at oswiecim - the polish town which tragically gave its germanized name to the auschwitz camp - to the birkenau sector of the death camp .
the main march , which will group around 10,000 people , including many international officials , will leave from the original camp at auschwitz in the early afternoon . " we 've hired six special trains to bring participants to oswiecim , " tamir said . auschwitz was set up by the nazis in 1940 on the site of a former polish army barracks on the outskirts of oswiecim and expanded later to the village of brzezinka - birkenau in german - three kilometers away , to allow hitler 's germany to more efficiently kill jews , sinti , roma , poles and others considered inferior human beings . at birkenau , near the rubble of two interconnecting gas chambers and crematoria the marchers will gather in mid-afternoon for a memorial ceremony , held near the train track that carried jews and other deportees to almost certain death more than 60 years ago .
the camp was liberated on jan .
27 , 1945 by soviet troops . belka , sharon , professor , writer and former auschwitz inmate elie wiesel will be among those to give speeches to the gathering , which this year will include as many holocaust survivors and their descendants as possible , according to tamir .
countering holocaust deniers " the survivors will not be with us forever , and when they are gone , it will be easier for those who deny the holocaust to spread untruths , " tamir said .
" the idea for the march came some 20 years ago when there were voices saying the holocaust never existed , " he said .
the denials " were heard by students and young people around the world and the founders of the march of the living decided the best way to stop the debate was to bring youths from all countries to see with their own eyes what happened .

from its start in 1988 , when it gathered small groups of young jewish people , the march of the living has grown to include " adults , survivors , students , youngsters , pupils " and , for the past few years , non-jews . " our project is to take people ' from holocaust to revival , " ' tamir said . some participants come to poland just for the day of the march while others spend a week in the central european country , which lost six million civilians in world war ii , half of them jews , visiting sites linked to the holocaust . " participants see and feel the holocaust with their own eyes , " tamir said .
" then many young people fly to israel for the ' revival ' part of our project .

it might soon be illegal .
several politicians want to ban smoking behind the wheel , saying it ’ s a distraction and increases the risk of having an accident . " the dangers of causing an accident rise drastically when you smoke and drive , " peter danckert of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- told the best-selling newspaper bild .
" i want a complete ban on smoking for drivers . " danckert was joined in his push for smoke-free driving by several politicians on the other side of the political spectrum .
katherina reiche of the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- also told bild she wanted to put an end to puffing behind the wheel .
she noted that parliament had already passed a law outlawing the use of cell phones for drivers , and that she and others want to push for similar legislation regarding mobile phones . " cigarettes are just as much of a distraction as cell phones , " she said .
" we urgently need ban on them along with fines . " another conservative politician , gerlinde kaupa , a health policy expert for the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , backed the anti-smoking proposal . according to bild , accident researchers found that a car going 50 kilometers -lrb- 31 miles -rrb- an hour continues to travel 14 meters -lrb- 16 yards -rrb- per second while a driver searches for a cigarette that has fallen out of his or her hand . the road safety organization traffic watch welcomed the proposal . " driving demands the driver 's 100-percent attention and any kind of distraction presents a danger , " said the organization 's director , michael hartje .
he criticized the presence of ashtrays and drink holders that he said turn driving into a " sideline job . " government against the idea but germany 's transport ministry does n't see the issue in quite so serious terms and has rejected the idea of putting a legal ban in place . " there is no scientific proof that smoking drastically increases the risk of having an accident , " said a ministry spokeswoman .

several politicians want to ban smoking behind the wheel , saying it ’ s a distraction and increases the risk of having an accident . " the dangers of causing an accident rise drastically when you smoke and drive , " peter danckert of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- told the best-selling newspaper bild .
" i want a complete ban on smoking for drivers . " danckert was joined in his push for smoke-free driving by several politicians on the other side of the political spectrum .
katherina reiche of the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- also told bild she wanted to put an end to puffing behind the wheel .
she noted that parliament had already passed a law outlawing the use of cell phones for drivers , and that she and others want to push for similar legislation regarding mobile phones . " cigarettes are just as much of a distraction as cell phones , " she said .
" we urgently need ban on them along with fines . " another conservative politician , gerlinde kaupa , a health policy expert for the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , backed the anti-smoking proposal . according to bild , accident researchers found that a car going 50 kilometers -lrb- 31 miles -rrb- an hour continues to travel 14 meters -lrb- 16 yards -rrb- per second while a driver searches for a cigarette that has fallen out of his or her hand . the road safety organization traffic watch welcomed the proposal . " driving demands the driver 's 100-percent attention and any kind of distraction presents a danger , " said the organization 's director , michael hartje .
he criticized the presence of ashtrays and drink holders that he said turn driving into a " sideline job . " government against the idea but germany 's transport ministry does n't see the issue in quite so serious terms and has rejected the idea of putting a legal ban in place . " there is no scientific proof that smoking drastically increases the risk of having an accident , " said a ministry spokeswoman .

" this year 's ' march of the living ' will be the largest ever , with 18,000 to 20,000 people coming to auschwitz on may 5 , which is holocaust remembrance day , " the event 's director aaron tamir told reporters in warsaw last week .
" it is going to be a huge and complicated event because this year marks the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz-birkenau and death camps in other countries , and the whole world is paying attention , " tamir said . at least 1.1 million men , women and children , most of them jews , died at auschwitz-birkenau , one of the key extermination sites for nazi germany 's " final solution , " which aimed to wipe out europe 's 11 million jews .
the nazis succeeded in exterminating six million european jews , half of them from poland , home to europe 's largest jewish community before world war ii . israeli prime minister ariel sharon , his polish counterpart marek belka and prime minister ferenc gyurcsany of hungary , which lost 450,000 jews at auschwitz , will be among dignitaries who will attend the event .
sharon was " unlikely to march , " the organizers told afp .
march of the living bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young israeli participants at the nazi auschwitz-birkenau death camp during the march of the living in 2002 .
in light of the huge numbers taking part this year , the organizers have arranged for thousands of people to set off thursday morning for the three-kilometer -lrb- two-mile -rrb- walk from the train station at oswiecim - the polish town which tragically gave its germanized name to the auschwitz camp - to the birkenau sector of the death camp .
the main march , which will group around 10,000 people , including many international officials , will leave from the original camp at auschwitz in the early afternoon . " we 've hired six special trains to bring participants to oswiecim , " tamir said . auschwitz was set up by the nazis in 1940 on the site of a former polish army barracks on the outskirts of oswiecim and expanded later to the village of brzezinka - birkenau in german - three kilometers away , to allow hitler 's germany to more efficiently kill jews , sinti , roma , poles and others considered inferior human beings . at birkenau , near the rubble of two interconnecting gas chambers and crematoria the marchers will gather in mid-afternoon for a memorial ceremony , held near the train track that carried jews and other deportees to almost certain death more than 60 years ago .
the camp was liberated on jan .
27 , 1945 by soviet troops . belka , sharon , professor , writer and former auschwitz inmate elie wiesel will be among those to give speeches to the gathering , which this year will include as many holocaust survivors and their descendants as possible , according to tamir .
countering holocaust deniers " the survivors will not be with us forever , and when they are gone , it will be easier for those who deny the holocaust to spread untruths , " tamir said .
" the idea for the march came some 20 years ago when there were voices saying the holocaust never existed , " he said .
the denials " were heard by students and young people around the world and the founders of the march of the living decided the best way to stop the debate was to bring youths from all countries to see with their own eyes what happened .

from its start in 1988 , when it gathered small groups of young jewish people , the march of the living has grown to include " adults , survivors , students , youngsters , pupils " and , for the past few years , non-jews . " our project is to take people ' from holocaust to revival , " ' tamir said . some participants come to poland just for the day of the march while others spend a week in the central european country , which lost six million civilians in world war ii , half of them jews , visiting sites linked to the holocaust . " participants see and feel the holocaust with their own eyes , " tamir said .

" this year 's ' march of the living ' will be the largest ever , with 18,000 to 20,000 people coming to auschwitz on may 5 , which is holocaust remembrance day , " the event 's director aaron tamir told reporters in warsaw last week .
" it is going to be a huge and complicated event because this year marks the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz-birkenau and death camps in other countries , and the whole world is paying attention , " tamir said . at least 1.1 million men , women and children , most of them jews , died at auschwitz-birkenau , one of the key extermination sites for nazi germany 's " final solution , " which aimed to wipe out europe 's 11 million jews .
the nazis succeeded in exterminating six million european jews , half of them from poland , home to europe 's largest jewish community before world war ii . israeli prime minister ariel sharon , his polish counterpart marek belka and prime minister ferenc gyurcsany of hungary , which lost 450,000 jews at auschwitz , will be among dignitaries who will attend the event .
sharon was " unlikely to march , " the organizers told afp .
march of the living bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young israeli participants at the nazi auschwitz-birkenau death camp during the march of the living in 2002 .
in light of the huge numbers taking part this year , the organizers have arranged for thousands of people to set off thursday morning for the three-kilometer -lrb- two-mile -rrb- walk from the train station at oswiecim - the polish town which tragically gave its germanized name to the auschwitz camp - to the birkenau sector of the death camp .
the main march , which will group around 10,000 people , including many international officials , will leave from the original camp at auschwitz in the early afternoon . " we 've hired six special trains to bring participants to oswiecim , " tamir said . auschwitz was set up by the nazis in 1940 on the site of a former polish army barracks on the outskirts of oswiecim and expanded later to the village of brzezinka - birkenau in german - three kilometers away , to allow hitler 's germany to more efficiently kill jews , sinti , roma , poles and others considered inferior human beings . at birkenau , near the rubble of two interconnecting gas chambers and crematoria the marchers will gather in mid-afternoon for a memorial ceremony , held near the train track that carried jews and other deportees to almost certain death more than 60 years ago .

derek knee was just 22 when he was the army interpreter at the luneburg heath surrender by germany .
now , 60 years on , he is the only person still alive of the group of german and british military who stood for hours negotiating the peace in the woods .
mr knee and his wife margaret , from barry , were at the london reception .
he was a student of french and german at cambridge university who had , like so many others , become caught up in the conflict .
a whole summer spent with a family in germany had helped make him fluent in the language , but he was not fully prepared for the task handed down to him .
" my commanding officer told me go down to montgomery 's office .
he did n't say what for but that was the nature of the army , was n't it ?
you just did what you were told , " said the former intelligence officer .
cognac mr knee found himself in the middle of the woods at luneburg heath , the only person who could understand both the field marshal and the three-man german delegation .
montgomery was demanding an unconditional surrender and the german officers said they were not qualified to offer it .
mr knee said : " it occupied all of the morning and when we arrived towards lunchtime , montgomery said -lrb- to the germans -rrb- ' we 're obviously not making any progress .
you had better go and talk about this and i will give you lunch . '
" montgomery gave them a good lunch - a bottle of wine and even a glass of cognac each to make sure they were in a good mood when they came back " .
after lunch , the peace talks moved inside to montgomery 's impressive carpeted tent , complete with flowers on the table .
with the aid of maps , the british officers impressed on the germans the extent to which the russians were also advancing on their forces from the east .
" they explained they did not have the authority to negotiate this unconditional surrender but if montgomery insisted they would go back to their hq and get permission from doenitz , the new leader of the german people , hitler having died days before , " said mr knee .
derek knee , pointing , lays down the terms of the surrender " they came back on the second day with an extra delegate and said that doenitz had agreed . "
the all-important surrender document , the first of three around europe , was eventually signed at 1830 bst on 4 may , 1945 mr knee added : " montgomery had insisted on drawing up a second surrender document .
he was very strict about it .
" the only thing was there was a mistake on it in the date , which he had to scribble out and correct " .
a couple of weeks later mr knee was one of the contingent who went to arrest doenitz and the rest of the german government in flensburg .
he witnessed friedeburg , one of the three who had signed the peace agreement , committing suicide with a cyanide pill .
after the war , mr knee returned to cambridge and , abandoning his languages degree , studied economics instead and went on with wife margaret , whom he had met before the war in barry , to travel widely advising the principal department stores in europe .
the couple joined around 100 veterans at the victory in europe reception at the imperial war museum in london on wednesday .
mr knee has never been able to forget his role in the luneburg surrender and has regularly been asked to receptions marking the war , and has become a prominent interviewee for war events .
" i would n't want to forget , of course , but to be honest the memories are fading , " he said .

derek knee was just 22 when he was the army interpreter at the luneburg heath surrender by germany .
now , 60 years on , he is the only person still alive of the group of german and british military who stood for hours negotiating the peace in the woods .
mr knee and his wife margaret , from barry , were at the london reception .
he was a student of french and german at cambridge university who had , like so many others , become caught up in the conflict .
a whole summer spent with a family in germany had helped make him fluent in the language , but he was not fully prepared for the task handed down to him .
" my commanding officer told me go down to montgomery 's office .
he did n't say what for but that was the nature of the army , was n't it ?
you just did what you were told , " said the former intelligence officer .
cognac mr knee found himself in the middle of the woods at luneburg heath , the only person who could understand both the field marshal and the three-man german delegation .
montgomery was demanding an unconditional surrender and the german officers said they were not qualified to offer it .
mr knee said : " it occupied all of the morning and when we arrived towards lunchtime , montgomery said -lrb- to the germans -rrb- ' we 're obviously not making any progress .
you had better go and talk about this and i will give you lunch . '
" montgomery gave them a good lunch - a bottle of wine and even a glass of cognac each to make sure they were in a good mood when they came back " .
after lunch , the peace talks moved inside to montgomery 's impressive carpeted tent , complete with flowers on the table .
with the aid of maps , the british officers impressed on the germans the extent to which the russians were also advancing on their forces from the east .
" they explained they did not have the authority to negotiate this unconditional surrender but if montgomery insisted they would go back to their hq and get permission from doenitz , the new leader of the german people , hitler having died days before , " said mr knee .
derek knee , pointing , lays down the terms of the surrender " they came back on the second day with an extra delegate and said that doenitz had agreed . "
the all-important surrender document , the first of three around europe , was eventually signed at 1830 bst on 4 may , 1945 mr knee added : " montgomery had insisted on drawing up a second surrender document .
he was very strict about it .
" the only thing was there was a mistake on it in the date , which he had to scribble out and correct " .
a couple of weeks later mr knee was one of the contingent who went to arrest doenitz and the rest of the german government in flensburg .
he witnessed friedeburg , one of the three who had signed the peace agreement , committing suicide with a cyanide pill .
after the war , mr knee returned to cambridge and , abandoning his languages degree , studied economics instead and went on with wife margaret , whom he had met before the war in barry , to travel widely advising the principal department stores in europe .
the couple joined around 100 veterans at the victory in europe reception at the imperial war museum in london on wednesday .

rallying supporters in kent , mr howard promised his party would deliver real action on the people 's priorities .
earlier he continued touring marginal constituencies , saying the tories offered a " better , brighter britain " .
labour says tories would put jobs at risk while charles kennedy has branded them " the party of the past " .
' positive change ' as he campaigned in tamworth , staffordshire , mr howard argued voters could choose for things to stay as they were or vote for " positive change " .
he then headed to loughborough in leicestershire and rushden in the wellingborough constituency - number 29 on the conservative target seat list .
they were all seats the tories have to win if they are to make a comeback .
he concluded his tour with a rally in his constituency of folkestone and hythe , where he was told his football club , liverpool , had reached the champions league final .
deadlines for tory priorities 9 may : end requirement for police to fill out a form when they stop someone 6 june : matrons to be responsible for cleaner hospitals 1 dec : heads to get final say on expulsions 1 april 2006 : discount of £ 500 for pensioners ' new council tax bills 6 april 2006:24-hour border surveillance covering 35 ports of entry 6 april 2006 : stamp duty abolished on houses up to £ 250,000 1 sep 2006 : scrapping university tuition fees 31 dec 2006 : uk border control police to tackle illegal immigration " this is obviously going to be a great night and a great week , " he said .
mr howard explained how he had rejoined frontline politics because of his anger about the state of public services , especially the nhs .
urging people to vote conservative , he said : " you can take a stand in two days time , you can put an end to a failing , discredited government , you can give our country hope again . "
in an interview with gmtv earlier , mr howard defended his party 's campaign tactics - particularly the decision to brand tony blair a liar .
labour and the lib dems have both attacked the tories ' campaigning as negative .
mr howard insisted that he would not have run his campaign any differently and rejected suggestions he now regretted denigrating the prime minister personally .
" what do you think is worse - calling someone a liar or taking us to a war on a lie ? " he said .
he continued to shrug off labour 's consistent poll lead , insisting he had not thought about the future if he failed to win .
" it is not the polls or the pollsters who are going to decide this election , it is real people out there , " he said .
mr howard also defended his party 's plans to process asylum claims in a third country , in an interview with bbc radio 4 's today programme .
priority tasks he said he had a list of possible countries in mind but would said it would not be " reasonable " to name them until he was in government and had started negotiation .
in a labour rally in huddersfield , mr blair claimed the tories had not proposed a serious programme for the government .
borrowing a conservative campaign slogan , he urged voters to " send a message " that they did not want the tories back in power .
for the lib dems , charles kennedy said it was his party which was providing the policies attractive to the public while the conservatives could not win the election .

on tuesday , new york 's benchmark oil price fell almost 3 % to $ 49.50 a barrel , with london 's brent crude closing down 1.1 % at $ 50.52 .
the trend could persist on wednesday as the us puts out stock figures expected to show strong growth in oil supplies .
but overall prices remain close to record levels , which have raised fears of damage to the us and world economy .
' anticipation ' the growth in supply , both in the us and from opec , comes as the world 's biggest oil markets head for the less thirsty summer season .
opec members in particular , pledged to bump up production , are boosting output in preparation for when demand soars again late in the year .
" we are allowing inventory levels to build in anticipation of the heating season , " said adel al-jubeir , foreign affairs advisor to the saudi government , in an interview with reuters .
following a promised production increase earlier this year , opec now says that its 10 quota-bound members are pumping 29.7 million barrels a day , 2 million above their quota .
a slowing of demand from factories in europe and the us has also helped moderate prices .
but one key factor in the 9 % decline in us oil prices in the past week is growing concern about the health of the world economy .
growth in the us proved slower at the start of 2005 than some had predicted , while an increase in us interest rates on tuesday to 3 % could also depress demand .

officials said they were confident they could prevent a major outbreak .
indonesia has begun a programme of vaccinating millions of children in the west java region , where the disease was first found in an infant girl .
the second case , in the same area , was found in an 18-month-old boy .
the virus is thought to have come from africa .
polio is a waterborne disease which usually infects young children by attacking the nervous system .
it causes paralysis and muscular atrophy , and there is no cure .
dr umar achmadi , head of communicable disease control for the indonesian health ministry , said officials had investigated the region for further infection in the wake of the first case .
" we found six other cases of paralysis , we confirmed one more additional case , and five turned out negative , " he said .
" i got the test results this morning . "
polio vaccination rates across indonesia as a whole stand at about 90 % , but in western java the rate has been around 55 % .
authorities have now launched a drive to immunise five million children in the area .
nigerian origins the infection of a 20-month-old girl , which indonesia announced on tuesday , was the country 's first recorded case of polio in almost a decade .
dna tests done on a viral sample from the infant girl has determined the polio arrived in indonesia from nigeria , via saudi arabia .
experts suspect the strain could have been carried by migrant workers or pilgrims visiting muslim holy sites in saudi arabia .
dr achmadi said he was " 99 % sure " the same viral strain had affected the baby boy .
the disease has all but disappeared in the developed world , but it is still endemic in nigeria , a problem that was made worse in 2003 when muslim clerics there spread rumours that the polio vaccine had been contaminated to make muslims infertile .
until the middle of last century , when a vaccine was discovered , polio was endemic across the globe , and the international campaign for universal vaccination has been one of the great successes in the fight against disease of recent years .
