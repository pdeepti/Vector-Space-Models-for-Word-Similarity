after the successful start of germany 's long troubled highway toll system for heavy commercial trucks , suggestions are already being made to expand the satellite-based technology to surface streets and normal cars . following a number of mishaps , germany 's high-tech toll system finally went into operation this week . held up for 16 months , the delay cost the german government billions in lost revenues .
but there were no major glitches on the country 's autobahns as had been feared , encouraging some politicians to consider how to widen the system 's reach . bavarian interior minister günther beckstein this week asked the federal government to collect the truck toll on some non-highway streets that could be possibly used by drivers to avoid paying the levy .
" the introduction of the toll can not be at the expense of residents on national roadways and of traffic safety , " beckstein said according to german news agency dpa . technically , there is nothing standing in the way of expanding the satellite toll system to other streets - at least not eventually .
currently the system is running on a slimmed-down version of the software that connects the trucks ' onboard units to the central computers of operator toll collect . the repeated delays were a major embarrassment for toll collect - the consortium made up of automaker daimlerchrysler , deutsche telekom and french motorway operator cofiroute .
but the successful start this year has opened the door to future possibilities for the pioneering system .

a user is only charged for the exact distance driven . " they picked the toll collect system exactly because it is a very flexible one , " markus friedrich from the institute for street and traffic studies at the university of stuttgart told german ard television .
" at any time it can be expanded to other parts of the street network or the price can be changed easily . " no one is expecting the german government to begin pushing for an auto toll soon .
but , with the transport ministry strapped for cash and road projects suffering accordingly , some experts believe it is only a matter of time . " i think the toll for cars will come quickly simply due to financial reasons , " werner rothengatter from the university of karlsruhe said .
an advisor to the transport ministry , he said he expected the issue would be raised shortly after the next general election in 2006 .
rothengatter added that car owners could be co-opted to support the toll by offering compensation in the way of lower auto taxes . the german government expects about € 2.5 billion -lrb- $ 3.30 billion -rrb- in truck toll revenues each year .
but economics minister wolfgang clement also hopes the state-of-the-art system will be an export hit doing away with the old-fashioned booths that still cause traffic congestions in many other european countries . on thursday , the czech transport ministry said it planned to introduce a similar electronic toll system for trucks on the country 's highways , possibly by the end of the year . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de smooth start for german truck toll germany ’ s brand new highway toll system for heavy trucks has got off to a smooth start dispelling fears of potential traffic disasters on monday morning .

not king as in " kaiser " , but as in elvis : king of rock n ' roll .
presley spent nearly two years in germany , one of the biggest music stars to have ever been in residence here .
from 1958 to 1960 , he was assigned as a gi in the 3rd armored division to ray barracks , in the small town of friedberg near frankfurt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elvis checks in at friedberg 's ray barracks at the time , officials worried that elvis 's visit would corrupt the area 's youth .
now , the town is tapping the elvis myth to help keep itself on the tourism map .
bad nauheim and the neighboring village of friedberg were utterly dull until some local hardcore elvis fans decided to liven up things , said hans-ulrich halwe , founder and honorary chairman of the bad nauheim-friedberg elvis presley club .
elvis slept here the club was formed in 1998 by halwe and a handful of others , but has since grown to more than 200 members .
they meet once a month in the bar of the " best western hotel rosenau " , which is decked out in elvis memorabilia , and stage elvis events , and give tours of the area .
this weekend , freidberg and bad nauheim are ground zero for the celebration of the king 's 70th birthday .
along with elvis impersonators doing a las vegas revival show and a gospel concert -lrb- harking back to the king 's church music roots -rrb- , there will be an exhibit of " elvis art " and daily elvis tours featuring anecdotes about his 18-month stay .
up to 50,000 people are expected to attend , with " chartered buses coming from berlin , from belgium , everywhere , " halwe said .
anyone planning a last minute visit can pretty much forget about staying in room 10 of the grünewald hotel , though .
that 's the room in the family-run hotel where elvis slept for several weeks in 1958 , and " the only place in europe where you can sleep in the same bed elvis slept in , " halwe said .
for big events it gets booked up to a year in advance , however .
elvis pressler ?
an honored guest at the bad nauheim festivities will be karl heinz stein , elvis ’ s military barber and the ace in the hole of bad nauheim 's elvis lore .
as someone who could handle the heartthrob 's head on a regular basis -lrb- haircuts were given every eight days or so -rrb- stein was forward-thinking enough to stash away a few locks of the star ’ s hair and hang on to his scissors and combs .
these objects have since been sold , ending up in private collections or , alternately , at the museum of german history , where a reconstruction of the military barber shop in friedberg is a centerpiece of the current " elvis in germany " exhibit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the interior of the bad nauheim hair salon where elvis got a trim , now in a museum stein clearly enjoys talking about his days as barber to the king and even claimed a certain kinship with the young tennesseean .
" there was something different about elvis , he was very special .
he was so generous ... so polite , so genteel .
you could n't say the same about all of his compatriots , " said stein . " i said even then , ' its like he is really a german , like he has german blood . '
and i turned out to be right . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans hold vigil on elvis death anniversary , in front of elvis performance image stein 's feeling that the presley family came not from english but german ancestry found a supporter a few years back in the form of donald presley , a distant cousin of elvis who was researching his roots .
donald claims that elvis 's bloodline reaches back to winemakers from the rhineland palatinate region named pressler .
-lrb- with scottish and english lineage researchers also claiming elvis as their own , it is up to each branch of the presley family to fight for their versions of the truth . -rrb-
calling maybelline ...
of course , the elvis following in germany , as well as the celebration of his birth , goes well beyond the borders of bad nauheim .
the country 's oldest and largest club , founded in 1978 and with about 2,000 members , is the elvis presley gesellschaft .
the web site of the elvis club berlin lists some 33 other active elvis clubs in germany , though it is an unofficial count .
members of these clubs use the internet to keep in touch and keep informed , with messages from germans with suspiciously southern-american names -lrb- maybelline , caroline , jacky , shakey -rrb- discussing topics like the size of elvis 's jumpsuits and announcing elvis radio specials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg based elvis imitator , shelvis late night channel flippers around germany can expect to stumble across a lot of elvis movies , and anyone in a big city looking for an elvis party on friday or saturday wo n't have too much trouble finding one .
in hamburg , an elvis imitator called shelvis performs , while berlin 's estrel theater has revived its popular " an evening with elvis . "
the well-reviewed show stars versatile irish elvis tribute artist grahame patrick doyle , who estrel fished out of las vegas ' teeming elvis waters several years ago .
with his music , elvis did , indeed , help usher social disarray into german society .
but today , the aspect of the king 's persona that most seems to warm german hearts is his history as a gospel singer .
an award-winning german elvis impersonator known simply as " rio , the voice of elvis " -lrb- yes , he has had his name officially changed -rrb- will do an elvis-sings-gospel show over the weekend in friedberg 's 600-seat church .
two years ago , a similar concert sold out .
singing the gospel " the best thing about elvis is his versatility ... few people realize this , but elvis is the only white singer to win grammy awards for his gospel music , " said the 40-year-old rio , who has been doing elvis since the age of 10 .
" its amazing to play a concert and move people to tears .
any music that touches the heart , that 's gospel . "
when elvis left bad nauheim , " he said he would come back and sing for all the people who had been so good to him here , " hans-ulrich halwe said .
because elvis 's manager refused to leave the country , though , elvis never took his show abroad .
" i 'm still waiting , " added halwe with a laugh . jennifer abramsohn , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de elvis lives on in bonn forget memphis , las vegas and graceland - germany has always had a special place in its heart for elvis , and now , anyone wanting a personal glimpse of the man behind the myth need go no further than bonn .

as someone who could handle the heartthrob 's head on a regular basis -lrb- haircuts were given every eight days or so -rrb- stein was forward-thinking enough to stash away a few locks of the star ’ s hair and hang on to his scissors and combs .
these objects have since been sold , ending up in private collections or , alternately , at the museum of german history , where a reconstruction of the military barber shop in friedberg is a centerpiece of the current " elvis in germany " exhibit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the interior of the bad nauheim hair salon where elvis got a trim , now in a museum stein clearly enjoys talking about his days as barber to the king and even claimed a certain kinship with the young tennesseean .
" there was something different about elvis , he was very special .
he was so generous ... so polite , so genteel .
you could n't say the same about all of his compatriots , " said stein . " i said even then , ' its like he is really a german , like he has german blood . '

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans hold vigil on elvis death anniversary , in front of elvis performance image stein 's feeling that the presley family came not from english but german ancestry found a supporter a few years back in the form of donald presley , a distant cousin of elvis who was researching his roots .
donald claims that elvis 's bloodline reaches back to winemakers from the rhineland palatinate region named pressler .

of course , the elvis following in germany , as well as the celebration of his birth , goes well beyond the borders of bad nauheim .
the country 's oldest and largest club , founded in 1978 and with about 2,000 members , is the elvis presley gesellschaft .
the web site of the elvis club berlin lists some 33 other active elvis clubs in germany , though it is an unofficial count .
members of these clubs use the internet to keep in touch and keep informed , with messages from germans with suspiciously southern-american names -lrb- maybelline , caroline , jacky , shakey -rrb- discussing topics like the size of elvis 's jumpsuits and announcing elvis radio specials .

in hamburg , an elvis imitator called shelvis performs , while berlin 's estrel theater has revived its popular " an evening with elvis . "
the well-reviewed show stars versatile irish elvis tribute artist grahame patrick doyle , who estrel fished out of las vegas ' teeming elvis waters several years ago .
with his music , elvis did , indeed , help usher social disarray into german society .
but today , the aspect of the king 's persona that most seems to warm german hearts is his history as a gospel singer .
an award-winning german elvis impersonator known simply as " rio , the voice of elvis " -lrb- yes , he has had his name officially changed -rrb- will do an elvis-sings-gospel show over the weekend in friedberg 's 600-seat church .
two years ago , a similar concert sold out .
singing the gospel " the best thing about elvis is his versatility ... few people realize this , but elvis is the only white singer to win grammy awards for his gospel music , " said the 40-year-old rio , who has been doing elvis since the age of 10 .
" its amazing to play a concert and move people to tears .
any music that touches the heart , that 's gospel . "
when elvis left bad nauheim , " he said he would come back and sing for all the people who had been so good to him here , " hans-ulrich halwe said .
because elvis 's manager refused to leave the country , though , elvis never took his show abroad .

not king as in " kaiser " , but as in elvis : king of rock n ' roll .
presley spent nearly two years in germany , one of the biggest music stars to have ever been in residence here .
from 1958 to 1960 , he was assigned as a gi in the 3rd armored division to ray barracks , in the small town of friedberg near frankfurt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elvis checks in at friedberg 's ray barracks at the time , officials worried that elvis 's visit would corrupt the area 's youth .

elvis slept here the club was formed in 1998 by halwe and a handful of others , but has since grown to more than 200 members .

up to 50,000 people are expected to attend , with " chartered buses coming from berlin , from belgium , everywhere , " halwe said .
anyone planning a last minute visit can pretty much forget about staying in room 10 of the grünewald hotel , though .
that 's the room in the family-run hotel where elvis slept for several weeks in 1958 , and " the only place in europe where you can sleep in the same bed elvis slept in , " halwe said .

not king as in " kaiser " , but as in elvis : king of rock n ' roll .
presley spent nearly two years in germany , one of the biggest music stars to have ever been in residence here .
from 1958 to 1960 , he was assigned as a gi in the 3rd armored division to ray barracks , in the small town of friedberg near frankfurt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elvis checks in at friedberg 's ray barracks at the time , officials worried that elvis 's visit would corrupt the area 's youth .
now , the town is tapping the elvis myth to help keep itself on the tourism map .
bad nauheim and the neighboring village of friedberg were utterly dull until some local hardcore elvis fans decided to liven up things , said hans-ulrich halwe , founder and honorary chairman of the bad nauheim-friedberg elvis presley club .
elvis slept here the club was formed in 1998 by halwe and a handful of others , but has since grown to more than 200 members .
they meet once a month in the bar of the " best western hotel rosenau " , which is decked out in elvis memorabilia , and stage elvis events , and give tours of the area .
this weekend , freidberg and bad nauheim are ground zero for the celebration of the king 's 70th birthday .
along with elvis impersonators doing a las vegas revival show and a gospel concert -lrb- harking back to the king 's church music roots -rrb- , there will be an exhibit of " elvis art " and daily elvis tours featuring anecdotes about his 18-month stay .
up to 50,000 people are expected to attend , with " chartered buses coming from berlin , from belgium , everywhere , " halwe said .
anyone planning a last minute visit can pretty much forget about staying in room 10 of the grünewald hotel , though .
that 's the room in the family-run hotel where elvis slept for several weeks in 1958 , and " the only place in europe where you can sleep in the same bed elvis slept in , " halwe said .
for big events it gets booked up to a year in advance , however .
elvis pressler ?
an honored guest at the bad nauheim festivities will be karl heinz stein , elvis ’ s military barber and the ace in the hole of bad nauheim 's elvis lore .
as someone who could handle the heartthrob 's head on a regular basis -lrb- haircuts were given every eight days or so -rrb- stein was forward-thinking enough to stash away a few locks of the star ’ s hair and hang on to his scissors and combs .
these objects have since been sold , ending up in private collections or , alternately , at the museum of german history , where a reconstruction of the military barber shop in friedberg is a centerpiece of the current " elvis in germany " exhibit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the interior of the bad nauheim hair salon where elvis got a trim , now in a museum stein clearly enjoys talking about his days as barber to the king and even claimed a certain kinship with the young tennesseean .
" there was something different about elvis , he was very special .
he was so generous ... so polite , so genteel .
you could n't say the same about all of his compatriots , " said stein . " i said even then , ' its like he is really a german , like he has german blood . '
and i turned out to be right . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans hold vigil on elvis death anniversary , in front of elvis performance image stein 's feeling that the presley family came not from english but german ancestry found a supporter a few years back in the form of donald presley , a distant cousin of elvis who was researching his roots .
donald claims that elvis 's bloodline reaches back to winemakers from the rhineland palatinate region named pressler .

but the record sums wo n't create massive budgetary problems around the world , according to experts . official aid for last month 's earthquake-tsunami disaster has been sizable .
germany on wednesday increased its pledge to € 500 million -lrb- $ 662 million -rrb- to become the world 's largest donor . but that amount was topped only hours later after australia said it would donate € 578 million to the catastrophe .
japan is the third largest donor with € 378 million and the united states has pledged € 265 million .
even tiny norway will give € 130 million . the offers of aid have come despite the fact that most rich industrial nations are currently running budget deficits .
for example , the united states will record a budget deficit of 4.5 percent in 2004 .
in europe , france and germany are both struggling to stick to the eu 's stability pact , which underpins the economic foundations of the euro . but experts are n't concerned that the commendable instinct to aid those suffering due to the tsunami could have a negative impact on the world 's economy .
" budgets are strained all over - except for perhaps in sweden and finland , " said ivo bischoff , an economist at the university of gießen .
" but these are all things that will come down to decimal figures . " klaus-jürgen gern from the kiel institute for world economics agreed .
he acknowledged germany 's pledge was large , however , " it will be paid out over at least three years , " he also pointed out . money coming and going most donor nations are more concerned about how the money will be spent than where it will come from .
germany is no exception .
" in principle , we ask aid organizations to name projects , " a spokesman for the foreign ministry told dw-world .
" they can determine extremely quickly what is needed .

thousands of villagers have begun returning to their homes after fleeing the tsunamis that pounded malaysia 's northwestern coast , officials said sunday .
-lrb- ap photo / teh eng koon -rrb- most frequently , the funds for immediate aid go directly to local partner organizations or international aid outfits that can transport food , water and clothing on their own .
the spokesman said there were two man criteria : food is bought in the affected regions to save transport costs and money is given only to groups with a clear system of distribution . the aid given out for the tsunami damage could bring germany closer to an important goal : according to a un agreement , member states should aim to spend at least 0.7 percent of their gdp on development aid .
germany currently only spends 0.3 percent . how much the aid for the tsunami will further such progress remains unclear , however . " it will depend on where exactly the € 500 million comes from , " said a spokesman for the german development ministry .

" i can only call on deutsche börse to retain its headquarters in frankfurt , " if a merger with lse were to come about , green party politician christine scheel , head of the german parliament 's financial committee , told business daily handelsblatt .
the finance expert of the opposition conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , heinz seiffert , also said that politicians should do everything to ensure that the decision regarding the merged company 's future headquarters should fall in germany 's favour . charm offensive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche börse in frankfurt in the battle for the lse , deutsche börse appears to be pulling out all the stops to convince the lse of the virtues of a frankfurt-london tie-up rather than a merger with frankfurt 's arch-rival , paris-based rival euronext .
the german company has so far put a bid of just under € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- on the table for the london market .
but , in an effort to win over the lse , deutsche börse has not only changed its official language to english , but has reportedly offered to manage the combined cash equities markets out of london and has also offered lse chief clara furse that job . furthermore , newspaper reports this week said the operator of the frankfurt stock exchange was ready to raise its offer and might even consider selling its luxembourg-based learstream unit , which many observers saw as the main stumbling block to a london-frankfurt tie-up . constructive meeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner g. seifert furse met with deutsche börse chief werner seifert -lrb- pictured -rrb- in london on thursday . a spokesman for the german group said the talks had been " friendly , constructive and professional " .
he declined to provide any further details .
furse was said to be meeting euronext boss jean-francois theodore on friday .
those talks were confidential and their outcome would not be made public , well-informed sources in paris told afp .
the negotiations were likely to last weeks rather than days . a german finance ministry spokesman insisted that the government expected the decision about the location of the headquarters of any merged group to fall in frankfurt 's favor .
the merger talks were an expression " of the strength of germany as a financial centre " , the spokesman said .
and that strength would be further enhanced in the event of a merger . fear of loss of jobs but , deutsche börse 's employees appear to be alarmed that they could lose their jobs .
the financial times deutschland reported in its friday edition that the group 's works council saw " urgent need for consultation " between employee representatives and management on the matter .
chairman seifert had insisted that there would be no compulsory redundancies if a merger went ahead .
and financial sources said friday that such fears were " unfounded " .
indeed , jobs could be in greater peril if a merger did not take place and frankfurt saw its importance as a stock market dwindle , the sources said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the asian tsunami : one year after doing better than " business as usual " german organizations take stock of tsunami relief an endeavor that needs time and money german tsunami early warning system takes shape germany -pipe- 07.01.2005 germans offer early warning help großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an early warning system could prevent future devastation there 's long been talk of creating a tsunami warning system , but now it 's time for action .
dw-world spoke to birger-gottfried lühr of the geo research center in potsdam , which wants to help . dw-world : at the donor conference for the tsunami victims , it was decided to introduce a warning system to the affected region .
what would be the exact role of the geo research center in implementing such a system ?
birger-gottfried lühr : our area of expertise is recording seismic activity and quickly analyzing signals registered .
in addition to this , each year we conduct a seismology training course , held alternately in potsdam and a country which is endangered by seismic activity .
so that means it would largely be your task to quickly recognize earthquakes .
but not every earthquake leads to a tsunami .
no , only a small number of earthquakes trigger tsunamis , but besides volcanic eruptions , they are the main cause .
it is critical to be able to recognize that an earthquake is coming and be able to see their movement in order to determine the likelihood of a tsunami .
what else would be involved in an early warning system besides an ability to recognize the danger in time ?
early warning does n't mean erecting a box somewhere which would ring at the critical moment .
we need a system which transports information from the decision-makers to the fishermen on the beach , who would then need to know what to do .
so it 's also a problem of training and understanding .
how long would it take to get such a system up and running ?
even if we were to set to it with the same verve as the japanese or the americans , it would still take a couple of years .
they are still improving their own system .
at the donor conference , kofi annan noted that japan could play a leading role in an early warning system , given that the japanese system is already very good .
does that mean it would be japanese rather than german researchers providing the technology for an early warning system ?
i think this incident has proven that natural catastrophes are a global problem .
every country on the planet should work together to reduce risk .
it is definitely an advantage that japan has already done some of the footwork , but i do n't believe the japanese should do it on their own .
have there already been international efforts to create a better system of protection against natural catastrophes ?
yes , we 've been thinking about this task for a long time .
there was a united nations initiative for the reduction of natural catastrophes between 1990 and 2000 , and there is also an initiative for the future , which would build on this .
so , yes , in the wider context , some preliminary work has already been done .
is there any existing cooperation between the different research institutes ?
yes , we are not starting from scratch .

dw-world spoke to birger-gottfried lühr of the geo research center in potsdam , which wants to help . dw-world : at the donor conference for the tsunami victims , it was decided to introduce a warning system to the affected region .
what would be the exact role of the geo research center in implementing such a system ?
birger-gottfried lühr : our area of expertise is recording seismic activity and quickly analyzing signals registered .
in addition to this , each year we conduct a seismology training course , held alternately in potsdam and a country which is endangered by seismic activity .
so that means it would largely be your task to quickly recognize earthquakes .
but not every earthquake leads to a tsunami .
no , only a small number of earthquakes trigger tsunamis , but besides volcanic eruptions , they are the main cause .
it is critical to be able to recognize that an earthquake is coming and be able to see their movement in order to determine the likelihood of a tsunami .
what else would be involved in an early warning system besides an ability to recognize the danger in time ?
early warning does n't mean erecting a box somewhere which would ring at the critical moment .
we need a system which transports information from the decision-makers to the fishermen on the beach , who would then need to know what to do .
so it 's also a problem of training and understanding .
how long would it take to get such a system up and running ?
even if we were to set to it with the same verve as the japanese or the americans , it would still take a couple of years .
they are still improving their own system .
at the donor conference , kofi annan noted that japan could play a leading role in an early warning system , given that the japanese system is already very good .
does that mean it would be japanese rather than german researchers providing the technology for an early warning system ?
i think this incident has proven that natural catastrophes are a global problem .
every country on the planet should work together to reduce risk .
it is definitely an advantage that japan has already done some of the footwork , but i do n't believe the japanese should do it on their own .
have there already been international efforts to create a better system of protection against natural catastrophes ?
yes , we 've been thinking about this task for a long time .
there was a united nations initiative for the reduction of natural catastrophes between 1990 and 2000 , and there is also an initiative for the future , which would build on this .
so , yes , in the wider context , some preliminary work has already been done .
is there any existing cooperation between the different research institutes ?
yes , we are not starting from scratch .
we already work with many groups on a scientific level , we already have contacts with scientists .
i am part of a project which works in java and the sunda islands , and there are a number of indonesian institutes involved .
we run a network with many stations across the world which record earthquakes , but they have to be improved , concentrated and appraised .

the main aim of the meeting , according to the eu presidency , was to coordinate ideas ahead of a un-hosted donors ' conference in geneva next week . " there are a number of ideas which have been floated , " francoise le bail , a spokeswoman for the european commission , told reporters .
" it is important to make sure that the response we make , the proposals we put forward , are the right ones . " besides ministers from the 25-member bloc , participants included david nabarro , the top official at the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- dealing with humanitarian crises , as well as carol bellamy , the head of unicef . rapid response and long-term aid besides debt relief , ministers threw their support behind a tsunami warning system for the indian ocean region .
they also looked at how it might respond to large-scale disasters in the future . earlier in the week , the eu 's external affairs commissioner , benita ferrero-waldner , had proposed creating a 5000-strong " crisis management corps . "
but at the meeting on friday , eu governments said they preferred putting the focus on a " rapid response " aid force that would be made up of coordinated national forces . germany 's foreign minister , joschka fischer , called on the eu to improve coordination in response to crises , warning that for a response force to be effective , it would have to first be efficient . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : survivors in sri lanka discussions in brussels also included a german initiative to partner countries , municipalities and even schools in europe with the region to help with long-term reconstruction . the eu and its member states have pledged aid to the region worth nearly € 1.5 billion -lrb- $ 2 billion -rrb- in the wake of the earthquake and tsunami disaster which has left more than 146,000 dead , including hundreds , possibly thousands of european tourists . eu governments so far have pledged over € 1 billion in aid while the eu commission has earmarked € 450 million . helping themselves , too eu ministers also stressed the need for governments of countries in the region to continue to play their part in helping their own citizens and warned that the long-running internal conflicts in sri lanka and the aceh province of indonesia should not interfere with relief efforts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers perpare emergency hospital containers for shipment to indonesia " the council launched an appeal so that aid can be delivered rapidly to all populations concerned , independent of the internal conflicts in some of the countries affected , " said the ministers in a draft conclusion document . several ministers at the meeting were returning from or heading to the disaster region .
germany 's fischer is scheduled to fly to thailand directly after the talks .
his british counterpart , jack straw , was absent from the meeting since he is currently in the region . temporary refuge on friday , the eu 's commissioner for justice , freedom and security , franco frattini , told the italian newspaper la repubblica that europe might offer temporary refuge to hundreds of thousands of children affected by the disaster . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : survivors are threatened by epidemics he said he had proposed offering to bring the children to the eu for several months , which would hopefully allow them to recover from their trauma and put them beyond the reach of criminal gangs which have been reported targeting lone children . the united nations children 's fund confirmed a case in indonesia of trafficking in children orphaned or separated from parents .
countries were warned to be on high alert for kidnappers . bringing children to the eu would require an extension of the bloc 's temporary asylum rules . the united nations estimates that 1.5 million children have been affected and are likely to suffer more than adults .

the main aim of the meeting , according to the eu presidency , was to coordinate ideas ahead of a un-hosted donors ' conference in geneva next week . " there are a number of ideas which have been floated , " francoise le bail , a spokeswoman for the european commission , told reporters .
" it is important to make sure that the response we make , the proposals we put forward , are the right ones . " besides ministers from the 25-member bloc , participants included david nabarro , the top official at the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- dealing with humanitarian crises , as well as carol bellamy , the head of unicef . rapid response and long-term aid besides debt relief , ministers threw their support behind a tsunami warning system for the indian ocean region .
they also looked at how it might respond to large-scale disasters in the future . earlier in the week , the eu 's external affairs commissioner , benita ferrero-waldner , had proposed creating a 5000-strong " crisis management corps . "
but at the meeting on friday , eu governments said they preferred putting the focus on a " rapid response " aid force that would be made up of coordinated national forces . germany 's foreign minister , joschka fischer , called on the eu to improve coordination in response to crises , warning that for a response force to be effective , it would have to first be efficient . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : survivors in sri lanka discussions in brussels also included a german initiative to partner countries , municipalities and even schools in europe with the region to help with long-term reconstruction . the eu and its member states have pledged aid to the region worth nearly € 1.5 billion -lrb- $ 2 billion -rrb- in the wake of the earthquake and tsunami disaster which has left more than 146,000 dead , including hundreds , possibly thousands of european tourists . eu governments so far have pledged over € 1 billion in aid while the eu commission has earmarked € 450 million . helping themselves , too eu ministers also stressed the need for governments of countries in the region to continue to play their part in helping their own citizens and warned that the long-running internal conflicts in sri lanka and the aceh province of indonesia should not interfere with relief efforts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers perpare emergency hospital containers for shipment to indonesia " the council launched an appeal so that aid can be delivered rapidly to all populations concerned , independent of the internal conflicts in some of the countries affected , " said the ministers in a draft conclusion document . several ministers at the meeting were returning from or heading to the disaster region .
germany 's fischer is scheduled to fly to thailand directly after the talks .
his british counterpart , jack straw , was absent from the meeting since he is currently in the region . temporary refuge on friday , the eu 's commissioner for justice , freedom and security , franco frattini , told the italian newspaper la repubblica that europe might offer temporary refuge to hundreds of thousands of children affected by the disaster . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : survivors are threatened by epidemics he said he had proposed offering to bring the children to the eu for several months , which would hopefully allow them to recover from their trauma and put them beyond the reach of criminal gangs which have been reported targeting lone children . the united nations children 's fund confirmed a case in indonesia of trafficking in children orphaned or separated from parents .
countries were warned to be on high alert for kidnappers . bringing children to the eu would require an extension of the bloc 's temporary asylum rules . the united nations estimates that 1.5 million children have been affected and are likely to suffer more than adults . " there are thousands of european families ready to take them in , " frattini told the paper . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans offer early warning help there 's long been talk of creating a tsunami warning system , but now it 's time for action .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 07.01.2005 a risque german fairy tale großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roughing it in erfurt : lakey -lrb- hansel , left -rrb- and serfling -lrb- gretel -rrb- culturally speaking , the new year period is usually reserved for mainstream family entertainment .
but not this year it seems as a chilling new production of " hansel and gretel " gets set to open at a german theater . italian opera director giancarlo del monaco 's adults-only treatment of the much-loved 1893 opera by engelbert humperdinck - set to premiere in erfurt , germany on jan .
15 - has been billed as a sinister study of pedophilia .
admittedly , it was preceded by a more palatable version in december .
in the run-up to christmas , erfurt theater staged a traditional , feel-good " hansel and gretel , " complete with gingerbread houses and old-school wicked witches .
but , based on the story by the famously no-nonsense grimm brothers , the second version is much closer to the original - and therefore strictly x-rated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giancarlo del monaco " underlying the libretto is a tacit comment on pedophilia , violence and sexual abuse of children , " del monaco -lrb- photo -rrb- said in an interview with german news agency dpa .
it 's a taboo he was determined to break , said del monaco , even if he " risked being called disgusting . "
telling it like it is disavowing sentimentality seems to be fashionable right now , and not only within the typically straight-talking world of fringe theater .
in london , the expletive-riddled " jerry springer - the opera " proved a run-away hit in the west-end , while producers of what turned into the musical hit of the festive season , " mary poppins " , felt compelled to defend their decision to advise parents against bringing under-sevens to performances of what 's generally seen as a christmas favorite .
in producer cameron mackintosh 's mature , non-mawkish version about family dysfunction - closer to the original book by pamela travers than the disney movie - the adorable nanny is revamped as a stern disciplinarian .
it may be dark , but the critics loved it .
meanwhile in germany , a controversial ballet choreographed by johann kresnik about the suicide of hannelore kohl -lrb- photo -rrb- , wife of former german chancellor helmut kohl , premiered in bonn in the middle of the festive season amid angry resistance from the opposition conservatives .
scandalous as it was to see the frail first lady in canary-yellow silk pajamas pouring herself a poison cocktail , the production was also critically acclaimed .
not a bedtime story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erfurt 's more traditional and child-friendly production of " hansel and gretel " premiered in october the warts-and-all version of " hansel and gretel " in erfurt uses the same music and libretto as the saccharine version , but marks a new visual departure thanks to the set design by peter sykora .
" the fairytale forest is replaced by a red-light district , with high-rises , garbage dumps and begging children , " del monaco said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter umstadt -lrb- center -rrb- , who also played the witch in the traditional version , is wicked in a different way in the adult production .
at left is denis lakey -lrb- hansel -rrb- and susanne serfling -lrb- gretel -rrb- at right " the children 's mother is a whore and their father an alcoholic .
the " sand-man " is a cocaine-snorting pimp who pursues hansel -lrb- denis lakey -rrb- and gretel -lrb- susanne serfling -rrb- with a video camera and hands them over to the wicked witch - the modern " stranger , " who could be the man down the road , the local pervert , the catholic priest , " he said . all for a good cause but it 's not just all gratuitous violence . there 's a good cause in there too .
erfurt theater collaborated on the project with unicef , the " weisser ring " help-line for victims of violent crime , the justice ministry of the state of thuringia , where erfurt is located , as well as police and child psychologists .
a series of discussions on juvenile crime is also planned .
in an interview with the magazine das opernglas , del monaco said he was deliberately setting out to shock .
" you have to horrify people , " he said .
" i do n't believe children these days are sufficiently legally protected . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de preventing new perpetrators while german programs to prevent sexual abuse of children have so far mainly focussed on awareness among parents and educators , a new project in berlin plans to offer treatment to people before they become perpetrators .

dw-world spoke to birger-gottfried lühr of the geo research center in potsdam , which wants to help . dw-world : at the donor conference for the tsunami victims , it was decided to introduce a warning system to the affected region .
what would be the exact role of the geo research center in implementing such a system ?
birger-gottfried lühr : our area of expertise is recording seismic activity and quickly analyzing signals registered .
in addition to this , each year we conduct a seismology training course , held alternately in potsdam and a country which is endangered by seismic activity .
so that means it would largely be your task to quickly recognize earthquakes .
but not every earthquake leads to a tsunami .
no , only a small number of earthquakes trigger tsunamis , but besides volcanic eruptions , they are the main cause .
it is critical to be able to recognize that an earthquake is coming and be able to see their movement in order to determine the likelihood of a tsunami .
what else would be involved in an early warning system besides an ability to recognize the danger in time ?
early warning does n't mean erecting a box somewhere which would ring at the critical moment .
we need a system which transports information from the decision-makers to the fishermen on the beach , who would then need to know what to do .
so it 's also a problem of training and understanding .
how long would it take to get such a system up and running ?
even if we were to set to it with the same verve as the japanese or the americans , it would still take a couple of years .
they are still improving their own system .
at the donor conference , kofi annan noted that japan could play a leading role in an early warning system , given that the japanese system is already very good .
does that mean it would be japanese rather than german researchers providing the technology for an early warning system ?
i think this incident has proven that natural catastrophes are a global problem .
every country on the planet should work together to reduce risk .
it is definitely an advantage that japan has already done some of the footwork , but i do n't believe the japanese should do it on their own .
have there already been international efforts to create a better system of protection against natural catastrophes ?
yes , we 've been thinking about this task for a long time .
there was a united nations initiative for the reduction of natural catastrophes between 1990 and 2000 , and there is also an initiative for the future , which would build on this .
so , yes , in the wider context , some preliminary work has already been done .
is there any existing cooperation between the different research institutes ?
yes , we are not starting from scratch .
we already work with many groups on a scientific level , we already have contacts with scientists .
i am part of a project which works in java and the sunda islands , and there are a number of indonesian institutes involved .
we run a network with many stations across the world which record earthquakes , but they have to be improved , concentrated and appraised .
has the geo research institute received any official requests to become involved ?
as an employee here , i have noticed certain signals that there is a wish for us to become more actively involved . markus roman -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany keen on south asia partnerships chancellor schröder wants to go beyond immediate financial and humanitarian aid to the tsunami-hit nations by proposing bilateral " partnerships .

dw-world spoke to birger-gottfried lühr of the geo research center in potsdam , which wants to help . dw-world : at the donor conference for the tsunami victims , it was decided to introduce a warning system to the affected region .
what would be the exact role of the geo research center in implementing such a system ?
birger-gottfried lühr : our area of expertise is recording seismic activity and quickly analyzing signals registered .
in addition to this , each year we conduct a seismology training course , held alternately in potsdam and a country which is endangered by seismic activity .
so that means it would largely be your task to quickly recognize earthquakes .
but not every earthquake leads to a tsunami .
no , only a small number of earthquakes trigger tsunamis , but besides volcanic eruptions , they are the main cause .
it is critical to be able to recognize that an earthquake is coming and be able to see their movement in order to determine the likelihood of a tsunami .
what else would be involved in an early warning system besides an ability to recognize the danger in time ?
early warning does n't mean erecting a box somewhere which would ring at the critical moment .
we need a system which transports information from the decision-makers to the fishermen on the beach , who would then need to know what to do .
so it 's also a problem of training and understanding .
how long would it take to get such a system up and running ?
even if we were to set to it with the same verve as the japanese or the americans , it would still take a couple of years .
they are still improving their own system .
at the donor conference , kofi annan noted that japan could play a leading role in an early warning system , given that the japanese system is already very good .
does that mean it would be japanese rather than german researchers providing the technology for an early warning system ?
i think this incident has proven that natural catastrophes are a global problem .
every country on the planet should work together to reduce risk .
it is definitely an advantage that japan has already done some of the footwork , but i do n't believe the japanese should do it on their own .
have there already been international efforts to create a better system of protection against natural catastrophes ?
yes , we 've been thinking about this task for a long time .
there was a united nations initiative for the reduction of natural catastrophes between 1990 and 2000 , and there is also an initiative for the future , which would build on this .

we run a network with many stations across the world which record earthquakes , but they have to be improved , concentrated and appraised .

after the successful start of germany 's long troubled highway toll system for heavy commercial trucks , suggestions are already being made to expand the satellite-based technology to surface streets and normal cars . following a number of mishaps , germany 's high-tech toll system finally went into operation this week . held up for 16 months , the delay cost the german government billions in lost revenues .
but there were no major glitches on the country 's autobahns as had been feared , encouraging some politicians to consider how to widen the system 's reach . bavarian interior minister günther beckstein this week asked the federal government to collect the truck toll on some non-highway streets that could be possibly used by drivers to avoid paying the levy .
" the introduction of the toll can not be at the expense of residents on national roadways and of traffic safety , " beckstein said according to german news agency dpa . technically , there is nothing standing in the way of expanding the satellite toll system to other streets - at least not eventually .
currently the system is running on a slimmed-down version of the software that connects the trucks ' onboard units to the central computers of operator toll collect . the repeated delays were a major embarrassment for toll collect - the consortium made up of automaker daimlerchrysler , deutsche telekom and french motorway operator cofiroute .

the main aim of the meeting , according to the eu presidency , was to coordinate ideas ahead of a un-hosted donors ' conference in geneva next week . " there are a number of ideas which have been floated , " francoise le bail , a spokeswoman for the european commission , told reporters .
" it is important to make sure that the response we make , the proposals we put forward , are the right ones . " besides ministers from the 25-member bloc , participants included david nabarro , the top official at the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- dealing with humanitarian crises , as well as carol bellamy , the head of unicef . rapid response and long-term aid besides debt relief , ministers threw their support behind a tsunami warning system for the indian ocean region .
they also looked at how it might respond to large-scale disasters in the future . earlier in the week , the eu 's external affairs commissioner , benita ferrero-waldner , had proposed creating a 5000-strong " crisis management corps . "
but at the meeting on friday , eu governments said they preferred putting the focus on a " rapid response " aid force that would be made up of coordinated national forces . germany 's foreign minister , joschka fischer , called on the eu to improve coordination in response to crises , warning that for a response force to be effective , it would have to first be efficient . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : survivors in sri lanka discussions in brussels also included a german initiative to partner countries , municipalities and even schools in europe with the region to help with long-term reconstruction . the eu and its member states have pledged aid to the region worth nearly € 1.5 billion -lrb- $ 2 billion -rrb- in the wake of the earthquake and tsunami disaster which has left more than 146,000 dead , including hundreds , possibly thousands of european tourists . eu governments so far have pledged over € 1 billion in aid while the eu commission has earmarked € 450 million . helping themselves , too eu ministers also stressed the need for governments of countries in the region to continue to play their part in helping their own citizens and warned that the long-running internal conflicts in sri lanka and the aceh province of indonesia should not interfere with relief efforts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers perpare emergency hospital containers for shipment to indonesia " the council launched an appeal so that aid can be delivered rapidly to all populations concerned , independent of the internal conflicts in some of the countries affected , " said the ministers in a draft conclusion document . several ministers at the meeting were returning from or heading to the disaster region .
germany 's fischer is scheduled to fly to thailand directly after the talks .
his british counterpart , jack straw , was absent from the meeting since he is currently in the region . temporary refuge on friday , the eu 's commissioner for justice , freedom and security , franco frattini , told the italian newspaper la repubblica that europe might offer temporary refuge to hundreds of thousands of children affected by the disaster . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : survivors are threatened by epidemics he said he had proposed offering to bring the children to the eu for several months , which would hopefully allow them to recover from their trauma and put them beyond the reach of criminal gangs which have been reported targeting lone children . the united nations children 's fund confirmed a case in indonesia of trafficking in children orphaned or separated from parents .
countries were warned to be on high alert for kidnappers . bringing children to the eu would require an extension of the bloc 's temporary asylum rules . the united nations estimates that 1.5 million children have been affected and are likely to suffer more than adults . " there are thousands of european families ready to take them in , " frattini told the paper . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans offer early warning help there 's long been talk of creating a tsunami warning system , but now it 's time for action .

in the run-up to christmas , erfurt theater staged a traditional , feel-good " hansel and gretel , " complete with gingerbread houses and old-school wicked witches .
but , based on the story by the famously no-nonsense grimm brothers , the second version is much closer to the original - and therefore strictly x-rated .

in london , the expletive-riddled " jerry springer - the opera " proved a run-away hit in the west-end , while producers of what turned into the musical hit of the festive season , " mary poppins " , felt compelled to defend their decision to advise parents against bringing under-sevens to performances of what 's generally seen as a christmas favorite .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 07.01.2005 the king is dead , long live the king großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elvis was stationed in bad nauheim for 18 months germany is marking elvis presley ’ s 70th birthday with television specials , a rash of live shows , and four straight days of " elvisiana " in the town where the young star was stationed as a gi . germans have long claimed a special relationship to the king .
not king as in " kaiser " , but as in elvis : king of rock n ' roll .
presley spent nearly two years in germany , one of the biggest music stars to have ever been in residence here .
from 1958 to 1960 , he was assigned as a gi in the 3rd armored division to ray barracks , in the small town of friedberg near frankfurt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elvis checks in at friedberg 's ray barracks at the time , officials worried that elvis 's visit would corrupt the area 's youth .
now , the town is tapping the elvis myth to help keep itself on the tourism map .
bad nauheim and the neighboring village of friedberg were utterly dull until some local hardcore elvis fans decided to liven up things , said hans-ulrich halwe , founder and honorary chairman of the bad nauheim-friedberg elvis presley club .
elvis slept here the club was formed in 1998 by halwe and a handful of others , but has since grown to more than 200 members .
they meet once a month in the bar of the " best western hotel rosenau " , which is decked out in elvis memorabilia , and stage elvis events , and give tours of the area .
this weekend , freidberg and bad nauheim are ground zero for the celebration of the king 's 70th birthday .
along with elvis impersonators doing a las vegas revival show and a gospel concert -lrb- harking back to the king 's church music roots -rrb- , there will be an exhibit of " elvis art " and daily elvis tours featuring anecdotes about his 18-month stay .
up to 50,000 people are expected to attend , with " chartered buses coming from berlin , from belgium , everywhere , " halwe said .
anyone planning a last minute visit can pretty much forget about staying in room 10 of the grünewald hotel , though .
that 's the room in the family-run hotel where elvis slept for several weeks in 1958 , and " the only place in europe where you can sleep in the same bed elvis slept in , " halwe said .
for big events it gets booked up to a year in advance , however .
elvis pressler ?
an honored guest at the bad nauheim festivities will be karl heinz stein , elvis ’ s military barber and the ace in the hole of bad nauheim 's elvis lore .
as someone who could handle the heartthrob 's head on a regular basis -lrb- haircuts were given every eight days or so -rrb- stein was forward-thinking enough to stash away a few locks of the star ’ s hair and hang on to his scissors and combs .
these objects have since been sold , ending up in private collections or , alternately , at the museum of german history , where a reconstruction of the military barber shop in friedberg is a centerpiece of the current " elvis in germany " exhibit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the interior of the bad nauheim hair salon where elvis got a trim , now in a museum stein clearly enjoys talking about his days as barber to the king and even claimed a certain kinship with the young tennesseean .
" there was something different about elvis , he was very special .
he was so generous ... so polite , so genteel .
you could n't say the same about all of his compatriots , " said stein . " i said even then , ' its like he is really a german , like he has german blood . '
and i turned out to be right . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans hold vigil on elvis death anniversary , in front of elvis performance image stein 's feeling that the presley family came not from english but german ancestry found a supporter a few years back in the form of donald presley , a distant cousin of elvis who was researching his roots .
donald claims that elvis 's bloodline reaches back to winemakers from the rhineland palatinate region named pressler .
-lrb- with scottish and english lineage researchers also claiming elvis as their own , it is up to each branch of the presley family to fight for their versions of the truth . -rrb-
calling maybelline ...
of course , the elvis following in germany , as well as the celebration of his birth , goes well beyond the borders of bad nauheim .
the country 's oldest and largest club , founded in 1978 and with about 2,000 members , is the elvis presley gesellschaft .
the web site of the elvis club berlin lists some 33 other active elvis clubs in germany , though it is an unofficial count .
members of these clubs use the internet to keep in touch and keep informed , with messages from germans with suspiciously southern-american names -lrb- maybelline , caroline , jacky , shakey -rrb- discussing topics like the size of elvis 's jumpsuits and announcing elvis radio specials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg based elvis imitator , shelvis late night channel flippers around germany can expect to stumble across a lot of elvis movies , and anyone in a big city looking for an elvis party on friday or saturday wo n't have too much trouble finding one .
in hamburg , an elvis imitator called shelvis performs , while berlin 's estrel theater has revived its popular " an evening with elvis . "
the well-reviewed show stars versatile irish elvis tribute artist grahame patrick doyle , who estrel fished out of las vegas ' teeming elvis waters several years ago .
with his music , elvis did , indeed , help usher social disarray into german society .
but today , the aspect of the king 's persona that most seems to warm german hearts is his history as a gospel singer .
an award-winning german elvis impersonator known simply as " rio , the voice of elvis " -lrb- yes , he has had his name officially changed -rrb- will do an elvis-sings-gospel show over the weekend in friedberg 's 600-seat church .
two years ago , a similar concert sold out .
singing the gospel " the best thing about elvis is his versatility ... few people realize this , but elvis is the only white singer to win grammy awards for his gospel music , " said the 40-year-old rio , who has been doing elvis since the age of 10 .
" its amazing to play a concert and move people to tears .
any music that touches the heart , that 's gospel . "
when elvis left bad nauheim , " he said he would come back and sing for all the people who had been so good to him here , " hans-ulrich halwe said .
because elvis 's manager refused to leave the country , though , elvis never took his show abroad .
" i 'm still waiting , " added halwe with a laugh . jennifer abramsohn , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de elvis lives on in bonn forget memphis , las vegas and graceland - germany has always had a special place in its heart for elvis , and now , anyone wanting a personal glimpse of the man behind the myth need go no further than bonn .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elvis checks in at friedberg 's ray barracks at the time , officials worried that elvis 's visit would corrupt the area 's youth .
now , the town is tapping the elvis myth to help keep itself on the tourism map .
bad nauheim and the neighboring village of friedberg were utterly dull until some local hardcore elvis fans decided to liven up things , said hans-ulrich halwe , founder and honorary chairman of the bad nauheim-friedberg elvis presley club .
elvis slept here the club was formed in 1998 by halwe and a handful of others , but has since grown to more than 200 members .
they meet once a month in the bar of the " best western hotel rosenau " , which is decked out in elvis memorabilia , and stage elvis events , and give tours of the area .
this weekend , freidberg and bad nauheim are ground zero for the celebration of the king 's 70th birthday .
along with elvis impersonators doing a las vegas revival show and a gospel concert -lrb- harking back to the king 's church music roots -rrb- , there will be an exhibit of " elvis art " and daily elvis tours featuring anecdotes about his 18-month stay .
up to 50,000 people are expected to attend , with " chartered buses coming from berlin , from belgium , everywhere , " halwe said .
anyone planning a last minute visit can pretty much forget about staying in room 10 of the grünewald hotel , though .
that 's the room in the family-run hotel where elvis slept for several weeks in 1958 , and " the only place in europe where you can sleep in the same bed elvis slept in , " halwe said .
for big events it gets booked up to a year in advance , however .
elvis pressler ?
an honored guest at the bad nauheim festivities will be karl heinz stein , elvis ’ s military barber and the ace in the hole of bad nauheim 's elvis lore .
as someone who could handle the heartthrob 's head on a regular basis -lrb- haircuts were given every eight days or so -rrb- stein was forward-thinking enough to stash away a few locks of the star ’ s hair and hang on to his scissors and combs .
these objects have since been sold , ending up in private collections or , alternately , at the museum of german history , where a reconstruction of the military barber shop in friedberg is a centerpiece of the current " elvis in germany " exhibit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the interior of the bad nauheim hair salon where elvis got a trim , now in a museum stein clearly enjoys talking about his days as barber to the king and even claimed a certain kinship with the young tennesseean .
" there was something different about elvis , he was very special .
he was so generous ... so polite , so genteel .
you could n't say the same about all of his compatriots , " said stein . " i said even then , ' its like he is really a german , like he has german blood . '
and i turned out to be right . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans hold vigil on elvis death anniversary , in front of elvis performance image stein 's feeling that the presley family came not from english but german ancestry found a supporter a few years back in the form of donald presley , a distant cousin of elvis who was researching his roots .
donald claims that elvis 's bloodline reaches back to winemakers from the rhineland palatinate region named pressler .
-lrb- with scottish and english lineage researchers also claiming elvis as their own , it is up to each branch of the presley family to fight for their versions of the truth . -rrb-
calling maybelline ...
of course , the elvis following in germany , as well as the celebration of his birth , goes well beyond the borders of bad nauheim .
the country 's oldest and largest club , founded in 1978 and with about 2,000 members , is the elvis presley gesellschaft .
the web site of the elvis club berlin lists some 33 other active elvis clubs in germany , though it is an unofficial count .
members of these clubs use the internet to keep in touch and keep informed , with messages from germans with suspiciously southern-american names -lrb- maybelline , caroline , jacky , shakey -rrb- discussing topics like the size of elvis 's jumpsuits and announcing elvis radio specials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg based elvis imitator , shelvis late night channel flippers around germany can expect to stumble across a lot of elvis movies , and anyone in a big city looking for an elvis party on friday or saturday wo n't have too much trouble finding one .
in hamburg , an elvis imitator called shelvis performs , while berlin 's estrel theater has revived its popular " an evening with elvis . "
the well-reviewed show stars versatile irish elvis tribute artist grahame patrick doyle , who estrel fished out of las vegas ' teeming elvis waters several years ago .
with his music , elvis did , indeed , help usher social disarray into german society .
but today , the aspect of the king 's persona that most seems to warm german hearts is his history as a gospel singer .
an award-winning german elvis impersonator known simply as " rio , the voice of elvis " -lrb- yes , he has had his name officially changed -rrb- will do an elvis-sings-gospel show over the weekend in friedberg 's 600-seat church .
two years ago , a similar concert sold out .
singing the gospel " the best thing about elvis is his versatility ... few people realize this , but elvis is the only white singer to win grammy awards for his gospel music , " said the 40-year-old rio , who has been doing elvis since the age of 10 .
" its amazing to play a concert and move people to tears .
any music that touches the heart , that 's gospel . "
when elvis left bad nauheim , " he said he would come back and sing for all the people who had been so good to him here , " hans-ulrich halwe said .
because elvis 's manager refused to leave the country , though , elvis never took his show abroad .
" i 'm still waiting , " added halwe with a laugh . jennifer abramsohn , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de elvis lives on in bonn forget memphis , las vegas and graceland - germany has always had a special place in its heart for elvis , and now , anyone wanting a personal glimpse of the man behind the myth need go no further than bonn .

that 's the room in the family-run hotel where elvis slept for several weeks in 1958 , and " the only place in europe where you can sleep in the same bed elvis slept in , " halwe said .
for big events it gets booked up to a year in advance , however .
elvis pressler ?
an honored guest at the bad nauheim festivities will be karl heinz stein , elvis ’ s military barber and the ace in the hole of bad nauheim 's elvis lore .
as someone who could handle the heartthrob 's head on a regular basis -lrb- haircuts were given every eight days or so -rrb- stein was forward-thinking enough to stash away a few locks of the star ’ s hair and hang on to his scissors and combs .
these objects have since been sold , ending up in private collections or , alternately , at the museum of german history , where a reconstruction of the military barber shop in friedberg is a centerpiece of the current " elvis in germany " exhibit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the interior of the bad nauheim hair salon where elvis got a trim , now in a museum stein clearly enjoys talking about his days as barber to the king and even claimed a certain kinship with the young tennesseean .
" there was something different about elvis , he was very special .
he was so generous ... so polite , so genteel .
you could n't say the same about all of his compatriots , " said stein . " i said even then , ' its like he is really a german , like he has german blood . '
and i turned out to be right . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans hold vigil on elvis death anniversary , in front of elvis performance image stein 's feeling that the presley family came not from english but german ancestry found a supporter a few years back in the form of donald presley , a distant cousin of elvis who was researching his roots .
donald claims that elvis 's bloodline reaches back to winemakers from the rhineland palatinate region named pressler .
-lrb- with scottish and english lineage researchers also claiming elvis as their own , it is up to each branch of the presley family to fight for their versions of the truth . -rrb-
calling maybelline ...
of course , the elvis following in germany , as well as the celebration of his birth , goes well beyond the borders of bad nauheim .
the country 's oldest and largest club , founded in 1978 and with about 2,000 members , is the elvis presley gesellschaft .
the web site of the elvis club berlin lists some 33 other active elvis clubs in germany , though it is an unofficial count .
members of these clubs use the internet to keep in touch and keep informed , with messages from germans with suspiciously southern-american names -lrb- maybelline , caroline , jacky , shakey -rrb- discussing topics like the size of elvis 's jumpsuits and announcing elvis radio specials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg based elvis imitator , shelvis late night channel flippers around germany can expect to stumble across a lot of elvis movies , and anyone in a big city looking for an elvis party on friday or saturday wo n't have too much trouble finding one .
in hamburg , an elvis imitator called shelvis performs , while berlin 's estrel theater has revived its popular " an evening with elvis . "
the well-reviewed show stars versatile irish elvis tribute artist grahame patrick doyle , who estrel fished out of las vegas ' teeming elvis waters several years ago .
with his music , elvis did , indeed , help usher social disarray into german society .
but today , the aspect of the king 's persona that most seems to warm german hearts is his history as a gospel singer .
an award-winning german elvis impersonator known simply as " rio , the voice of elvis " -lrb- yes , he has had his name officially changed -rrb- will do an elvis-sings-gospel show over the weekend in friedberg 's 600-seat church .
two years ago , a similar concert sold out .
singing the gospel " the best thing about elvis is his versatility ... few people realize this , but elvis is the only white singer to win grammy awards for his gospel music , " said the 40-year-old rio , who has been doing elvis since the age of 10 .
" its amazing to play a concert and move people to tears .
any music that touches the heart , that 's gospel . "
when elvis left bad nauheim , " he said he would come back and sing for all the people who had been so good to him here , " hans-ulrich halwe said .
because elvis 's manager refused to leave the country , though , elvis never took his show abroad .

not king as in " kaiser " , but as in elvis : king of rock n ' roll .
presley spent nearly two years in germany , one of the biggest music stars to have ever been in residence here .
from 1958 to 1960 , he was assigned as a gi in the 3rd armored division to ray barracks , in the small town of friedberg near frankfurt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elvis checks in at friedberg 's ray barracks at the time , officials worried that elvis 's visit would corrupt the area 's youth .
now , the town is tapping the elvis myth to help keep itself on the tourism map .
bad nauheim and the neighboring village of friedberg were utterly dull until some local hardcore elvis fans decided to liven up things , said hans-ulrich halwe , founder and honorary chairman of the bad nauheim-friedberg elvis presley club .
elvis slept here the club was formed in 1998 by halwe and a handful of others , but has since grown to more than 200 members .
they meet once a month in the bar of the " best western hotel rosenau " , which is decked out in elvis memorabilia , and stage elvis events , and give tours of the area .
this weekend , freidberg and bad nauheim are ground zero for the celebration of the king 's 70th birthday .
along with elvis impersonators doing a las vegas revival show and a gospel concert -lrb- harking back to the king 's church music roots -rrb- , there will be an exhibit of " elvis art " and daily elvis tours featuring anecdotes about his 18-month stay .
up to 50,000 people are expected to attend , with " chartered buses coming from berlin , from belgium , everywhere , " halwe said .
anyone planning a last minute visit can pretty much forget about staying in room 10 of the grünewald hotel , though .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 07.01.2005 the king is dead , long live the king großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elvis was stationed in bad nauheim for 18 months germany is marking elvis presley ’ s 70th birthday with television specials , a rash of live shows , and four straight days of " elvisiana " in the town where the young star was stationed as a gi . germans have long claimed a special relationship to the king .
not king as in " kaiser " , but as in elvis : king of rock n ' roll .
presley spent nearly two years in germany , one of the biggest music stars to have ever been in residence here .
from 1958 to 1960 , he was assigned as a gi in the 3rd armored division to ray barracks , in the small town of friedberg near frankfurt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elvis checks in at friedberg 's ray barracks at the time , officials worried that elvis 's visit would corrupt the area 's youth .
now , the town is tapping the elvis myth to help keep itself on the tourism map .
bad nauheim and the neighboring village of friedberg were utterly dull until some local hardcore elvis fans decided to liven up things , said hans-ulrich halwe , founder and honorary chairman of the bad nauheim-friedberg elvis presley club .
elvis slept here the club was formed in 1998 by halwe and a handful of others , but has since grown to more than 200 members .
they meet once a month in the bar of the " best western hotel rosenau " , which is decked out in elvis memorabilia , and stage elvis events , and give tours of the area .
this weekend , freidberg and bad nauheim are ground zero for the celebration of the king 's 70th birthday .
along with elvis impersonators doing a las vegas revival show and a gospel concert -lrb- harking back to the king 's church music roots -rrb- , there will be an exhibit of " elvis art " and daily elvis tours featuring anecdotes about his 18-month stay .
up to 50,000 people are expected to attend , with " chartered buses coming from berlin , from belgium , everywhere , " halwe said .
anyone planning a last minute visit can pretty much forget about staying in room 10 of the grünewald hotel , though .
that 's the room in the family-run hotel where elvis slept for several weeks in 1958 , and " the only place in europe where you can sleep in the same bed elvis slept in , " halwe said .
for big events it gets booked up to a year in advance , however .
elvis pressler ?
an honored guest at the bad nauheim festivities will be karl heinz stein , elvis ’ s military barber and the ace in the hole of bad nauheim 's elvis lore .
as someone who could handle the heartthrob 's head on a regular basis -lrb- haircuts were given every eight days or so -rrb- stein was forward-thinking enough to stash away a few locks of the star ’ s hair and hang on to his scissors and combs .
these objects have since been sold , ending up in private collections or , alternately , at the museum of german history , where a reconstruction of the military barber shop in friedberg is a centerpiece of the current " elvis in germany " exhibit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the interior of the bad nauheim hair salon where elvis got a trim , now in a museum stein clearly enjoys talking about his days as barber to the king and even claimed a certain kinship with the young tennesseean .
" there was something different about elvis , he was very special .
he was so generous ... so polite , so genteel .
you could n't say the same about all of his compatriots , " said stein . " i said even then , ' its like he is really a german , like he has german blood . '
and i turned out to be right . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans hold vigil on elvis death anniversary , in front of elvis performance image stein 's feeling that the presley family came not from english but german ancestry found a supporter a few years back in the form of donald presley , a distant cousin of elvis who was researching his roots .
donald claims that elvis 's bloodline reaches back to winemakers from the rhineland palatinate region named pressler .
-lrb- with scottish and english lineage researchers also claiming elvis as their own , it is up to each branch of the presley family to fight for their versions of the truth . -rrb-
calling maybelline ...
of course , the elvis following in germany , as well as the celebration of his birth , goes well beyond the borders of bad nauheim .
the country 's oldest and largest club , founded in 1978 and with about 2,000 members , is the elvis presley gesellschaft .
the web site of the elvis club berlin lists some 33 other active elvis clubs in germany , though it is an unofficial count .

in hamburg , an elvis imitator called shelvis performs , while berlin 's estrel theater has revived its popular " an evening with elvis . "
the well-reviewed show stars versatile irish elvis tribute artist grahame patrick doyle , who estrel fished out of las vegas ' teeming elvis waters several years ago .
with his music , elvis did , indeed , help usher social disarray into german society .
but today , the aspect of the king 's persona that most seems to warm german hearts is his history as a gospel singer .
an award-winning german elvis impersonator known simply as " rio , the voice of elvis " -lrb- yes , he has had his name officially changed -rrb- will do an elvis-sings-gospel show over the weekend in friedberg 's 600-seat church .
two years ago , a similar concert sold out .
singing the gospel " the best thing about elvis is his versatility ... few people realize this , but elvis is the only white singer to win grammy awards for his gospel music , " said the 40-year-old rio , who has been doing elvis since the age of 10 .
" its amazing to play a concert and move people to tears .
any music that touches the heart , that 's gospel . "
when elvis left bad nauheim , " he said he would come back and sing for all the people who had been so good to him here , " hans-ulrich halwe said .
because elvis 's manager refused to leave the country , though , elvis never took his show abroad .

after the successful start of germany 's long troubled highway toll system for heavy commercial trucks , suggestions are already being made to expand the satellite-based technology to surface streets and normal cars . following a number of mishaps , germany 's high-tech toll system finally went into operation this week . held up for 16 months , the delay cost the german government billions in lost revenues .
but there were no major glitches on the country 's autobahns as had been feared , encouraging some politicians to consider how to widen the system 's reach . bavarian interior minister günther beckstein this week asked the federal government to collect the truck toll on some non-highway streets that could be possibly used by drivers to avoid paying the levy .
" the introduction of the toll can not be at the expense of residents on national roadways and of traffic safety , " beckstein said according to german news agency dpa . technically , there is nothing standing in the way of expanding the satellite toll system to other streets - at least not eventually .
currently the system is running on a slimmed-down version of the software that connects the trucks ' onboard units to the central computers of operator toll collect . the repeated delays were a major embarrassment for toll collect - the consortium made up of automaker daimlerchrysler , deutsche telekom and french motorway operator cofiroute .
but the successful start this year has opened the door to future possibilities for the pioneering system .
that could include levying a toll on the streets as suggested by beckstein , as well as charging normal cars for using the autobahn . advanced technology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the system uses gps technology to send an sms via germany 's gsm mobile telephone network to locate a vehicle .
that works even at speeds of 200 kilometers -lrb- 124.27 miles -rrb- per hour while changing lanes .
a user is only charged for the exact distance driven . " they picked the toll collect system exactly because it is a very flexible one , " markus friedrich from the institute for street and traffic studies at the university of stuttgart told german ard television .
" at any time it can be expanded to other parts of the street network or the price can be changed easily . " no one is expecting the german government to begin pushing for an auto toll soon .
but , with the transport ministry strapped for cash and road projects suffering accordingly , some experts believe it is only a matter of time . " i think the toll for cars will come quickly simply due to financial reasons , " werner rothengatter from the university of karlsruhe said .
an advisor to the transport ministry , he said he expected the issue would be raised shortly after the next general election in 2006 .
rothengatter added that car owners could be co-opted to support the toll by offering compensation in the way of lower auto taxes . the german government expects about € 2.5 billion -lrb- $ 3.30 billion -rrb- in truck toll revenues each year .
but economics minister wolfgang clement also hopes the state-of-the-art system will be an export hit doing away with the old-fashioned booths that still cause traffic congestions in many other european countries . on thursday , the czech transport ministry said it planned to introduce a similar electronic toll system for trucks on the country 's highways , possibly by the end of the year . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de smooth start for german truck toll germany ’ s brand new highway toll system for heavy trucks has got off to a smooth start dispelling fears of potential traffic disasters on monday morning .

after the successful start of germany 's long troubled highway toll system for heavy commercial trucks , suggestions are already being made to expand the satellite-based technology to surface streets and normal cars . following a number of mishaps , germany 's high-tech toll system finally went into operation this week . held up for 16 months , the delay cost the german government billions in lost revenues .
but there were no major glitches on the country 's autobahns as had been feared , encouraging some politicians to consider how to widen the system 's reach . bavarian interior minister günther beckstein this week asked the federal government to collect the truck toll on some non-highway streets that could be possibly used by drivers to avoid paying the levy .
" the introduction of the toll can not be at the expense of residents on national roadways and of traffic safety , " beckstein said according to german news agency dpa . technically , there is nothing standing in the way of expanding the satellite toll system to other streets - at least not eventually .
currently the system is running on a slimmed-down version of the software that connects the trucks ' onboard units to the central computers of operator toll collect . the repeated delays were a major embarrassment for toll collect - the consortium made up of automaker daimlerchrysler , deutsche telekom and french motorway operator cofiroute .

a user is only charged for the exact distance driven . " they picked the toll collect system exactly because it is a very flexible one , " markus friedrich from the institute for street and traffic studies at the university of stuttgart told german ard television .
" at any time it can be expanded to other parts of the street network or the price can be changed easily . " no one is expecting the german government to begin pushing for an auto toll soon .
but , with the transport ministry strapped for cash and road projects suffering accordingly , some experts believe it is only a matter of time . " i think the toll for cars will come quickly simply due to financial reasons , " werner rothengatter from the university of karlsruhe said .
an advisor to the transport ministry , he said he expected the issue would be raised shortly after the next general election in 2006 .
rothengatter added that car owners could be co-opted to support the toll by offering compensation in the way of lower auto taxes . the german government expects about € 2.5 billion -lrb- $ 3.30 billion -rrb- in truck toll revenues each year .
but economics minister wolfgang clement also hopes the state-of-the-art system will be an export hit doing away with the old-fashioned booths that still cause traffic congestions in many other european countries . on thursday , the czech transport ministry said it planned to introduce a similar electronic toll system for trucks on the country 's highways , possibly by the end of the year . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de smooth start for german truck toll germany ’ s brand new highway toll system for heavy trucks has got off to a smooth start dispelling fears of potential traffic disasters on monday morning .

" the introduction of the toll can not be at the expense of residents on national roadways and of traffic safety , " beckstein said according to german news agency dpa . technically , there is nothing standing in the way of expanding the satellite toll system to other streets - at least not eventually .

after the successful start of germany 's long troubled highway toll system for heavy commercial trucks , suggestions are already being made to expand the satellite-based technology to surface streets and normal cars . following a number of mishaps , germany 's high-tech toll system finally went into operation this week . held up for 16 months , the delay cost the german government billions in lost revenues .
but there were no major glitches on the country 's autobahns as had been feared , encouraging some politicians to consider how to widen the system 's reach . bavarian interior minister günther beckstein this week asked the federal government to collect the truck toll on some non-highway streets that could be possibly used by drivers to avoid paying the levy .
" the introduction of the toll can not be at the expense of residents on national roadways and of traffic safety , " beckstein said according to german news agency dpa . technically , there is nothing standing in the way of expanding the satellite toll system to other streets - at least not eventually .
currently the system is running on a slimmed-down version of the software that connects the trucks ' onboard units to the central computers of operator toll collect . the repeated delays were a major embarrassment for toll collect - the consortium made up of automaker daimlerchrysler , deutsche telekom and french motorway operator cofiroute .
but the successful start this year has opened the door to future possibilities for the pioneering system .
that could include levying a toll on the streets as suggested by beckstein , as well as charging normal cars for using the autobahn . advanced technology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the system uses gps technology to send an sms via germany 's gsm mobile telephone network to locate a vehicle .

not king as in " kaiser " , but as in elvis : king of rock n ' roll .
presley spent nearly two years in germany , one of the biggest music stars to have ever been in residence here .
from 1958 to 1960 , he was assigned as a gi in the 3rd armored division to ray barracks , in the small town of friedberg near frankfurt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elvis checks in at friedberg 's ray barracks at the time , officials worried that elvis 's visit would corrupt the area 's youth .
now , the town is tapping the elvis myth to help keep itself on the tourism map .
bad nauheim and the neighboring village of friedberg were utterly dull until some local hardcore elvis fans decided to liven up things , said hans-ulrich halwe , founder and honorary chairman of the bad nauheim-friedberg elvis presley club .
elvis slept here the club was formed in 1998 by halwe and a handful of others , but has since grown to more than 200 members .
they meet once a month in the bar of the " best western hotel rosenau " , which is decked out in elvis memorabilia , and stage elvis events , and give tours of the area .
this weekend , freidberg and bad nauheim are ground zero for the celebration of the king 's 70th birthday .
along with elvis impersonators doing a las vegas revival show and a gospel concert -lrb- harking back to the king 's church music roots -rrb- , there will be an exhibit of " elvis art " and daily elvis tours featuring anecdotes about his 18-month stay .
up to 50,000 people are expected to attend , with " chartered buses coming from berlin , from belgium , everywhere , " halwe said .
anyone planning a last minute visit can pretty much forget about staying in room 10 of the grünewald hotel , though .
that 's the room in the family-run hotel where elvis slept for several weeks in 1958 , and " the only place in europe where you can sleep in the same bed elvis slept in , " halwe said .
for big events it gets booked up to a year in advance , however .
elvis pressler ?
an honored guest at the bad nauheim festivities will be karl heinz stein , elvis ’ s military barber and the ace in the hole of bad nauheim 's elvis lore .
as someone who could handle the heartthrob 's head on a regular basis -lrb- haircuts were given every eight days or so -rrb- stein was forward-thinking enough to stash away a few locks of the star ’ s hair and hang on to his scissors and combs .
these objects have since been sold , ending up in private collections or , alternately , at the museum of german history , where a reconstruction of the military barber shop in friedberg is a centerpiece of the current " elvis in germany " exhibit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the interior of the bad nauheim hair salon where elvis got a trim , now in a museum stein clearly enjoys talking about his days as barber to the king and even claimed a certain kinship with the young tennesseean .
" there was something different about elvis , he was very special .
he was so generous ... so polite , so genteel .
you could n't say the same about all of his compatriots , " said stein . " i said even then , ' its like he is really a german , like he has german blood . '
and i turned out to be right . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans hold vigil on elvis death anniversary , in front of elvis performance image stein 's feeling that the presley family came not from english but german ancestry found a supporter a few years back in the form of donald presley , a distant cousin of elvis who was researching his roots .
donald claims that elvis 's bloodline reaches back to winemakers from the rhineland palatinate region named pressler .
-lrb- with scottish and english lineage researchers also claiming elvis as their own , it is up to each branch of the presley family to fight for their versions of the truth . -rrb-
calling maybelline ...
of course , the elvis following in germany , as well as the celebration of his birth , goes well beyond the borders of bad nauheim .
the country 's oldest and largest club , founded in 1978 and with about 2,000 members , is the elvis presley gesellschaft .
the web site of the elvis club berlin lists some 33 other active elvis clubs in germany , though it is an unofficial count .
members of these clubs use the internet to keep in touch and keep informed , with messages from germans with suspiciously southern-american names -lrb- maybelline , caroline , jacky , shakey -rrb- discussing topics like the size of elvis 's jumpsuits and announcing elvis radio specials .

in hamburg , an elvis imitator called shelvis performs , while berlin 's estrel theater has revived its popular " an evening with elvis . "
the well-reviewed show stars versatile irish elvis tribute artist grahame patrick doyle , who estrel fished out of las vegas ' teeming elvis waters several years ago .
with his music , elvis did , indeed , help usher social disarray into german society .
but today , the aspect of the king 's persona that most seems to warm german hearts is his history as a gospel singer .
an award-winning german elvis impersonator known simply as " rio , the voice of elvis " -lrb- yes , he has had his name officially changed -rrb- will do an elvis-sings-gospel show over the weekend in friedberg 's 600-seat church .
two years ago , a similar concert sold out .
singing the gospel " the best thing about elvis is his versatility ... few people realize this , but elvis is the only white singer to win grammy awards for his gospel music , " said the 40-year-old rio , who has been doing elvis since the age of 10 .
" its amazing to play a concert and move people to tears .
any music that touches the heart , that 's gospel . "
when elvis left bad nauheim , " he said he would come back and sing for all the people who had been so good to him here , " hans-ulrich halwe said .

this weekend , freidberg and bad nauheim are ground zero for the celebration of the king 's 70th birthday .
along with elvis impersonators doing a las vegas revival show and a gospel concert -lrb- harking back to the king 's church music roots -rrb- , there will be an exhibit of " elvis art " and daily elvis tours featuring anecdotes about his 18-month stay .
up to 50,000 people are expected to attend , with " chartered buses coming from berlin , from belgium , everywhere , " halwe said .
anyone planning a last minute visit can pretty much forget about staying in room 10 of the grünewald hotel , though .
that 's the room in the family-run hotel where elvis slept for several weeks in 1958 , and " the only place in europe where you can sleep in the same bed elvis slept in , " halwe said .
for big events it gets booked up to a year in advance , however .
elvis pressler ?
an honored guest at the bad nauheim festivities will be karl heinz stein , elvis ’ s military barber and the ace in the hole of bad nauheim 's elvis lore .
as someone who could handle the heartthrob 's head on a regular basis -lrb- haircuts were given every eight days or so -rrb- stein was forward-thinking enough to stash away a few locks of the star ’ s hair and hang on to his scissors and combs .
these objects have since been sold , ending up in private collections or , alternately , at the museum of german history , where a reconstruction of the military barber shop in friedberg is a centerpiece of the current " elvis in germany " exhibit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the interior of the bad nauheim hair salon where elvis got a trim , now in a museum stein clearly enjoys talking about his days as barber to the king and even claimed a certain kinship with the young tennesseean .
" there was something different about elvis , he was very special .
he was so generous ... so polite , so genteel .
you could n't say the same about all of his compatriots , " said stein . " i said even then , ' its like he is really a german , like he has german blood . '
and i turned out to be right . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans hold vigil on elvis death anniversary , in front of elvis performance image stein 's feeling that the presley family came not from english but german ancestry found a supporter a few years back in the form of donald presley , a distant cousin of elvis who was researching his roots .
donald claims that elvis 's bloodline reaches back to winemakers from the rhineland palatinate region named pressler .
-lrb- with scottish and english lineage researchers also claiming elvis as their own , it is up to each branch of the presley family to fight for their versions of the truth . -rrb-
calling maybelline ...
of course , the elvis following in germany , as well as the celebration of his birth , goes well beyond the borders of bad nauheim .
the country 's oldest and largest club , founded in 1978 and with about 2,000 members , is the elvis presley gesellschaft .
the web site of the elvis club berlin lists some 33 other active elvis clubs in germany , though it is an unofficial count .
members of these clubs use the internet to keep in touch and keep informed , with messages from germans with suspiciously southern-american names -lrb- maybelline , caroline , jacky , shakey -rrb- discussing topics like the size of elvis 's jumpsuits and announcing elvis radio specials .

in hamburg , an elvis imitator called shelvis performs , while berlin 's estrel theater has revived its popular " an evening with elvis . "
the well-reviewed show stars versatile irish elvis tribute artist grahame patrick doyle , who estrel fished out of las vegas ' teeming elvis waters several years ago .
with his music , elvis did , indeed , help usher social disarray into german society .
but today , the aspect of the king 's persona that most seems to warm german hearts is his history as a gospel singer .
an award-winning german elvis impersonator known simply as " rio , the voice of elvis " -lrb- yes , he has had his name officially changed -rrb- will do an elvis-sings-gospel show over the weekend in friedberg 's 600-seat church .
two years ago , a similar concert sold out .
singing the gospel " the best thing about elvis is his versatility ... few people realize this , but elvis is the only white singer to win grammy awards for his gospel music , " said the 40-year-old rio , who has been doing elvis since the age of 10 .
" its amazing to play a concert and move people to tears .
any music that touches the heart , that 's gospel . "
when elvis left bad nauheim , " he said he would come back and sing for all the people who had been so good to him here , " hans-ulrich halwe said .
because elvis 's manager refused to leave the country , though , elvis never took his show abroad .

not king as in " kaiser " , but as in elvis : king of rock n ' roll .
presley spent nearly two years in germany , one of the biggest music stars to have ever been in residence here .
from 1958 to 1960 , he was assigned as a gi in the 3rd armored division to ray barracks , in the small town of friedberg near frankfurt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elvis checks in at friedberg 's ray barracks at the time , officials worried that elvis 's visit would corrupt the area 's youth .
now , the town is tapping the elvis myth to help keep itself on the tourism map .
bad nauheim and the neighboring village of friedberg were utterly dull until some local hardcore elvis fans decided to liven up things , said hans-ulrich halwe , founder and honorary chairman of the bad nauheim-friedberg elvis presley club .
elvis slept here the club was formed in 1998 by halwe and a handful of others , but has since grown to more than 200 members .
they meet once a month in the bar of the " best western hotel rosenau " , which is decked out in elvis memorabilia , and stage elvis events , and give tours of the area .
this weekend , freidberg and bad nauheim are ground zero for the celebration of the king 's 70th birthday .
along with elvis impersonators doing a las vegas revival show and a gospel concert -lrb- harking back to the king 's church music roots -rrb- , there will be an exhibit of " elvis art " and daily elvis tours featuring anecdotes about his 18-month stay .
up to 50,000 people are expected to attend , with " chartered buses coming from berlin , from belgium , everywhere , " halwe said .
anyone planning a last minute visit can pretty much forget about staying in room 10 of the grünewald hotel , though .
that 's the room in the family-run hotel where elvis slept for several weeks in 1958 , and " the only place in europe where you can sleep in the same bed elvis slept in , " halwe said .
for big events it gets booked up to a year in advance , however .

the country 's oldest and largest club , founded in 1978 and with about 2,000 members , is the elvis presley gesellschaft .
the web site of the elvis club berlin lists some 33 other active elvis clubs in germany , though it is an unofficial count .
members of these clubs use the internet to keep in touch and keep informed , with messages from germans with suspiciously southern-american names -lrb- maybelline , caroline , jacky , shakey -rrb- discussing topics like the size of elvis 's jumpsuits and announcing elvis radio specials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg based elvis imitator , shelvis late night channel flippers around germany can expect to stumble across a lot of elvis movies , and anyone in a big city looking for an elvis party on friday or saturday wo n't have too much trouble finding one .
in hamburg , an elvis imitator called shelvis performs , while berlin 's estrel theater has revived its popular " an evening with elvis . "
the well-reviewed show stars versatile irish elvis tribute artist grahame patrick doyle , who estrel fished out of las vegas ' teeming elvis waters several years ago .
with his music , elvis did , indeed , help usher social disarray into german society .
but today , the aspect of the king 's persona that most seems to warm german hearts is his history as a gospel singer .
an award-winning german elvis impersonator known simply as " rio , the voice of elvis " -lrb- yes , he has had his name officially changed -rrb- will do an elvis-sings-gospel show over the weekend in friedberg 's 600-seat church .
two years ago , a similar concert sold out .
singing the gospel " the best thing about elvis is his versatility ... few people realize this , but elvis is the only white singer to win grammy awards for his gospel music , " said the 40-year-old rio , who has been doing elvis since the age of 10 .
" its amazing to play a concert and move people to tears .
any music that touches the heart , that 's gospel . "
when elvis left bad nauheim , " he said he would come back and sing for all the people who had been so good to him here , " hans-ulrich halwe said .
because elvis 's manager refused to leave the country , though , elvis never took his show abroad .
" i 'm still waiting , " added halwe with a laugh . jennifer abramsohn , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de elvis lives on in bonn forget memphis , las vegas and graceland - germany has always had a special place in its heart for elvis , and now , anyone wanting a personal glimpse of the man behind the myth need go no further than bonn .

dw-world spoke to birger-gottfried lühr of the geo research center in potsdam , which wants to help . dw-world : at the donor conference for the tsunami victims , it was decided to introduce a warning system to the affected region .
what would be the exact role of the geo research center in implementing such a system ?
birger-gottfried lühr : our area of expertise is recording seismic activity and quickly analyzing signals registered .
in addition to this , each year we conduct a seismology training course , held alternately in potsdam and a country which is endangered by seismic activity .
so that means it would largely be your task to quickly recognize earthquakes .
but not every earthquake leads to a tsunami .
no , only a small number of earthquakes trigger tsunamis , but besides volcanic eruptions , they are the main cause .
it is critical to be able to recognize that an earthquake is coming and be able to see their movement in order to determine the likelihood of a tsunami .
what else would be involved in an early warning system besides an ability to recognize the danger in time ?
early warning does n't mean erecting a box somewhere which would ring at the critical moment .
we need a system which transports information from the decision-makers to the fishermen on the beach , who would then need to know what to do .
so it 's also a problem of training and understanding .
how long would it take to get such a system up and running ?
even if we were to set to it with the same verve as the japanese or the americans , it would still take a couple of years .
they are still improving their own system .
at the donor conference , kofi annan noted that japan could play a leading role in an early warning system , given that the japanese system is already very good .
does that mean it would be japanese rather than german researchers providing the technology for an early warning system ?
i think this incident has proven that natural catastrophes are a global problem .
every country on the planet should work together to reduce risk .
it is definitely an advantage that japan has already done some of the footwork , but i do n't believe the japanese should do it on their own .
have there already been international efforts to create a better system of protection against natural catastrophes ?
yes , we 've been thinking about this task for a long time .
there was a united nations initiative for the reduction of natural catastrophes between 1990 and 2000 , and there is also an initiative for the future , which would build on this .
so , yes , in the wider context , some preliminary work has already been done .
is there any existing cooperation between the different research institutes ?
yes , we are not starting from scratch .
we already work with many groups on a scientific level , we already have contacts with scientists .
i am part of a project which works in java and the sunda islands , and there are a number of indonesian institutes involved .
we run a network with many stations across the world which record earthquakes , but they have to be improved , concentrated and appraised .
has the geo research institute received any official requests to become involved ?
as an employee here , i have noticed certain signals that there is a wish for us to become more actively involved . markus roman -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany keen on south asia partnerships chancellor schröder wants to go beyond immediate financial and humanitarian aid to the tsunami-hit nations by proposing bilateral " partnerships .

dw-world spoke to birger-gottfried lühr of the geo research center in potsdam , which wants to help . dw-world : at the donor conference for the tsunami victims , it was decided to introduce a warning system to the affected region .
what would be the exact role of the geo research center in implementing such a system ?
birger-gottfried lühr : our area of expertise is recording seismic activity and quickly analyzing signals registered .
in addition to this , each year we conduct a seismology training course , held alternately in potsdam and a country which is endangered by seismic activity .
so that means it would largely be your task to quickly recognize earthquakes .
but not every earthquake leads to a tsunami .
no , only a small number of earthquakes trigger tsunamis , but besides volcanic eruptions , they are the main cause .
it is critical to be able to recognize that an earthquake is coming and be able to see their movement in order to determine the likelihood of a tsunami .
what else would be involved in an early warning system besides an ability to recognize the danger in time ?
early warning does n't mean erecting a box somewhere which would ring at the critical moment .
we need a system which transports information from the decision-makers to the fishermen on the beach , who would then need to know what to do .
so it 's also a problem of training and understanding .
how long would it take to get such a system up and running ?
even if we were to set to it with the same verve as the japanese or the americans , it would still take a couple of years .
they are still improving their own system .
at the donor conference , kofi annan noted that japan could play a leading role in an early warning system , given that the japanese system is already very good .
does that mean it would be japanese rather than german researchers providing the technology for an early warning system ?
i think this incident has proven that natural catastrophes are a global problem .
every country on the planet should work together to reduce risk .
it is definitely an advantage that japan has already done some of the footwork , but i do n't believe the japanese should do it on their own .
have there already been international efforts to create a better system of protection against natural catastrophes ?
yes , we 've been thinking about this task for a long time .
there was a united nations initiative for the reduction of natural catastrophes between 1990 and 2000 , and there is also an initiative for the future , which would build on this .
so , yes , in the wider context , some preliminary work has already been done .
is there any existing cooperation between the different research institutes ?
yes , we are not starting from scratch .
we already work with many groups on a scientific level , we already have contacts with scientists .
i am part of a project which works in java and the sunda islands , and there are a number of indonesian institutes involved .
we run a network with many stations across the world which record earthquakes , but they have to be improved , concentrated and appraised .
has the geo research institute received any official requests to become involved ?

dw-world spoke to birger-gottfried lühr of the geo research center in potsdam , which wants to help . dw-world : at the donor conference for the tsunami victims , it was decided to introduce a warning system to the affected region .
what would be the exact role of the geo research center in implementing such a system ?
birger-gottfried lühr : our area of expertise is recording seismic activity and quickly analyzing signals registered .
in addition to this , each year we conduct a seismology training course , held alternately in potsdam and a country which is endangered by seismic activity .
so that means it would largely be your task to quickly recognize earthquakes .
but not every earthquake leads to a tsunami .
no , only a small number of earthquakes trigger tsunamis , but besides volcanic eruptions , they are the main cause .
it is critical to be able to recognize that an earthquake is coming and be able to see their movement in order to determine the likelihood of a tsunami .
what else would be involved in an early warning system besides an ability to recognize the danger in time ?
early warning does n't mean erecting a box somewhere which would ring at the critical moment .
we need a system which transports information from the decision-makers to the fishermen on the beach , who would then need to know what to do .
so it 's also a problem of training and understanding .
how long would it take to get such a system up and running ?
even if we were to set to it with the same verve as the japanese or the americans , it would still take a couple of years .
they are still improving their own system .
at the donor conference , kofi annan noted that japan could play a leading role in an early warning system , given that the japanese system is already very good .
does that mean it would be japanese rather than german researchers providing the technology for an early warning system ?
i think this incident has proven that natural catastrophes are a global problem .
every country on the planet should work together to reduce risk .
it is definitely an advantage that japan has already done some of the footwork , but i do n't believe the japanese should do it on their own .
have there already been international efforts to create a better system of protection against natural catastrophes ?
yes , we 've been thinking about this task for a long time .
there was a united nations initiative for the reduction of natural catastrophes between 1990 and 2000 , and there is also an initiative for the future , which would build on this .
so , yes , in the wider context , some preliminary work has already been done .
is there any existing cooperation between the different research institutes ?
yes , we are not starting from scratch .
we already work with many groups on a scientific level , we already have contacts with scientists .
i am part of a project which works in java and the sunda islands , and there are a number of indonesian institutes involved .
we run a network with many stations across the world which record earthquakes , but they have to be improved , concentrated and appraised .
has the geo research institute received any official requests to become involved ?
as an employee here , i have noticed certain signals that there is a wish for us to become more actively involved . markus roman -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany keen on south asia partnerships chancellor schröder wants to go beyond immediate financial and humanitarian aid to the tsunami-hit nations by proposing bilateral " partnerships .

imagine air will offer low-cost flights on the internet to and from germany , britain and the netherlands , much like bexx air did for eight months before bulgarian authorities shut its offices for operating without a proper licence .
bexx air then cancelled its flights and over 100 passengers are still waiting to get money back for their unused tickets .
dirk wiesemann , bexx air 's chief executive has promised the new company will reimburse all bexx air 's clients .
according to media reports , the bulgarian transport ministry has refused to liberalize the aviation market and let in major low cost airlines such as irish budget airline ryanair . dw-world.de lufthansa forges ahead with cost-cutting lufthansa airlines has reached an agreement with pilots to freeze pay and make hours more flexible .

the main aim of the meeting , according to the eu presidency , was to coordinate ideas ahead of a un-hosted donors ' conference in geneva next week . " there are a number of ideas which have been floated , " francoise le bail , a spokeswoman for the european commission , told reporters .
" it is important to make sure that the response we make , the proposals we put forward , are the right ones . " besides ministers from the 25-member bloc , participants included david nabarro , the top official at the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- dealing with humanitarian crises , as well as carol bellamy , the head of unicef . rapid response and long-term aid besides debt relief , ministers threw their support behind a tsunami warning system for the indian ocean region .
they also looked at how it might respond to large-scale disasters in the future . earlier in the week , the eu 's external affairs commissioner , benita ferrero-waldner , had proposed creating a 5000-strong " crisis management corps . "
but at the meeting on friday , eu governments said they preferred putting the focus on a " rapid response " aid force that would be made up of coordinated national forces . germany 's foreign minister , joschka fischer , called on the eu to improve coordination in response to crises , warning that for a response force to be effective , it would have to first be efficient . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : survivors in sri lanka discussions in brussels also included a german initiative to partner countries , municipalities and even schools in europe with the region to help with long-term reconstruction . the eu and its member states have pledged aid to the region worth nearly € 1.5 billion -lrb- $ 2 billion -rrb- in the wake of the earthquake and tsunami disaster which has left more than 146,000 dead , including hundreds , possibly thousands of european tourists . eu governments so far have pledged over € 1 billion in aid while the eu commission has earmarked € 450 million . helping themselves , too eu ministers also stressed the need for governments of countries in the region to continue to play their part in helping their own citizens and warned that the long-running internal conflicts in sri lanka and the aceh province of indonesia should not interfere with relief efforts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers perpare emergency hospital containers for shipment to indonesia " the council launched an appeal so that aid can be delivered rapidly to all populations concerned , independent of the internal conflicts in some of the countries affected , " said the ministers in a draft conclusion document . several ministers at the meeting were returning from or heading to the disaster region .
germany 's fischer is scheduled to fly to thailand directly after the talks .
his british counterpart , jack straw , was absent from the meeting since he is currently in the region . temporary refuge on friday , the eu 's commissioner for justice , freedom and security , franco frattini , told the italian newspaper la repubblica that europe might offer temporary refuge to hundreds of thousands of children affected by the disaster . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : survivors are threatened by epidemics he said he had proposed offering to bring the children to the eu for several months , which would hopefully allow them to recover from their trauma and put them beyond the reach of criminal gangs which have been reported targeting lone children . the united nations children 's fund confirmed a case in indonesia of trafficking in children orphaned or separated from parents .
countries were warned to be on high alert for kidnappers . bringing children to the eu would require an extension of the bloc 's temporary asylum rules . the united nations estimates that 1.5 million children have been affected and are likely to suffer more than adults .

" i can only call on deutsche börse to retain its headquarters in frankfurt , " if a merger with lse were to come about , green party politician christine scheel , head of the german parliament 's financial committee , told business daily handelsblatt .
the finance expert of the opposition conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , heinz seiffert , also said that politicians should do everything to ensure that the decision regarding the merged company 's future headquarters should fall in germany 's favour . charm offensive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche börse in frankfurt in the battle for the lse , deutsche börse appears to be pulling out all the stops to convince the lse of the virtues of a frankfurt-london tie-up rather than a merger with frankfurt 's arch-rival , paris-based rival euronext .
the german company has so far put a bid of just under € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- on the table for the london market .
but , in an effort to win over the lse , deutsche börse has not only changed its official language to english , but has reportedly offered to manage the combined cash equities markets out of london and has also offered lse chief clara furse that job . furthermore , newspaper reports this week said the operator of the frankfurt stock exchange was ready to raise its offer and might even consider selling its luxembourg-based learstream unit , which many observers saw as the main stumbling block to a london-frankfurt tie-up . constructive meeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner g. seifert furse met with deutsche börse chief werner seifert -lrb- pictured -rrb- in london on thursday . a spokesman for the german group said the talks had been " friendly , constructive and professional " .
he declined to provide any further details .
furse was said to be meeting euronext boss jean-francois theodore on friday .
those talks were confidential and their outcome would not be made public , well-informed sources in paris told afp .
the negotiations were likely to last weeks rather than days . a german finance ministry spokesman insisted that the government expected the decision about the location of the headquarters of any merged group to fall in frankfurt 's favor .
the merger talks were an expression " of the strength of germany as a financial centre " , the spokesman said .
and that strength would be further enhanced in the event of a merger . fear of loss of jobs but , deutsche börse 's employees appear to be alarmed that they could lose their jobs .
the financial times deutschland reported in its friday edition that the group 's works council saw " urgent need for consultation " between employee representatives and management on the matter .
chairman seifert had insisted that there would be no compulsory redundancies if a merger went ahead .
and financial sources said friday that such fears were " unfounded " .
indeed , jobs could be in greater peril if a merger did not take place and frankfurt saw its importance as a stock market dwindle , the sources said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 07.01.2005 tsunami aid to have little economic impact großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsunami victims depend on immediate aid several nations have pledged unprecedented amounts of aid to countries struck by the asian tsunami .
but the record sums wo n't create massive budgetary problems around the world , according to experts . official aid for last month 's earthquake-tsunami disaster has been sizable .
germany on wednesday increased its pledge to € 500 million -lrb- $ 662 million -rrb- to become the world 's largest donor . but that amount was topped only hours later after australia said it would donate € 578 million to the catastrophe .
japan is the third largest donor with € 378 million and the united states has pledged € 265 million .
even tiny norway will give € 130 million . the offers of aid have come despite the fact that most rich industrial nations are currently running budget deficits .
for example , the united states will record a budget deficit of 4.5 percent in 2004 .
in europe , france and germany are both struggling to stick to the eu 's stability pact , which underpins the economic foundations of the euro . but experts are n't concerned that the commendable instinct to aid those suffering due to the tsunami could have a negative impact on the world 's economy .
" budgets are strained all over - except for perhaps in sweden and finland , " said ivo bischoff , an economist at the university of gießen .
" but these are all things that will come down to decimal figures . " klaus-jürgen gern from the kiel institute for world economics agreed .
he acknowledged germany 's pledge was large , however , " it will be paid out over at least three years , " he also pointed out . money coming and going most donor nations are more concerned about how the money will be spent than where it will come from .
germany is no exception .
" in principle , we ask aid organizations to name projects , " a spokesman for the foreign ministry told dw-world .
" they can determine extremely quickly what is needed .

thousands of villagers have begun returning to their homes after fleeing the tsunamis that pounded malaysia 's northwestern coast , officials said sunday .
-lrb- ap photo / teh eng koon -rrb- most frequently , the funds for immediate aid go directly to local partner organizations or international aid outfits that can transport food , water and clothing on their own .
the spokesman said there were two man criteria : food is bought in the affected regions to save transport costs and money is given only to groups with a clear system of distribution . the aid given out for the tsunami damage could bring germany closer to an important goal : according to a un agreement , member states should aim to spend at least 0.7 percent of their gdp on development aid .
germany currently only spends 0.3 percent . how much the aid for the tsunami will further such progress remains unclear , however . " it will depend on where exactly the € 500 million comes from , " said a spokesman for the german development ministry .

germany 's fischer is scheduled to fly to thailand directly after the talks .
his british counterpart , jack straw , was absent from the meeting since he is currently in the region . temporary refuge on friday , the eu 's commissioner for justice , freedom and security , franco frattini , told the italian newspaper la repubblica that europe might offer temporary refuge to hundreds of thousands of children affected by the disaster . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : survivors are threatened by epidemics he said he had proposed offering to bring the children to the eu for several months , which would hopefully allow them to recover from their trauma and put them beyond the reach of criminal gangs which have been reported targeting lone children . the united nations children 's fund confirmed a case in indonesia of trafficking in children orphaned or separated from parents .
countries were warned to be on high alert for kidnappers . bringing children to the eu would require an extension of the bloc 's temporary asylum rules . the united nations estimates that 1.5 million children have been affected and are likely to suffer more than adults .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 07.01.2005 the king is dead , long live the king großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elvis was stationed in bad nauheim for 18 months germany is marking elvis presley ’ s 70th birthday with television specials , a rash of live shows , and four straight days of " elvisiana " in the town where the young star was stationed as a gi . germans have long claimed a special relationship to the king .
not king as in " kaiser " , but as in elvis : king of rock n ' roll .
presley spent nearly two years in germany , one of the biggest music stars to have ever been in residence here .
from 1958 to 1960 , he was assigned as a gi in the 3rd armored division to ray barracks , in the small town of friedberg near frankfurt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elvis checks in at friedberg 's ray barracks at the time , officials worried that elvis 's visit would corrupt the area 's youth .
now , the town is tapping the elvis myth to help keep itself on the tourism map .
bad nauheim and the neighboring village of friedberg were utterly dull until some local hardcore elvis fans decided to liven up things , said hans-ulrich halwe , founder and honorary chairman of the bad nauheim-friedberg elvis presley club .
elvis slept here the club was formed in 1998 by halwe and a handful of others , but has since grown to more than 200 members .
they meet once a month in the bar of the " best western hotel rosenau " , which is decked out in elvis memorabilia , and stage elvis events , and give tours of the area .
this weekend , freidberg and bad nauheim are ground zero for the celebration of the king 's 70th birthday .
along with elvis impersonators doing a las vegas revival show and a gospel concert -lrb- harking back to the king 's church music roots -rrb- , there will be an exhibit of " elvis art " and daily elvis tours featuring anecdotes about his 18-month stay .
up to 50,000 people are expected to attend , with " chartered buses coming from berlin , from belgium , everywhere , " halwe said .
anyone planning a last minute visit can pretty much forget about staying in room 10 of the grünewald hotel , though .
that 's the room in the family-run hotel where elvis slept for several weeks in 1958 , and " the only place in europe where you can sleep in the same bed elvis slept in , " halwe said .
for big events it gets booked up to a year in advance , however .
elvis pressler ?
an honored guest at the bad nauheim festivities will be karl heinz stein , elvis ’ s military barber and the ace in the hole of bad nauheim 's elvis lore .
as someone who could handle the heartthrob 's head on a regular basis -lrb- haircuts were given every eight days or so -rrb- stein was forward-thinking enough to stash away a few locks of the star ’ s hair and hang on to his scissors and combs .
these objects have since been sold , ending up in private collections or , alternately , at the museum of german history , where a reconstruction of the military barber shop in friedberg is a centerpiece of the current " elvis in germany " exhibit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the interior of the bad nauheim hair salon where elvis got a trim , now in a museum stein clearly enjoys talking about his days as barber to the king and even claimed a certain kinship with the young tennesseean .
" there was something different about elvis , he was very special .
he was so generous ... so polite , so genteel .
you could n't say the same about all of his compatriots , " said stein . " i said even then , ' its like he is really a german , like he has german blood . '
and i turned out to be right . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans hold vigil on elvis death anniversary , in front of elvis performance image stein 's feeling that the presley family came not from english but german ancestry found a supporter a few years back in the form of donald presley , a distant cousin of elvis who was researching his roots .
donald claims that elvis 's bloodline reaches back to winemakers from the rhineland palatinate region named pressler .
-lrb- with scottish and english lineage researchers also claiming elvis as their own , it is up to each branch of the presley family to fight for their versions of the truth . -rrb-
calling maybelline ...
of course , the elvis following in germany , as well as the celebration of his birth , goes well beyond the borders of bad nauheim .
the country 's oldest and largest club , founded in 1978 and with about 2,000 members , is the elvis presley gesellschaft .
the web site of the elvis club berlin lists some 33 other active elvis clubs in germany , though it is an unofficial count .
members of these clubs use the internet to keep in touch and keep informed , with messages from germans with suspiciously southern-american names -lrb- maybelline , caroline , jacky , shakey -rrb- discussing topics like the size of elvis 's jumpsuits and announcing elvis radio specials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg based elvis imitator , shelvis late night channel flippers around germany can expect to stumble across a lot of elvis movies , and anyone in a big city looking for an elvis party on friday or saturday wo n't have too much trouble finding one .
in hamburg , an elvis imitator called shelvis performs , while berlin 's estrel theater has revived its popular " an evening with elvis . "
the well-reviewed show stars versatile irish elvis tribute artist grahame patrick doyle , who estrel fished out of las vegas ' teeming elvis waters several years ago .
with his music , elvis did , indeed , help usher social disarray into german society .
but today , the aspect of the king 's persona that most seems to warm german hearts is his history as a gospel singer .
an award-winning german elvis impersonator known simply as " rio , the voice of elvis " -lrb- yes , he has had his name officially changed -rrb- will do an elvis-sings-gospel show over the weekend in friedberg 's 600-seat church .
two years ago , a similar concert sold out .
singing the gospel " the best thing about elvis is his versatility ... few people realize this , but elvis is the only white singer to win grammy awards for his gospel music , " said the 40-year-old rio , who has been doing elvis since the age of 10 .
" its amazing to play a concert and move people to tears .
any music that touches the heart , that 's gospel . "
when elvis left bad nauheim , " he said he would come back and sing for all the people who had been so good to him here , " hans-ulrich halwe said .
because elvis 's manager refused to leave the country , though , elvis never took his show abroad .
" i 'm still waiting , " added halwe with a laugh . jennifer abramsohn , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de elvis lives on in bonn forget memphis , las vegas and graceland - germany has always had a special place in its heart for elvis , and now , anyone wanting a personal glimpse of the man behind the myth need go no further than bonn .

not king as in " kaiser " , but as in elvis : king of rock n ' roll .
presley spent nearly two years in germany , one of the biggest music stars to have ever been in residence here .
from 1958 to 1960 , he was assigned as a gi in the 3rd armored division to ray barracks , in the small town of friedberg near frankfurt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elvis checks in at friedberg 's ray barracks at the time , officials worried that elvis 's visit would corrupt the area 's youth .
now , the town is tapping the elvis myth to help keep itself on the tourism map .
bad nauheim and the neighboring village of friedberg were utterly dull until some local hardcore elvis fans decided to liven up things , said hans-ulrich halwe , founder and honorary chairman of the bad nauheim-friedberg elvis presley club .
elvis slept here the club was formed in 1998 by halwe and a handful of others , but has since grown to more than 200 members .
they meet once a month in the bar of the " best western hotel rosenau " , which is decked out in elvis memorabilia , and stage elvis events , and give tours of the area .
this weekend , freidberg and bad nauheim are ground zero for the celebration of the king 's 70th birthday .
along with elvis impersonators doing a las vegas revival show and a gospel concert -lrb- harking back to the king 's church music roots -rrb- , there will be an exhibit of " elvis art " and daily elvis tours featuring anecdotes about his 18-month stay .
up to 50,000 people are expected to attend , with " chartered buses coming from berlin , from belgium , everywhere , " halwe said .
anyone planning a last minute visit can pretty much forget about staying in room 10 of the grünewald hotel , though .
that 's the room in the family-run hotel where elvis slept for several weeks in 1958 , and " the only place in europe where you can sleep in the same bed elvis slept in , " halwe said .
for big events it gets booked up to a year in advance , however .
elvis pressler ?
an honored guest at the bad nauheim festivities will be karl heinz stein , elvis ’ s military barber and the ace in the hole of bad nauheim 's elvis lore .
as someone who could handle the heartthrob 's head on a regular basis -lrb- haircuts were given every eight days or so -rrb- stein was forward-thinking enough to stash away a few locks of the star ’ s hair and hang on to his scissors and combs .
these objects have since been sold , ending up in private collections or , alternately , at the museum of german history , where a reconstruction of the military barber shop in friedberg is a centerpiece of the current " elvis in germany " exhibit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the interior of the bad nauheim hair salon where elvis got a trim , now in a museum stein clearly enjoys talking about his days as barber to the king and even claimed a certain kinship with the young tennesseean .
" there was something different about elvis , he was very special .
he was so generous ... so polite , so genteel .
you could n't say the same about all of his compatriots , " said stein . " i said even then , ' its like he is really a german , like he has german blood . '
and i turned out to be right . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans hold vigil on elvis death anniversary , in front of elvis performance image stein 's feeling that the presley family came not from english but german ancestry found a supporter a few years back in the form of donald presley , a distant cousin of elvis who was researching his roots .
donald claims that elvis 's bloodline reaches back to winemakers from the rhineland palatinate region named pressler .
-lrb- with scottish and english lineage researchers also claiming elvis as their own , it is up to each branch of the presley family to fight for their versions of the truth . -rrb-
calling maybelline ...
of course , the elvis following in germany , as well as the celebration of his birth , goes well beyond the borders of bad nauheim .
the country 's oldest and largest club , founded in 1978 and with about 2,000 members , is the elvis presley gesellschaft .
the web site of the elvis club berlin lists some 33 other active elvis clubs in germany , though it is an unofficial count .
members of these clubs use the internet to keep in touch and keep informed , with messages from germans with suspiciously southern-american names -lrb- maybelline , caroline , jacky , shakey -rrb- discussing topics like the size of elvis 's jumpsuits and announcing elvis radio specials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg based elvis imitator , shelvis late night channel flippers around germany can expect to stumble across a lot of elvis movies , and anyone in a big city looking for an elvis party on friday or saturday wo n't have too much trouble finding one .
in hamburg , an elvis imitator called shelvis performs , while berlin 's estrel theater has revived its popular " an evening with elvis . "
the well-reviewed show stars versatile irish elvis tribute artist grahame patrick doyle , who estrel fished out of las vegas ' teeming elvis waters several years ago .
with his music , elvis did , indeed , help usher social disarray into german society .
but today , the aspect of the king 's persona that most seems to warm german hearts is his history as a gospel singer .
an award-winning german elvis impersonator known simply as " rio , the voice of elvis " -lrb- yes , he has had his name officially changed -rrb- will do an elvis-sings-gospel show over the weekend in friedberg 's 600-seat church .
two years ago , a similar concert sold out .
singing the gospel " the best thing about elvis is his versatility ... few people realize this , but elvis is the only white singer to win grammy awards for his gospel music , " said the 40-year-old rio , who has been doing elvis since the age of 10 .
" its amazing to play a concert and move people to tears .
any music that touches the heart , that 's gospel . "
when elvis left bad nauheim , " he said he would come back and sing for all the people who had been so good to him here , " hans-ulrich halwe said .
because elvis 's manager refused to leave the country , though , elvis never took his show abroad .

after the successful start of germany 's long troubled highway toll system for heavy commercial trucks , suggestions are already being made to expand the satellite-based technology to surface streets and normal cars . following a number of mishaps , germany 's high-tech toll system finally went into operation this week . held up for 16 months , the delay cost the german government billions in lost revenues .
but there were no major glitches on the country 's autobahns as had been feared , encouraging some politicians to consider how to widen the system 's reach . bavarian interior minister günther beckstein this week asked the federal government to collect the truck toll on some non-highway streets that could be possibly used by drivers to avoid paying the levy .
" the introduction of the toll can not be at the expense of residents on national roadways and of traffic safety , " beckstein said according to german news agency dpa . technically , there is nothing standing in the way of expanding the satellite toll system to other streets - at least not eventually .
currently the system is running on a slimmed-down version of the software that connects the trucks ' onboard units to the central computers of operator toll collect . the repeated delays were a major embarrassment for toll collect - the consortium made up of automaker daimlerchrysler , deutsche telekom and french motorway operator cofiroute .
but the successful start this year has opened the door to future possibilities for the pioneering system .
that could include levying a toll on the streets as suggested by beckstein , as well as charging normal cars for using the autobahn . advanced technology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the system uses gps technology to send an sms via germany 's gsm mobile telephone network to locate a vehicle .

" at any time it can be expanded to other parts of the street network or the price can be changed easily . " no one is expecting the german government to begin pushing for an auto toll soon .
but , with the transport ministry strapped for cash and road projects suffering accordingly , some experts believe it is only a matter of time . " i think the toll for cars will come quickly simply due to financial reasons , " werner rothengatter from the university of karlsruhe said .
an advisor to the transport ministry , he said he expected the issue would be raised shortly after the next general election in 2006 .
rothengatter added that car owners could be co-opted to support the toll by offering compensation in the way of lower auto taxes . the german government expects about € 2.5 billion -lrb- $ 3.30 billion -rrb- in truck toll revenues each year .
but economics minister wolfgang clement also hopes the state-of-the-art system will be an export hit doing away with the old-fashioned booths that still cause traffic congestions in many other european countries . on thursday , the czech transport ministry said it planned to introduce a similar electronic toll system for trucks on the country 's highways , possibly by the end of the year . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de smooth start for german truck toll germany ’ s brand new highway toll system for heavy trucks has got off to a smooth start dispelling fears of potential traffic disasters on monday morning .

but there were no major glitches on the country 's autobahns as had been feared , encouraging some politicians to consider how to widen the system 's reach . bavarian interior minister günther beckstein this week asked the federal government to collect the truck toll on some non-highway streets that could be possibly used by drivers to avoid paying the levy .
" the introduction of the toll can not be at the expense of residents on national roadways and of traffic safety , " beckstein said according to german news agency dpa . technically , there is nothing standing in the way of expanding the satellite toll system to other streets - at least not eventually .

but the record sums wo n't create massive budgetary problems around the world , according to experts . official aid for last month 's earthquake-tsunami disaster has been sizable .
germany on wednesday increased its pledge to € 500 million -lrb- $ 662 million -rrb- to become the world 's largest donor . but that amount was topped only hours later after australia said it would donate € 578 million to the catastrophe .
japan is the third largest donor with € 378 million and the united states has pledged € 265 million .
even tiny norway will give € 130 million . the offers of aid have come despite the fact that most rich industrial nations are currently running budget deficits .
for example , the united states will record a budget deficit of 4.5 percent in 2004 .
in europe , france and germany are both struggling to stick to the eu 's stability pact , which underpins the economic foundations of the euro . but experts are n't concerned that the commendable instinct to aid those suffering due to the tsunami could have a negative impact on the world 's economy .
" budgets are strained all over - except for perhaps in sweden and finland , " said ivo bischoff , an economist at the university of gießen .
" but these are all things that will come down to decimal figures . " klaus-jürgen gern from the kiel institute for world economics agreed .
he acknowledged germany 's pledge was large , however , " it will be paid out over at least three years , " he also pointed out . money coming and going most donor nations are more concerned about how the money will be spent than where it will come from .
germany is no exception .
" in principle , we ask aid organizations to name projects , " a spokesman for the foreign ministry told dw-world .
" they can determine extremely quickly what is needed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : malaysian volunteers are busy packing clothes and food supplies for the tsunami victims across asian countries at the malaysian red crescent society headquarters in kuala lumpur sunday , jan .
2 , 2005 .
thousands of villagers have begun returning to their homes after fleeing the tsunamis that pounded malaysia 's northwestern coast , officials said sunday .
-lrb- ap photo / teh eng koon -rrb- most frequently , the funds for immediate aid go directly to local partner organizations or international aid outfits that can transport food , water and clothing on their own .
the spokesman said there were two man criteria : food is bought in the affected regions to save transport costs and money is given only to groups with a clear system of distribution . the aid given out for the tsunami damage could bring germany closer to an important goal : according to a un agreement , member states should aim to spend at least 0.7 percent of their gdp on development aid .
germany currently only spends 0.3 percent . how much the aid for the tsunami will further such progress remains unclear , however . " it will depend on where exactly the € 500 million comes from , " said a spokesman for the german development ministry .
" at the moment it 's impossible to say anything exact .

germany 's fischer is scheduled to fly to thailand directly after the talks .
his british counterpart , jack straw , was absent from the meeting since he is currently in the region . temporary refuge on friday , the eu 's commissioner for justice , freedom and security , franco frattini , told the italian newspaper la repubblica that europe might offer temporary refuge to hundreds of thousands of children affected by the disaster . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : survivors are threatened by epidemics he said he had proposed offering to bring the children to the eu for several months , which would hopefully allow them to recover from their trauma and put them beyond the reach of criminal gangs which have been reported targeting lone children . the united nations children 's fund confirmed a case in indonesia of trafficking in children orphaned or separated from parents .

his british counterpart , jack straw , was absent from the meeting since he is currently in the region . temporary refuge on friday , the eu 's commissioner for justice , freedom and security , franco frattini , told the italian newspaper la repubblica that europe might offer temporary refuge to hundreds of thousands of children affected by the disaster . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : survivors are threatened by epidemics he said he had proposed offering to bring the children to the eu for several months , which would hopefully allow them to recover from their trauma and put them beyond the reach of criminal gangs which have been reported targeting lone children . the united nations children 's fund confirmed a case in indonesia of trafficking in children orphaned or separated from parents .
countries were warned to be on high alert for kidnappers . bringing children to the eu would require an extension of the bloc 's temporary asylum rules . the united nations estimates that 1.5 million children have been affected and are likely to suffer more than adults .

dw-world spoke to birger-gottfried lühr of the geo research center in potsdam , which wants to help . dw-world : at the donor conference for the tsunami victims , it was decided to introduce a warning system to the affected region .
what would be the exact role of the geo research center in implementing such a system ?
birger-gottfried lühr : our area of expertise is recording seismic activity and quickly analyzing signals registered .
in addition to this , each year we conduct a seismology training course , held alternately in potsdam and a country which is endangered by seismic activity .
so that means it would largely be your task to quickly recognize earthquakes .
but not every earthquake leads to a tsunami .
no , only a small number of earthquakes trigger tsunamis , but besides volcanic eruptions , they are the main cause .
it is critical to be able to recognize that an earthquake is coming and be able to see their movement in order to determine the likelihood of a tsunami .
what else would be involved in an early warning system besides an ability to recognize the danger in time ?
early warning does n't mean erecting a box somewhere which would ring at the critical moment .
we need a system which transports information from the decision-makers to the fishermen on the beach , who would then need to know what to do .
so it 's also a problem of training and understanding .
how long would it take to get such a system up and running ?
even if we were to set to it with the same verve as the japanese or the americans , it would still take a couple of years .
they are still improving their own system .
at the donor conference , kofi annan noted that japan could play a leading role in an early warning system , given that the japanese system is already very good .
does that mean it would be japanese rather than german researchers providing the technology for an early warning system ?
i think this incident has proven that natural catastrophes are a global problem .
every country on the planet should work together to reduce risk .
it is definitely an advantage that japan has already done some of the footwork , but i do n't believe the japanese should do it on their own .
have there already been international efforts to create a better system of protection against natural catastrophes ?
yes , we 've been thinking about this task for a long time .
there was a united nations initiative for the reduction of natural catastrophes between 1990 and 2000 , and there is also an initiative for the future , which would build on this .
so , yes , in the wider context , some preliminary work has already been done .
is there any existing cooperation between the different research institutes ?
yes , we are not starting from scratch .
we already work with many groups on a scientific level , we already have contacts with scientists .
i am part of a project which works in java and the sunda islands , and there are a number of indonesian institutes involved .
we run a network with many stations across the world which record earthquakes , but they have to be improved , concentrated and appraised .
has the geo research institute received any official requests to become involved ?
as an employee here , i have noticed certain signals that there is a wish for us to become more actively involved . markus roman -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany keen on south asia partnerships chancellor schröder wants to go beyond immediate financial and humanitarian aid to the tsunami-hit nations by proposing bilateral " partnerships .

it is critical to be able to recognize that an earthquake is coming and be able to see their movement in order to determine the likelihood of a tsunami .
what else would be involved in an early warning system besides an ability to recognize the danger in time ?
early warning does n't mean erecting a box somewhere which would ring at the critical moment .
we need a system which transports information from the decision-makers to the fishermen on the beach , who would then need to know what to do .
so it 's also a problem of training and understanding .
how long would it take to get such a system up and running ?
even if we were to set to it with the same verve as the japanese or the americans , it would still take a couple of years .
they are still improving their own system .
at the donor conference , kofi annan noted that japan could play a leading role in an early warning system , given that the japanese system is already very good .
does that mean it would be japanese rather than german researchers providing the technology for an early warning system ?
i think this incident has proven that natural catastrophes are a global problem .
every country on the planet should work together to reduce risk .
it is definitely an advantage that japan has already done some of the footwork , but i do n't believe the japanese should do it on their own .
have there already been international efforts to create a better system of protection against natural catastrophes ?
yes , we 've been thinking about this task for a long time .
there was a united nations initiative for the reduction of natural catastrophes between 1990 and 2000 , and there is also an initiative for the future , which would build on this .
so , yes , in the wider context , some preliminary work has already been done .
is there any existing cooperation between the different research institutes ?
yes , we are not starting from scratch .
we already work with many groups on a scientific level , we already have contacts with scientists .
i am part of a project which works in java and the sunda islands , and there are a number of indonesian institutes involved .
we run a network with many stations across the world which record earthquakes , but they have to be improved , concentrated and appraised .

so that means it would largely be your task to quickly recognize earthquakes .
but not every earthquake leads to a tsunami .
no , only a small number of earthquakes trigger tsunamis , but besides volcanic eruptions , they are the main cause .
it is critical to be able to recognize that an earthquake is coming and be able to see their movement in order to determine the likelihood of a tsunami .
what else would be involved in an early warning system besides an ability to recognize the danger in time ?
early warning does n't mean erecting a box somewhere which would ring at the critical moment .
we need a system which transports information from the decision-makers to the fishermen on the beach , who would then need to know what to do .
so it 's also a problem of training and understanding .
how long would it take to get such a system up and running ?
even if we were to set to it with the same verve as the japanese or the americans , it would still take a couple of years .
they are still improving their own system .
at the donor conference , kofi annan noted that japan could play a leading role in an early warning system , given that the japanese system is already very good .
does that mean it would be japanese rather than german researchers providing the technology for an early warning system ?
i think this incident has proven that natural catastrophes are a global problem .
every country on the planet should work together to reduce risk .
it is definitely an advantage that japan has already done some of the footwork , but i do n't believe the japanese should do it on their own .
have there already been international efforts to create a better system of protection against natural catastrophes ?
yes , we 've been thinking about this task for a long time .
there was a united nations initiative for the reduction of natural catastrophes between 1990 and 2000 , and there is also an initiative for the future , which would build on this .
so , yes , in the wider context , some preliminary work has already been done .
is there any existing cooperation between the different research institutes ?
yes , we are not starting from scratch .
we already work with many groups on a scientific level , we already have contacts with scientists .
i am part of a project which works in java and the sunda islands , and there are a number of indonesian institutes involved .
we run a network with many stations across the world which record earthquakes , but they have to be improved , concentrated and appraised .
has the geo research institute received any official requests to become involved ?
as an employee here , i have noticed certain signals that there is a wish for us to become more actively involved . markus roman -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany keen on south asia partnerships chancellor schröder wants to go beyond immediate financial and humanitarian aid to the tsunami-hit nations by proposing bilateral " partnerships .

dw-world spoke to birger-gottfried lühr of the geo research center in potsdam , which wants to help . dw-world : at the donor conference for the tsunami victims , it was decided to introduce a warning system to the affected region .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 07.01.2005 the king is dead , long live the king großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elvis was stationed in bad nauheim for 18 months germany is marking elvis presley ’ s 70th birthday with television specials , a rash of live shows , and four straight days of " elvisiana " in the town where the young star was stationed as a gi . germans have long claimed a special relationship to the king .
not king as in " kaiser " , but as in elvis : king of rock n ' roll .
presley spent nearly two years in germany , one of the biggest music stars to have ever been in residence here .
from 1958 to 1960 , he was assigned as a gi in the 3rd armored division to ray barracks , in the small town of friedberg near frankfurt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elvis checks in at friedberg 's ray barracks at the time , officials worried that elvis 's visit would corrupt the area 's youth .
now , the town is tapping the elvis myth to help keep itself on the tourism map .
bad nauheim and the neighboring village of friedberg were utterly dull until some local hardcore elvis fans decided to liven up things , said hans-ulrich halwe , founder and honorary chairman of the bad nauheim-friedberg elvis presley club .
elvis slept here the club was formed in 1998 by halwe and a handful of others , but has since grown to more than 200 members .
they meet once a month in the bar of the " best western hotel rosenau " , which is decked out in elvis memorabilia , and stage elvis events , and give tours of the area .
this weekend , freidberg and bad nauheim are ground zero for the celebration of the king 's 70th birthday .
along with elvis impersonators doing a las vegas revival show and a gospel concert -lrb- harking back to the king 's church music roots -rrb- , there will be an exhibit of " elvis art " and daily elvis tours featuring anecdotes about his 18-month stay .
up to 50,000 people are expected to attend , with " chartered buses coming from berlin , from belgium , everywhere , " halwe said .
anyone planning a last minute visit can pretty much forget about staying in room 10 of the grünewald hotel , though .
that 's the room in the family-run hotel where elvis slept for several weeks in 1958 , and " the only place in europe where you can sleep in the same bed elvis slept in , " halwe said .
for big events it gets booked up to a year in advance , however .
elvis pressler ?
an honored guest at the bad nauheim festivities will be karl heinz stein , elvis ’ s military barber and the ace in the hole of bad nauheim 's elvis lore .
as someone who could handle the heartthrob 's head on a regular basis -lrb- haircuts were given every eight days or so -rrb- stein was forward-thinking enough to stash away a few locks of the star ’ s hair and hang on to his scissors and combs .
these objects have since been sold , ending up in private collections or , alternately , at the museum of german history , where a reconstruction of the military barber shop in friedberg is a centerpiece of the current " elvis in germany " exhibit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the interior of the bad nauheim hair salon where elvis got a trim , now in a museum stein clearly enjoys talking about his days as barber to the king and even claimed a certain kinship with the young tennesseean .
" there was something different about elvis , he was very special .
he was so generous ... so polite , so genteel .
you could n't say the same about all of his compatriots , " said stein . " i said even then , ' its like he is really a german , like he has german blood . '
and i turned out to be right . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans hold vigil on elvis death anniversary , in front of elvis performance image stein 's feeling that the presley family came not from english but german ancestry found a supporter a few years back in the form of donald presley , a distant cousin of elvis who was researching his roots .
donald claims that elvis 's bloodline reaches back to winemakers from the rhineland palatinate region named pressler .
-lrb- with scottish and english lineage researchers also claiming elvis as their own , it is up to each branch of the presley family to fight for their versions of the truth . -rrb-
calling maybelline ...
of course , the elvis following in germany , as well as the celebration of his birth , goes well beyond the borders of bad nauheim .
the country 's oldest and largest club , founded in 1978 and with about 2,000 members , is the elvis presley gesellschaft .
the web site of the elvis club berlin lists some 33 other active elvis clubs in germany , though it is an unofficial count .
members of these clubs use the internet to keep in touch and keep informed , with messages from germans with suspiciously southern-american names -lrb- maybelline , caroline , jacky , shakey -rrb- discussing topics like the size of elvis 's jumpsuits and announcing elvis radio specials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg based elvis imitator , shelvis late night channel flippers around germany can expect to stumble across a lot of elvis movies , and anyone in a big city looking for an elvis party on friday or saturday wo n't have too much trouble finding one .
in hamburg , an elvis imitator called shelvis performs , while berlin 's estrel theater has revived its popular " an evening with elvis . "
the well-reviewed show stars versatile irish elvis tribute artist grahame patrick doyle , who estrel fished out of las vegas ' teeming elvis waters several years ago .
with his music , elvis did , indeed , help usher social disarray into german society .
but today , the aspect of the king 's persona that most seems to warm german hearts is his history as a gospel singer .
an award-winning german elvis impersonator known simply as " rio , the voice of elvis " -lrb- yes , he has had his name officially changed -rrb- will do an elvis-sings-gospel show over the weekend in friedberg 's 600-seat church .
two years ago , a similar concert sold out .
singing the gospel " the best thing about elvis is his versatility ... few people realize this , but elvis is the only white singer to win grammy awards for his gospel music , " said the 40-year-old rio , who has been doing elvis since the age of 10 .
" its amazing to play a concert and move people to tears .
any music that touches the heart , that 's gospel . "
when elvis left bad nauheim , " he said he would come back and sing for all the people who had been so good to him here , " hans-ulrich halwe said .
because elvis 's manager refused to leave the country , though , elvis never took his show abroad .
" i 'm still waiting , " added halwe with a laugh . jennifer abramsohn , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de elvis lives on in bonn forget memphis , las vegas and graceland - germany has always had a special place in its heart for elvis , and now , anyone wanting a personal glimpse of the man behind the myth need go no further than bonn .

not king as in " kaiser " , but as in elvis : king of rock n ' roll .
presley spent nearly two years in germany , one of the biggest music stars to have ever been in residence here .
from 1958 to 1960 , he was assigned as a gi in the 3rd armored division to ray barracks , in the small town of friedberg near frankfurt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elvis checks in at friedberg 's ray barracks at the time , officials worried that elvis 's visit would corrupt the area 's youth .
now , the town is tapping the elvis myth to help keep itself on the tourism map .
bad nauheim and the neighboring village of friedberg were utterly dull until some local hardcore elvis fans decided to liven up things , said hans-ulrich halwe , founder and honorary chairman of the bad nauheim-friedberg elvis presley club .
elvis slept here the club was formed in 1998 by halwe and a handful of others , but has since grown to more than 200 members .
they meet once a month in the bar of the " best western hotel rosenau " , which is decked out in elvis memorabilia , and stage elvis events , and give tours of the area .
this weekend , freidberg and bad nauheim are ground zero for the celebration of the king 's 70th birthday .
along with elvis impersonators doing a las vegas revival show and a gospel concert -lrb- harking back to the king 's church music roots -rrb- , there will be an exhibit of " elvis art " and daily elvis tours featuring anecdotes about his 18-month stay .
up to 50,000 people are expected to attend , with " chartered buses coming from berlin , from belgium , everywhere , " halwe said .
anyone planning a last minute visit can pretty much forget about staying in room 10 of the grünewald hotel , though .
that 's the room in the family-run hotel where elvis slept for several weeks in 1958 , and " the only place in europe where you can sleep in the same bed elvis slept in , " halwe said .
for big events it gets booked up to a year in advance , however .
elvis pressler ?
an honored guest at the bad nauheim festivities will be karl heinz stein , elvis ’ s military barber and the ace in the hole of bad nauheim 's elvis lore .
as someone who could handle the heartthrob 's head on a regular basis -lrb- haircuts were given every eight days or so -rrb- stein was forward-thinking enough to stash away a few locks of the star ’ s hair and hang on to his scissors and combs .
these objects have since been sold , ending up in private collections or , alternately , at the museum of german history , where a reconstruction of the military barber shop in friedberg is a centerpiece of the current " elvis in germany " exhibit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the interior of the bad nauheim hair salon where elvis got a trim , now in a museum stein clearly enjoys talking about his days as barber to the king and even claimed a certain kinship with the young tennesseean .
" there was something different about elvis , he was very special .
he was so generous ... so polite , so genteel .
you could n't say the same about all of his compatriots , " said stein . " i said even then , ' its like he is really a german , like he has german blood . '
and i turned out to be right . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans hold vigil on elvis death anniversary , in front of elvis performance image stein 's feeling that the presley family came not from english but german ancestry found a supporter a few years back in the form of donald presley , a distant cousin of elvis who was researching his roots .
donald claims that elvis 's bloodline reaches back to winemakers from the rhineland palatinate region named pressler .
-lrb- with scottish and english lineage researchers also claiming elvis as their own , it is up to each branch of the presley family to fight for their versions of the truth . -rrb-
calling maybelline ...
of course , the elvis following in germany , as well as the celebration of his birth , goes well beyond the borders of bad nauheim .
the country 's oldest and largest club , founded in 1978 and with about 2,000 members , is the elvis presley gesellschaft .
the web site of the elvis club berlin lists some 33 other active elvis clubs in germany , though it is an unofficial count .
members of these clubs use the internet to keep in touch and keep informed , with messages from germans with suspiciously southern-american names -lrb- maybelline , caroline , jacky , shakey -rrb- discussing topics like the size of elvis 's jumpsuits and announcing elvis radio specials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg based elvis imitator , shelvis late night channel flippers around germany can expect to stumble across a lot of elvis movies , and anyone in a big city looking for an elvis party on friday or saturday wo n't have too much trouble finding one .
in hamburg , an elvis imitator called shelvis performs , while berlin 's estrel theater has revived its popular " an evening with elvis . "
the well-reviewed show stars versatile irish elvis tribute artist grahame patrick doyle , who estrel fished out of las vegas ' teeming elvis waters several years ago .
with his music , elvis did , indeed , help usher social disarray into german society .
but today , the aspect of the king 's persona that most seems to warm german hearts is his history as a gospel singer .
an award-winning german elvis impersonator known simply as " rio , the voice of elvis " -lrb- yes , he has had his name officially changed -rrb- will do an elvis-sings-gospel show over the weekend in friedberg 's 600-seat church .
two years ago , a similar concert sold out .
singing the gospel " the best thing about elvis is his versatility ... few people realize this , but elvis is the only white singer to win grammy awards for his gospel music , " said the 40-year-old rio , who has been doing elvis since the age of 10 .
" its amazing to play a concert and move people to tears .
any music that touches the heart , that 's gospel . "
when elvis left bad nauheim , " he said he would come back and sing for all the people who had been so good to him here , " hans-ulrich halwe said .
because elvis 's manager refused to leave the country , though , elvis never took his show abroad .
" i 'm still waiting , " added halwe with a laugh . jennifer abramsohn , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de elvis lives on in bonn forget memphis , las vegas and graceland - germany has always had a special place in its heart for elvis , and now , anyone wanting a personal glimpse of the man behind the myth need go no further than bonn .

not king as in " kaiser " , but as in elvis : king of rock n ' roll .
presley spent nearly two years in germany , one of the biggest music stars to have ever been in residence here .
from 1958 to 1960 , he was assigned as a gi in the 3rd armored division to ray barracks , in the small town of friedberg near frankfurt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elvis checks in at friedberg 's ray barracks at the time , officials worried that elvis 's visit would corrupt the area 's youth .
now , the town is tapping the elvis myth to help keep itself on the tourism map .
bad nauheim and the neighboring village of friedberg were utterly dull until some local hardcore elvis fans decided to liven up things , said hans-ulrich halwe , founder and honorary chairman of the bad nauheim-friedberg elvis presley club .
elvis slept here the club was formed in 1998 by halwe and a handful of others , but has since grown to more than 200 members .
they meet once a month in the bar of the " best western hotel rosenau " , which is decked out in elvis memorabilia , and stage elvis events , and give tours of the area .
this weekend , freidberg and bad nauheim are ground zero for the celebration of the king 's 70th birthday .
along with elvis impersonators doing a las vegas revival show and a gospel concert -lrb- harking back to the king 's church music roots -rrb- , there will be an exhibit of " elvis art " and daily elvis tours featuring anecdotes about his 18-month stay .
up to 50,000 people are expected to attend , with " chartered buses coming from berlin , from belgium , everywhere , " halwe said .
anyone planning a last minute visit can pretty much forget about staying in room 10 of the grünewald hotel , though .
that 's the room in the family-run hotel where elvis slept for several weeks in 1958 , and " the only place in europe where you can sleep in the same bed elvis slept in , " halwe said .
for big events it gets booked up to a year in advance , however .
elvis pressler ?
an honored guest at the bad nauheim festivities will be karl heinz stein , elvis ’ s military barber and the ace in the hole of bad nauheim 's elvis lore .
as someone who could handle the heartthrob 's head on a regular basis -lrb- haircuts were given every eight days or so -rrb- stein was forward-thinking enough to stash away a few locks of the star ’ s hair and hang on to his scissors and combs .
these objects have since been sold , ending up in private collections or , alternately , at the museum of german history , where a reconstruction of the military barber shop in friedberg is a centerpiece of the current " elvis in germany " exhibit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the interior of the bad nauheim hair salon where elvis got a trim , now in a museum stein clearly enjoys talking about his days as barber to the king and even claimed a certain kinship with the young tennesseean .
" there was something different about elvis , he was very special .
he was so generous ... so polite , so genteel .
you could n't say the same about all of his compatriots , " said stein . " i said even then , ' its like he is really a german , like he has german blood . '
and i turned out to be right . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans hold vigil on elvis death anniversary , in front of elvis performance image stein 's feeling that the presley family came not from english but german ancestry found a supporter a few years back in the form of donald presley , a distant cousin of elvis who was researching his roots .
donald claims that elvis 's bloodline reaches back to winemakers from the rhineland palatinate region named pressler .
-lrb- with scottish and english lineage researchers also claiming elvis as their own , it is up to each branch of the presley family to fight for their versions of the truth . -rrb-
calling maybelline ...
of course , the elvis following in germany , as well as the celebration of his birth , goes well beyond the borders of bad nauheim .
the country 's oldest and largest club , founded in 1978 and with about 2,000 members , is the elvis presley gesellschaft .
the web site of the elvis club berlin lists some 33 other active elvis clubs in germany , though it is an unofficial count .
members of these clubs use the internet to keep in touch and keep informed , with messages from germans with suspiciously southern-american names -lrb- maybelline , caroline , jacky , shakey -rrb- discussing topics like the size of elvis 's jumpsuits and announcing elvis radio specials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg based elvis imitator , shelvis late night channel flippers around germany can expect to stumble across a lot of elvis movies , and anyone in a big city looking for an elvis party on friday or saturday wo n't have too much trouble finding one .
in hamburg , an elvis imitator called shelvis performs , while berlin 's estrel theater has revived its popular " an evening with elvis . "
the well-reviewed show stars versatile irish elvis tribute artist grahame patrick doyle , who estrel fished out of las vegas ' teeming elvis waters several years ago .
with his music , elvis did , indeed , help usher social disarray into german society .
but today , the aspect of the king 's persona that most seems to warm german hearts is his history as a gospel singer .
an award-winning german elvis impersonator known simply as " rio , the voice of elvis " -lrb- yes , he has had his name officially changed -rrb- will do an elvis-sings-gospel show over the weekend in friedberg 's 600-seat church .
two years ago , a similar concert sold out .
singing the gospel " the best thing about elvis is his versatility ... few people realize this , but elvis is the only white singer to win grammy awards for his gospel music , " said the 40-year-old rio , who has been doing elvis since the age of 10 .
" its amazing to play a concert and move people to tears .
any music that touches the heart , that 's gospel . "
when elvis left bad nauheim , " he said he would come back and sing for all the people who had been so good to him here , " hans-ulrich halwe said .
because elvis 's manager refused to leave the country , though , elvis never took his show abroad .

after the successful start of germany 's long troubled highway toll system for heavy commercial trucks , suggestions are already being made to expand the satellite-based technology to surface streets and normal cars . following a number of mishaps , germany 's high-tech toll system finally went into operation this week . held up for 16 months , the delay cost the german government billions in lost revenues .
but there were no major glitches on the country 's autobahns as had been feared , encouraging some politicians to consider how to widen the system 's reach . bavarian interior minister günther beckstein this week asked the federal government to collect the truck toll on some non-highway streets that could be possibly used by drivers to avoid paying the levy .
" the introduction of the toll can not be at the expense of residents on national roadways and of traffic safety , " beckstein said according to german news agency dpa . technically , there is nothing standing in the way of expanding the satellite toll system to other streets - at least not eventually .
currently the system is running on a slimmed-down version of the software that connects the trucks ' onboard units to the central computers of operator toll collect . the repeated delays were a major embarrassment for toll collect - the consortium made up of automaker daimlerchrysler , deutsche telekom and french motorway operator cofiroute .
but the successful start this year has opened the door to future possibilities for the pioneering system .
that could include levying a toll on the streets as suggested by beckstein , as well as charging normal cars for using the autobahn . advanced technology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the system uses gps technology to send an sms via germany 's gsm mobile telephone network to locate a vehicle .

" at any time it can be expanded to other parts of the street network or the price can be changed easily . " no one is expecting the german government to begin pushing for an auto toll soon .
but , with the transport ministry strapped for cash and road projects suffering accordingly , some experts believe it is only a matter of time . " i think the toll for cars will come quickly simply due to financial reasons , " werner rothengatter from the university of karlsruhe said .
an advisor to the transport ministry , he said he expected the issue would be raised shortly after the next general election in 2006 .
rothengatter added that car owners could be co-opted to support the toll by offering compensation in the way of lower auto taxes . the german government expects about € 2.5 billion -lrb- $ 3.30 billion -rrb- in truck toll revenues each year .
but economics minister wolfgang clement also hopes the state-of-the-art system will be an export hit doing away with the old-fashioned booths that still cause traffic congestions in many other european countries . on thursday , the czech transport ministry said it planned to introduce a similar electronic toll system for trucks on the country 's highways , possibly by the end of the year . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de smooth start for german truck toll germany ’ s brand new highway toll system for heavy trucks has got off to a smooth start dispelling fears of potential traffic disasters on monday morning .

" the introduction of the toll can not be at the expense of residents on national roadways and of traffic safety , " beckstein said according to german news agency dpa . technically , there is nothing standing in the way of expanding the satellite toll system to other streets - at least not eventually .

after the successful start of germany 's long troubled highway toll system for heavy commercial trucks , suggestions are already being made to expand the satellite-based technology to surface streets and normal cars . following a number of mishaps , germany 's high-tech toll system finally went into operation this week . held up for 16 months , the delay cost the german government billions in lost revenues .
but there were no major glitches on the country 's autobahns as had been feared , encouraging some politicians to consider how to widen the system 's reach . bavarian interior minister günther beckstein this week asked the federal government to collect the truck toll on some non-highway streets that could be possibly used by drivers to avoid paying the levy .
" the introduction of the toll can not be at the expense of residents on national roadways and of traffic safety , " beckstein said according to german news agency dpa . technically , there is nothing standing in the way of expanding the satellite toll system to other streets - at least not eventually .
currently the system is running on a slimmed-down version of the software that connects the trucks ' onboard units to the central computers of operator toll collect . the repeated delays were a major embarrassment for toll collect - the consortium made up of automaker daimlerchrysler , deutsche telekom and french motorway operator cofiroute .
but the successful start this year has opened the door to future possibilities for the pioneering system .
that could include levying a toll on the streets as suggested by beckstein , as well as charging normal cars for using the autobahn . advanced technology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the system uses gps technology to send an sms via germany 's gsm mobile telephone network to locate a vehicle .
that works even at speeds of 200 kilometers -lrb- 124.27 miles -rrb- per hour while changing lanes .
a user is only charged for the exact distance driven . " they picked the toll collect system exactly because it is a very flexible one , " markus friedrich from the institute for street and traffic studies at the university of stuttgart told german ard television .
" at any time it can be expanded to other parts of the street network or the price can be changed easily . " no one is expecting the german government to begin pushing for an auto toll soon .
but , with the transport ministry strapped for cash and road projects suffering accordingly , some experts believe it is only a matter of time . " i think the toll for cars will come quickly simply due to financial reasons , " werner rothengatter from the university of karlsruhe said .
an advisor to the transport ministry , he said he expected the issue would be raised shortly after the next general election in 2006 .
rothengatter added that car owners could be co-opted to support the toll by offering compensation in the way of lower auto taxes . the german government expects about € 2.5 billion -lrb- $ 3.30 billion -rrb- in truck toll revenues each year .
but economics minister wolfgang clement also hopes the state-of-the-art system will be an export hit doing away with the old-fashioned booths that still cause traffic congestions in many other european countries . on thursday , the czech transport ministry said it planned to introduce a similar electronic toll system for trucks on the country 's highways , possibly by the end of the year . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de smooth start for german truck toll germany ’ s brand new highway toll system for heavy trucks has got off to a smooth start dispelling fears of potential traffic disasters on monday morning .

dw-world spoke to birger-gottfried lühr of the geo research center in potsdam , which wants to help . dw-world : at the donor conference for the tsunami victims , it was decided to introduce a warning system to the affected region .
what would be the exact role of the geo research center in implementing such a system ?
birger-gottfried lühr : our area of expertise is recording seismic activity and quickly analyzing signals registered .
in addition to this , each year we conduct a seismology training course , held alternately in potsdam and a country which is endangered by seismic activity .
so that means it would largely be your task to quickly recognize earthquakes .
but not every earthquake leads to a tsunami .
no , only a small number of earthquakes trigger tsunamis , but besides volcanic eruptions , they are the main cause .
it is critical to be able to recognize that an earthquake is coming and be able to see their movement in order to determine the likelihood of a tsunami .
what else would be involved in an early warning system besides an ability to recognize the danger in time ?
early warning does n't mean erecting a box somewhere which would ring at the critical moment .
we need a system which transports information from the decision-makers to the fishermen on the beach , who would then need to know what to do .
so it 's also a problem of training and understanding .
how long would it take to get such a system up and running ?
even if we were to set to it with the same verve as the japanese or the americans , it would still take a couple of years .
they are still improving their own system .
at the donor conference , kofi annan noted that japan could play a leading role in an early warning system , given that the japanese system is already very good .
does that mean it would be japanese rather than german researchers providing the technology for an early warning system ?
i think this incident has proven that natural catastrophes are a global problem .
every country on the planet should work together to reduce risk .
it is definitely an advantage that japan has already done some of the footwork , but i do n't believe the japanese should do it on their own .
have there already been international efforts to create a better system of protection against natural catastrophes ?
yes , we 've been thinking about this task for a long time .
there was a united nations initiative for the reduction of natural catastrophes between 1990 and 2000 , and there is also an initiative for the future , which would build on this .
so , yes , in the wider context , some preliminary work has already been done .
is there any existing cooperation between the different research institutes ?
yes , we are not starting from scratch .
we already work with many groups on a scientific level , we already have contacts with scientists .
i am part of a project which works in java and the sunda islands , and there are a number of indonesian institutes involved .
we run a network with many stations across the world which record earthquakes , but they have to be improved , concentrated and appraised .
has the geo research institute received any official requests to become involved ?
as an employee here , i have noticed certain signals that there is a wish for us to become more actively involved . markus roman -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany keen on south asia partnerships chancellor schröder wants to go beyond immediate financial and humanitarian aid to the tsunami-hit nations by proposing bilateral " partnerships .

in addition to this , each year we conduct a seismology training course , held alternately in potsdam and a country which is endangered by seismic activity .
so that means it would largely be your task to quickly recognize earthquakes .
but not every earthquake leads to a tsunami .
no , only a small number of earthquakes trigger tsunamis , but besides volcanic eruptions , they are the main cause .
it is critical to be able to recognize that an earthquake is coming and be able to see their movement in order to determine the likelihood of a tsunami .
what else would be involved in an early warning system besides an ability to recognize the danger in time ?
early warning does n't mean erecting a box somewhere which would ring at the critical moment .
we need a system which transports information from the decision-makers to the fishermen on the beach , who would then need to know what to do .
so it 's also a problem of training and understanding .
how long would it take to get such a system up and running ?
even if we were to set to it with the same verve as the japanese or the americans , it would still take a couple of years .
they are still improving their own system .
at the donor conference , kofi annan noted that japan could play a leading role in an early warning system , given that the japanese system is already very good .
does that mean it would be japanese rather than german researchers providing the technology for an early warning system ?
i think this incident has proven that natural catastrophes are a global problem .
every country on the planet should work together to reduce risk .
it is definitely an advantage that japan has already done some of the footwork , but i do n't believe the japanese should do it on their own .
have there already been international efforts to create a better system of protection against natural catastrophes ?
yes , we 've been thinking about this task for a long time .
there was a united nations initiative for the reduction of natural catastrophes between 1990 and 2000 , and there is also an initiative for the future , which would build on this .
so , yes , in the wider context , some preliminary work has already been done .
is there any existing cooperation between the different research institutes ?
yes , we are not starting from scratch .
we already work with many groups on a scientific level , we already have contacts with scientists .
i am part of a project which works in java and the sunda islands , and there are a number of indonesian institutes involved .
we run a network with many stations across the world which record earthquakes , but they have to be improved , concentrated and appraised .
has the geo research institute received any official requests to become involved ?

after the successful start of germany 's long troubled highway toll system for heavy commercial trucks , suggestions are already being made to expand the satellite-based technology to surface streets and normal cars . following a number of mishaps , germany 's high-tech toll system finally went into operation this week . held up for 16 months , the delay cost the german government billions in lost revenues .
but there were no major glitches on the country 's autobahns as had been feared , encouraging some politicians to consider how to widen the system 's reach . bavarian interior minister günther beckstein this week asked the federal government to collect the truck toll on some non-highway streets that could be possibly used by drivers to avoid paying the levy .
" the introduction of the toll can not be at the expense of residents on national roadways and of traffic safety , " beckstein said according to german news agency dpa . technically , there is nothing standing in the way of expanding the satellite toll system to other streets - at least not eventually .
currently the system is running on a slimmed-down version of the software that connects the trucks ' onboard units to the central computers of operator toll collect . the repeated delays were a major embarrassment for toll collect - the consortium made up of automaker daimlerchrysler , deutsche telekom and french motorway operator cofiroute .
but the successful start this year has opened the door to future possibilities for the pioneering system .
that could include levying a toll on the streets as suggested by beckstein , as well as charging normal cars for using the autobahn . advanced technology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the system uses gps technology to send an sms via germany 's gsm mobile telephone network to locate a vehicle .

a user is only charged for the exact distance driven . " they picked the toll collect system exactly because it is a very flexible one , " markus friedrich from the institute for street and traffic studies at the university of stuttgart told german ard television .
" at any time it can be expanded to other parts of the street network or the price can be changed easily . " no one is expecting the german government to begin pushing for an auto toll soon .
but , with the transport ministry strapped for cash and road projects suffering accordingly , some experts believe it is only a matter of time . " i think the toll for cars will come quickly simply due to financial reasons , " werner rothengatter from the university of karlsruhe said .
an advisor to the transport ministry , he said he expected the issue would be raised shortly after the next general election in 2006 .
rothengatter added that car owners could be co-opted to support the toll by offering compensation in the way of lower auto taxes . the german government expects about € 2.5 billion -lrb- $ 3.30 billion -rrb- in truck toll revenues each year .
but economics minister wolfgang clement also hopes the state-of-the-art system will be an export hit doing away with the old-fashioned booths that still cause traffic congestions in many other european countries . on thursday , the czech transport ministry said it planned to introduce a similar electronic toll system for trucks on the country 's highways , possibly by the end of the year . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de smooth start for german truck toll germany ’ s brand new highway toll system for heavy trucks has got off to a smooth start dispelling fears of potential traffic disasters on monday morning .

after the successful start of germany 's long troubled highway toll system for heavy commercial trucks , suggestions are already being made to expand the satellite-based technology to surface streets and normal cars . following a number of mishaps , germany 's high-tech toll system finally went into operation this week . held up for 16 months , the delay cost the german government billions in lost revenues .
but there were no major glitches on the country 's autobahns as had been feared , encouraging some politicians to consider how to widen the system 's reach . bavarian interior minister günther beckstein this week asked the federal government to collect the truck toll on some non-highway streets that could be possibly used by drivers to avoid paying the levy .
" the introduction of the toll can not be at the expense of residents on national roadways and of traffic safety , " beckstein said according to german news agency dpa . technically , there is nothing standing in the way of expanding the satellite toll system to other streets - at least not eventually .
currently the system is running on a slimmed-down version of the software that connects the trucks ' onboard units to the central computers of operator toll collect . the repeated delays were a major embarrassment for toll collect - the consortium made up of automaker daimlerchrysler , deutsche telekom and french motorway operator cofiroute .
but the successful start this year has opened the door to future possibilities for the pioneering system .
that could include levying a toll on the streets as suggested by beckstein , as well as charging normal cars for using the autobahn . advanced technology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the system uses gps technology to send an sms via germany 's gsm mobile telephone network to locate a vehicle .
that works even at speeds of 200 kilometers -lrb- 124.27 miles -rrb- per hour while changing lanes .
a user is only charged for the exact distance driven . " they picked the toll collect system exactly because it is a very flexible one , " markus friedrich from the institute for street and traffic studies at the university of stuttgart told german ard television .
" at any time it can be expanded to other parts of the street network or the price can be changed easily . " no one is expecting the german government to begin pushing for an auto toll soon .
but , with the transport ministry strapped for cash and road projects suffering accordingly , some experts believe it is only a matter of time . " i think the toll for cars will come quickly simply due to financial reasons , " werner rothengatter from the university of karlsruhe said .
an advisor to the transport ministry , he said he expected the issue would be raised shortly after the next general election in 2006 .
rothengatter added that car owners could be co-opted to support the toll by offering compensation in the way of lower auto taxes . the german government expects about € 2.5 billion -lrb- $ 3.30 billion -rrb- in truck toll revenues each year .
but economics minister wolfgang clement also hopes the state-of-the-art system will be an export hit doing away with the old-fashioned booths that still cause traffic congestions in many other european countries . on thursday , the czech transport ministry said it planned to introduce a similar electronic toll system for trucks on the country 's highways , possibly by the end of the year . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de smooth start for german truck toll germany ’ s brand new highway toll system for heavy trucks has got off to a smooth start dispelling fears of potential traffic disasters on monday morning .

but the record sums wo n't create massive budgetary problems around the world , according to experts . official aid for last month 's earthquake-tsunami disaster has been sizable .
germany on wednesday increased its pledge to € 500 million -lrb- $ 662 million -rrb- to become the world 's largest donor . but that amount was topped only hours later after australia said it would donate € 578 million to the catastrophe .
japan is the third largest donor with € 378 million and the united states has pledged € 265 million .
even tiny norway will give € 130 million . the offers of aid have come despite the fact that most rich industrial nations are currently running budget deficits .
for example , the united states will record a budget deficit of 4.5 percent in 2004 .
in europe , france and germany are both struggling to stick to the eu 's stability pact , which underpins the economic foundations of the euro . but experts are n't concerned that the commendable instinct to aid those suffering due to the tsunami could have a negative impact on the world 's economy .
" budgets are strained all over - except for perhaps in sweden and finland , " said ivo bischoff , an economist at the university of gießen .
" but these are all things that will come down to decimal figures . " klaus-jürgen gern from the kiel institute for world economics agreed .
he acknowledged germany 's pledge was large , however , " it will be paid out over at least three years , " he also pointed out . money coming and going most donor nations are more concerned about how the money will be spent than where it will come from .
germany is no exception .
" in principle , we ask aid organizations to name projects , " a spokesman for the foreign ministry told dw-world .
" they can determine extremely quickly what is needed .

2 , 2005 .
thousands of villagers have begun returning to their homes after fleeing the tsunamis that pounded malaysia 's northwestern coast , officials said sunday .
-lrb- ap photo / teh eng koon -rrb- most frequently , the funds for immediate aid go directly to local partner organizations or international aid outfits that can transport food , water and clothing on their own .
the spokesman said there were two man criteria : food is bought in the affected regions to save transport costs and money is given only to groups with a clear system of distribution . the aid given out for the tsunami damage could bring germany closer to an important goal : according to a un agreement , member states should aim to spend at least 0.7 percent of their gdp on development aid .
germany currently only spends 0.3 percent . how much the aid for the tsunami will further such progress remains unclear , however . " it will depend on where exactly the € 500 million comes from , " said a spokesman for the german development ministry .
" at the moment it 's impossible to say anything exact .

not king as in " kaiser " , but as in elvis : king of rock n ' roll .
presley spent nearly two years in germany , one of the biggest music stars to have ever been in residence here .
from 1958 to 1960 , he was assigned as a gi in the 3rd armored division to ray barracks , in the small town of friedberg near frankfurt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elvis checks in at friedberg 's ray barracks at the time , officials worried that elvis 's visit would corrupt the area 's youth .
now , the town is tapping the elvis myth to help keep itself on the tourism map .
bad nauheim and the neighboring village of friedberg were utterly dull until some local hardcore elvis fans decided to liven up things , said hans-ulrich halwe , founder and honorary chairman of the bad nauheim-friedberg elvis presley club .
elvis slept here the club was formed in 1998 by halwe and a handful of others , but has since grown to more than 200 members .
they meet once a month in the bar of the " best western hotel rosenau " , which is decked out in elvis memorabilia , and stage elvis events , and give tours of the area .
this weekend , freidberg and bad nauheim are ground zero for the celebration of the king 's 70th birthday .
along with elvis impersonators doing a las vegas revival show and a gospel concert -lrb- harking back to the king 's church music roots -rrb- , there will be an exhibit of " elvis art " and daily elvis tours featuring anecdotes about his 18-month stay .
up to 50,000 people are expected to attend , with " chartered buses coming from berlin , from belgium , everywhere , " halwe said .
anyone planning a last minute visit can pretty much forget about staying in room 10 of the grünewald hotel , though .
that 's the room in the family-run hotel where elvis slept for several weeks in 1958 , and " the only place in europe where you can sleep in the same bed elvis slept in , " halwe said .
for big events it gets booked up to a year in advance , however .
elvis pressler ?
an honored guest at the bad nauheim festivities will be karl heinz stein , elvis ’ s military barber and the ace in the hole of bad nauheim 's elvis lore .
as someone who could handle the heartthrob 's head on a regular basis -lrb- haircuts were given every eight days or so -rrb- stein was forward-thinking enough to stash away a few locks of the star ’ s hair and hang on to his scissors and combs .
these objects have since been sold , ending up in private collections or , alternately , at the museum of german history , where a reconstruction of the military barber shop in friedberg is a centerpiece of the current " elvis in germany " exhibit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the interior of the bad nauheim hair salon where elvis got a trim , now in a museum stein clearly enjoys talking about his days as barber to the king and even claimed a certain kinship with the young tennesseean .
" there was something different about elvis , he was very special .
he was so generous ... so polite , so genteel .
you could n't say the same about all of his compatriots , " said stein . " i said even then , ' its like he is really a german , like he has german blood . '
and i turned out to be right . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans hold vigil on elvis death anniversary , in front of elvis performance image stein 's feeling that the presley family came not from english but german ancestry found a supporter a few years back in the form of donald presley , a distant cousin of elvis who was researching his roots .
donald claims that elvis 's bloodline reaches back to winemakers from the rhineland palatinate region named pressler .
-lrb- with scottish and english lineage researchers also claiming elvis as their own , it is up to each branch of the presley family to fight for their versions of the truth . -rrb-
calling maybelline ...
of course , the elvis following in germany , as well as the celebration of his birth , goes well beyond the borders of bad nauheim .
the country 's oldest and largest club , founded in 1978 and with about 2,000 members , is the elvis presley gesellschaft .
the web site of the elvis club berlin lists some 33 other active elvis clubs in germany , though it is an unofficial count .
members of these clubs use the internet to keep in touch and keep informed , with messages from germans with suspiciously southern-american names -lrb- maybelline , caroline , jacky , shakey -rrb- discussing topics like the size of elvis 's jumpsuits and announcing elvis radio specials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg based elvis imitator , shelvis late night channel flippers around germany can expect to stumble across a lot of elvis movies , and anyone in a big city looking for an elvis party on friday or saturday wo n't have too much trouble finding one .
in hamburg , an elvis imitator called shelvis performs , while berlin 's estrel theater has revived its popular " an evening with elvis . "
the well-reviewed show stars versatile irish elvis tribute artist grahame patrick doyle , who estrel fished out of las vegas ' teeming elvis waters several years ago .
with his music , elvis did , indeed , help usher social disarray into german society .
but today , the aspect of the king 's persona that most seems to warm german hearts is his history as a gospel singer .
an award-winning german elvis impersonator known simply as " rio , the voice of elvis " -lrb- yes , he has had his name officially changed -rrb- will do an elvis-sings-gospel show over the weekend in friedberg 's 600-seat church .
two years ago , a similar concert sold out .
singing the gospel " the best thing about elvis is his versatility ... few people realize this , but elvis is the only white singer to win grammy awards for his gospel music , " said the 40-year-old rio , who has been doing elvis since the age of 10 .
" its amazing to play a concert and move people to tears .
any music that touches the heart , that 's gospel . "
when elvis left bad nauheim , " he said he would come back and sing for all the people who had been so good to him here , " hans-ulrich halwe said .
because elvis 's manager refused to leave the country , though , elvis never took his show abroad .

any music that touches the heart , that 's gospel . "
when elvis left bad nauheim , " he said he would come back and sing for all the people who had been so good to him here , " hans-ulrich halwe said .

not king as in " kaiser " , but as in elvis : king of rock n ' roll .
presley spent nearly two years in germany , one of the biggest music stars to have ever been in residence here .
from 1958 to 1960 , he was assigned as a gi in the 3rd armored division to ray barracks , in the small town of friedberg near frankfurt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elvis checks in at friedberg 's ray barracks at the time , officials worried that elvis 's visit would corrupt the area 's youth .
now , the town is tapping the elvis myth to help keep itself on the tourism map .
bad nauheim and the neighboring village of friedberg were utterly dull until some local hardcore elvis fans decided to liven up things , said hans-ulrich halwe , founder and honorary chairman of the bad nauheim-friedberg elvis presley club .
elvis slept here the club was formed in 1998 by halwe and a handful of others , but has since grown to more than 200 members .
they meet once a month in the bar of the " best western hotel rosenau " , which is decked out in elvis memorabilia , and stage elvis events , and give tours of the area .
this weekend , freidberg and bad nauheim are ground zero for the celebration of the king 's 70th birthday .
along with elvis impersonators doing a las vegas revival show and a gospel concert -lrb- harking back to the king 's church music roots -rrb- , there will be an exhibit of " elvis art " and daily elvis tours featuring anecdotes about his 18-month stay .
up to 50,000 people are expected to attend , with " chartered buses coming from berlin , from belgium , everywhere , " halwe said .
anyone planning a last minute visit can pretty much forget about staying in room 10 of the grünewald hotel , though .
that 's the room in the family-run hotel where elvis slept for several weeks in 1958 , and " the only place in europe where you can sleep in the same bed elvis slept in , " halwe said .
for big events it gets booked up to a year in advance , however .
elvis pressler ?
an honored guest at the bad nauheim festivities will be karl heinz stein , elvis ’ s military barber and the ace in the hole of bad nauheim 's elvis lore .
as someone who could handle the heartthrob 's head on a regular basis -lrb- haircuts were given every eight days or so -rrb- stein was forward-thinking enough to stash away a few locks of the star ’ s hair and hang on to his scissors and combs .
these objects have since been sold , ending up in private collections or , alternately , at the museum of german history , where a reconstruction of the military barber shop in friedberg is a centerpiece of the current " elvis in germany " exhibit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the interior of the bad nauheim hair salon where elvis got a trim , now in a museum stein clearly enjoys talking about his days as barber to the king and even claimed a certain kinship with the young tennesseean .
" there was something different about elvis , he was very special .
he was so generous ... so polite , so genteel .
you could n't say the same about all of his compatriots , " said stein . " i said even then , ' its like he is really a german , like he has german blood . '
and i turned out to be right . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans hold vigil on elvis death anniversary , in front of elvis performance image stein 's feeling that the presley family came not from english but german ancestry found a supporter a few years back in the form of donald presley , a distant cousin of elvis who was researching his roots .
donald claims that elvis 's bloodline reaches back to winemakers from the rhineland palatinate region named pressler .
-lrb- with scottish and english lineage researchers also claiming elvis as their own , it is up to each branch of the presley family to fight for their versions of the truth . -rrb-
calling maybelline ...
of course , the elvis following in germany , as well as the celebration of his birth , goes well beyond the borders of bad nauheim .
the country 's oldest and largest club , founded in 1978 and with about 2,000 members , is the elvis presley gesellschaft .
the web site of the elvis club berlin lists some 33 other active elvis clubs in germany , though it is an unofficial count .
members of these clubs use the internet to keep in touch and keep informed , with messages from germans with suspiciously southern-american names -lrb- maybelline , caroline , jacky , shakey -rrb- discussing topics like the size of elvis 's jumpsuits and announcing elvis radio specials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg based elvis imitator , shelvis late night channel flippers around germany can expect to stumble across a lot of elvis movies , and anyone in a big city looking for an elvis party on friday or saturday wo n't have too much trouble finding one .
in hamburg , an elvis imitator called shelvis performs , while berlin 's estrel theater has revived its popular " an evening with elvis . "
the well-reviewed show stars versatile irish elvis tribute artist grahame patrick doyle , who estrel fished out of las vegas ' teeming elvis waters several years ago .

but the record sums wo n't create massive budgetary problems around the world , according to experts . official aid for last month 's earthquake-tsunami disaster has been sizable .
germany on wednesday increased its pledge to € 500 million -lrb- $ 662 million -rrb- to become the world 's largest donor . but that amount was topped only hours later after australia said it would donate € 578 million to the catastrophe .
japan is the third largest donor with € 378 million and the united states has pledged € 265 million .
even tiny norway will give € 130 million . the offers of aid have come despite the fact that most rich industrial nations are currently running budget deficits .
for example , the united states will record a budget deficit of 4.5 percent in 2004 .
in europe , france and germany are both struggling to stick to the eu 's stability pact , which underpins the economic foundations of the euro . but experts are n't concerned that the commendable instinct to aid those suffering due to the tsunami could have a negative impact on the world 's economy .
" budgets are strained all over - except for perhaps in sweden and finland , " said ivo bischoff , an economist at the university of gießen .
" but these are all things that will come down to decimal figures . " klaus-jürgen gern from the kiel institute for world economics agreed .
he acknowledged germany 's pledge was large , however , " it will be paid out over at least three years , " he also pointed out . money coming and going most donor nations are more concerned about how the money will be spent than where it will come from .
germany is no exception .
" in principle , we ask aid organizations to name projects , " a spokesman for the foreign ministry told dw-world .
" they can determine extremely quickly what is needed .

2 , 2005 .
thousands of villagers have begun returning to their homes after fleeing the tsunamis that pounded malaysia 's northwestern coast , officials said sunday .
-lrb- ap photo / teh eng koon -rrb- most frequently , the funds for immediate aid go directly to local partner organizations or international aid outfits that can transport food , water and clothing on their own .
the spokesman said there were two man criteria : food is bought in the affected regions to save transport costs and money is given only to groups with a clear system of distribution . the aid given out for the tsunami damage could bring germany closer to an important goal : according to a un agreement , member states should aim to spend at least 0.7 percent of their gdp on development aid .
germany currently only spends 0.3 percent . how much the aid for the tsunami will further such progress remains unclear , however . " it will depend on where exactly the € 500 million comes from , " said a spokesman for the german development ministry .
" at the moment it 's impossible to say anything exact .

after the successful start of germany 's long troubled highway toll system for heavy commercial trucks , suggestions are already being made to expand the satellite-based technology to surface streets and normal cars . following a number of mishaps , germany 's high-tech toll system finally went into operation this week . held up for 16 months , the delay cost the german government billions in lost revenues .
but there were no major glitches on the country 's autobahns as had been feared , encouraging some politicians to consider how to widen the system 's reach . bavarian interior minister günther beckstein this week asked the federal government to collect the truck toll on some non-highway streets that could be possibly used by drivers to avoid paying the levy .
" the introduction of the toll can not be at the expense of residents on national roadways and of traffic safety , " beckstein said according to german news agency dpa . technically , there is nothing standing in the way of expanding the satellite toll system to other streets - at least not eventually .
currently the system is running on a slimmed-down version of the software that connects the trucks ' onboard units to the central computers of operator toll collect . the repeated delays were a major embarrassment for toll collect - the consortium made up of automaker daimlerchrysler , deutsche telekom and french motorway operator cofiroute .
but the successful start this year has opened the door to future possibilities for the pioneering system .

" at any time it can be expanded to other parts of the street network or the price can be changed easily . " no one is expecting the german government to begin pushing for an auto toll soon .
but , with the transport ministry strapped for cash and road projects suffering accordingly , some experts believe it is only a matter of time . " i think the toll for cars will come quickly simply due to financial reasons , " werner rothengatter from the university of karlsruhe said .
an advisor to the transport ministry , he said he expected the issue would be raised shortly after the next general election in 2006 .
rothengatter added that car owners could be co-opted to support the toll by offering compensation in the way of lower auto taxes . the german government expects about € 2.5 billion -lrb- $ 3.30 billion -rrb- in truck toll revenues each year .
but economics minister wolfgang clement also hopes the state-of-the-art system will be an export hit doing away with the old-fashioned booths that still cause traffic congestions in many other european countries . on thursday , the czech transport ministry said it planned to introduce a similar electronic toll system for trucks on the country 's highways , possibly by the end of the year . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de smooth start for german truck toll germany ’ s brand new highway toll system for heavy trucks has got off to a smooth start dispelling fears of potential traffic disasters on monday morning .

not king as in " kaiser " , but as in elvis : king of rock n ' roll .
presley spent nearly two years in germany , one of the biggest music stars to have ever been in residence here .
from 1958 to 1960 , he was assigned as a gi in the 3rd armored division to ray barracks , in the small town of friedberg near frankfurt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elvis checks in at friedberg 's ray barracks at the time , officials worried that elvis 's visit would corrupt the area 's youth .
now , the town is tapping the elvis myth to help keep itself on the tourism map .
bad nauheim and the neighboring village of friedberg were utterly dull until some local hardcore elvis fans decided to liven up things , said hans-ulrich halwe , founder and honorary chairman of the bad nauheim-friedberg elvis presley club .
elvis slept here the club was formed in 1998 by halwe and a handful of others , but has since grown to more than 200 members .
they meet once a month in the bar of the " best western hotel rosenau " , which is decked out in elvis memorabilia , and stage elvis events , and give tours of the area .
this weekend , freidberg and bad nauheim are ground zero for the celebration of the king 's 70th birthday .
along with elvis impersonators doing a las vegas revival show and a gospel concert -lrb- harking back to the king 's church music roots -rrb- , there will be an exhibit of " elvis art " and daily elvis tours featuring anecdotes about his 18-month stay .
up to 50,000 people are expected to attend , with " chartered buses coming from berlin , from belgium , everywhere , " halwe said .
anyone planning a last minute visit can pretty much forget about staying in room 10 of the grünewald hotel , though .
that 's the room in the family-run hotel where elvis slept for several weeks in 1958 , and " the only place in europe where you can sleep in the same bed elvis slept in , " halwe said .
for big events it gets booked up to a year in advance , however .
elvis pressler ?
an honored guest at the bad nauheim festivities will be karl heinz stein , elvis ’ s military barber and the ace in the hole of bad nauheim 's elvis lore .
as someone who could handle the heartthrob 's head on a regular basis -lrb- haircuts were given every eight days or so -rrb- stein was forward-thinking enough to stash away a few locks of the star ’ s hair and hang on to his scissors and combs .
these objects have since been sold , ending up in private collections or , alternately , at the museum of german history , where a reconstruction of the military barber shop in friedberg is a centerpiece of the current " elvis in germany " exhibit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the interior of the bad nauheim hair salon where elvis got a trim , now in a museum stein clearly enjoys talking about his days as barber to the king and even claimed a certain kinship with the young tennesseean .
" there was something different about elvis , he was very special .
he was so generous ... so polite , so genteel .
you could n't say the same about all of his compatriots , " said stein . " i said even then , ' its like he is really a german , like he has german blood . '
and i turned out to be right . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans hold vigil on elvis death anniversary , in front of elvis performance image stein 's feeling that the presley family came not from english but german ancestry found a supporter a few years back in the form of donald presley , a distant cousin of elvis who was researching his roots .
donald claims that elvis 's bloodline reaches back to winemakers from the rhineland palatinate region named pressler .
-lrb- with scottish and english lineage researchers also claiming elvis as their own , it is up to each branch of the presley family to fight for their versions of the truth . -rrb-
calling maybelline ...
of course , the elvis following in germany , as well as the celebration of his birth , goes well beyond the borders of bad nauheim .
the country 's oldest and largest club , founded in 1978 and with about 2,000 members , is the elvis presley gesellschaft .
the web site of the elvis club berlin lists some 33 other active elvis clubs in germany , though it is an unofficial count .
members of these clubs use the internet to keep in touch and keep informed , with messages from germans with suspiciously southern-american names -lrb- maybelline , caroline , jacky , shakey -rrb- discussing topics like the size of elvis 's jumpsuits and announcing elvis radio specials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg based elvis imitator , shelvis late night channel flippers around germany can expect to stumble across a lot of elvis movies , and anyone in a big city looking for an elvis party on friday or saturday wo n't have too much trouble finding one .
in hamburg , an elvis imitator called shelvis performs , while berlin 's estrel theater has revived its popular " an evening with elvis . "
the well-reviewed show stars versatile irish elvis tribute artist grahame patrick doyle , who estrel fished out of las vegas ' teeming elvis waters several years ago .
with his music , elvis did , indeed , help usher social disarray into german society .
but today , the aspect of the king 's persona that most seems to warm german hearts is his history as a gospel singer .
an award-winning german elvis impersonator known simply as " rio , the voice of elvis " -lrb- yes , he has had his name officially changed -rrb- will do an elvis-sings-gospel show over the weekend in friedberg 's 600-seat church .
two years ago , a similar concert sold out .
singing the gospel " the best thing about elvis is his versatility ... few people realize this , but elvis is the only white singer to win grammy awards for his gospel music , " said the 40-year-old rio , who has been doing elvis since the age of 10 .
" its amazing to play a concert and move people to tears .
any music that touches the heart , that 's gospel . "
when elvis left bad nauheim , " he said he would come back and sing for all the people who had been so good to him here , " hans-ulrich halwe said .
because elvis 's manager refused to leave the country , though , elvis never took his show abroad .

the well-reviewed show stars versatile irish elvis tribute artist grahame patrick doyle , who estrel fished out of las vegas ' teeming elvis waters several years ago .

" its amazing to play a concert and move people to tears .
any music that touches the heart , that 's gospel . "
when elvis left bad nauheim , " he said he would come back and sing for all the people who had been so good to him here , " hans-ulrich halwe said .

not king as in " kaiser " , but as in elvis : king of rock n ' roll .
presley spent nearly two years in germany , one of the biggest music stars to have ever been in residence here .
from 1958 to 1960 , he was assigned as a gi in the 3rd armored division to ray barracks , in the small town of friedberg near frankfurt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elvis checks in at friedberg 's ray barracks at the time , officials worried that elvis 's visit would corrupt the area 's youth .
now , the town is tapping the elvis myth to help keep itself on the tourism map .
bad nauheim and the neighboring village of friedberg were utterly dull until some local hardcore elvis fans decided to liven up things , said hans-ulrich halwe , founder and honorary chairman of the bad nauheim-friedberg elvis presley club .
elvis slept here the club was formed in 1998 by halwe and a handful of others , but has since grown to more than 200 members .
they meet once a month in the bar of the " best western hotel rosenau " , which is decked out in elvis memorabilia , and stage elvis events , and give tours of the area .
this weekend , freidberg and bad nauheim are ground zero for the celebration of the king 's 70th birthday .
along with elvis impersonators doing a las vegas revival show and a gospel concert -lrb- harking back to the king 's church music roots -rrb- , there will be an exhibit of " elvis art " and daily elvis tours featuring anecdotes about his 18-month stay .
up to 50,000 people are expected to attend , with " chartered buses coming from berlin , from belgium , everywhere , " halwe said .
anyone planning a last minute visit can pretty much forget about staying in room 10 of the grünewald hotel , though .
that 's the room in the family-run hotel where elvis slept for several weeks in 1958 , and " the only place in europe where you can sleep in the same bed elvis slept in , " halwe said .
for big events it gets booked up to a year in advance , however .
elvis pressler ?
an honored guest at the bad nauheim festivities will be karl heinz stein , elvis ’ s military barber and the ace in the hole of bad nauheim 's elvis lore .
as someone who could handle the heartthrob 's head on a regular basis -lrb- haircuts were given every eight days or so -rrb- stein was forward-thinking enough to stash away a few locks of the star ’ s hair and hang on to his scissors and combs .
these objects have since been sold , ending up in private collections or , alternately , at the museum of german history , where a reconstruction of the military barber shop in friedberg is a centerpiece of the current " elvis in germany " exhibit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the interior of the bad nauheim hair salon where elvis got a trim , now in a museum stein clearly enjoys talking about his days as barber to the king and even claimed a certain kinship with the young tennesseean .
" there was something different about elvis , he was very special .
he was so generous ... so polite , so genteel .
you could n't say the same about all of his compatriots , " said stein . " i said even then , ' its like he is really a german , like he has german blood . '

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 07.01.2005 a risque german fairy tale großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roughing it in erfurt : lakey -lrb- hansel , left -rrb- and serfling -lrb- gretel -rrb- culturally speaking , the new year period is usually reserved for mainstream family entertainment .
but not this year it seems as a chilling new production of " hansel and gretel " gets set to open at a german theater . italian opera director giancarlo del monaco 's adults-only treatment of the much-loved 1893 opera by engelbert humperdinck - set to premiere in erfurt , germany on jan .
15 - has been billed as a sinister study of pedophilia .
admittedly , it was preceded by a more palatable version in december .
in the run-up to christmas , erfurt theater staged a traditional , feel-good " hansel and gretel , " complete with gingerbread houses and old-school wicked witches .
but , based on the story by the famously no-nonsense grimm brothers , the second version is much closer to the original - and therefore strictly x-rated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giancarlo del monaco " underlying the libretto is a tacit comment on pedophilia , violence and sexual abuse of children , " del monaco -lrb- photo -rrb- said in an interview with german news agency dpa .
it 's a taboo he was determined to break , said del monaco , even if he " risked being called disgusting . "
telling it like it is disavowing sentimentality seems to be fashionable right now , and not only within the typically straight-talking world of fringe theater .
in london , the expletive-riddled " jerry springer - the opera " proved a run-away hit in the west-end , while producers of what turned into the musical hit of the festive season , " mary poppins " , felt compelled to defend their decision to advise parents against bringing under-sevens to performances of what 's generally seen as a christmas favorite .
in producer cameron mackintosh 's mature , non-mawkish version about family dysfunction - closer to the original book by pamela travers than the disney movie - the adorable nanny is revamped as a stern disciplinarian .
it may be dark , but the critics loved it .
meanwhile in germany , a controversial ballet choreographed by johann kresnik about the suicide of hannelore kohl -lrb- photo -rrb- , wife of former german chancellor helmut kohl , premiered in bonn in the middle of the festive season amid angry resistance from the opposition conservatives .
scandalous as it was to see the frail first lady in canary-yellow silk pajamas pouring herself a poison cocktail , the production was also critically acclaimed .
not a bedtime story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erfurt 's more traditional and child-friendly production of " hansel and gretel " premiered in october the warts-and-all version of " hansel and gretel " in erfurt uses the same music and libretto as the saccharine version , but marks a new visual departure thanks to the set design by peter sykora .
" the fairytale forest is replaced by a red-light district , with high-rises , garbage dumps and begging children , " del monaco said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter umstadt -lrb- center -rrb- , who also played the witch in the traditional version , is wicked in a different way in the adult production .
at left is denis lakey -lrb- hansel -rrb- and susanne serfling -lrb- gretel -rrb- at right " the children 's mother is a whore and their father an alcoholic .
the " sand-man " is a cocaine-snorting pimp who pursues hansel -lrb- denis lakey -rrb- and gretel -lrb- susanne serfling -rrb- with a video camera and hands them over to the wicked witch - the modern " stranger , " who could be the man down the road , the local pervert , the catholic priest , " he said . all for a good cause but it 's not just all gratuitous violence . there 's a good cause in there too .
erfurt theater collaborated on the project with unicef , the " weisser ring " help-line for victims of violent crime , the justice ministry of the state of thuringia , where erfurt is located , as well as police and child psychologists .
a series of discussions on juvenile crime is also planned .
in an interview with the magazine das opernglas , del monaco said he was deliberately setting out to shock .
" you have to horrify people , " he said .
" i do n't believe children these days are sufficiently legally protected .

" i can only call on deutsche börse to retain its headquarters in frankfurt , " if a merger with lse were to come about , green party politician christine scheel , head of the german parliament 's financial committee , told business daily handelsblatt .
the finance expert of the opposition conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , heinz seiffert , also said that politicians should do everything to ensure that the decision regarding the merged company 's future headquarters should fall in germany 's favour . charm offensive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche börse in frankfurt in the battle for the lse , deutsche börse appears to be pulling out all the stops to convince the lse of the virtues of a frankfurt-london tie-up rather than a merger with frankfurt 's arch-rival , paris-based rival euronext .
the german company has so far put a bid of just under € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- on the table for the london market .
but , in an effort to win over the lse , deutsche börse has not only changed its official language to english , but has reportedly offered to manage the combined cash equities markets out of london and has also offered lse chief clara furse that job . furthermore , newspaper reports this week said the operator of the frankfurt stock exchange was ready to raise its offer and might even consider selling its luxembourg-based learstream unit , which many observers saw as the main stumbling block to a london-frankfurt tie-up . constructive meeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner g. seifert furse met with deutsche börse chief werner seifert -lrb- pictured -rrb- in london on thursday . a spokesman for the german group said the talks had been " friendly , constructive and professional " .
he declined to provide any further details .
furse was said to be meeting euronext boss jean-francois theodore on friday .
those talks were confidential and their outcome would not be made public , well-informed sources in paris told afp .
the negotiations were likely to last weeks rather than days . a german finance ministry spokesman insisted that the government expected the decision about the location of the headquarters of any merged group to fall in frankfurt 's favor .
the merger talks were an expression " of the strength of germany as a financial centre " , the spokesman said .
and that strength would be further enhanced in the event of a merger . fear of loss of jobs but , deutsche börse 's employees appear to be alarmed that they could lose their jobs .
the financial times deutschland reported in its friday edition that the group 's works council saw " urgent need for consultation " between employee representatives and management on the matter .
chairman seifert had insisted that there would be no compulsory redundancies if a merger went ahead .
and financial sources said friday that such fears were " unfounded " .
indeed , jobs could be in greater peril if a merger did not take place and frankfurt saw its importance as a stock market dwindle , the sources said .

dw-world spoke to birger-gottfried lühr of the geo research center in potsdam , which wants to help . dw-world : at the donor conference for the tsunami victims , it was decided to introduce a warning system to the affected region .
what would be the exact role of the geo research center in implementing such a system ?
birger-gottfried lühr : our area of expertise is recording seismic activity and quickly analyzing signals registered .
in addition to this , each year we conduct a seismology training course , held alternately in potsdam and a country which is endangered by seismic activity .
so that means it would largely be your task to quickly recognize earthquakes .
but not every earthquake leads to a tsunami .
no , only a small number of earthquakes trigger tsunamis , but besides volcanic eruptions , they are the main cause .
it is critical to be able to recognize that an earthquake is coming and be able to see their movement in order to determine the likelihood of a tsunami .
what else would be involved in an early warning system besides an ability to recognize the danger in time ?
early warning does n't mean erecting a box somewhere which would ring at the critical moment .
we need a system which transports information from the decision-makers to the fishermen on the beach , who would then need to know what to do .
so it 's also a problem of training and understanding .
how long would it take to get such a system up and running ?
even if we were to set to it with the same verve as the japanese or the americans , it would still take a couple of years .
they are still improving their own system .
at the donor conference , kofi annan noted that japan could play a leading role in an early warning system , given that the japanese system is already very good .
does that mean it would be japanese rather than german researchers providing the technology for an early warning system ?
i think this incident has proven that natural catastrophes are a global problem .
every country on the planet should work together to reduce risk .
it is definitely an advantage that japan has already done some of the footwork , but i do n't believe the japanese should do it on their own .
have there already been international efforts to create a better system of protection against natural catastrophes ?
yes , we 've been thinking about this task for a long time .
there was a united nations initiative for the reduction of natural catastrophes between 1990 and 2000 , and there is also an initiative for the future , which would build on this .
so , yes , in the wider context , some preliminary work has already been done .
is there any existing cooperation between the different research institutes ?
yes , we are not starting from scratch .
we already work with many groups on a scientific level , we already have contacts with scientists .
i am part of a project which works in java and the sunda islands , and there are a number of indonesian institutes involved .
we run a network with many stations across the world which record earthquakes , but they have to be improved , concentrated and appraised .
has the geo research institute received any official requests to become involved ?
as an employee here , i have noticed certain signals that there is a wish for us to become more actively involved . markus roman -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany keen on south asia partnerships chancellor schröder wants to go beyond immediate financial and humanitarian aid to the tsunami-hit nations by proposing bilateral " partnerships .

dw-world spoke to birger-gottfried lühr of the geo research center in potsdam , which wants to help . dw-world : at the donor conference for the tsunami victims , it was decided to introduce a warning system to the affected region .
what would be the exact role of the geo research center in implementing such a system ?
birger-gottfried lühr : our area of expertise is recording seismic activity and quickly analyzing signals registered .
in addition to this , each year we conduct a seismology training course , held alternately in potsdam and a country which is endangered by seismic activity .
so that means it would largely be your task to quickly recognize earthquakes .
but not every earthquake leads to a tsunami .
no , only a small number of earthquakes trigger tsunamis , but besides volcanic eruptions , they are the main cause .
it is critical to be able to recognize that an earthquake is coming and be able to see their movement in order to determine the likelihood of a tsunami .
what else would be involved in an early warning system besides an ability to recognize the danger in time ?
early warning does n't mean erecting a box somewhere which would ring at the critical moment .
we need a system which transports information from the decision-makers to the fishermen on the beach , who would then need to know what to do .
so it 's also a problem of training and understanding .
how long would it take to get such a system up and running ?
even if we were to set to it with the same verve as the japanese or the americans , it would still take a couple of years .
they are still improving their own system .
at the donor conference , kofi annan noted that japan could play a leading role in an early warning system , given that the japanese system is already very good .
does that mean it would be japanese rather than german researchers providing the technology for an early warning system ?
i think this incident has proven that natural catastrophes are a global problem .
every country on the planet should work together to reduce risk .
it is definitely an advantage that japan has already done some of the footwork , but i do n't believe the japanese should do it on their own .
have there already been international efforts to create a better system of protection against natural catastrophes ?
yes , we 've been thinking about this task for a long time .
there was a united nations initiative for the reduction of natural catastrophes between 1990 and 2000 , and there is also an initiative for the future , which would build on this .
so , yes , in the wider context , some preliminary work has already been done .
is there any existing cooperation between the different research institutes ?
yes , we are not starting from scratch .
we already work with many groups on a scientific level , we already have contacts with scientists .
i am part of a project which works in java and the sunda islands , and there are a number of indonesian institutes involved .
we run a network with many stations across the world which record earthquakes , but they have to be improved , concentrated and appraised .
has the geo research institute received any official requests to become involved ?

after the successful start of germany 's long troubled highway toll system for heavy commercial trucks , suggestions are already being made to expand the satellite-based technology to surface streets and normal cars . following a number of mishaps , germany 's high-tech toll system finally went into operation this week . held up for 16 months , the delay cost the german government billions in lost revenues .
but there were no major glitches on the country 's autobahns as had been feared , encouraging some politicians to consider how to widen the system 's reach . bavarian interior minister günther beckstein this week asked the federal government to collect the truck toll on some non-highway streets that could be possibly used by drivers to avoid paying the levy .
" the introduction of the toll can not be at the expense of residents on national roadways and of traffic safety , " beckstein said according to german news agency dpa . technically , there is nothing standing in the way of expanding the satellite toll system to other streets - at least not eventually .
currently the system is running on a slimmed-down version of the software that connects the trucks ' onboard units to the central computers of operator toll collect . the repeated delays were a major embarrassment for toll collect - the consortium made up of automaker daimlerchrysler , deutsche telekom and french motorway operator cofiroute .
but the successful start this year has opened the door to future possibilities for the pioneering system .
that could include levying a toll on the streets as suggested by beckstein , as well as charging normal cars for using the autobahn . advanced technology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the system uses gps technology to send an sms via germany 's gsm mobile telephone network to locate a vehicle .
that works even at speeds of 200 kilometers -lrb- 124.27 miles -rrb- per hour while changing lanes .
a user is only charged for the exact distance driven . " they picked the toll collect system exactly because it is a very flexible one , " markus friedrich from the institute for street and traffic studies at the university of stuttgart told german ard television .
" at any time it can be expanded to other parts of the street network or the price can be changed easily . " no one is expecting the german government to begin pushing for an auto toll soon .
but , with the transport ministry strapped for cash and road projects suffering accordingly , some experts believe it is only a matter of time . " i think the toll for cars will come quickly simply due to financial reasons , " werner rothengatter from the university of karlsruhe said .
an advisor to the transport ministry , he said he expected the issue would be raised shortly after the next general election in 2006 .
rothengatter added that car owners could be co-opted to support the toll by offering compensation in the way of lower auto taxes . the german government expects about € 2.5 billion -lrb- $ 3.30 billion -rrb- in truck toll revenues each year .
but economics minister wolfgang clement also hopes the state-of-the-art system will be an export hit doing away with the old-fashioned booths that still cause traffic congestions in many other european countries . on thursday , the czech transport ministry said it planned to introduce a similar electronic toll system for trucks on the country 's highways , possibly by the end of the year . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de smooth start for german truck toll germany ’ s brand new highway toll system for heavy trucks has got off to a smooth start dispelling fears of potential traffic disasters on monday morning .

after the successful start of germany 's long troubled highway toll system for heavy commercial trucks , suggestions are already being made to expand the satellite-based technology to surface streets and normal cars . following a number of mishaps , germany 's high-tech toll system finally went into operation this week . held up for 16 months , the delay cost the german government billions in lost revenues .
but there were no major glitches on the country 's autobahns as had been feared , encouraging some politicians to consider how to widen the system 's reach . bavarian interior minister günther beckstein this week asked the federal government to collect the truck toll on some non-highway streets that could be possibly used by drivers to avoid paying the levy .
" the introduction of the toll can not be at the expense of residents on national roadways and of traffic safety , " beckstein said according to german news agency dpa . technically , there is nothing standing in the way of expanding the satellite toll system to other streets - at least not eventually .
currently the system is running on a slimmed-down version of the software that connects the trucks ' onboard units to the central computers of operator toll collect . the repeated delays were a major embarrassment for toll collect - the consortium made up of automaker daimlerchrysler , deutsche telekom and french motorway operator cofiroute .
but the successful start this year has opened the door to future possibilities for the pioneering system .
that could include levying a toll on the streets as suggested by beckstein , as well as charging normal cars for using the autobahn . advanced technology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the system uses gps technology to send an sms via germany 's gsm mobile telephone network to locate a vehicle .
that works even at speeds of 200 kilometers -lrb- 124.27 miles -rrb- per hour while changing lanes .
a user is only charged for the exact distance driven . " they picked the toll collect system exactly because it is a very flexible one , " markus friedrich from the institute for street and traffic studies at the university of stuttgart told german ard television .
" at any time it can be expanded to other parts of the street network or the price can be changed easily . " no one is expecting the german government to begin pushing for an auto toll soon .
but , with the transport ministry strapped for cash and road projects suffering accordingly , some experts believe it is only a matter of time . " i think the toll for cars will come quickly simply due to financial reasons , " werner rothengatter from the university of karlsruhe said .
an advisor to the transport ministry , he said he expected the issue would be raised shortly after the next general election in 2006 .
rothengatter added that car owners could be co-opted to support the toll by offering compensation in the way of lower auto taxes . the german government expects about € 2.5 billion -lrb- $ 3.30 billion -rrb- in truck toll revenues each year .
but economics minister wolfgang clement also hopes the state-of-the-art system will be an export hit doing away with the old-fashioned booths that still cause traffic congestions in many other european countries . on thursday , the czech transport ministry said it planned to introduce a similar electronic toll system for trucks on the country 's highways , possibly by the end of the year . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de smooth start for german truck toll germany ’ s brand new highway toll system for heavy trucks has got off to a smooth start dispelling fears of potential traffic disasters on monday morning .

but not this year it seems as a chilling new production of " hansel and gretel " gets set to open at a german theater . italian opera director giancarlo del monaco 's adults-only treatment of the much-loved 1893 opera by engelbert humperdinck - set to premiere in erfurt , germany on jan .
15 - has been billed as a sinister study of pedophilia .
admittedly , it was preceded by a more palatable version in december .
in the run-up to christmas , erfurt theater staged a traditional , feel-good " hansel and gretel , " complete with gingerbread houses and old-school wicked witches .
but , based on the story by the famously no-nonsense grimm brothers , the second version is much closer to the original - and therefore strictly x-rated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giancarlo del monaco " underlying the libretto is a tacit comment on pedophilia , violence and sexual abuse of children , " del monaco -lrb- photo -rrb- said in an interview with german news agency dpa .
it 's a taboo he was determined to break , said del monaco , even if he " risked being called disgusting . "
telling it like it is disavowing sentimentality seems to be fashionable right now , and not only within the typically straight-talking world of fringe theater .
in london , the expletive-riddled " jerry springer - the opera " proved a run-away hit in the west-end , while producers of what turned into the musical hit of the festive season , " mary poppins " , felt compelled to defend their decision to advise parents against bringing under-sevens to performances of what 's generally seen as a christmas favorite .
in producer cameron mackintosh 's mature , non-mawkish version about family dysfunction - closer to the original book by pamela travers than the disney movie - the adorable nanny is revamped as a stern disciplinarian .
it may be dark , but the critics loved it .
meanwhile in germany , a controversial ballet choreographed by johann kresnik about the suicide of hannelore kohl -lrb- photo -rrb- , wife of former german chancellor helmut kohl , premiered in bonn in the middle of the festive season amid angry resistance from the opposition conservatives .
scandalous as it was to see the frail first lady in canary-yellow silk pajamas pouring herself a poison cocktail , the production was also critically acclaimed .
not a bedtime story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erfurt 's more traditional and child-friendly production of " hansel and gretel " premiered in october the warts-and-all version of " hansel and gretel " in erfurt uses the same music and libretto as the saccharine version , but marks a new visual departure thanks to the set design by peter sykora .
" the fairytale forest is replaced by a red-light district , with high-rises , garbage dumps and begging children , " del monaco said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter umstadt -lrb- center -rrb- , who also played the witch in the traditional version , is wicked in a different way in the adult production .
at left is denis lakey -lrb- hansel -rrb- and susanne serfling -lrb- gretel -rrb- at right " the children 's mother is a whore and their father an alcoholic .
the " sand-man " is a cocaine-snorting pimp who pursues hansel -lrb- denis lakey -rrb- and gretel -lrb- susanne serfling -rrb- with a video camera and hands them over to the wicked witch - the modern " stranger , " who could be the man down the road , the local pervert , the catholic priest , " he said . all for a good cause but it 's not just all gratuitous violence . there 's a good cause in there too .
erfurt theater collaborated on the project with unicef , the " weisser ring " help-line for victims of violent crime , the justice ministry of the state of thuringia , where erfurt is located , as well as police and child psychologists .
a series of discussions on juvenile crime is also planned .
in an interview with the magazine das opernglas , del monaco said he was deliberately setting out to shock .
" you have to horrify people , " he said .

not king as in " kaiser " , but as in elvis : king of rock n ' roll .
presley spent nearly two years in germany , one of the biggest music stars to have ever been in residence here .
from 1958 to 1960 , he was assigned as a gi in the 3rd armored division to ray barracks , in the small town of friedberg near frankfurt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elvis checks in at friedberg 's ray barracks at the time , officials worried that elvis 's visit would corrupt the area 's youth .
now , the town is tapping the elvis myth to help keep itself on the tourism map .
bad nauheim and the neighboring village of friedberg were utterly dull until some local hardcore elvis fans decided to liven up things , said hans-ulrich halwe , founder and honorary chairman of the bad nauheim-friedberg elvis presley club .
elvis slept here the club was formed in 1998 by halwe and a handful of others , but has since grown to more than 200 members .
they meet once a month in the bar of the " best western hotel rosenau " , which is decked out in elvis memorabilia , and stage elvis events , and give tours of the area .
this weekend , freidberg and bad nauheim are ground zero for the celebration of the king 's 70th birthday .
along with elvis impersonators doing a las vegas revival show and a gospel concert -lrb- harking back to the king 's church music roots -rrb- , there will be an exhibit of " elvis art " and daily elvis tours featuring anecdotes about his 18-month stay .
up to 50,000 people are expected to attend , with " chartered buses coming from berlin , from belgium , everywhere , " halwe said .
anyone planning a last minute visit can pretty much forget about staying in room 10 of the grünewald hotel , though .
that 's the room in the family-run hotel where elvis slept for several weeks in 1958 , and " the only place in europe where you can sleep in the same bed elvis slept in , " halwe said .
for big events it gets booked up to a year in advance , however .
elvis pressler ?
an honored guest at the bad nauheim festivities will be karl heinz stein , elvis ’ s military barber and the ace in the hole of bad nauheim 's elvis lore .
as someone who could handle the heartthrob 's head on a regular basis -lrb- haircuts were given every eight days or so -rrb- stein was forward-thinking enough to stash away a few locks of the star ’ s hair and hang on to his scissors and combs .
these objects have since been sold , ending up in private collections or , alternately , at the museum of german history , where a reconstruction of the military barber shop in friedberg is a centerpiece of the current " elvis in germany " exhibit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the interior of the bad nauheim hair salon where elvis got a trim , now in a museum stein clearly enjoys talking about his days as barber to the king and even claimed a certain kinship with the young tennesseean .
" there was something different about elvis , he was very special .
he was so generous ... so polite , so genteel .
you could n't say the same about all of his compatriots , " said stein . " i said even then , ' its like he is really a german , like he has german blood . '
and i turned out to be right . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans hold vigil on elvis death anniversary , in front of elvis performance image stein 's feeling that the presley family came not from english but german ancestry found a supporter a few years back in the form of donald presley , a distant cousin of elvis who was researching his roots .
donald claims that elvis 's bloodline reaches back to winemakers from the rhineland palatinate region named pressler .
-lrb- with scottish and english lineage researchers also claiming elvis as their own , it is up to each branch of the presley family to fight for their versions of the truth . -rrb-
calling maybelline ...
of course , the elvis following in germany , as well as the celebration of his birth , goes well beyond the borders of bad nauheim .
the country 's oldest and largest club , founded in 1978 and with about 2,000 members , is the elvis presley gesellschaft .
the web site of the elvis club berlin lists some 33 other active elvis clubs in germany , though it is an unofficial count .
members of these clubs use the internet to keep in touch and keep informed , with messages from germans with suspiciously southern-american names -lrb- maybelline , caroline , jacky , shakey -rrb- discussing topics like the size of elvis 's jumpsuits and announcing elvis radio specials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg based elvis imitator , shelvis late night channel flippers around germany can expect to stumble across a lot of elvis movies , and anyone in a big city looking for an elvis party on friday or saturday wo n't have too much trouble finding one .
in hamburg , an elvis imitator called shelvis performs , while berlin 's estrel theater has revived its popular " an evening with elvis . "
the well-reviewed show stars versatile irish elvis tribute artist grahame patrick doyle , who estrel fished out of las vegas ' teeming elvis waters several years ago .
with his music , elvis did , indeed , help usher social disarray into german society .
but today , the aspect of the king 's persona that most seems to warm german hearts is his history as a gospel singer .
an award-winning german elvis impersonator known simply as " rio , the voice of elvis " -lrb- yes , he has had his name officially changed -rrb- will do an elvis-sings-gospel show over the weekend in friedberg 's 600-seat church .
two years ago , a similar concert sold out .
singing the gospel " the best thing about elvis is his versatility ... few people realize this , but elvis is the only white singer to win grammy awards for his gospel music , " said the 40-year-old rio , who has been doing elvis since the age of 10 .
" its amazing to play a concert and move people to tears .
any music that touches the heart , that 's gospel . "
when elvis left bad nauheim , " he said he would come back and sing for all the people who had been so good to him here , " hans-ulrich halwe said .
because elvis 's manager refused to leave the country , though , elvis never took his show abroad .
" i 'm still waiting , " added halwe with a laugh . jennifer abramsohn , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : elvis lives on in bonn forget memphis , las vegas and graceland - germany has always had a special place in its heart for elvis , and now , anyone wanting a personal glimpse of the man behind the myth need go no further than bonn .

while some missing people may still be found alive , he told a news conference this morning , many are now thought to have died in the boxing day tsunami disaster .
mr straw has been talking to the world 's media , during his official visit to thailand , where it seems , the vast majority of british casualties have happened .
he has seen for himself the patong beach area , popular with british tourists - and talked to the metropolitan police team which has been dealing with relatives of those missing and confirmed dead .
the official figures are now : 49 british people confirmed dead ; 391 missing people listed as likely or very likely to have died - based on credible reports placing them in the area where the tsunami struck on boxing day .
sian williams talked live to the foreign secretary jack straw , just after his press conference in phuket .
" some of the relatives have said it 's been chaos , " he conceded .
" disasters of this kind produce chaos - and it takes some time to produce order .
" the big difference between this and a train crash or a terrorist outrage is that it 's much more difficult to estimate the numbers of those involved because the area of the disaster is so vast .
" some bodies will never be found because they have gone out to sea ; others will need to be identified using dna , dental records or fingerprints , " he said .
the number of people listed as missing and likely to be dead is made up of those seen in the tsunami zone before the disaster .
but some back-packers may have been in the area without anyone knowing where they were .
the figures of the number of british people missing and feared dead have risen sharply , from around 200 .
mr straw explained that - with the help of the police teams - they have been waiting for the figures to settle into an accurate pattern : " some other countries gave out total numbers of people who people reported missing .
my judgement was that no purpose would be served by that - it would have scared people .
" our tradition is to rely on police expertise . "
breakfast 's mike sergeant looked at the impact on the tourist trade in thailand .

while some missing people may still be found alive , he told a news conference this morning , many are now thought to have died in the boxing day tsunami disaster .
mr straw has been talking to the world 's media , during his official visit to thailand , where it seems , the vast majority of british casualties have happened .
he has seen for himself the patong beach area , popular with british tourists - and talked to the metropolitan police team which has been dealing with relatives of those missing and confirmed dead .
the official figures are now : 49 british people confirmed dead ; 391 missing people listed as likely or very likely to have died - based on credible reports placing them in the area where the tsunami struck on boxing day .
sian williams talked live to the foreign secretary jack straw , just after his press conference in phuket .
" some of the relatives have said it 's been chaos , " he conceded .
" disasters of this kind produce chaos - and it takes some time to produce order .
" the big difference between this and a train crash or a terrorist outrage is that it 's much more difficult to estimate the numbers of those involved because the area of the disaster is so vast .
" some bodies will never be found because they have gone out to sea ; others will need to be identified using dna , dental records or fingerprints , " he said .
the number of people listed as missing and likely to be dead is made up of those seen in the tsunami zone before the disaster .
but some back-packers may have been in the area without anyone knowing where they were .
the figures of the number of british people missing and feared dead have risen sharply , from around 200 .
mr straw explained that - with the help of the police teams - they have been waiting for the figures to settle into an accurate pattern : " some other countries gave out total numbers of people who people reported missing .
my judgement was that no purpose would be served by that - it would have scared people .
" our tradition is to rely on police expertise . " watch our interview in full with jack straw breakfast 's mike sergeant looked at the impact on the tourist trade in thailand .

the results of the scottish executive survey suggested that there was now widespread acceptance of the fact that anyone can suffer from such problems .
it is only the second time that a national survey of public attitudes to mental health has been carried out .
researchers have published their findings from about 1,500 interviews .
they found that 98 % of those questioned believed that people with mental health issues should not be treated any differently .
fewer people said they felt that the public should be better protected from those with mental health problems - down from 32 % from a survey in 2002 to 15 % last year . "

although too early to say whether the figures constituted a permanent trend , deputy health minister rhona brankin said : " it is extremely encouraging to see that attitudes in scotland towards mental health are changing for the better .
' not complacent ' " by talking openly about mental health , people are more likely to seek help early , which in turn helps by improving their chances of a quicker recovery .
" by encouraging discussion of mental health , we can increase understanding which , in turn , promotes tolerance . "
the minister added : " much work has been done over the last two years to improve mental health and wellbeing and in particular to address the stigma which can be associated with mental health problems .
" but we are not complacent and will continue to break down the barriers that mental health problems can bring .
the most important thing is that attitudes are moving in the right direction and we will strive to build on this . "

the results of the scottish executive survey suggested that there was now widespread acceptance of the fact that anyone can suffer from such problems .
it is only the second time that a national survey of public attitudes to mental health has been carried out .
researchers have published their findings from about 1,500 interviews .
they found that 98 % of those questioned believed that people with mental health issues should not be treated any differently .
fewer people said they felt that the public should be better protected from those with mental health problems - down from 32 % from a survey in 2002 to 15 % last year .

women , and especially those aged 35-54 years , were among the most likely to have said they had experienced a problem , as were adults who found it difficult to manage on their income , or who rated their general health as poor .
although too early to say whether the figures constituted a permanent trend , deputy health minister rhona brankin said : " it is extremely encouraging to see that attitudes in scotland towards mental health are changing for the better .
' not complacent ' " by talking openly about mental health , people are more likely to seek help early , which in turn helps by improving their chances of a quicker recovery .
" by encouraging discussion of mental health , we can increase understanding which , in turn , promotes tolerance . "
the minister added : " much work has been done over the last two years to improve mental health and wellbeing and in particular to address the stigma which can be associated with mental health problems .
