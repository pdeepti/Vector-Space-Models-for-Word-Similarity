" we can not continue the negotiations with the europeans without having resumed some of our activities , " rohani told state television , adding iran 's decision to resume conversion of uranium - a precursor to enrichment - was " still valid . " " we are in favor of negotiations .
we can negotiate for months , but we can not negotiate under the present conditions , " rohani argued , repeating the demand to resume activities that were suspended in november 2004 as part of a deal with britain , france and germany . iran announced earlier that it was postponing a restart of work at isfahan , a move that would have violated the accord , following appeals from the so-called eu-3 and their offer of four-way talks . the three european nations also warned iran that it could wind up on the desk of the un security council . " we are in favor of the principle of negotiating , " rohani said , adding that " the fact that the resumption of our activities will be delayed by several days is not a problem . " " last chance for europe " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea logo speaking in vienna , french foreign minister michel barnier confirmed that he , german foreign minister joschka fischer and british foreign secretary jack straw would meet iranian authorities in the coming days . iranian media reports said the meeting would take place in either geneva or brussels .
" the coming days will be the last chance for the europeans , " iranian foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefin told reporters .
" with or without an agreement , we will restart our activities . " " the security council does not worry iran , " asefi said , but acknowledged that iran had also received appeals from south africa , malaysia and un secretary general kofi annan - who telephoned iran late saturday - to hold more talks . the eu has offered iran a package of incentives in return for " objective guarantees " it will not develop weapons - hoping to strike a deal similar to that which the united states and britain reached with libya . defiant message bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranians are angered by european demands that it shelve its uranium enrichment program but iran has expressed frustration with the pace of the negotiations , which remain deadlocked given iran 's refusal to abandon fuel cycle work . the stand-off worsened after the eu-3 last month rejected an iranian proposal to begin a phased resumption of enrichment .
iran complained the talks were being deliberately dragged out to keep the freeze in place . iran 's hardline parliament also took a defiant stand sunday , passing a bill that obliges the government to " guarantee " the islamic republic 's production of its own nuclear fuel . the bill , entitled " acquiring nuclear technology for peaceful purposes " was the latest move by right-wingers seeking to send a defiant message in the face of mounting international demands that iran abandon its nuclear fuel programme altogether . deputies had already begun voting on the bill in october 2004 , and it has been seen largely as a symbolic gesture .
after the vote , deputies in the majlis broke out into chants of " death to america . " one hardline mp , hasan kamran , said the bill " will send a message to world oppressors the us and its european footsoldiers .

dubbed by its creators as " grease on acid " , a new musical entitled " gabba gabba hey ! " tells the rock and rock story of us punk initiators , the ramones .
and it 's hit the stage in berlin . big news back in the golden era of the seventies rock scene , the ramones put a new spin on the old concept of anarchy as they crashed into the psyche of a generation looking for a new way to rebel .
their self-titled debut album , released in 1976 , was the first example of punk rock , making them the first of their kind , and the creators of a genre often more widely associated with the sex pistols . by way of testimony to their anarchic achievements , the band has become further immortalized the form of a musical . super sceptical it 's not exactly an obvious way of preserving a punk legacy , but after digesting his initial disgust at such a sacrilegious suggestion , jörg buttgeriet , the director of the german version of " gabba gabba hey " decided it might be right up his street . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director jörg buttgereit -lrb- l -rrb- , tommy ramone -lrb- r -rrb- buttgeriet , who is a bit of a cult figure in the world of trash horror movies , ultimately decided that his lack of experience in the musical genre was just the thing to make the project credible .
" i have no idea about musicals , but i 'm just going to do it .
and that 's punk rock , " he said . the show , which includes 18 of the band 's songs and is packaged in the form of an edgy love story , promises to be emotional , romantic , wild and rebellious - all in keeping with the casting and rehearsals procedure . lead actor , rolf zacher , was brought in the last minute to cover for martin semmelrogge , who is reported to have pulled out in order to serve a prison sentence . the ensemble also includes two musical novices who secured their roles after applying through a berlin city magazine .
rehearsals only started a couple of days before the opening night on tuesday . an ambient thing it 's actually not an attitude thing .
rather , it 's part of buttgeriet 's master plan on how to deliver the audience a natural and spontaneous atmosphere .
" i want to portray a mood of nonchalance , of matter-of-factness which they used to take onto stage with them when they were just being musicians , " he told the dpa news agency . being musicians in this case is the band " forgotten idols " who do justice to the wild , rebellious and even emotional moments in the original songs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the original ramones tommy ramone is the only surviving member of the original four-man line-up , and he 's working on the project as musical advisor .
" modern musicals are neither hip nor creative .
we want to give them their energy back , " he said . and he is certain that his fellow band members would have had derived the same fun from the project as him .
" joey would love it , dee dee would think it amusing and johnny would say : " as long as it makes some money ! " the show , which premiered in australia last year , is playing twelve dates in berlin before heading off on tour around germany .

their focus on added value puts pressure on companies .
but it also raises a company 's share value and profitability . the struggle over deutsche börse , the company that operates germany 's stock exchanges , has been settled for now : it wo n't take over the london stock exchange -lrb- lse -rrb- as originally planned - investors connected with hedge fund tci have made this clear . the reason for this is quite simple : takeovers usually cost the active party money and share value and dividends can drop as a result .
that 's something hedge funds ca n't afford .
it 's their mission to multiply the money they 've invested , as is the case with any kind of investor .
but tci and others are under extreme pressure as they buy and sell almost daily and make their money with falling and rising share values . german companies have become highly attractive for aggressive investors from the us and britain in recent years as the german financial sector began selling its shares . an eldorado for investors previously , the so-called " germany , inc . " had made the country 's firms unattractive for investors from abroad .
financial giants such as allianz , deutsche bank and others held shares in companies throughout the country .
it was a comfortable arrangement for decades as it gave these investors nice dividends and high reserves . in today 's globalized world , however , the germans have been forced to sell their shares to free up money .
foreigners are finding many lucrative investment opportunities as a result .
the share values of many companies are far below their real value as they 've been held by german banks for such a long time . they 're cheap when compared with others internationally , but that 's changing rapidly .
share holders may be happy about this , but it can cause tremendous upset within the companies .
deutsche börse is only the most recent example for this . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the funds ' interest is tremendous .
many german companies are or were seen as antiquated , because they relied on safe businesses for too long .
but since hedge funds have been admitted to the german market , they 're on a shopping tour , just like they have been in the us for years .
they want to see yields immediately and push for dividends to keep their own shareholders happy . a place for profiteers individual investors sometimes also play a role .
guy wyser-pratte is a classic example .
he shook up two german industrial conglomerates .
currently he holds 5 percent of iwka , a machine-building company based in karlsruhe that 's mainly known for its robots .
after wyser-pratte invested in the company in 2004 , its share value rose significantly .
he made it clear that he did n't agree with the company 's " sleepy " leadership . such statements make market analysts think that the sale of unprofitable parts of the company might be sold in the future .
whether this happens or not , wyser-pratte will be able to sell his shares at a higher price - even if nothing changes after all . that 's exactly what happened at rheinmetall .
the company 's share value was stagnating for years because of unprofitable divisions and a complex company structure .
in 2000 , wyser-pratte invested in the düsseldorf-based concern .
he made a lot of noise but did not succeed against the majority of share holders . in november 2001 , he sold his shares for 20 euros -lrb- $ 25.40 -rrb- .
he had bought them for 8.50 euros .
but wyser-pratte 's involvement led the company 's management to initiate a restructuring process analysts had called for .
the company sold off divisions , shrank by half and became highly profitable .
its share value now hovers around 40 euros - a positive thing for shareholders and employees alike . not all is well but there are also negative examples .
employees in particular often have to fear investors .
for decades , germany 's economy was governed by rules , regulations and agreements between unions and employers ' groups that are no longer viable in many cases .
as a result , companies with big names and good products were and are no longer competitive internationally and become easy targets for a new kind of investor - venture capital firms such as blackstone , kkr ; carlyle , argantis , lone star , capiton , apax , cinven , investcorp , 3i , permira , and bc partners to name just a few . take tenovis , formerly known as telenorma .

while investment companies control such firms , they streamline them with profit maximization in mind .
when the company is then taken to the market , the investors make money again .
in the case of wincor nixdorf , about 350 million euros were made on the stock exchange .

" we can not continue the negotiations with the europeans without having resumed some of our activities , " rohani told state television , adding iran 's decision to resume conversion of uranium - a precursor to enrichment - was " still valid . " " we are in favor of negotiations .
we can negotiate for months , but we can not negotiate under the present conditions , " rohani argued , repeating the demand to resume activities that were suspended in november 2004 as part of a deal with britain , france and germany . iran announced earlier that it was postponing a restart of work at isfahan , a move that would have violated the accord , following appeals from the so-called eu-3 and their offer of four-way talks . the three european nations also warned iran that it could wind up on the desk of the un security council . " we are in favor of the principle of negotiating , " rohani said , adding that " the fact that the resumption of our activities will be delayed by several days is not a problem . " " last chance for europe " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea logo speaking in vienna , french foreign minister michel barnier confirmed that he , german foreign minister joschka fischer and british foreign secretary jack straw would meet iranian authorities in the coming days . iranian media reports said the meeting would take place in either geneva or brussels .
" the coming days will be the last chance for the europeans , " iranian foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefin told reporters .
" with or without an agreement , we will restart our activities . " " the security council does not worry iran , " asefi said , but acknowledged that iran had also received appeals from south africa , malaysia and un secretary general kofi annan - who telephoned iran late saturday - to hold more talks . the eu has offered iran a package of incentives in return for " objective guarantees " it will not develop weapons - hoping to strike a deal similar to that which the united states and britain reached with libya . defiant message bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranians are angered by european demands that it shelve its uranium enrichment program but iran has expressed frustration with the pace of the negotiations , which remain deadlocked given iran 's refusal to abandon fuel cycle work . the stand-off worsened after the eu-3 last month rejected an iranian proposal to begin a phased resumption of enrichment .
iran complained the talks were being deliberately dragged out to keep the freeze in place . iran 's hardline parliament also took a defiant stand sunday , passing a bill that obliges the government to " guarantee " the islamic republic 's production of its own nuclear fuel . the bill , entitled " acquiring nuclear technology for peaceful purposes " was the latest move by right-wingers seeking to send a defiant message in the face of mounting international demands that iran abandon its nuclear fuel programme altogether . deputies had already begun voting on the bill in october 2004 , and it has been seen largely as a symbolic gesture .
after the vote , deputies in the majlis broke out into chants of " death to america . " one hardline mp , hasan kamran , said the bill " will send a message to world oppressors the us and its european footsoldiers .

dubbed by its creators as " grease on acid " , a new musical entitled " gabba gabba hey ! " tells the rock and rock story of us punk initiators , the ramones .
and it 's hit the stage in berlin . big news back in the golden era of the seventies rock scene , the ramones put a new spin on the old concept of anarchy as they crashed into the psyche of a generation looking for a new way to rebel .
their self-titled debut album , released in 1976 , was the first example of punk rock , making them the first of their kind , and the creators of a genre often more widely associated with the sex pistols . by way of testimony to their anarchic achievements , the band has become further immortalized the form of a musical . super sceptical it 's not exactly an obvious way of preserving a punk legacy , but after digesting his initial disgust at such a sacrilegious suggestion , jörg buttgeriet , the director of the german version of " gabba gabba hey " decided it might be right up his street . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director jörg buttgereit -lrb- l -rrb- , tommy ramone -lrb- r -rrb- buttgeriet , who is a bit of a cult figure in the world of trash horror movies , ultimately decided that his lack of experience in the musical genre was just the thing to make the project credible .
" i have no idea about musicals , but i 'm just going to do it .
and that 's punk rock , " he said . the show , which includes 18 of the band 's songs and is packaged in the form of an edgy love story , promises to be emotional , romantic , wild and rebellious - all in keeping with the casting and rehearsals procedure . lead actor , rolf zacher , was brought in the last minute to cover for martin semmelrogge , who is reported to have pulled out in order to serve a prison sentence . the ensemble also includes two musical novices who secured their roles after applying through a berlin city magazine .
rehearsals only started a couple of days before the opening night on tuesday . an ambient thing it 's actually not an attitude thing .
rather , it 's part of buttgeriet 's master plan on how to deliver the audience a natural and spontaneous atmosphere .
" i want to portray a mood of nonchalance , of matter-of-factness which they used to take onto stage with them when they were just being musicians , " he told the dpa news agency . being musicians in this case is the band " forgotten idols " who do justice to the wild , rebellious and even emotional moments in the original songs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the original ramones tommy ramone is the only surviving member of the original four-man line-up , and he 's working on the project as musical advisor .
" modern musicals are neither hip nor creative .
we want to give them their energy back , " he said . and he is certain that his fellow band members would have had derived the same fun from the project as him .
" joey would love it , dee dee would think it amusing and johnny would say : " as long as it makes some money ! " the show , which premiered in australia last year , is playing twelve dates in berlin before heading off on tour around germany .

albert czetwertynski was born in poland .
his father had made the mistake of deciding to return home after the war from the uk , where the family sought refuge from the nazis .
" my father unfortunately came back from england and in 1953 he was arrested by the communists and put into prison so they could take away his property , " he said .

the czetwertynskis managed to slip out of poland in 1960 and settle in canada .
but long before they returned to warsaw in the early 1990s , their confiscated palace in one of the polish capital ’ s posh districts had been torn down .
ironically , the prime lot was given by the communists to the us government to build an embassy .

there are many properties in warsaw that many former owners managed to get back , some of them through courts , some through selling their claim to someone who had better relations with the administration in warsaw .
then we decided that the law should be the same for everybody , so we should get compensation , or get our property back . "

little hope with little hope of getting decent compensation for their property , it looks like the younger generation of polish aristocrats , like the dashing marek czetwertynski , now in his mid-twenties , made the right decision to go into business to run a family company , rather than get locked into a losing battle with the polish state .

initially the polish government told them it couldn ’ t shoulder the burden of such claims , along with those advanced by millions of ordinary citizens who were deprived of their homes in the post-war border shifts .

albert czetwertynski was born in poland .
his father had made the mistake of deciding to return home after the war from the uk , where the family sought refuge from the nazis .

their focus on added value puts pressure on companies .
but it also raises a company 's share value and profitability . the struggle over deutsche börse , the company that operates germany 's stock exchanges , has been settled for now : it wo n't take over the london stock exchange -lrb- lse -rrb- as originally planned - investors connected with hedge fund tci have made this clear . the reason for this is quite simple : takeovers usually cost the active party money and share value and dividends can drop as a result .
that 's something hedge funds ca n't afford .
it 's their mission to multiply the money they 've invested , as is the case with any kind of investor .
but tci and others are under extreme pressure as they buy and sell almost daily and make their money with falling and rising share values . german companies have become highly attractive for aggressive investors from the us and britain in recent years as the german financial sector began selling its shares . an eldorado for investors previously , the so-called " germany , inc . " had made the country 's firms unattractive for investors from abroad .
financial giants such as allianz , deutsche bank and others held shares in companies throughout the country .
it was a comfortable arrangement for decades as it gave these investors nice dividends and high reserves . in today 's globalized world , however , the germans have been forced to sell their shares to free up money .
foreigners are finding many lucrative investment opportunities as a result .
the share values of many companies are far below their real value as they 've been held by german banks for such a long time . they 're cheap when compared with others internationally , but that 's changing rapidly .
share holders may be happy about this , but it can cause tremendous upset within the companies .
deutsche börse is only the most recent example for this . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the funds ' interest is tremendous .
many german companies are or were seen as antiquated , because they relied on safe businesses for too long .
but since hedge funds have been admitted to the german market , they 're on a shopping tour , just like they have been in the us for years .
they want to see yields immediately and push for dividends to keep their own shareholders happy . a place for profiteers individual investors sometimes also play a role .
guy wyser-pratte is a classic example .
he shook up two german industrial conglomerates .
currently he holds 5 percent of iwka , a machine-building company based in karlsruhe that 's mainly known for its robots .
after wyser-pratte invested in the company in 2004 , its share value rose significantly .
he made it clear that he did n't agree with the company 's " sleepy " leadership . such statements make market analysts think that the sale of unprofitable parts of the company might be sold in the future .
whether this happens or not , wyser-pratte will be able to sell his shares at a higher price - even if nothing changes after all . that 's exactly what happened at rheinmetall .
the company 's share value was stagnating for years because of unprofitable divisions and a complex company structure .
in 2000 , wyser-pratte invested in the düsseldorf-based concern .
he made a lot of noise but did not succeed against the majority of share holders . in november 2001 , he sold his shares for 20 euros -lrb- $ 25.40 -rrb- .
he had bought them for 8.50 euros .
but wyser-pratte 's involvement led the company 's management to initiate a restructuring process analysts had called for .
the company sold off divisions , shrank by half and became highly profitable .
its share value now hovers around 40 euros - a positive thing for shareholders and employees alike . not all is well but there are also negative examples .
employees in particular often have to fear investors .
for decades , germany 's economy was governed by rules , regulations and agreements between unions and employers ' groups that are no longer viable in many cases .
as a result , companies with big names and good products were and are no longer competitive internationally and become easy targets for a new kind of investor - venture capital firms such as blackstone , kkr ; carlyle , argantis , lone star , capiton , apax , cinven , investcorp , 3i , permira , and bc partners to name just a few . take tenovis , formerly known as telenorma .
kkr took over the company in 2002 and half of the employees were let go within the first two years despite an agreement to forego 12.5 percent of their wages .
managers on the other hand received bonuses for their good work .
since then tenovis has been sold again , this time to us concern avaya - with profit . another option is to take a company to the stock exchange .
this happened in the case of wincor nixdorf , formerly siemens nixdorf .
while investment companies control such firms , they streamline them with profit maximization in mind .
when the company is then taken to the market , the investors make money again .
in the case of wincor nixdorf , about 350 million euros were made on the stock exchange .
the company only received 125 million euros . the list of german companies with similar experiences is long : mtu will soon be taken to the stock exchange , gerresheimer glas , dynamit nobel , rodenstock , celanese , minimax , atu autoteile unger , debitel , tank & rast , duales system deutschland -lrb- dsd -rrb- .

their focus on added value puts pressure on companies .
but it also raises a company 's share value and profitability . the struggle over deutsche börse , the company that operates germany 's stock exchanges , has been settled for now : it wo n't take over the london stock exchange -lrb- lse -rrb- as originally planned - investors connected with hedge fund tci have made this clear . the reason for this is quite simple : takeovers usually cost the active party money and share value and dividends can drop as a result .
that 's something hedge funds ca n't afford .
it 's their mission to multiply the money they 've invested , as is the case with any kind of investor .
but tci and others are under extreme pressure as they buy and sell almost daily and make their money with falling and rising share values . german companies have become highly attractive for aggressive investors from the us and britain in recent years as the german financial sector began selling its shares . an eldorado for investors previously , the so-called " germany , inc . " had made the country 's firms unattractive for investors from abroad .
financial giants such as allianz , deutsche bank and others held shares in companies throughout the country .
it was a comfortable arrangement for decades as it gave these investors nice dividends and high reserves . in today 's globalized world , however , the germans have been forced to sell their shares to free up money .
foreigners are finding many lucrative investment opportunities as a result .
the share values of many companies are far below their real value as they 've been held by german banks for such a long time . they 're cheap when compared with others internationally , but that 's changing rapidly .
share holders may be happy about this , but it can cause tremendous upset within the companies .
deutsche börse is only the most recent example for this . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the funds ' interest is tremendous .
many german companies are or were seen as antiquated , because they relied on safe businesses for too long .
but since hedge funds have been admitted to the german market , they 're on a shopping tour , just like they have been in the us for years .
they want to see yields immediately and push for dividends to keep their own shareholders happy . a place for profiteers individual investors sometimes also play a role .
guy wyser-pratte is a classic example .
he shook up two german industrial conglomerates .
currently he holds 5 percent of iwka , a machine-building company based in karlsruhe that 's mainly known for its robots .
after wyser-pratte invested in the company in 2004 , its share value rose significantly .
he made it clear that he did n't agree with the company 's " sleepy " leadership . such statements make market analysts think that the sale of unprofitable parts of the company might be sold in the future .
whether this happens or not , wyser-pratte will be able to sell his shares at a higher price - even if nothing changes after all . that 's exactly what happened at rheinmetall .
the company 's share value was stagnating for years because of unprofitable divisions and a complex company structure .
in 2000 , wyser-pratte invested in the düsseldorf-based concern .
he made a lot of noise but did not succeed against the majority of share holders . in november 2001 , he sold his shares for 20 euros -lrb- $ 25.40 -rrb- .
he had bought them for 8.50 euros .
but wyser-pratte 's involvement led the company 's management to initiate a restructuring process analysts had called for .
the company sold off divisions , shrank by half and became highly profitable .
its share value now hovers around 40 euros - a positive thing for shareholders and employees alike . not all is well but there are also negative examples .
employees in particular often have to fear investors .
for decades , germany 's economy was governed by rules , regulations and agreements between unions and employers ' groups that are no longer viable in many cases .
as a result , companies with big names and good products were and are no longer competitive internationally and become easy targets for a new kind of investor - venture capital firms such as blackstone , kkr ; carlyle , argantis , lone star , capiton , apax , cinven , investcorp , 3i , permira , and bc partners to name just a few . take tenovis , formerly known as telenorma .
kkr took over the company in 2002 and half of the employees were let go within the first two years despite an agreement to forego 12.5 percent of their wages .
managers on the other hand received bonuses for their good work .
since then tenovis has been sold again , this time to us concern avaya - with profit . another option is to take a company to the stock exchange .
this happened in the case of wincor nixdorf , formerly siemens nixdorf .
while investment companies control such firms , they streamline them with profit maximization in mind .
when the company is then taken to the market , the investors make money again .
in the case of wincor nixdorf , about 350 million euros were made on the stock exchange .

the share values of many companies are far below their real value as they 've been held by german banks for such a long time . they 're cheap when compared with others internationally , but that 's changing rapidly .

many german companies are or were seen as antiquated , because they relied on safe businesses for too long .

guy wyser-pratte is a classic example .
he shook up two german industrial conglomerates .
currently he holds 5 percent of iwka , a machine-building company based in karlsruhe that 's mainly known for its robots .
after wyser-pratte invested in the company in 2004 , its share value rose significantly .
he made it clear that he did n't agree with the company 's " sleepy " leadership . such statements make market analysts think that the sale of unprofitable parts of the company might be sold in the future .
whether this happens or not , wyser-pratte will be able to sell his shares at a higher price - even if nothing changes after all . that 's exactly what happened at rheinmetall .
the company 's share value was stagnating for years because of unprofitable divisions and a complex company structure .
in 2000 , wyser-pratte invested in the düsseldorf-based concern .
he made a lot of noise but did not succeed against the majority of share holders . in november 2001 , he sold his shares for 20 euros -lrb- $ 25.40 -rrb- .
he had bought them for 8.50 euros .
but wyser-pratte 's involvement led the company 's management to initiate a restructuring process analysts had called for .
the company sold off divisions , shrank by half and became highly profitable .
its share value now hovers around 40 euros - a positive thing for shareholders and employees alike . not all is well but there are also negative examples .

but now , a year after joining the eu , some of these nobles are pushing to get compensation . the communists hated them , these once powerful owners of landed estates that stretched far into what is now ukraine and the baltic states .
and when they took over after the end of world war ii , they confiscated their imposing palaces and art collections , reducing them to near-poverty and forcing many into exile . some returned in the early 1990s after the fall of communism .
since then , poland ’ s aristocratic families have been campaigning for compensation .
initially the polish government told them it couldn ’ t shoulder the burden of such claims , along with those advanced by millions of ordinary citizens who were deprived of their homes in the post-war border shifts .
but aware of poland ’ s economic progress and its european union membership , former owners recently doubled up their efforts , finally forcing the government to adopt a restitution bill . accused of spying bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shifting borders , displaced people and property albert swiatopelk czetwertynski is member of one of poland ’ s oldest aristocratic families , whose records , originating in ukraine , which was part of poland for several centuries , date back to 960 .
the czetwertynskis once owned vast stretches of land in the east in what is today ukraine and belarus .
albert czetwertynski was born in poland .
his father had made the mistake of deciding to return home after the war from the uk , where the family sought refuge from the nazis .
" my father unfortunately came back from england and in 1953 he was arrested by the communists and put into prison so they could take away his property , " he said .
" he was accused of spying for the americans .
the entire accusation and records from the court proceedings indicate that everything was manipulated , it was one big lie . "
the czetwertynskis managed to slip out of poland in 1960 and settle in canada .
but long before they returned to warsaw in the early 1990s , their confiscated palace in one of the polish capital ’ s posh districts had been torn down .
ironically , the prime lot was given by the communists to the us government to build an embassy .
this 1960s office block is an eyesore in a street otherwise lined with elegant villas , but since the us embassy had all the papers to prove they were the rightful owners , there was little that the family could do .
seeking compensation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans want their former lands in poland and czech back , too " when i came back from canada , i didn ’ t even think to get any type of compensation for any property that used to belong to my grandmother - poland was in a very difficult economic situation and i didn ’ t feel this was the right time to make a claim , " he said . " but things have progressed in many different ways .
there are many properties in warsaw that many former owners managed to get back , some of them through courts , some through selling their claim to someone who had better relations with the administration in warsaw .
then we decided that the law should be the same for everybody , so we should get compensation , or get our property back . "
the complexity of the restitution program is further complicated by the fact that some property is now in other countries .
after the war , the allies redrew the map of postwar poland , leaving huge chunks of the country in what is now lithuania , belarus and ukraine . mariusz umiastowski , another polish aristocrat whose family used to own two palaces in what is now the lithuanian capital of vilnius , runs a foundation that restores historical monuments in the east that once belonged to polish aristocrats .
he also tries to promote the image of polish aristocracy as " more than bloodsucking landowners . "
" when poland and lithuania joined the european union , we thought that at last , the foundation would regain the property that rightfully belonged to it , " he said .
" it turns out that the former owners are still being discriminated against , especially if the owner left the country before world war ii .
so we are still waiting for the green light to open again . "
little hope with little hope of getting decent compensation for their property , it looks like the younger generation of polish aristocrats , like the dashing marek czetwertynski , now in his mid-twenties , made the right decision to go into business to run a family company , rather than get locked into a losing battle with the polish state .
born in canada , he returned to poland at the age of 10 .
these days , he is philosophical about the role the aristocracy can play in a fast-changing polish society .
" personally i think that aristocracy can ’ t play a role exactly similar to the one it did before , " he said .
" poland is a different country now , with different influences and the aristocracy doesn ’ t have the financial power that it used to have .
it ’ s important that everybody should play a role in keeping up democracy in poland , which everybody fought for , not just aristocracy . "
meanwhile , marek czetwertynski ’ s father and other aristocrats describe as ridiculous the government ’ s latest offer to pay them between 15 and 30 percent of the 1946 value of the confiscated properties , the year the nationalization process was started by the communists .
they think that although they are now living in a very different poland , the state still has the responsibility to put right past wrongs . rafal kiepuszewski -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reconciliation instead of reparation as tension simmers between germany and poland over world war ii compensation claims , a german journalist is trying to bring reason to the impassioned debate by urging ethnic germans to relinquish their claims .

initially the polish government told them it couldn ’ t shoulder the burden of such claims , along with those advanced by millions of ordinary citizens who were deprived of their homes in the post-war border shifts .

the czetwertynskis once owned vast stretches of land in the east in what is today ukraine and belarus .
albert czetwertynski was born in poland .
his father had made the mistake of deciding to return home after the war from the uk , where the family sought refuge from the nazis .
" my father unfortunately came back from england and in 1953 he was arrested by the communists and put into prison so they could take away his property , " he said .
" he was accused of spying for the americans .

the czetwertynskis managed to slip out of poland in 1960 and settle in canada .
but long before they returned to warsaw in the early 1990s , their confiscated palace in one of the polish capital ’ s posh districts had been torn down .
ironically , the prime lot was given by the communists to the us government to build an embassy .

little hope with little hope of getting decent compensation for their property , it looks like the younger generation of polish aristocrats , like the dashing marek czetwertynski , now in his mid-twenties , made the right decision to go into business to run a family company , rather than get locked into a losing battle with the polish state .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.05.2005 polish nobles want property back großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as poland moves on , aristocrats want past reconciled former owners of large estates , polish aristocrats saw much of their property confiscated by the communists .
but now , a year after joining the eu , some of these nobles are pushing to get compensation . the communists hated them , these once powerful owners of landed estates that stretched far into what is now ukraine and the baltic states .
and when they took over after the end of world war ii , they confiscated their imposing palaces and art collections , reducing them to near-poverty and forcing many into exile . some returned in the early 1990s after the fall of communism .
since then , poland ’ s aristocratic families have been campaigning for compensation .
initially the polish government told them it couldn ’ t shoulder the burden of such claims , along with those advanced by millions of ordinary citizens who were deprived of their homes in the post-war border shifts .
but aware of poland ’ s economic progress and its european union membership , former owners recently doubled up their efforts , finally forcing the government to adopt a restitution bill . accused of spying bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shifting borders , displaced people and property albert swiatopelk czetwertynski is member of one of poland ’ s oldest aristocratic families , whose records , originating in ukraine , which was part of poland for several centuries , date back to 960 .
the czetwertynskis once owned vast stretches of land in the east in what is today ukraine and belarus .
albert czetwertynski was born in poland .
his father had made the mistake of deciding to return home after the war from the uk , where the family sought refuge from the nazis .
" my father unfortunately came back from england and in 1953 he was arrested by the communists and put into prison so they could take away his property , " he said .
" he was accused of spying for the americans .
the entire accusation and records from the court proceedings indicate that everything was manipulated , it was one big lie . "
the czetwertynskis managed to slip out of poland in 1960 and settle in canada .
but long before they returned to warsaw in the early 1990s , their confiscated palace in one of the polish capital ’ s posh districts had been torn down .
ironically , the prime lot was given by the communists to the us government to build an embassy .
this 1960s office block is an eyesore in a street otherwise lined with elegant villas , but since the us embassy had all the papers to prove they were the rightful owners , there was little that the family could do .
seeking compensation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans want their former lands in poland and czech back , too " when i came back from canada , i didn ’ t even think to get any type of compensation for any property that used to belong to my grandmother - poland was in a very difficult economic situation and i didn ’ t feel this was the right time to make a claim , " he said . " but things have progressed in many different ways .
there are many properties in warsaw that many former owners managed to get back , some of them through courts , some through selling their claim to someone who had better relations with the administration in warsaw .
then we decided that the law should be the same for everybody , so we should get compensation , or get our property back . "
the complexity of the restitution program is further complicated by the fact that some property is now in other countries .
after the war , the allies redrew the map of postwar poland , leaving huge chunks of the country in what is now lithuania , belarus and ukraine . mariusz umiastowski , another polish aristocrat whose family used to own two palaces in what is now the lithuanian capital of vilnius , runs a foundation that restores historical monuments in the east that once belonged to polish aristocrats .
he also tries to promote the image of polish aristocracy as " more than bloodsucking landowners . "
" when poland and lithuania joined the european union , we thought that at last , the foundation would regain the property that rightfully belonged to it , " he said .
" it turns out that the former owners are still being discriminated against , especially if the owner left the country before world war ii .
so we are still waiting for the green light to open again . "
little hope with little hope of getting decent compensation for their property , it looks like the younger generation of polish aristocrats , like the dashing marek czetwertynski , now in his mid-twenties , made the right decision to go into business to run a family company , rather than get locked into a losing battle with the polish state .
born in canada , he returned to poland at the age of 10 .
these days , he is philosophical about the role the aristocracy can play in a fast-changing polish society .
" personally i think that aristocracy can ’ t play a role exactly similar to the one it did before , " he said .
" poland is a different country now , with different influences and the aristocracy doesn ’ t have the financial power that it used to have .
it ’ s important that everybody should play a role in keeping up democracy in poland , which everybody fought for , not just aristocracy . "
meanwhile , marek czetwertynski ’ s father and other aristocrats describe as ridiculous the government ’ s latest offer to pay them between 15 and 30 percent of the 1946 value of the confiscated properties , the year the nationalization process was started by the communists .
they think that although they are now living in a very different poland , the state still has the responsibility to put right past wrongs . rafal kiepuszewski -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reconciliation instead of reparation as tension simmers between germany and poland over world war ii compensation claims , a german journalist is trying to bring reason to the impassioned debate by urging ethnic germans to relinquish their claims .

dubbed by its creators as " grease on acid " , a new musical entitled " gabba gabba hey ! " tells the rock and rock story of us punk initiators , the ramones .
and it 's hit the stage in berlin . big news back in the golden era of the seventies rock scene , the ramones put a new spin on the old concept of anarchy as they crashed into the psyche of a generation looking for a new way to rebel .
their self-titled debut album , released in 1976 , was the first example of punk rock , making them the first of their kind , and the creators of a genre often more widely associated with the sex pistols . by way of testimony to their anarchic achievements , the band has become further immortalized the form of a musical . super sceptical it 's not exactly an obvious way of preserving a punk legacy , but after digesting his initial disgust at such a sacrilegious suggestion , jörg buttgeriet , the director of the german version of " gabba gabba hey " decided it might be right up his street . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director jörg buttgereit -lrb- l -rrb- , tommy ramone -lrb- r -rrb- buttgeriet , who is a bit of a cult figure in the world of trash horror movies , ultimately decided that his lack of experience in the musical genre was just the thing to make the project credible .

rehearsals only started a couple of days before the opening night on tuesday . an ambient thing it 's actually not an attitude thing .

their self-titled debut album , released in 1976 , was the first example of punk rock , making them the first of their kind , and the creators of a genre often more widely associated with the sex pistols . by way of testimony to their anarchic achievements , the band has become further immortalized the form of a musical . super sceptical it 's not exactly an obvious way of preserving a punk legacy , but after digesting his initial disgust at such a sacrilegious suggestion , jörg buttgeriet , the director of the german version of " gabba gabba hey " decided it might be right up his street . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director jörg buttgereit -lrb- l -rrb- , tommy ramone -lrb- r -rrb- buttgeriet , who is a bit of a cult figure in the world of trash horror movies , ultimately decided that his lack of experience in the musical genre was just the thing to make the project credible .
" i have no idea about musicals , but i 'm just going to do it .
and that 's punk rock , " he said . the show , which includes 18 of the band 's songs and is packaged in the form of an edgy love story , promises to be emotional , romantic , wild and rebellious - all in keeping with the casting and rehearsals procedure . lead actor , rolf zacher , was brought in the last minute to cover for martin semmelrogge , who is reported to have pulled out in order to serve a prison sentence . the ensemble also includes two musical novices who secured their roles after applying through a berlin city magazine .
rehearsals only started a couple of days before the opening night on tuesday . an ambient thing it 's actually not an attitude thing .
rather , it 's part of buttgeriet 's master plan on how to deliver the audience a natural and spontaneous atmosphere .
" i want to portray a mood of nonchalance , of matter-of-factness which they used to take onto stage with them when they were just being musicians , " he told the dpa news agency . being musicians in this case is the band " forgotten idols " who do justice to the wild , rebellious and even emotional moments in the original songs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the original ramones tommy ramone is the only surviving member of the original four-man line-up , and he 's working on the project as musical advisor .
" modern musicals are neither hip nor creative .
we want to give them their energy back , " he said . and he is certain that his fellow band members would have had derived the same fun from the project as him .
" joey would love it , dee dee would think it amusing and johnny would say : " as long as it makes some money ! " the show , which premiered in australia last year , is playing twelve dates in berlin before heading off on tour around germany .

" we can not continue the negotiations with the europeans without having resumed some of our activities , " rohani told state television , adding iran 's decision to resume conversion of uranium - a precursor to enrichment - was " still valid .

" with or without an agreement , we will restart our activities .

iran complained the talks were being deliberately dragged out to keep the freeze in place . iran 's hardline parliament also took a defiant stand sunday , passing a bill that obliges the government to " guarantee " the islamic republic 's production of its own nuclear fuel . the bill , entitled " acquiring nuclear technology for peaceful purposes " was the latest move by right-wingers seeking to send a defiant message in the face of mounting international demands that iran abandon its nuclear fuel programme altogether . deputies had already begun voting on the bill in october 2004 , and it has been seen largely as a symbolic gesture .

" we can not continue the negotiations with the europeans without having resumed some of our activities , " rohani told state television , adding iran 's decision to resume conversion of uranium - a precursor to enrichment - was " still valid . " " we are in favor of negotiations .
we can negotiate for months , but we can not negotiate under the present conditions , " rohani argued , repeating the demand to resume activities that were suspended in november 2004 as part of a deal with britain , france and germany . iran announced earlier that it was postponing a restart of work at isfahan , a move that would have violated the accord , following appeals from the so-called eu-3 and their offer of four-way talks . the three european nations also warned iran that it could wind up on the desk of the un security council . " we are in favor of the principle of negotiating , " rohani said , adding that " the fact that the resumption of our activities will be delayed by several days is not a problem . " " last chance for europe " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea logo speaking in vienna , french foreign minister michel barnier confirmed that he , german foreign minister joschka fischer and british foreign secretary jack straw would meet iranian authorities in the coming days . iranian media reports said the meeting would take place in either geneva or brussels .
" the coming days will be the last chance for the europeans , " iranian foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefin told reporters .
" with or without an agreement , we will restart our activities . " " the security council does not worry iran , " asefi said , but acknowledged that iran had also received appeals from south africa , malaysia and un secretary general kofi annan - who telephoned iran late saturday - to hold more talks . the eu has offered iran a package of incentives in return for " objective guarantees " it will not develop weapons - hoping to strike a deal similar to that which the united states and britain reached with libya . defiant message bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranians are angered by european demands that it shelve its uranium enrichment program but iran has expressed frustration with the pace of the negotiations , which remain deadlocked given iran 's refusal to abandon fuel cycle work . the stand-off worsened after the eu-3 last month rejected an iranian proposal to begin a phased resumption of enrichment .
iran complained the talks were being deliberately dragged out to keep the freeze in place . iran 's hardline parliament also took a defiant stand sunday , passing a bill that obliges the government to " guarantee " the islamic republic 's production of its own nuclear fuel . the bill , entitled " acquiring nuclear technology for peaceful purposes " was the latest move by right-wingers seeking to send a defiant message in the face of mounting international demands that iran abandon its nuclear fuel programme altogether . deputies had already begun voting on the bill in october 2004 , and it has been seen largely as a symbolic gesture .
after the vote , deputies in the majlis broke out into chants of " death to america . " one hardline mp , hasan kamran , said the bill " will send a message to world oppressors the us and its european footsoldiers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 15.05.2005 for sale : germany , inc . großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investors have begun waking up germany 's sleeping beauties financial investors have recently shown their might by shaking up deutsche börse .
their focus on added value puts pressure on companies .
but it also raises a company 's share value and profitability . the struggle over deutsche börse , the company that operates germany 's stock exchanges , has been settled for now : it wo n't take over the london stock exchange -lrb- lse -rrb- as originally planned - investors connected with hedge fund tci have made this clear . the reason for this is quite simple : takeovers usually cost the active party money and share value and dividends can drop as a result .
that 's something hedge funds ca n't afford .
it 's their mission to multiply the money they 've invested , as is the case with any kind of investor .
but tci and others are under extreme pressure as they buy and sell almost daily and make their money with falling and rising share values . german companies have become highly attractive for aggressive investors from the us and britain in recent years as the german financial sector began selling its shares . an eldorado for investors previously , the so-called " germany , inc . " had made the country 's firms unattractive for investors from abroad .
financial giants such as allianz , deutsche bank and others held shares in companies throughout the country .
it was a comfortable arrangement for decades as it gave these investors nice dividends and high reserves . in today 's globalized world , however , the germans have been forced to sell their shares to free up money .
foreigners are finding many lucrative investment opportunities as a result .
the share values of many companies are far below their real value as they 've been held by german banks for such a long time . they 're cheap when compared with others internationally , but that 's changing rapidly .
share holders may be happy about this , but it can cause tremendous upset within the companies .
deutsche börse is only the most recent example for this . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the funds ' interest is tremendous .
many german companies are or were seen as antiquated , because they relied on safe businesses for too long .
but since hedge funds have been admitted to the german market , they 're on a shopping tour , just like they have been in the us for years .
they want to see yields immediately and push for dividends to keep their own shareholders happy . a place for profiteers individual investors sometimes also play a role .
guy wyser-pratte is a classic example .
he shook up two german industrial conglomerates .
currently he holds 5 percent of iwka , a machine-building company based in karlsruhe that 's mainly known for its robots .
after wyser-pratte invested in the company in 2004 , its share value rose significantly .
he made it clear that he did n't agree with the company 's " sleepy " leadership . such statements make market analysts think that the sale of unprofitable parts of the company might be sold in the future .
whether this happens or not , wyser-pratte will be able to sell his shares at a higher price - even if nothing changes after all . that 's exactly what happened at rheinmetall .
the company 's share value was stagnating for years because of unprofitable divisions and a complex company structure .
in 2000 , wyser-pratte invested in the düsseldorf-based concern .
he made a lot of noise but did not succeed against the majority of share holders . in november 2001 , he sold his shares for 20 euros -lrb- $ 25.40 -rrb- .
he had bought them for 8.50 euros .
but wyser-pratte 's involvement led the company 's management to initiate a restructuring process analysts had called for .
the company sold off divisions , shrank by half and became highly profitable .
its share value now hovers around 40 euros - a positive thing for shareholders and employees alike . not all is well but there are also negative examples .
employees in particular often have to fear investors .
for decades , germany 's economy was governed by rules , regulations and agreements between unions and employers ' groups that are no longer viable in many cases .
as a result , companies with big names and good products were and are no longer competitive internationally and become easy targets for a new kind of investor - venture capital firms such as blackstone , kkr ; carlyle , argantis , lone star , capiton , apax , cinven , investcorp , 3i , permira , and bc partners to name just a few . take tenovis , formerly known as telenorma .
kkr took over the company in 2002 and half of the employees were let go within the first two years despite an agreement to forego 12.5 percent of their wages .
managers on the other hand received bonuses for their good work .
since then tenovis has been sold again , this time to us concern avaya - with profit . another option is to take a company to the stock exchange .
this happened in the case of wincor nixdorf , formerly siemens nixdorf .
while investment companies control such firms , they streamline them with profit maximization in mind .
when the company is then taken to the market , the investors make money again .
in the case of wincor nixdorf , about 350 million euros were made on the stock exchange .
the company only received 125 million euros . the list of german companies with similar experiences is long : mtu will soon be taken to the stock exchange , gerresheimer glas , dynamit nobel , rodenstock , celanese , minimax , atu autoteile unger , debitel , tank & rast , duales system deutschland -lrb- dsd -rrb- .
more will follow . investigating the börse case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chairman of the board of german stock exchange -lrb- deutsche börse ag -rrb- werner g. seifert as far as deutsche börse is concerned , officials for germany 's financial sector watchdog bafin announced thursday that it is investigating the role played by hedge funds in the removal of the company 's chief executive officer this week . bafin was looking to find out whether the funds had acted in concert to force ceo werner seifert to quit after already forcing him to abandon plans for the lse takeover . if that were the case , and if funds held a combined stake of more than 30 percent in deutsche börse , they would be obliged under german law to launch a public takeover offer for the remaining shares . bafin refused to provide a precise timetable for the investigation , but the spokeswoman said the probe could take " some weeks .

albert czetwertynski was born in poland .
his father had made the mistake of deciding to return home after the war from the uk , where the family sought refuge from the nazis .
" my father unfortunately came back from england and in 1953 he was arrested by the communists and put into prison so they could take away his property , " he said .
" he was accused of spying for the americans .

but long before they returned to warsaw in the early 1990s , their confiscated palace in one of the polish capital ’ s posh districts had been torn down .
ironically , the prime lot was given by the communists to the us government to build an embassy .

he made a lot of noise but did not succeed against the majority of share holders . in november 2001 , he sold his shares for 20 euros -lrb- $ 25.40 -rrb- .
he had bought them for 8.50 euros .
but wyser-pratte 's involvement led the company 's management to initiate a restructuring process analysts had called for .
the company sold off divisions , shrank by half and became highly profitable .
its share value now hovers around 40 euros - a positive thing for shareholders and employees alike . not all is well but there are also negative examples .
employees in particular often have to fear investors .
for decades , germany 's economy was governed by rules , regulations and agreements between unions and employers ' groups that are no longer viable in many cases .
as a result , companies with big names and good products were and are no longer competitive internationally and become easy targets for a new kind of investor - venture capital firms such as blackstone , kkr ; carlyle , argantis , lone star , capiton , apax , cinven , investcorp , 3i , permira , and bc partners to name just a few . take tenovis , formerly known as telenorma .
kkr took over the company in 2002 and half of the employees were let go within the first two years despite an agreement to forego 12.5 percent of their wages .
managers on the other hand received bonuses for their good work .
since then tenovis has been sold again , this time to us concern avaya - with profit . another option is to take a company to the stock exchange .
this happened in the case of wincor nixdorf , formerly siemens nixdorf .
while investment companies control such firms , they streamline them with profit maximization in mind .
when the company is then taken to the market , the investors make money again .
in the case of wincor nixdorf , about 350 million euros were made on the stock exchange .
the company only received 125 million euros . the list of german companies with similar experiences is long : mtu will soon be taken to the stock exchange , gerresheimer glas , dynamit nobel , rodenstock , celanese , minimax , atu autoteile unger , debitel , tank & rast , duales system deutschland -lrb- dsd -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 15.05.2005 for sale : germany , inc . großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investors have begun waking up germany 's sleeping beauties financial investors have recently shown their might by shaking up deutsche börse .
their focus on added value puts pressure on companies .
but it also raises a company 's share value and profitability . the struggle over deutsche börse , the company that operates germany 's stock exchanges , has been settled for now : it wo n't take over the london stock exchange -lrb- lse -rrb- as originally planned - investors connected with hedge fund tci have made this clear . the reason for this is quite simple : takeovers usually cost the active party money and share value and dividends can drop as a result .
that 's something hedge funds ca n't afford .
it 's their mission to multiply the money they 've invested , as is the case with any kind of investor .
but tci and others are under extreme pressure as they buy and sell almost daily and make their money with falling and rising share values . german companies have become highly attractive for aggressive investors from the us and britain in recent years as the german financial sector began selling its shares . an eldorado for investors previously , the so-called " germany , inc . " had made the country 's firms unattractive for investors from abroad .
financial giants such as allianz , deutsche bank and others held shares in companies throughout the country .
it was a comfortable arrangement for decades as it gave these investors nice dividends and high reserves . in today 's globalized world , however , the germans have been forced to sell their shares to free up money .
foreigners are finding many lucrative investment opportunities as a result .
the share values of many companies are far below their real value as they 've been held by german banks for such a long time . they 're cheap when compared with others internationally , but that 's changing rapidly .
share holders may be happy about this , but it can cause tremendous upset within the companies .
deutsche börse is only the most recent example for this . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the funds ' interest is tremendous .
many german companies are or were seen as antiquated , because they relied on safe businesses for too long .
but since hedge funds have been admitted to the german market , they 're on a shopping tour , just like they have been in the us for years .
they want to see yields immediately and push for dividends to keep their own shareholders happy . a place for profiteers individual investors sometimes also play a role .
guy wyser-pratte is a classic example .
he shook up two german industrial conglomerates .
currently he holds 5 percent of iwka , a machine-building company based in karlsruhe that 's mainly known for its robots .
after wyser-pratte invested in the company in 2004 , its share value rose significantly .
he made it clear that he did n't agree with the company 's " sleepy " leadership . such statements make market analysts think that the sale of unprofitable parts of the company might be sold in the future .
whether this happens or not , wyser-pratte will be able to sell his shares at a higher price - even if nothing changes after all . that 's exactly what happened at rheinmetall .
the company 's share value was stagnating for years because of unprofitable divisions and a complex company structure .
in 2000 , wyser-pratte invested in the düsseldorf-based concern .
he made a lot of noise but did not succeed against the majority of share holders . in november 2001 , he sold his shares for 20 euros -lrb- $ 25.40 -rrb- .
he had bought them for 8.50 euros .
but wyser-pratte 's involvement led the company 's management to initiate a restructuring process analysts had called for .
the company sold off divisions , shrank by half and became highly profitable .
its share value now hovers around 40 euros - a positive thing for shareholders and employees alike . not all is well but there are also negative examples .
employees in particular often have to fear investors .
for decades , germany 's economy was governed by rules , regulations and agreements between unions and employers ' groups that are no longer viable in many cases .
as a result , companies with big names and good products were and are no longer competitive internationally and become easy targets for a new kind of investor - venture capital firms such as blackstone , kkr ; carlyle , argantis , lone star , capiton , apax , cinven , investcorp , 3i , permira , and bc partners to name just a few . take tenovis , formerly known as telenorma .
kkr took over the company in 2002 and half of the employees were let go within the first two years despite an agreement to forego 12.5 percent of their wages .
managers on the other hand received bonuses for their good work .
since then tenovis has been sold again , this time to us concern avaya - with profit . another option is to take a company to the stock exchange .
this happened in the case of wincor nixdorf , formerly siemens nixdorf .
while investment companies control such firms , they streamline them with profit maximization in mind .
when the company is then taken to the market , the investors make money again .
in the case of wincor nixdorf , about 350 million euros were made on the stock exchange .
the company only received 125 million euros . the list of german companies with similar experiences is long : mtu will soon be taken to the stock exchange , gerresheimer glas , dynamit nobel , rodenstock , celanese , minimax , atu autoteile unger , debitel , tank & rast , duales system deutschland -lrb- dsd -rrb- .
more will follow . investigating the börse case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chairman of the board of german stock exchange -lrb- deutsche börse ag -rrb- werner g. seifert as far as deutsche börse is concerned , officials for germany 's financial sector watchdog bafin announced thursday that it is investigating the role played by hedge funds in the removal of the company 's chief executive officer this week . bafin was looking to find out whether the funds had acted in concert to force ceo werner seifert to quit after already forcing him to abandon plans for the lse takeover . if that were the case , and if funds held a combined stake of more than 30 percent in deutsche börse , they would be obliged under german law to launch a public takeover offer for the remaining shares . bafin refused to provide a precise timetable for the investigation , but the spokeswoman said the probe could take " some weeks .

initially the polish government told them it couldn ’ t shoulder the burden of such claims , along with those advanced by millions of ordinary citizens who were deprived of their homes in the post-war border shifts .

albert czetwertynski was born in poland .
his father had made the mistake of deciding to return home after the war from the uk , where the family sought refuge from the nazis .

since then , poland ’ s aristocratic families have been campaigning for compensation .
initially the polish government told them it couldn ’ t shoulder the burden of such claims , along with those advanced by millions of ordinary citizens who were deprived of their homes in the post-war border shifts .
but aware of poland ’ s economic progress and its european union membership , former owners recently doubled up their efforts , finally forcing the government to adopt a restitution bill . accused of spying bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shifting borders , displaced people and property albert swiatopelk czetwertynski is member of one of poland ’ s oldest aristocratic families , whose records , originating in ukraine , which was part of poland for several centuries , date back to 960 .
the czetwertynskis once owned vast stretches of land in the east in what is today ukraine and belarus .
albert czetwertynski was born in poland .
his father had made the mistake of deciding to return home after the war from the uk , where the family sought refuge from the nazis .
" my father unfortunately came back from england and in 1953 he was arrested by the communists and put into prison so they could take away his property , " he said .
" he was accused of spying for the americans .
the entire accusation and records from the court proceedings indicate that everything was manipulated , it was one big lie . "
the czetwertynskis managed to slip out of poland in 1960 and settle in canada .
but long before they returned to warsaw in the early 1990s , their confiscated palace in one of the polish capital ’ s posh districts had been torn down .
ironically , the prime lot was given by the communists to the us government to build an embassy .
this 1960s office block is an eyesore in a street otherwise lined with elegant villas , but since the us embassy had all the papers to prove they were the rightful owners , there was little that the family could do .

" but things have progressed in many different ways .
there are many properties in warsaw that many former owners managed to get back , some of them through courts , some through selling their claim to someone who had better relations with the administration in warsaw .
then we decided that the law should be the same for everybody , so we should get compensation , or get our property back . "
the complexity of the restitution program is further complicated by the fact that some property is now in other countries .
after the war , the allies redrew the map of postwar poland , leaving huge chunks of the country in what is now lithuania , belarus and ukraine . mariusz umiastowski , another polish aristocrat whose family used to own two palaces in what is now the lithuanian capital of vilnius , runs a foundation that restores historical monuments in the east that once belonged to polish aristocrats .
he also tries to promote the image of polish aristocracy as " more than bloodsucking landowners . "
" when poland and lithuania joined the european union , we thought that at last , the foundation would regain the property that rightfully belonged to it , " he said .
" it turns out that the former owners are still being discriminated against , especially if the owner left the country before world war ii .
so we are still waiting for the green light to open again . "
little hope with little hope of getting decent compensation for their property , it looks like the younger generation of polish aristocrats , like the dashing marek czetwertynski , now in his mid-twenties , made the right decision to go into business to run a family company , rather than get locked into a losing battle with the polish state .
born in canada , he returned to poland at the age of 10 .
these days , he is philosophical about the role the aristocracy can play in a fast-changing polish society .
" personally i think that aristocracy can ’ t play a role exactly similar to the one it did before , " he said .
" poland is a different country now , with different influences and the aristocracy doesn ’ t have the financial power that it used to have .
it ’ s important that everybody should play a role in keeping up democracy in poland , which everybody fought for , not just aristocracy . "

their focus on added value puts pressure on companies .
but it also raises a company 's share value and profitability . the struggle over deutsche börse , the company that operates germany 's stock exchanges , has been settled for now : it wo n't take over the london stock exchange -lrb- lse -rrb- as originally planned - investors connected with hedge fund tci have made this clear . the reason for this is quite simple : takeovers usually cost the active party money and share value and dividends can drop as a result .
that 's something hedge funds ca n't afford .
it 's their mission to multiply the money they 've invested , as is the case with any kind of investor .
but tci and others are under extreme pressure as they buy and sell almost daily and make their money with falling and rising share values . german companies have become highly attractive for aggressive investors from the us and britain in recent years as the german financial sector began selling its shares . an eldorado for investors previously , the so-called " germany , inc . " had made the country 's firms unattractive for investors from abroad .
financial giants such as allianz , deutsche bank and others held shares in companies throughout the country .
it was a comfortable arrangement for decades as it gave these investors nice dividends and high reserves . in today 's globalized world , however , the germans have been forced to sell their shares to free up money .
foreigners are finding many lucrative investment opportunities as a result .
the share values of many companies are far below their real value as they 've been held by german banks for such a long time . they 're cheap when compared with others internationally , but that 's changing rapidly .
share holders may be happy about this , but it can cause tremendous upset within the companies .
deutsche börse is only the most recent example for this . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the funds ' interest is tremendous .
many german companies are or were seen as antiquated , because they relied on safe businesses for too long .
but since hedge funds have been admitted to the german market , they 're on a shopping tour , just like they have been in the us for years .
they want to see yields immediately and push for dividends to keep their own shareholders happy . a place for profiteers individual investors sometimes also play a role .
guy wyser-pratte is a classic example .
he shook up two german industrial conglomerates .
currently he holds 5 percent of iwka , a machine-building company based in karlsruhe that 's mainly known for its robots .
after wyser-pratte invested in the company in 2004 , its share value rose significantly .
he made it clear that he did n't agree with the company 's " sleepy " leadership . such statements make market analysts think that the sale of unprofitable parts of the company might be sold in the future .
whether this happens or not , wyser-pratte will be able to sell his shares at a higher price - even if nothing changes after all . that 's exactly what happened at rheinmetall .
the company 's share value was stagnating for years because of unprofitable divisions and a complex company structure .
in 2000 , wyser-pratte invested in the düsseldorf-based concern .
he made a lot of noise but did not succeed against the majority of share holders . in november 2001 , he sold his shares for 20 euros -lrb- $ 25.40 -rrb- .
he had bought them for 8.50 euros .
but wyser-pratte 's involvement led the company 's management to initiate a restructuring process analysts had called for .
the company sold off divisions , shrank by half and became highly profitable .
its share value now hovers around 40 euros - a positive thing for shareholders and employees alike . not all is well but there are also negative examples .
employees in particular often have to fear investors .
for decades , germany 's economy was governed by rules , regulations and agreements between unions and employers ' groups that are no longer viable in many cases .
as a result , companies with big names and good products were and are no longer competitive internationally and become easy targets for a new kind of investor - venture capital firms such as blackstone , kkr ; carlyle , argantis , lone star , capiton , apax , cinven , investcorp , 3i , permira , and bc partners to name just a few . take tenovis , formerly known as telenorma .
kkr took over the company in 2002 and half of the employees were let go within the first two years despite an agreement to forego 12.5 percent of their wages .
managers on the other hand received bonuses for their good work .
since then tenovis has been sold again , this time to us concern avaya - with profit . another option is to take a company to the stock exchange .
this happened in the case of wincor nixdorf , formerly siemens nixdorf .
while investment companies control such firms , they streamline them with profit maximization in mind .
when the company is then taken to the market , the investors make money again .
in the case of wincor nixdorf , about 350 million euros were made on the stock exchange .
the company only received 125 million euros . the list of german companies with similar experiences is long : mtu will soon be taken to the stock exchange , gerresheimer glas , dynamit nobel , rodenstock , celanese , minimax , atu autoteile unger , debitel , tank & rast , duales system deutschland -lrb- dsd -rrb- .

their focus on added value puts pressure on companies .
but it also raises a company 's share value and profitability . the struggle over deutsche börse , the company that operates germany 's stock exchanges , has been settled for now : it wo n't take over the london stock exchange -lrb- lse -rrb- as originally planned - investors connected with hedge fund tci have made this clear . the reason for this is quite simple : takeovers usually cost the active party money and share value and dividends can drop as a result .
that 's something hedge funds ca n't afford .
it 's their mission to multiply the money they 've invested , as is the case with any kind of investor .
but tci and others are under extreme pressure as they buy and sell almost daily and make their money with falling and rising share values . german companies have become highly attractive for aggressive investors from the us and britain in recent years as the german financial sector began selling its shares . an eldorado for investors previously , the so-called " germany , inc . " had made the country 's firms unattractive for investors from abroad .
financial giants such as allianz , deutsche bank and others held shares in companies throughout the country .
it was a comfortable arrangement for decades as it gave these investors nice dividends and high reserves . in today 's globalized world , however , the germans have been forced to sell their shares to free up money .
foreigners are finding many lucrative investment opportunities as a result .
the share values of many companies are far below their real value as they 've been held by german banks for such a long time . they 're cheap when compared with others internationally , but that 's changing rapidly .
share holders may be happy about this , but it can cause tremendous upset within the companies .
deutsche börse is only the most recent example for this . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the funds ' interest is tremendous .
many german companies are or were seen as antiquated , because they relied on safe businesses for too long .
but since hedge funds have been admitted to the german market , they 're on a shopping tour , just like they have been in the us for years .
they want to see yields immediately and push for dividends to keep their own shareholders happy . a place for profiteers individual investors sometimes also play a role .
guy wyser-pratte is a classic example .
he shook up two german industrial conglomerates .
currently he holds 5 percent of iwka , a machine-building company based in karlsruhe that 's mainly known for its robots .
after wyser-pratte invested in the company in 2004 , its share value rose significantly .
he made it clear that he did n't agree with the company 's " sleepy " leadership . such statements make market analysts think that the sale of unprofitable parts of the company might be sold in the future .
whether this happens or not , wyser-pratte will be able to sell his shares at a higher price - even if nothing changes after all . that 's exactly what happened at rheinmetall .
the company 's share value was stagnating for years because of unprofitable divisions and a complex company structure .
in 2000 , wyser-pratte invested in the düsseldorf-based concern .
he made a lot of noise but did not succeed against the majority of share holders . in november 2001 , he sold his shares for 20 euros -lrb- $ 25.40 -rrb- .
he had bought them for 8.50 euros .
but wyser-pratte 's involvement led the company 's management to initiate a restructuring process analysts had called for .
the company sold off divisions , shrank by half and became highly profitable .
its share value now hovers around 40 euros - a positive thing for shareholders and employees alike . not all is well but there are also negative examples .
employees in particular often have to fear investors .
for decades , germany 's economy was governed by rules , regulations and agreements between unions and employers ' groups that are no longer viable in many cases .
as a result , companies with big names and good products were and are no longer competitive internationally and become easy targets for a new kind of investor - venture capital firms such as blackstone , kkr ; carlyle , argantis , lone star , capiton , apax , cinven , investcorp , 3i , permira , and bc partners to name just a few . take tenovis , formerly known as telenorma .

but now , a year after joining the eu , some of these nobles are pushing to get compensation . the communists hated them , these once powerful owners of landed estates that stretched far into what is now ukraine and the baltic states .
and when they took over after the end of world war ii , they confiscated their imposing palaces and art collections , reducing them to near-poverty and forcing many into exile . some returned in the early 1990s after the fall of communism .
since then , poland ’ s aristocratic families have been campaigning for compensation .
initially the polish government told them it couldn ’ t shoulder the burden of such claims , along with those advanced by millions of ordinary citizens who were deprived of their homes in the post-war border shifts .
but aware of poland ’ s economic progress and its european union membership , former owners recently doubled up their efforts , finally forcing the government to adopt a restitution bill . accused of spying bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shifting borders , displaced people and property albert swiatopelk czetwertynski is member of one of poland ’ s oldest aristocratic families , whose records , originating in ukraine , which was part of poland for several centuries , date back to 960 .
the czetwertynskis once owned vast stretches of land in the east in what is today ukraine and belarus .
albert czetwertynski was born in poland .
his father had made the mistake of deciding to return home after the war from the uk , where the family sought refuge from the nazis .
" my father unfortunately came back from england and in 1953 he was arrested by the communists and put into prison so they could take away his property , " he said .
" he was accused of spying for the americans .
the entire accusation and records from the court proceedings indicate that everything was manipulated , it was one big lie . "
the czetwertynskis managed to slip out of poland in 1960 and settle in canada .
but long before they returned to warsaw in the early 1990s , their confiscated palace in one of the polish capital ’ s posh districts had been torn down .
ironically , the prime lot was given by the communists to the us government to build an embassy .
this 1960s office block is an eyesore in a street otherwise lined with elegant villas , but since the us embassy had all the papers to prove they were the rightful owners , there was little that the family could do .
seeking compensation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans want their former lands in poland and czech back , too " when i came back from canada , i didn ’ t even think to get any type of compensation for any property that used to belong to my grandmother - poland was in a very difficult economic situation and i didn ’ t feel this was the right time to make a claim , " he said . " but things have progressed in many different ways .
there are many properties in warsaw that many former owners managed to get back , some of them through courts , some through selling their claim to someone who had better relations with the administration in warsaw .
then we decided that the law should be the same for everybody , so we should get compensation , or get our property back . "
the complexity of the restitution program is further complicated by the fact that some property is now in other countries .
after the war , the allies redrew the map of postwar poland , leaving huge chunks of the country in what is now lithuania , belarus and ukraine . mariusz umiastowski , another polish aristocrat whose family used to own two palaces in what is now the lithuanian capital of vilnius , runs a foundation that restores historical monuments in the east that once belonged to polish aristocrats .
he also tries to promote the image of polish aristocracy as " more than bloodsucking landowners . "
" when poland and lithuania joined the european union , we thought that at last , the foundation would regain the property that rightfully belonged to it , " he said .
" it turns out that the former owners are still being discriminated against , especially if the owner left the country before world war ii .
so we are still waiting for the green light to open again . "
little hope with little hope of getting decent compensation for their property , it looks like the younger generation of polish aristocrats , like the dashing marek czetwertynski , now in his mid-twenties , made the right decision to go into business to run a family company , rather than get locked into a losing battle with the polish state .
born in canada , he returned to poland at the age of 10 .
these days , he is philosophical about the role the aristocracy can play in a fast-changing polish society .
" personally i think that aristocracy can ’ t play a role exactly similar to the one it did before , " he said .
" poland is a different country now , with different influences and the aristocracy doesn ’ t have the financial power that it used to have .
it ’ s important that everybody should play a role in keeping up democracy in poland , which everybody fought for , not just aristocracy . "
meanwhile , marek czetwertynski ’ s father and other aristocrats describe as ridiculous the government ’ s latest offer to pay them between 15 and 30 percent of the 1946 value of the confiscated properties , the year the nationalization process was started by the communists .
they think that although they are now living in a very different poland , the state still has the responsibility to put right past wrongs . rafal kiepuszewski -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reconciliation instead of reparation as tension simmers between germany and poland over world war ii compensation claims , a german journalist is trying to bring reason to the impassioned debate by urging ethnic germans to relinquish their claims .

and it 's hit the stage in berlin . big news back in the golden era of the seventies rock scene , the ramones put a new spin on the old concept of anarchy as they crashed into the psyche of a generation looking for a new way to rebel .
their self-titled debut album , released in 1976 , was the first example of punk rock , making them the first of their kind , and the creators of a genre often more widely associated with the sex pistols . by way of testimony to their anarchic achievements , the band has become further immortalized the form of a musical . super sceptical it 's not exactly an obvious way of preserving a punk legacy , but after digesting his initial disgust at such a sacrilegious suggestion , jörg buttgeriet , the director of the german version of " gabba gabba hey " decided it might be right up his street . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director jörg buttgereit -lrb- l -rrb- , tommy ramone -lrb- r -rrb- buttgeriet , who is a bit of a cult figure in the world of trash horror movies , ultimately decided that his lack of experience in the musical genre was just the thing to make the project credible .
" i have no idea about musicals , but i 'm just going to do it .
and that 's punk rock , " he said . the show , which includes 18 of the band 's songs and is packaged in the form of an edgy love story , promises to be emotional , romantic , wild and rebellious - all in keeping with the casting and rehearsals procedure . lead actor , rolf zacher , was brought in the last minute to cover for martin semmelrogge , who is reported to have pulled out in order to serve a prison sentence . the ensemble also includes two musical novices who secured their roles after applying through a berlin city magazine .
rehearsals only started a couple of days before the opening night on tuesday . an ambient thing it 's actually not an attitude thing .
rather , it 's part of buttgeriet 's master plan on how to deliver the audience a natural and spontaneous atmosphere .
" i want to portray a mood of nonchalance , of matter-of-factness which they used to take onto stage with them when they were just being musicians , " he told the dpa news agency . being musicians in this case is the band " forgotten idols " who do justice to the wild , rebellious and even emotional moments in the original songs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the original ramones tommy ramone is the only surviving member of the original four-man line-up , and he 's working on the project as musical advisor .

their focus on added value puts pressure on companies .
but it also raises a company 's share value and profitability . the struggle over deutsche börse , the company that operates germany 's stock exchanges , has been settled for now : it wo n't take over the london stock exchange -lrb- lse -rrb- as originally planned - investors connected with hedge fund tci have made this clear . the reason for this is quite simple : takeovers usually cost the active party money and share value and dividends can drop as a result .
that 's something hedge funds ca n't afford .
it 's their mission to multiply the money they 've invested , as is the case with any kind of investor .
but tci and others are under extreme pressure as they buy and sell almost daily and make their money with falling and rising share values . german companies have become highly attractive for aggressive investors from the us and britain in recent years as the german financial sector began selling its shares . an eldorado for investors previously , the so-called " germany , inc . " had made the country 's firms unattractive for investors from abroad .
financial giants such as allianz , deutsche bank and others held shares in companies throughout the country .
it was a comfortable arrangement for decades as it gave these investors nice dividends and high reserves . in today 's globalized world , however , the germans have been forced to sell their shares to free up money .
foreigners are finding many lucrative investment opportunities as a result .
the share values of many companies are far below their real value as they 've been held by german banks for such a long time . they 're cheap when compared with others internationally , but that 's changing rapidly .
share holders may be happy about this , but it can cause tremendous upset within the companies .
deutsche börse is only the most recent example for this . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the funds ' interest is tremendous .
many german companies are or were seen as antiquated , because they relied on safe businesses for too long .
but since hedge funds have been admitted to the german market , they 're on a shopping tour , just like they have been in the us for years .
they want to see yields immediately and push for dividends to keep their own shareholders happy . a place for profiteers individual investors sometimes also play a role .
guy wyser-pratte is a classic example .
he shook up two german industrial conglomerates .
currently he holds 5 percent of iwka , a machine-building company based in karlsruhe that 's mainly known for its robots .
after wyser-pratte invested in the company in 2004 , its share value rose significantly .
he made it clear that he did n't agree with the company 's " sleepy " leadership . such statements make market analysts think that the sale of unprofitable parts of the company might be sold in the future .
whether this happens or not , wyser-pratte will be able to sell his shares at a higher price - even if nothing changes after all . that 's exactly what happened at rheinmetall .
the company 's share value was stagnating for years because of unprofitable divisions and a complex company structure .
in 2000 , wyser-pratte invested in the düsseldorf-based concern .
he made a lot of noise but did not succeed against the majority of share holders . in november 2001 , he sold his shares for 20 euros -lrb- $ 25.40 -rrb- .
he had bought them for 8.50 euros .
but wyser-pratte 's involvement led the company 's management to initiate a restructuring process analysts had called for .
the company sold off divisions , shrank by half and became highly profitable .
its share value now hovers around 40 euros - a positive thing for shareholders and employees alike . not all is well but there are also negative examples .
employees in particular often have to fear investors .
for decades , germany 's economy was governed by rules , regulations and agreements between unions and employers ' groups that are no longer viable in many cases .
as a result , companies with big names and good products were and are no longer competitive internationally and become easy targets for a new kind of investor - venture capital firms such as blackstone , kkr ; carlyle , argantis , lone star , capiton , apax , cinven , investcorp , 3i , permira , and bc partners to name just a few . take tenovis , formerly known as telenorma .
kkr took over the company in 2002 and half of the employees were let go within the first two years despite an agreement to forego 12.5 percent of their wages .
managers on the other hand received bonuses for their good work .
since then tenovis has been sold again , this time to us concern avaya - with profit . another option is to take a company to the stock exchange .
this happened in the case of wincor nixdorf , formerly siemens nixdorf .
while investment companies control such firms , they streamline them with profit maximization in mind .
when the company is then taken to the market , the investors make money again .
in the case of wincor nixdorf , about 350 million euros were made on the stock exchange .
the company only received 125 million euros . the list of german companies with similar experiences is long : mtu will soon be taken to the stock exchange , gerresheimer glas , dynamit nobel , rodenstock , celanese , minimax , atu autoteile unger , debitel , tank & rast , duales system deutschland -lrb- dsd -rrb- .
more will follow . investigating the börse case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chairman of the board of german stock exchange -lrb- deutsche börse ag -rrb- werner g. seifert as far as deutsche börse is concerned , officials for germany 's financial sector watchdog bafin announced thursday that it is investigating the role played by hedge funds in the removal of the company 's chief executive officer this week . bafin was looking to find out whether the funds had acted in concert to force ceo werner seifert to quit after already forcing him to abandon plans for the lse takeover . if that were the case , and if funds held a combined stake of more than 30 percent in deutsche börse , they would be obliged under german law to launch a public takeover offer for the remaining shares . bafin refused to provide a precise timetable for the investigation , but the spokeswoman said the probe could take " some weeks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.05.2005 polish nobles want property back großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as poland moves on , aristocrats want past reconciled former owners of large estates , polish aristocrats saw much of their property confiscated by the communists .
but now , a year after joining the eu , some of these nobles are pushing to get compensation . the communists hated them , these once powerful owners of landed estates that stretched far into what is now ukraine and the baltic states .
and when they took over after the end of world war ii , they confiscated their imposing palaces and art collections , reducing them to near-poverty and forcing many into exile . some returned in the early 1990s after the fall of communism .
since then , poland ’ s aristocratic families have been campaigning for compensation .
initially the polish government told them it couldn ’ t shoulder the burden of such claims , along with those advanced by millions of ordinary citizens who were deprived of their homes in the post-war border shifts .
but aware of poland ’ s economic progress and its european union membership , former owners recently doubled up their efforts , finally forcing the government to adopt a restitution bill . accused of spying bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shifting borders , displaced people and property albert swiatopelk czetwertynski is member of one of poland ’ s oldest aristocratic families , whose records , originating in ukraine , which was part of poland for several centuries , date back to 960 .
the czetwertynskis once owned vast stretches of land in the east in what is today ukraine and belarus .
albert czetwertynski was born in poland .
his father had made the mistake of deciding to return home after the war from the uk , where the family sought refuge from the nazis .
" my father unfortunately came back from england and in 1953 he was arrested by the communists and put into prison so they could take away his property , " he said .
" he was accused of spying for the americans .
the entire accusation and records from the court proceedings indicate that everything was manipulated , it was one big lie . "
the czetwertynskis managed to slip out of poland in 1960 and settle in canada .
but long before they returned to warsaw in the early 1990s , their confiscated palace in one of the polish capital ’ s posh districts had been torn down .
ironically , the prime lot was given by the communists to the us government to build an embassy .
this 1960s office block is an eyesore in a street otherwise lined with elegant villas , but since the us embassy had all the papers to prove they were the rightful owners , there was little that the family could do .
seeking compensation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans want their former lands in poland and czech back , too " when i came back from canada , i didn ’ t even think to get any type of compensation for any property that used to belong to my grandmother - poland was in a very difficult economic situation and i didn ’ t feel this was the right time to make a claim , " he said . " but things have progressed in many different ways .
there are many properties in warsaw that many former owners managed to get back , some of them through courts , some through selling their claim to someone who had better relations with the administration in warsaw .
then we decided that the law should be the same for everybody , so we should get compensation , or get our property back . "
the complexity of the restitution program is further complicated by the fact that some property is now in other countries .
after the war , the allies redrew the map of postwar poland , leaving huge chunks of the country in what is now lithuania , belarus and ukraine . mariusz umiastowski , another polish aristocrat whose family used to own two palaces in what is now the lithuanian capital of vilnius , runs a foundation that restores historical monuments in the east that once belonged to polish aristocrats .
he also tries to promote the image of polish aristocracy as " more than bloodsucking landowners . "
" when poland and lithuania joined the european union , we thought that at last , the foundation would regain the property that rightfully belonged to it , " he said .
" it turns out that the former owners are still being discriminated against , especially if the owner left the country before world war ii .
so we are still waiting for the green light to open again . "
little hope with little hope of getting decent compensation for their property , it looks like the younger generation of polish aristocrats , like the dashing marek czetwertynski , now in his mid-twenties , made the right decision to go into business to run a family company , rather than get locked into a losing battle with the polish state .
born in canada , he returned to poland at the age of 10 .
these days , he is philosophical about the role the aristocracy can play in a fast-changing polish society .
" personally i think that aristocracy can ’ t play a role exactly similar to the one it did before , " he said .
" poland is a different country now , with different influences and the aristocracy doesn ’ t have the financial power that it used to have .
it ’ s important that everybody should play a role in keeping up democracy in poland , which everybody fought for , not just aristocracy . "
meanwhile , marek czetwertynski ’ s father and other aristocrats describe as ridiculous the government ’ s latest offer to pay them between 15 and 30 percent of the 1946 value of the confiscated properties , the year the nationalization process was started by the communists .
they think that although they are now living in a very different poland , the state still has the responsibility to put right past wrongs . rafal kiepuszewski -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reconciliation instead of reparation as tension simmers between germany and poland over world war ii compensation claims , a german journalist is trying to bring reason to the impassioned debate by urging ethnic germans to relinquish their claims .

their self-titled debut album , released in 1976 , was the first example of punk rock , making them the first of their kind , and the creators of a genre often more widely associated with the sex pistols . by way of testimony to their anarchic achievements , the band has become further immortalized the form of a musical . super sceptical it 's not exactly an obvious way of preserving a punk legacy , but after digesting his initial disgust at such a sacrilegious suggestion , jörg buttgeriet , the director of the german version of " gabba gabba hey " decided it might be right up his street . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director jörg buttgereit -lrb- l -rrb- , tommy ramone -lrb- r -rrb- buttgeriet , who is a bit of a cult figure in the world of trash horror movies , ultimately decided that his lack of experience in the musical genre was just the thing to make the project credible .
" i have no idea about musicals , but i 'm just going to do it .
and that 's punk rock , " he said . the show , which includes 18 of the band 's songs and is packaged in the form of an edgy love story , promises to be emotional , romantic , wild and rebellious - all in keeping with the casting and rehearsals procedure . lead actor , rolf zacher , was brought in the last minute to cover for martin semmelrogge , who is reported to have pulled out in order to serve a prison sentence . the ensemble also includes two musical novices who secured their roles after applying through a berlin city magazine .
rehearsals only started a couple of days before the opening night on tuesday . an ambient thing it 's actually not an attitude thing .
rather , it 's part of buttgeriet 's master plan on how to deliver the audience a natural and spontaneous atmosphere .
" i want to portray a mood of nonchalance , of matter-of-factness which they used to take onto stage with them when they were just being musicians , " he told the dpa news agency . being musicians in this case is the band " forgotten idols " who do justice to the wild , rebellious and even emotional moments in the original songs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the original ramones tommy ramone is the only surviving member of the original four-man line-up , and he 's working on the project as musical advisor .
" modern musicals are neither hip nor creative .
we want to give them their energy back , " he said . and he is certain that his fellow band members would have had derived the same fun from the project as him .
" joey would love it , dee dee would think it amusing and johnny would say : " as long as it makes some money ! " the show , which premiered in australia last year , is playing twelve dates in berlin before heading off on tour around germany .

but now , a year after joining the eu , some of these nobles are pushing to get compensation . the communists hated them , these once powerful owners of landed estates that stretched far into what is now ukraine and the baltic states .
and when they took over after the end of world war ii , they confiscated their imposing palaces and art collections , reducing them to near-poverty and forcing many into exile . some returned in the early 1990s after the fall of communism .
since then , poland ’ s aristocratic families have been campaigning for compensation .
initially the polish government told them it couldn ’ t shoulder the burden of such claims , along with those advanced by millions of ordinary citizens who were deprived of their homes in the post-war border shifts .
but aware of poland ’ s economic progress and its european union membership , former owners recently doubled up their efforts , finally forcing the government to adopt a restitution bill . accused of spying bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shifting borders , displaced people and property albert swiatopelk czetwertynski is member of one of poland ’ s oldest aristocratic families , whose records , originating in ukraine , which was part of poland for several centuries , date back to 960 .
the czetwertynskis once owned vast stretches of land in the east in what is today ukraine and belarus .
albert czetwertynski was born in poland .
his father had made the mistake of deciding to return home after the war from the uk , where the family sought refuge from the nazis .
" my father unfortunately came back from england and in 1953 he was arrested by the communists and put into prison so they could take away his property , " he said .
" he was accused of spying for the americans .
the entire accusation and records from the court proceedings indicate that everything was manipulated , it was one big lie . "
the czetwertynskis managed to slip out of poland in 1960 and settle in canada .
but long before they returned to warsaw in the early 1990s , their confiscated palace in one of the polish capital ’ s posh districts had been torn down .
ironically , the prime lot was given by the communists to the us government to build an embassy .
this 1960s office block is an eyesore in a street otherwise lined with elegant villas , but since the us embassy had all the papers to prove they were the rightful owners , there was little that the family could do .
seeking compensation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans want their former lands in poland and czech back , too " when i came back from canada , i didn ’ t even think to get any type of compensation for any property that used to belong to my grandmother - poland was in a very difficult economic situation and i didn ’ t feel this was the right time to make a claim , " he said . " but things have progressed in many different ways .
there are many properties in warsaw that many former owners managed to get back , some of them through courts , some through selling their claim to someone who had better relations with the administration in warsaw .
then we decided that the law should be the same for everybody , so we should get compensation , or get our property back . "
the complexity of the restitution program is further complicated by the fact that some property is now in other countries .
after the war , the allies redrew the map of postwar poland , leaving huge chunks of the country in what is now lithuania , belarus and ukraine . mariusz umiastowski , another polish aristocrat whose family used to own two palaces in what is now the lithuanian capital of vilnius , runs a foundation that restores historical monuments in the east that once belonged to polish aristocrats .
he also tries to promote the image of polish aristocracy as " more than bloodsucking landowners . "
" when poland and lithuania joined the european union , we thought that at last , the foundation would regain the property that rightfully belonged to it , " he said .
" it turns out that the former owners are still being discriminated against , especially if the owner left the country before world war ii .
so we are still waiting for the green light to open again . "
little hope with little hope of getting decent compensation for their property , it looks like the younger generation of polish aristocrats , like the dashing marek czetwertynski , now in his mid-twenties , made the right decision to go into business to run a family company , rather than get locked into a losing battle with the polish state .
born in canada , he returned to poland at the age of 10 .
these days , he is philosophical about the role the aristocracy can play in a fast-changing polish society .
" personally i think that aristocracy can ’ t play a role exactly similar to the one it did before , " he said .
" poland is a different country now , with different influences and the aristocracy doesn ’ t have the financial power that it used to have .
it ’ s important that everybody should play a role in keeping up democracy in poland , which everybody fought for , not just aristocracy . "
meanwhile , marek czetwertynski ’ s father and other aristocrats describe as ridiculous the government ’ s latest offer to pay them between 15 and 30 percent of the 1946 value of the confiscated properties , the year the nationalization process was started by the communists .
they think that although they are now living in a very different poland , the state still has the responsibility to put right past wrongs . rafal kiepuszewski -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reconciliation instead of reparation as tension simmers between germany and poland over world war ii compensation claims , a german journalist is trying to bring reason to the impassioned debate by urging ethnic germans to relinquish their claims .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.05.2005 polish nobles want property back großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as poland moves on , aristocrats want past reconciled former owners of large estates , polish aristocrats saw much of their property confiscated by the communists .
but now , a year after joining the eu , some of these nobles are pushing to get compensation . the communists hated them , these once powerful owners of landed estates that stretched far into what is now ukraine and the baltic states .
and when they took over after the end of world war ii , they confiscated their imposing palaces and art collections , reducing them to near-poverty and forcing many into exile . some returned in the early 1990s after the fall of communism .
since then , poland ’ s aristocratic families have been campaigning for compensation .
initially the polish government told them it couldn ’ t shoulder the burden of such claims , along with those advanced by millions of ordinary citizens who were deprived of their homes in the post-war border shifts .
but aware of poland ’ s economic progress and its european union membership , former owners recently doubled up their efforts , finally forcing the government to adopt a restitution bill . accused of spying bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shifting borders , displaced people and property albert swiatopelk czetwertynski is member of one of poland ’ s oldest aristocratic families , whose records , originating in ukraine , which was part of poland for several centuries , date back to 960 .
the czetwertynskis once owned vast stretches of land in the east in what is today ukraine and belarus .
albert czetwertynski was born in poland .
his father had made the mistake of deciding to return home after the war from the uk , where the family sought refuge from the nazis .
" my father unfortunately came back from england and in 1953 he was arrested by the communists and put into prison so they could take away his property , " he said .
" he was accused of spying for the americans .
the entire accusation and records from the court proceedings indicate that everything was manipulated , it was one big lie . "
the czetwertynskis managed to slip out of poland in 1960 and settle in canada .
but long before they returned to warsaw in the early 1990s , their confiscated palace in one of the polish capital ’ s posh districts had been torn down .
ironically , the prime lot was given by the communists to the us government to build an embassy .
this 1960s office block is an eyesore in a street otherwise lined with elegant villas , but since the us embassy had all the papers to prove they were the rightful owners , there was little that the family could do .
seeking compensation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans want their former lands in poland and czech back , too " when i came back from canada , i didn ’ t even think to get any type of compensation for any property that used to belong to my grandmother - poland was in a very difficult economic situation and i didn ’ t feel this was the right time to make a claim , " he said . " but things have progressed in many different ways .
there are many properties in warsaw that many former owners managed to get back , some of them through courts , some through selling their claim to someone who had better relations with the administration in warsaw .
then we decided that the law should be the same for everybody , so we should get compensation , or get our property back . "
the complexity of the restitution program is further complicated by the fact that some property is now in other countries .
after the war , the allies redrew the map of postwar poland , leaving huge chunks of the country in what is now lithuania , belarus and ukraine . mariusz umiastowski , another polish aristocrat whose family used to own two palaces in what is now the lithuanian capital of vilnius , runs a foundation that restores historical monuments in the east that once belonged to polish aristocrats .
he also tries to promote the image of polish aristocracy as " more than bloodsucking landowners . "
" when poland and lithuania joined the european union , we thought that at last , the foundation would regain the property that rightfully belonged to it , " he said .
" it turns out that the former owners are still being discriminated against , especially if the owner left the country before world war ii .
so we are still waiting for the green light to open again . "
little hope with little hope of getting decent compensation for their property , it looks like the younger generation of polish aristocrats , like the dashing marek czetwertynski , now in his mid-twenties , made the right decision to go into business to run a family company , rather than get locked into a losing battle with the polish state .

that 's something hedge funds ca n't afford .
it 's their mission to multiply the money they 've invested , as is the case with any kind of investor .
but tci and others are under extreme pressure as they buy and sell almost daily and make their money with falling and rising share values . german companies have become highly attractive for aggressive investors from the us and britain in recent years as the german financial sector began selling its shares . an eldorado for investors previously , the so-called " germany , inc . " had made the country 's firms unattractive for investors from abroad .
financial giants such as allianz , deutsche bank and others held shares in companies throughout the country .
it was a comfortable arrangement for decades as it gave these investors nice dividends and high reserves . in today 's globalized world , however , the germans have been forced to sell their shares to free up money .
foreigners are finding many lucrative investment opportunities as a result .
the share values of many companies are far below their real value as they 've been held by german banks for such a long time . they 're cheap when compared with others internationally , but that 's changing rapidly .
share holders may be happy about this , but it can cause tremendous upset within the companies .
deutsche börse is only the most recent example for this . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the funds ' interest is tremendous .
many german companies are or were seen as antiquated , because they relied on safe businesses for too long .
but since hedge funds have been admitted to the german market , they 're on a shopping tour , just like they have been in the us for years .
they want to see yields immediately and push for dividends to keep their own shareholders happy . a place for profiteers individual investors sometimes also play a role .
guy wyser-pratte is a classic example .
he shook up two german industrial conglomerates .
currently he holds 5 percent of iwka , a machine-building company based in karlsruhe that 's mainly known for its robots .
after wyser-pratte invested in the company in 2004 , its share value rose significantly .
he made it clear that he did n't agree with the company 's " sleepy " leadership . such statements make market analysts think that the sale of unprofitable parts of the company might be sold in the future .
whether this happens or not , wyser-pratte will be able to sell his shares at a higher price - even if nothing changes after all . that 's exactly what happened at rheinmetall .
the company 's share value was stagnating for years because of unprofitable divisions and a complex company structure .
in 2000 , wyser-pratte invested in the düsseldorf-based concern .
he made a lot of noise but did not succeed against the majority of share holders . in november 2001 , he sold his shares for 20 euros -lrb- $ 25.40 -rrb- .
he had bought them for 8.50 euros .
but wyser-pratte 's involvement led the company 's management to initiate a restructuring process analysts had called for .
the company sold off divisions , shrank by half and became highly profitable .
its share value now hovers around 40 euros - a positive thing for shareholders and employees alike . not all is well but there are also negative examples .
employees in particular often have to fear investors .
for decades , germany 's economy was governed by rules , regulations and agreements between unions and employers ' groups that are no longer viable in many cases .
as a result , companies with big names and good products were and are no longer competitive internationally and become easy targets for a new kind of investor - venture capital firms such as blackstone , kkr ; carlyle , argantis , lone star , capiton , apax , cinven , investcorp , 3i , permira , and bc partners to name just a few . take tenovis , formerly known as telenorma .

share holders may be happy about this , but it can cause tremendous upset within the companies .
deutsche börse is only the most recent example for this . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the funds ' interest is tremendous .
many german companies are or were seen as antiquated , because they relied on safe businesses for too long .
but since hedge funds have been admitted to the german market , they 're on a shopping tour , just like they have been in the us for years .
they want to see yields immediately and push for dividends to keep their own shareholders happy . a place for profiteers individual investors sometimes also play a role .
guy wyser-pratte is a classic example .
he shook up two german industrial conglomerates .
currently he holds 5 percent of iwka , a machine-building company based in karlsruhe that 's mainly known for its robots .
after wyser-pratte invested in the company in 2004 , its share value rose significantly .
he made it clear that he did n't agree with the company 's " sleepy " leadership . such statements make market analysts think that the sale of unprofitable parts of the company might be sold in the future .
whether this happens or not , wyser-pratte will be able to sell his shares at a higher price - even if nothing changes after all . that 's exactly what happened at rheinmetall .
the company 's share value was stagnating for years because of unprofitable divisions and a complex company structure .
in 2000 , wyser-pratte invested in the düsseldorf-based concern .
he made a lot of noise but did not succeed against the majority of share holders . in november 2001 , he sold his shares for 20 euros -lrb- $ 25.40 -rrb- .
he had bought them for 8.50 euros .
but wyser-pratte 's involvement led the company 's management to initiate a restructuring process analysts had called for .
the company sold off divisions , shrank by half and became highly profitable .
its share value now hovers around 40 euros - a positive thing for shareholders and employees alike . not all is well but there are also negative examples .
employees in particular often have to fear investors .
for decades , germany 's economy was governed by rules , regulations and agreements between unions and employers ' groups that are no longer viable in many cases .
as a result , companies with big names and good products were and are no longer competitive internationally and become easy targets for a new kind of investor - venture capital firms such as blackstone , kkr ; carlyle , argantis , lone star , capiton , apax , cinven , investcorp , 3i , permira , and bc partners to name just a few . take tenovis , formerly known as telenorma .
kkr took over the company in 2002 and half of the employees were let go within the first two years despite an agreement to forego 12.5 percent of their wages .
managers on the other hand received bonuses for their good work .
since then tenovis has been sold again , this time to us concern avaya - with profit . another option is to take a company to the stock exchange .
this happened in the case of wincor nixdorf , formerly siemens nixdorf .
while investment companies control such firms , they streamline them with profit maximization in mind .
when the company is then taken to the market , the investors make money again .
in the case of wincor nixdorf , about 350 million euros were made on the stock exchange .
the company only received 125 million euros . the list of german companies with similar experiences is long : mtu will soon be taken to the stock exchange , gerresheimer glas , dynamit nobel , rodenstock , celanese , minimax , atu autoteile unger , debitel , tank & rast , duales system deutschland -lrb- dsd -rrb- .

dubbed by its creators as " grease on acid " , a new musical entitled " gabba gabba hey ! " tells the rock and rock story of us punk initiators , the ramones .
and it 's hit the stage in berlin . big news back in the golden era of the seventies rock scene , the ramones put a new spin on the old concept of anarchy as they crashed into the psyche of a generation looking for a new way to rebel .
their self-titled debut album , released in 1976 , was the first example of punk rock , making them the first of their kind , and the creators of a genre often more widely associated with the sex pistols . by way of testimony to their anarchic achievements , the band has become further immortalized the form of a musical . super sceptical it 's not exactly an obvious way of preserving a punk legacy , but after digesting his initial disgust at such a sacrilegious suggestion , jörg buttgeriet , the director of the german version of " gabba gabba hey " decided it might be right up his street . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director jörg buttgereit -lrb- l -rrb- , tommy ramone -lrb- r -rrb- buttgeriet , who is a bit of a cult figure in the world of trash horror movies , ultimately decided that his lack of experience in the musical genre was just the thing to make the project credible .
" i have no idea about musicals , but i 'm just going to do it .
and that 's punk rock , " he said . the show , which includes 18 of the band 's songs and is packaged in the form of an edgy love story , promises to be emotional , romantic , wild and rebellious - all in keeping with the casting and rehearsals procedure . lead actor , rolf zacher , was brought in the last minute to cover for martin semmelrogge , who is reported to have pulled out in order to serve a prison sentence . the ensemble also includes two musical novices who secured their roles after applying through a berlin city magazine .
rehearsals only started a couple of days before the opening night on tuesday . an ambient thing it 's actually not an attitude thing .
rather , it 's part of buttgeriet 's master plan on how to deliver the audience a natural and spontaneous atmosphere .
" i want to portray a mood of nonchalance , of matter-of-factness which they used to take onto stage with them when they were just being musicians , " he told the dpa news agency . being musicians in this case is the band " forgotten idols " who do justice to the wild , rebellious and even emotional moments in the original songs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the original ramones tommy ramone is the only surviving member of the original four-man line-up , and he 's working on the project as musical advisor .
" modern musicals are neither hip nor creative .
we want to give them their energy back , " he said . and he is certain that his fellow band members would have had derived the same fun from the project as him .
" joey would love it , dee dee would think it amusing and johnny would say : " as long as it makes some money ! " the show , which premiered in australia last year , is playing twelve dates in berlin before heading off on tour around germany .

and it 's hit the stage in berlin . big news back in the golden era of the seventies rock scene , the ramones put a new spin on the old concept of anarchy as they crashed into the psyche of a generation looking for a new way to rebel .
their self-titled debut album , released in 1976 , was the first example of punk rock , making them the first of their kind , and the creators of a genre often more widely associated with the sex pistols . by way of testimony to their anarchic achievements , the band has become further immortalized the form of a musical . super sceptical it 's not exactly an obvious way of preserving a punk legacy , but after digesting his initial disgust at such a sacrilegious suggestion , jörg buttgeriet , the director of the german version of " gabba gabba hey " decided it might be right up his street . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director jörg buttgereit -lrb- l -rrb- , tommy ramone -lrb- r -rrb- buttgeriet , who is a bit of a cult figure in the world of trash horror movies , ultimately decided that his lack of experience in the musical genre was just the thing to make the project credible .
" i have no idea about musicals , but i 'm just going to do it .
and that 's punk rock , " he said . the show , which includes 18 of the band 's songs and is packaged in the form of an edgy love story , promises to be emotional , romantic , wild and rebellious - all in keeping with the casting and rehearsals procedure . lead actor , rolf zacher , was brought in the last minute to cover for martin semmelrogge , who is reported to have pulled out in order to serve a prison sentence . the ensemble also includes two musical novices who secured their roles after applying through a berlin city magazine .
rehearsals only started a couple of days before the opening night on tuesday . an ambient thing it 's actually not an attitude thing .
rather , it 's part of buttgeriet 's master plan on how to deliver the audience a natural and spontaneous atmosphere .
" i want to portray a mood of nonchalance , of matter-of-factness which they used to take onto stage with them when they were just being musicians , " he told the dpa news agency . being musicians in this case is the band " forgotten idols " who do justice to the wild , rebellious and even emotional moments in the original songs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the original ramones tommy ramone is the only surviving member of the original four-man line-up , and he 's working on the project as musical advisor .

" we can not continue the negotiations with the europeans without having resumed some of our activities , " rohani told state television , adding iran 's decision to resume conversion of uranium - a precursor to enrichment - was " still valid . " " we are in favor of negotiations .
we can negotiate for months , but we can not negotiate under the present conditions , " rohani argued , repeating the demand to resume activities that were suspended in november 2004 as part of a deal with britain , france and germany . iran announced earlier that it was postponing a restart of work at isfahan , a move that would have violated the accord , following appeals from the so-called eu-3 and their offer of four-way talks . the three european nations also warned iran that it could wind up on the desk of the un security council . " we are in favor of the principle of negotiating , " rohani said , adding that " the fact that the resumption of our activities will be delayed by several days is not a problem . " " last chance for europe " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea logo speaking in vienna , french foreign minister michel barnier confirmed that he , german foreign minister joschka fischer and british foreign secretary jack straw would meet iranian authorities in the coming days . iranian media reports said the meeting would take place in either geneva or brussels .
" the coming days will be the last chance for the europeans , " iranian foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefin told reporters .
" with or without an agreement , we will restart our activities . " " the security council does not worry iran , " asefi said , but acknowledged that iran had also received appeals from south africa , malaysia and un secretary general kofi annan - who telephoned iran late saturday - to hold more talks . the eu has offered iran a package of incentives in return for " objective guarantees " it will not develop weapons - hoping to strike a deal similar to that which the united states and britain reached with libya . defiant message bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranians are angered by european demands that it shelve its uranium enrichment program but iran has expressed frustration with the pace of the negotiations , which remain deadlocked given iran 's refusal to abandon fuel cycle work . the stand-off worsened after the eu-3 last month rejected an iranian proposal to begin a phased resumption of enrichment .
iran complained the talks were being deliberately dragged out to keep the freeze in place . iran 's hardline parliament also took a defiant stand sunday , passing a bill that obliges the government to " guarantee " the islamic republic 's production of its own nuclear fuel . the bill , entitled " acquiring nuclear technology for peaceful purposes " was the latest move by right-wingers seeking to send a defiant message in the face of mounting international demands that iran abandon its nuclear fuel programme altogether . deputies had already begun voting on the bill in october 2004 , and it has been seen largely as a symbolic gesture .
after the vote , deputies in the majlis broke out into chants of " death to america . " one hardline mp , hasan kamran , said the bill " will send a message to world oppressors the us and its european footsoldiers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 15.05.2005 for sale : germany , inc . großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investors have begun waking up germany 's sleeping beauties financial investors have recently shown their might by shaking up deutsche börse .
their focus on added value puts pressure on companies .
but it also raises a company 's share value and profitability . the struggle over deutsche börse , the company that operates germany 's stock exchanges , has been settled for now : it wo n't take over the london stock exchange -lrb- lse -rrb- as originally planned - investors connected with hedge fund tci have made this clear . the reason for this is quite simple : takeovers usually cost the active party money and share value and dividends can drop as a result .
that 's something hedge funds ca n't afford .
it 's their mission to multiply the money they 've invested , as is the case with any kind of investor .
but tci and others are under extreme pressure as they buy and sell almost daily and make their money with falling and rising share values . german companies have become highly attractive for aggressive investors from the us and britain in recent years as the german financial sector began selling its shares . an eldorado for investors previously , the so-called " germany , inc . " had made the country 's firms unattractive for investors from abroad .
financial giants such as allianz , deutsche bank and others held shares in companies throughout the country .
it was a comfortable arrangement for decades as it gave these investors nice dividends and high reserves . in today 's globalized world , however , the germans have been forced to sell their shares to free up money .
foreigners are finding many lucrative investment opportunities as a result .
the share values of many companies are far below their real value as they 've been held by german banks for such a long time . they 're cheap when compared with others internationally , but that 's changing rapidly .
share holders may be happy about this , but it can cause tremendous upset within the companies .
deutsche börse is only the most recent example for this . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the funds ' interest is tremendous .
many german companies are or were seen as antiquated , because they relied on safe businesses for too long .
but since hedge funds have been admitted to the german market , they 're on a shopping tour , just like they have been in the us for years .
they want to see yields immediately and push for dividends to keep their own shareholders happy . a place for profiteers individual investors sometimes also play a role .
guy wyser-pratte is a classic example .
he shook up two german industrial conglomerates .
currently he holds 5 percent of iwka , a machine-building company based in karlsruhe that 's mainly known for its robots .
after wyser-pratte invested in the company in 2004 , its share value rose significantly .
he made it clear that he did n't agree with the company 's " sleepy " leadership . such statements make market analysts think that the sale of unprofitable parts of the company might be sold in the future .
whether this happens or not , wyser-pratte will be able to sell his shares at a higher price - even if nothing changes after all . that 's exactly what happened at rheinmetall .
the company 's share value was stagnating for years because of unprofitable divisions and a complex company structure .
in 2000 , wyser-pratte invested in the düsseldorf-based concern .
he made a lot of noise but did not succeed against the majority of share holders . in november 2001 , he sold his shares for 20 euros -lrb- $ 25.40 -rrb- .
he had bought them for 8.50 euros .
but wyser-pratte 's involvement led the company 's management to initiate a restructuring process analysts had called for .
the company sold off divisions , shrank by half and became highly profitable .
its share value now hovers around 40 euros - a positive thing for shareholders and employees alike . not all is well but there are also negative examples .
employees in particular often have to fear investors .
for decades , germany 's economy was governed by rules , regulations and agreements between unions and employers ' groups that are no longer viable in many cases .
as a result , companies with big names and good products were and are no longer competitive internationally and become easy targets for a new kind of investor - venture capital firms such as blackstone , kkr ; carlyle , argantis , lone star , capiton , apax , cinven , investcorp , 3i , permira , and bc partners to name just a few . take tenovis , formerly known as telenorma .
kkr took over the company in 2002 and half of the employees were let go within the first two years despite an agreement to forego 12.5 percent of their wages .
managers on the other hand received bonuses for their good work .
since then tenovis has been sold again , this time to us concern avaya - with profit . another option is to take a company to the stock exchange .
this happened in the case of wincor nixdorf , formerly siemens nixdorf .
while investment companies control such firms , they streamline them with profit maximization in mind .
when the company is then taken to the market , the investors make money again .
in the case of wincor nixdorf , about 350 million euros were made on the stock exchange .
the company only received 125 million euros . the list of german companies with similar experiences is long : mtu will soon be taken to the stock exchange , gerresheimer glas , dynamit nobel , rodenstock , celanese , minimax , atu autoteile unger , debitel , tank & rast , duales system deutschland -lrb- dsd -rrb- .
more will follow . investigating the börse case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chairman of the board of german stock exchange -lrb- deutsche börse ag -rrb- werner g. seifert as far as deutsche börse is concerned , officials for germany 's financial sector watchdog bafin announced thursday that it is investigating the role played by hedge funds in the removal of the company 's chief executive officer this week . bafin was looking to find out whether the funds had acted in concert to force ceo werner seifert to quit after already forcing him to abandon plans for the lse takeover . if that were the case , and if funds held a combined stake of more than 30 percent in deutsche börse , they would be obliged under german law to launch a public takeover offer for the remaining shares . bafin refused to provide a precise timetable for the investigation , but the spokeswoman said the probe could take " some weeks .

" we can not continue the negotiations with the europeans without having resumed some of our activities , " rohani told state television , adding iran 's decision to resume conversion of uranium - a precursor to enrichment - was " still valid . " " we are in favor of negotiations .
we can negotiate for months , but we can not negotiate under the present conditions , " rohani argued , repeating the demand to resume activities that were suspended in november 2004 as part of a deal with britain , france and germany . iran announced earlier that it was postponing a restart of work at isfahan , a move that would have violated the accord , following appeals from the so-called eu-3 and their offer of four-way talks . the three european nations also warned iran that it could wind up on the desk of the un security council . " we are in favor of the principle of negotiating , " rohani said , adding that " the fact that the resumption of our activities will be delayed by several days is not a problem . " " last chance for europe " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea logo speaking in vienna , french foreign minister michel barnier confirmed that he , german foreign minister joschka fischer and british foreign secretary jack straw would meet iranian authorities in the coming days . iranian media reports said the meeting would take place in either geneva or brussels .
" the coming days will be the last chance for the europeans , " iranian foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefin told reporters .
" with or without an agreement , we will restart our activities . " " the security council does not worry iran , " asefi said , but acknowledged that iran had also received appeals from south africa , malaysia and un secretary general kofi annan - who telephoned iran late saturday - to hold more talks . the eu has offered iran a package of incentives in return for " objective guarantees " it will not develop weapons - hoping to strike a deal similar to that which the united states and britain reached with libya . defiant message bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranians are angered by european demands that it shelve its uranium enrichment program but iran has expressed frustration with the pace of the negotiations , which remain deadlocked given iran 's refusal to abandon fuel cycle work . the stand-off worsened after the eu-3 last month rejected an iranian proposal to begin a phased resumption of enrichment .
iran complained the talks were being deliberately dragged out to keep the freeze in place . iran 's hardline parliament also took a defiant stand sunday , passing a bill that obliges the government to " guarantee " the islamic republic 's production of its own nuclear fuel . the bill , entitled " acquiring nuclear technology for peaceful purposes " was the latest move by right-wingers seeking to send a defiant message in the face of mounting international demands that iran abandon its nuclear fuel programme altogether . deputies had already begun voting on the bill in october 2004 , and it has been seen largely as a symbolic gesture .
after the vote , deputies in the majlis broke out into chants of " death to america . " one hardline mp , hasan kamran , said the bill " will send a message to world oppressors the us and its european footsoldiers .

since then , poland ’ s aristocratic families have been campaigning for compensation .
initially the polish government told them it couldn ’ t shoulder the burden of such claims , along with those advanced by millions of ordinary citizens who were deprived of their homes in the post-war border shifts .

the czetwertynskis once owned vast stretches of land in the east in what is today ukraine and belarus .
albert czetwertynski was born in poland .
his father had made the mistake of deciding to return home after the war from the uk , where the family sought refuge from the nazis .
" my father unfortunately came back from england and in 1953 he was arrested by the communists and put into prison so they could take away his property , " he said .
" he was accused of spying for the americans .
the entire accusation and records from the court proceedings indicate that everything was manipulated , it was one big lie . "

ironically , the prime lot was given by the communists to the us government to build an embassy .

their focus on added value puts pressure on companies .
but it also raises a company 's share value and profitability . the struggle over deutsche börse , the company that operates germany 's stock exchanges , has been settled for now : it wo n't take over the london stock exchange -lrb- lse -rrb- as originally planned - investors connected with hedge fund tci have made this clear . the reason for this is quite simple : takeovers usually cost the active party money and share value and dividends can drop as a result .
that 's something hedge funds ca n't afford .
it 's their mission to multiply the money they 've invested , as is the case with any kind of investor .
but tci and others are under extreme pressure as they buy and sell almost daily and make their money with falling and rising share values . german companies have become highly attractive for aggressive investors from the us and britain in recent years as the german financial sector began selling its shares . an eldorado for investors previously , the so-called " germany , inc . " had made the country 's firms unattractive for investors from abroad .
financial giants such as allianz , deutsche bank and others held shares in companies throughout the country .
it was a comfortable arrangement for decades as it gave these investors nice dividends and high reserves . in today 's globalized world , however , the germans have been forced to sell their shares to free up money .
foreigners are finding many lucrative investment opportunities as a result .
the share values of many companies are far below their real value as they 've been held by german banks for such a long time . they 're cheap when compared with others internationally , but that 's changing rapidly .
share holders may be happy about this , but it can cause tremendous upset within the companies .
deutsche börse is only the most recent example for this . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the funds ' interest is tremendous .
many german companies are or were seen as antiquated , because they relied on safe businesses for too long .
but since hedge funds have been admitted to the german market , they 're on a shopping tour , just like they have been in the us for years .
they want to see yields immediately and push for dividends to keep their own shareholders happy . a place for profiteers individual investors sometimes also play a role .
guy wyser-pratte is a classic example .
he shook up two german industrial conglomerates .
currently he holds 5 percent of iwka , a machine-building company based in karlsruhe that 's mainly known for its robots .
after wyser-pratte invested in the company in 2004 , its share value rose significantly .
he made it clear that he did n't agree with the company 's " sleepy " leadership . such statements make market analysts think that the sale of unprofitable parts of the company might be sold in the future .
whether this happens or not , wyser-pratte will be able to sell his shares at a higher price - even if nothing changes after all . that 's exactly what happened at rheinmetall .
the company 's share value was stagnating for years because of unprofitable divisions and a complex company structure .
in 2000 , wyser-pratte invested in the düsseldorf-based concern .
he made a lot of noise but did not succeed against the majority of share holders . in november 2001 , he sold his shares for 20 euros -lrb- $ 25.40 -rrb- .
he had bought them for 8.50 euros .
but wyser-pratte 's involvement led the company 's management to initiate a restructuring process analysts had called for .
the company sold off divisions , shrank by half and became highly profitable .
its share value now hovers around 40 euros - a positive thing for shareholders and employees alike . not all is well but there are also negative examples .
employees in particular often have to fear investors .
for decades , germany 's economy was governed by rules , regulations and agreements between unions and employers ' groups that are no longer viable in many cases .
as a result , companies with big names and good products were and are no longer competitive internationally and become easy targets for a new kind of investor - venture capital firms such as blackstone , kkr ; carlyle , argantis , lone star , capiton , apax , cinven , investcorp , 3i , permira , and bc partners to name just a few . take tenovis , formerly known as telenorma .
kkr took over the company in 2002 and half of the employees were let go within the first two years despite an agreement to forego 12.5 percent of their wages .
managers on the other hand received bonuses for their good work .
since then tenovis has been sold again , this time to us concern avaya - with profit . another option is to take a company to the stock exchange .
this happened in the case of wincor nixdorf , formerly siemens nixdorf .
while investment companies control such firms , they streamline them with profit maximization in mind .
when the company is then taken to the market , the investors make money again .
in the case of wincor nixdorf , about 350 million euros were made on the stock exchange .
the company only received 125 million euros . the list of german companies with similar experiences is long : mtu will soon be taken to the stock exchange , gerresheimer glas , dynamit nobel , rodenstock , celanese , minimax , atu autoteile unger , debitel , tank & rast , duales system deutschland -lrb- dsd -rrb- .

" we can not continue the negotiations with the europeans without having resumed some of our activities , " rohani told state television , adding iran 's decision to resume conversion of uranium - a precursor to enrichment - was " still valid .

we can negotiate for months , but we can not negotiate under the present conditions , " rohani argued , repeating the demand to resume activities that were suspended in november 2004 as part of a deal with britain , france and germany . iran announced earlier that it was postponing a restart of work at isfahan , a move that would have violated the accord , following appeals from the so-called eu-3 and their offer of four-way talks . the three european nations also warned iran that it could wind up on the desk of the un security council .

iran complained the talks were being deliberately dragged out to keep the freeze in place . iran 's hardline parliament also took a defiant stand sunday , passing a bill that obliges the government to " guarantee " the islamic republic 's production of its own nuclear fuel . the bill , entitled " acquiring nuclear technology for peaceful purposes " was the latest move by right-wingers seeking to send a defiant message in the face of mounting international demands that iran abandon its nuclear fuel programme altogether . deputies had already begun voting on the bill in october 2004 , and it has been seen largely as a symbolic gesture .

but now , a year after joining the eu , some of these nobles are pushing to get compensation . the communists hated them , these once powerful owners of landed estates that stretched far into what is now ukraine and the baltic states .
and when they took over after the end of world war ii , they confiscated their imposing palaces and art collections , reducing them to near-poverty and forcing many into exile . some returned in the early 1990s after the fall of communism .
since then , poland ’ s aristocratic families have been campaigning for compensation .
initially the polish government told them it couldn ’ t shoulder the burden of such claims , along with those advanced by millions of ordinary citizens who were deprived of their homes in the post-war border shifts .
but aware of poland ’ s economic progress and its european union membership , former owners recently doubled up their efforts , finally forcing the government to adopt a restitution bill . accused of spying bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shifting borders , displaced people and property albert swiatopelk czetwertynski is member of one of poland ’ s oldest aristocratic families , whose records , originating in ukraine , which was part of poland for several centuries , date back to 960 .
the czetwertynskis once owned vast stretches of land in the east in what is today ukraine and belarus .
albert czetwertynski was born in poland .
his father had made the mistake of deciding to return home after the war from the uk , where the family sought refuge from the nazis .
" my father unfortunately came back from england and in 1953 he was arrested by the communists and put into prison so they could take away his property , " he said .
" he was accused of spying for the americans .
the entire accusation and records from the court proceedings indicate that everything was manipulated , it was one big lie . "
the czetwertynskis managed to slip out of poland in 1960 and settle in canada .
but long before they returned to warsaw in the early 1990s , their confiscated palace in one of the polish capital ’ s posh districts had been torn down .
ironically , the prime lot was given by the communists to the us government to build an embassy .
this 1960s office block is an eyesore in a street otherwise lined with elegant villas , but since the us embassy had all the papers to prove they were the rightful owners , there was little that the family could do .
seeking compensation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans want their former lands in poland and czech back , too " when i came back from canada , i didn ’ t even think to get any type of compensation for any property that used to belong to my grandmother - poland was in a very difficult economic situation and i didn ’ t feel this was the right time to make a claim , " he said . " but things have progressed in many different ways .
there are many properties in warsaw that many former owners managed to get back , some of them through courts , some through selling their claim to someone who had better relations with the administration in warsaw .
then we decided that the law should be the same for everybody , so we should get compensation , or get our property back . "
the complexity of the restitution program is further complicated by the fact that some property is now in other countries .
after the war , the allies redrew the map of postwar poland , leaving huge chunks of the country in what is now lithuania , belarus and ukraine . mariusz umiastowski , another polish aristocrat whose family used to own two palaces in what is now the lithuanian capital of vilnius , runs a foundation that restores historical monuments in the east that once belonged to polish aristocrats .
he also tries to promote the image of polish aristocracy as " more than bloodsucking landowners . "
" when poland and lithuania joined the european union , we thought that at last , the foundation would regain the property that rightfully belonged to it , " he said .
" it turns out that the former owners are still being discriminated against , especially if the owner left the country before world war ii .
so we are still waiting for the green light to open again . "
little hope with little hope of getting decent compensation for their property , it looks like the younger generation of polish aristocrats , like the dashing marek czetwertynski , now in his mid-twenties , made the right decision to go into business to run a family company , rather than get locked into a losing battle with the polish state .
born in canada , he returned to poland at the age of 10 .
these days , he is philosophical about the role the aristocracy can play in a fast-changing polish society .
" personally i think that aristocracy can ’ t play a role exactly similar to the one it did before , " he said .
" poland is a different country now , with different influences and the aristocracy doesn ’ t have the financial power that it used to have .
it ’ s important that everybody should play a role in keeping up democracy in poland , which everybody fought for , not just aristocracy . "
meanwhile , marek czetwertynski ’ s father and other aristocrats describe as ridiculous the government ’ s latest offer to pay them between 15 and 30 percent of the 1946 value of the confiscated properties , the year the nationalization process was started by the communists .
they think that although they are now living in a very different poland , the state still has the responsibility to put right past wrongs . rafal kiepuszewski -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reconciliation instead of reparation as tension simmers between germany and poland over world war ii compensation claims , a german journalist is trying to bring reason to the impassioned debate by urging ethnic germans to relinquish their claims .

initially the polish government told them it couldn ’ t shoulder the burden of such claims , along with those advanced by millions of ordinary citizens who were deprived of their homes in the post-war border shifts .

albert czetwertynski was born in poland .
his father had made the mistake of deciding to return home after the war from the uk , where the family sought refuge from the nazis .
" my father unfortunately came back from england and in 1953 he was arrested by the communists and put into prison so they could take away his property , " he said .
" he was accused of spying for the americans .
the entire accusation and records from the court proceedings indicate that everything was manipulated , it was one big lie . "
the czetwertynskis managed to slip out of poland in 1960 and settle in canada .
but long before they returned to warsaw in the early 1990s , their confiscated palace in one of the polish capital ’ s posh districts had been torn down .
ironically , the prime lot was given by the communists to the us government to build an embassy .
this 1960s office block is an eyesore in a street otherwise lined with elegant villas , but since the us embassy had all the papers to prove they were the rightful owners , there was little that the family could do .

" but things have progressed in many different ways .
there are many properties in warsaw that many former owners managed to get back , some of them through courts , some through selling their claim to someone who had better relations with the administration in warsaw .
then we decided that the law should be the same for everybody , so we should get compensation , or get our property back . "
the complexity of the restitution program is further complicated by the fact that some property is now in other countries .
after the war , the allies redrew the map of postwar poland , leaving huge chunks of the country in what is now lithuania , belarus and ukraine . mariusz umiastowski , another polish aristocrat whose family used to own two palaces in what is now the lithuanian capital of vilnius , runs a foundation that restores historical monuments in the east that once belonged to polish aristocrats .
he also tries to promote the image of polish aristocracy as " more than bloodsucking landowners . "
" when poland and lithuania joined the european union , we thought that at last , the foundation would regain the property that rightfully belonged to it , " he said .
" it turns out that the former owners are still being discriminated against , especially if the owner left the country before world war ii .
so we are still waiting for the green light to open again . "
little hope with little hope of getting decent compensation for their property , it looks like the younger generation of polish aristocrats , like the dashing marek czetwertynski , now in his mid-twenties , made the right decision to go into business to run a family company , rather than get locked into a losing battle with the polish state .
born in canada , he returned to poland at the age of 10 .

" poland is a different country now , with different influences and the aristocracy doesn ’ t have the financial power that it used to have .
it ’ s important that everybody should play a role in keeping up democracy in poland , which everybody fought for , not just aristocracy . "
meanwhile , marek czetwertynski ’ s father and other aristocrats describe as ridiculous the government ’ s latest offer to pay them between 15 and 30 percent of the 1946 value of the confiscated properties , the year the nationalization process was started by the communists .

dubbed by its creators as " grease on acid " , a new musical entitled " gabba gabba hey ! " tells the rock and rock story of us punk initiators , the ramones .
and it 's hit the stage in berlin . big news back in the golden era of the seventies rock scene , the ramones put a new spin on the old concept of anarchy as they crashed into the psyche of a generation looking for a new way to rebel .
their self-titled debut album , released in 1976 , was the first example of punk rock , making them the first of their kind , and the creators of a genre often more widely associated with the sex pistols . by way of testimony to their anarchic achievements , the band has become further immortalized the form of a musical . super sceptical it 's not exactly an obvious way of preserving a punk legacy , but after digesting his initial disgust at such a sacrilegious suggestion , jörg buttgeriet , the director of the german version of " gabba gabba hey " decided it might be right up his street . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director jörg buttgereit -lrb- l -rrb- , tommy ramone -lrb- r -rrb- buttgeriet , who is a bit of a cult figure in the world of trash horror movies , ultimately decided that his lack of experience in the musical genre was just the thing to make the project credible .
" i have no idea about musicals , but i 'm just going to do it .
and that 's punk rock , " he said . the show , which includes 18 of the band 's songs and is packaged in the form of an edgy love story , promises to be emotional , romantic , wild and rebellious - all in keeping with the casting and rehearsals procedure . lead actor , rolf zacher , was brought in the last minute to cover for martin semmelrogge , who is reported to have pulled out in order to serve a prison sentence . the ensemble also includes two musical novices who secured their roles after applying through a berlin city magazine .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 15.05.2005 for sale : germany , inc . großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investors have begun waking up germany 's sleeping beauties financial investors have recently shown their might by shaking up deutsche börse .
their focus on added value puts pressure on companies .
but it also raises a company 's share value and profitability . the struggle over deutsche börse , the company that operates germany 's stock exchanges , has been settled for now : it wo n't take over the london stock exchange -lrb- lse -rrb- as originally planned - investors connected with hedge fund tci have made this clear . the reason for this is quite simple : takeovers usually cost the active party money and share value and dividends can drop as a result .
that 's something hedge funds ca n't afford .
it 's their mission to multiply the money they 've invested , as is the case with any kind of investor .
but tci and others are under extreme pressure as they buy and sell almost daily and make their money with falling and rising share values . german companies have become highly attractive for aggressive investors from the us and britain in recent years as the german financial sector began selling its shares . an eldorado for investors previously , the so-called " germany , inc . " had made the country 's firms unattractive for investors from abroad .
financial giants such as allianz , deutsche bank and others held shares in companies throughout the country .
it was a comfortable arrangement for decades as it gave these investors nice dividends and high reserves . in today 's globalized world , however , the germans have been forced to sell their shares to free up money .
foreigners are finding many lucrative investment opportunities as a result .
the share values of many companies are far below their real value as they 've been held by german banks for such a long time . they 're cheap when compared with others internationally , but that 's changing rapidly .
share holders may be happy about this , but it can cause tremendous upset within the companies .
deutsche börse is only the most recent example for this . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the funds ' interest is tremendous .
many german companies are or were seen as antiquated , because they relied on safe businesses for too long .
but since hedge funds have been admitted to the german market , they 're on a shopping tour , just like they have been in the us for years .
they want to see yields immediately and push for dividends to keep their own shareholders happy . a place for profiteers individual investors sometimes also play a role .
guy wyser-pratte is a classic example .
he shook up two german industrial conglomerates .
currently he holds 5 percent of iwka , a machine-building company based in karlsruhe that 's mainly known for its robots .
after wyser-pratte invested in the company in 2004 , its share value rose significantly .
he made it clear that he did n't agree with the company 's " sleepy " leadership . such statements make market analysts think that the sale of unprofitable parts of the company might be sold in the future .
whether this happens or not , wyser-pratte will be able to sell his shares at a higher price - even if nothing changes after all . that 's exactly what happened at rheinmetall .
the company 's share value was stagnating for years because of unprofitable divisions and a complex company structure .
in 2000 , wyser-pratte invested in the düsseldorf-based concern .
he made a lot of noise but did not succeed against the majority of share holders . in november 2001 , he sold his shares for 20 euros -lrb- $ 25.40 -rrb- .
he had bought them for 8.50 euros .
but wyser-pratte 's involvement led the company 's management to initiate a restructuring process analysts had called for .
the company sold off divisions , shrank by half and became highly profitable .
its share value now hovers around 40 euros - a positive thing for shareholders and employees alike . not all is well but there are also negative examples .
employees in particular often have to fear investors .
for decades , germany 's economy was governed by rules , regulations and agreements between unions and employers ' groups that are no longer viable in many cases .
as a result , companies with big names and good products were and are no longer competitive internationally and become easy targets for a new kind of investor - venture capital firms such as blackstone , kkr ; carlyle , argantis , lone star , capiton , apax , cinven , investcorp , 3i , permira , and bc partners to name just a few . take tenovis , formerly known as telenorma .
kkr took over the company in 2002 and half of the employees were let go within the first two years despite an agreement to forego 12.5 percent of their wages .
managers on the other hand received bonuses for their good work .
since then tenovis has been sold again , this time to us concern avaya - with profit . another option is to take a company to the stock exchange .
this happened in the case of wincor nixdorf , formerly siemens nixdorf .
while investment companies control such firms , they streamline them with profit maximization in mind .
when the company is then taken to the market , the investors make money again .
in the case of wincor nixdorf , about 350 million euros were made on the stock exchange .
the company only received 125 million euros . the list of german companies with similar experiences is long : mtu will soon be taken to the stock exchange , gerresheimer glas , dynamit nobel , rodenstock , celanese , minimax , atu autoteile unger , debitel , tank & rast , duales system deutschland -lrb- dsd -rrb- .
more will follow . investigating the börse case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chairman of the board of german stock exchange -lrb- deutsche börse ag -rrb- werner g. seifert as far as deutsche börse is concerned , officials for germany 's financial sector watchdog bafin announced thursday that it is investigating the role played by hedge funds in the removal of the company 's chief executive officer this week . bafin was looking to find out whether the funds had acted in concert to force ceo werner seifert to quit after already forcing him to abandon plans for the lse takeover . if that were the case , and if funds held a combined stake of more than 30 percent in deutsche börse , they would be obliged under german law to launch a public takeover offer for the remaining shares . bafin refused to provide a precise timetable for the investigation , but the spokeswoman said the probe could take " some weeks .

but now , a year after joining the eu , some of these nobles are pushing to get compensation . the communists hated them , these once powerful owners of landed estates that stretched far into what is now ukraine and the baltic states .
and when they took over after the end of world war ii , they confiscated their imposing palaces and art collections , reducing them to near-poverty and forcing many into exile . some returned in the early 1990s after the fall of communism .
since then , poland ’ s aristocratic families have been campaigning for compensation .
initially the polish government told them it couldn ’ t shoulder the burden of such claims , along with those advanced by millions of ordinary citizens who were deprived of their homes in the post-war border shifts .
but aware of poland ’ s economic progress and its european union membership , former owners recently doubled up their efforts , finally forcing the government to adopt a restitution bill . accused of spying bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shifting borders , displaced people and property albert swiatopelk czetwertynski is member of one of poland ’ s oldest aristocratic families , whose records , originating in ukraine , which was part of poland for several centuries , date back to 960 .
the czetwertynskis once owned vast stretches of land in the east in what is today ukraine and belarus .
albert czetwertynski was born in poland .
his father had made the mistake of deciding to return home after the war from the uk , where the family sought refuge from the nazis .
" my father unfortunately came back from england and in 1953 he was arrested by the communists and put into prison so they could take away his property , " he said .
" he was accused of spying for the americans .
the entire accusation and records from the court proceedings indicate that everything was manipulated , it was one big lie . "
the czetwertynskis managed to slip out of poland in 1960 and settle in canada .
but long before they returned to warsaw in the early 1990s , their confiscated palace in one of the polish capital ’ s posh districts had been torn down .
ironically , the prime lot was given by the communists to the us government to build an embassy .
this 1960s office block is an eyesore in a street otherwise lined with elegant villas , but since the us embassy had all the papers to prove they were the rightful owners , there was little that the family could do .
seeking compensation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans want their former lands in poland and czech back , too " when i came back from canada , i didn ’ t even think to get any type of compensation for any property that used to belong to my grandmother - poland was in a very difficult economic situation and i didn ’ t feel this was the right time to make a claim , " he said . " but things have progressed in many different ways .
there are many properties in warsaw that many former owners managed to get back , some of them through courts , some through selling their claim to someone who had better relations with the administration in warsaw .
then we decided that the law should be the same for everybody , so we should get compensation , or get our property back . "
the complexity of the restitution program is further complicated by the fact that some property is now in other countries .
after the war , the allies redrew the map of postwar poland , leaving huge chunks of the country in what is now lithuania , belarus and ukraine . mariusz umiastowski , another polish aristocrat whose family used to own two palaces in what is now the lithuanian capital of vilnius , runs a foundation that restores historical monuments in the east that once belonged to polish aristocrats .
he also tries to promote the image of polish aristocracy as " more than bloodsucking landowners . "
" when poland and lithuania joined the european union , we thought that at last , the foundation would regain the property that rightfully belonged to it , " he said .
" it turns out that the former owners are still being discriminated against , especially if the owner left the country before world war ii .
so we are still waiting for the green light to open again . "
little hope with little hope of getting decent compensation for their property , it looks like the younger generation of polish aristocrats , like the dashing marek czetwertynski , now in his mid-twenties , made the right decision to go into business to run a family company , rather than get locked into a losing battle with the polish state .
born in canada , he returned to poland at the age of 10 .
these days , he is philosophical about the role the aristocracy can play in a fast-changing polish society .
" personally i think that aristocracy can ’ t play a role exactly similar to the one it did before , " he said .
" poland is a different country now , with different influences and the aristocracy doesn ’ t have the financial power that it used to have .
it ’ s important that everybody should play a role in keeping up democracy in poland , which everybody fought for , not just aristocracy . "
meanwhile , marek czetwertynski ’ s father and other aristocrats describe as ridiculous the government ’ s latest offer to pay them between 15 and 30 percent of the 1946 value of the confiscated properties , the year the nationalization process was started by the communists .
they think that although they are now living in a very different poland , the state still has the responsibility to put right past wrongs . rafal kiepuszewski -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reconciliation instead of reparation as tension simmers between germany and poland over world war ii compensation claims , a german journalist is trying to bring reason to the impassioned debate by urging ethnic germans to relinquish their claims .

after the war , the allies redrew the map of postwar poland , leaving huge chunks of the country in what is now lithuania , belarus and ukraine . mariusz umiastowski , another polish aristocrat whose family used to own two palaces in what is now the lithuanian capital of vilnius , runs a foundation that restores historical monuments in the east that once belonged to polish aristocrats .
he also tries to promote the image of polish aristocracy as " more than bloodsucking landowners . "
" when poland and lithuania joined the european union , we thought that at last , the foundation would regain the property that rightfully belonged to it , " he said .
" it turns out that the former owners are still being discriminated against , especially if the owner left the country before world war ii .
so we are still waiting for the green light to open again . "
little hope with little hope of getting decent compensation for their property , it looks like the younger generation of polish aristocrats , like the dashing marek czetwertynski , now in his mid-twenties , made the right decision to go into business to run a family company , rather than get locked into a losing battle with the polish state .
born in canada , he returned to poland at the age of 10 .
these days , he is philosophical about the role the aristocracy can play in a fast-changing polish society .
" personally i think that aristocracy can ’ t play a role exactly similar to the one it did before , " he said .
" poland is a different country now , with different influences and the aristocracy doesn ’ t have the financial power that it used to have .
it ’ s important that everybody should play a role in keeping up democracy in poland , which everybody fought for , not just aristocracy . "
meanwhile , marek czetwertynski ’ s father and other aristocrats describe as ridiculous the government ’ s latest offer to pay them between 15 and 30 percent of the 1946 value of the confiscated properties , the year the nationalization process was started by the communists .
they think that although they are now living in a very different poland , the state still has the responsibility to put right past wrongs . rafal kiepuszewski -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : reconciliation instead of reparation as tension simmers between germany and poland over world war ii compensation claims , a german journalist is trying to bring reason to the impassioned debate by urging ethnic germans to relinquish their claims .

protesters rallied against the trial of 23 islamic businessmen the unrest in the eastern uzbek region of andijan was sparked by protests linked to the trial of 23 local businessmen which began in february this year .
their arrests occurred against the backdrop of allegations by human rights groups that president islam karimov 's regime systematically clamped down on islamic groups following a series of bombings in 1999 and 2004 linked to the militant islamic movement of turkestan .
prosecutors allege that the men in the andijan are members of a heterodox islamic sect known as akramiya , named after akramjon yoldoshev , a mathematics teacher from andijan .
in 1992 he authored a pamphlet entitled " iymonga yol " , or the " way to sacred islam " , in which he addressed questions of morality and stressed the superiority of the islamic worldview .
as a result , he attracted a group of followers that became known as akramiya .
it remains unclear whether the group has a distinct structure , or indeed comprises a group at all .
but the uzbek authorities have repeatedly claimed akramiya is an anti-constitutional extremist organisation who wish to impose sharia law and an islamic state in central asia .
others state that akramiya is a splinter group from hezb-e tahrir -lrb- party of liberation -rrb- , a trans-national islamic group that seeks to re-establish the caliphate in central asia , though by peaceful means .
' helping the poor ' in april 2005 , the regional newspaper andijonnoma stated that followers of the group propagate the idea that the solution to all problems in life - social and economic - can be found in the koran or hadith .
its slogan is " use wisdom in the right way " and the paper states that the group aims to create an " islamic environment " to attract followers by setting up small business enterprises in the spheres of construction , production and farming , providing members and followers with jobs and money .
in mid-march 2005 , an unrecognised youth group in the andijan region appealed to the international community to " help their 23 friends and colleagues " charged with involvement in the akramiya group .
the appeal stated that the defendants " were not religious extremists but successful businessmen who have carried out charitable activities and rendered assistance to needy people " .
their statement outlined that the andijan youth movement itself was established in 1994 with the aim of advancing economic reform in the country and they began to implement their plans in 1999 .
a limited liability partnership " qurilishsavdotaminot " -lrb- construction company -rrb- was set up and other enterprises were established later .
in 2004 , all the heads of these enterprises , the 23 defendants , were arrested by officers from the andijan regional branch of the national security service .
the appeal further stated that the " defendants and their friends do not deny that they were and still are muslims , and that they have rendered assistance to people , as prescribed by the koran " .
' no incitement ' those on trial may share the views of akramiya 's founder akramjon yoldoshev , but his book 's main aim , they say , is to prevent the young from joining organisations such as hezb-e tahrir .
other independent sources similarly claim that yoldoshev 's book does not address political questions .
on 11 march yoldoshev 's wife yodgora testified at the trial on behalf of the defence .
she stated that , although she did not know the defendants , she was attending to refute allegations that her husband 's book incited extremism .
her husband , she said , was arrested for the first time on 3 march 1998 , charged with possessing drugs and sentenced to two years and six months in prison , but was released following an amnesty in december that year .
following his release , yoldoshev appealed to the justice department to have his book published officially .
he was subsequently re-arrested on 17 february 1999 and sentenced to 17 years in prison .
yodgora yoldoshev 's states that her husband forbids her to criticise the authorities , and especially not the president , as he says that " one becomes ruler at allah 's will .
acting against the ruler means acting against allah 's will . "
on 29 april the ferghana.ru website announced that the 23 defendants had gone on hunger strike and by 11 may reports emerged of a 4,000-strong protest outside andijan 's town court .
whatever the true aims or beliefs of the followers of akramjon yoldoshev , it now appears that events have taken over .

protesters rallied against the trial of 23 islamic businessmen the unrest in the eastern uzbek region of andijan was sparked by protests linked to the trial of 23 local businessmen which began in february this year .
their arrests occurred against the backdrop of allegations by human rights groups that president islam karimov 's regime systematically clamped down on islamic groups following a series of bombings in 1999 and 2004 linked to the militant islamic movement of turkestan .
prosecutors allege that the men in the andijan are members of a heterodox islamic sect known as akramiya , named after akramjon yoldoshev , a mathematics teacher from andijan .
in 1992 he authored a pamphlet entitled " iymonga yol " , or the " way to sacred islam " , in which he addressed questions of morality and stressed the superiority of the islamic worldview .
as a result , he attracted a group of followers that became known as akramiya .
it remains unclear whether the group has a distinct structure , or indeed comprises a group at all .
but the uzbek authorities have repeatedly claimed akramiya is an anti-constitutional extremist organisation who wish to impose sharia law and an islamic state in central asia .
others state that akramiya is a splinter group from hezb-e tahrir -lrb- party of liberation -rrb- , a trans-national islamic group that seeks to re-establish the caliphate in central asia , though by peaceful means .
' helping the poor ' in april 2005 , the regional newspaper andijonnoma stated that followers of the group propagate the idea that the solution to all problems in life - social and economic - can be found in the koran or hadith .
its slogan is " use wisdom in the right way " and the paper states that the group aims to create an " islamic environment " to attract followers by setting up small business enterprises in the spheres of construction , production and farming , providing members and followers with jobs and money .
in mid-march 2005 , an unrecognised youth group in the andijan region appealed to the international community to " help their 23 friends and colleagues " charged with involvement in the akramiya group .
the appeal stated that the defendants " were not religious extremists but successful businessmen who have carried out charitable activities and rendered assistance to needy people " .
their statement outlined that the andijan youth movement itself was established in 1994 with the aim of advancing economic reform in the country and they began to implement their plans in 1999 .
a limited liability partnership " qurilishsavdotaminot " -lrb- construction company -rrb- was set up and other enterprises were established later .
in 2004 , all the heads of these enterprises , the 23 defendants , were arrested by officers from the andijan regional branch of the national security service .
the appeal further stated that the " defendants and their friends do not deny that they were and still are muslims , and that they have rendered assistance to people , as prescribed by the koran " .
' no incitement ' those on trial may share the views of akramiya 's founder akramjon yoldoshev , but his book 's main aim , they say , is to prevent the young from joining organisations such as hezb-e tahrir .
other independent sources similarly claim that yoldoshev 's book does not address political questions .
on 11 march yoldoshev 's wife yodgora testified at the trial on behalf of the defence .
she stated that , although she did not know the defendants , she was attending to refute allegations that her husband 's book incited extremism .
her husband , she said , was arrested for the first time on 3 march 1998 , charged with possessing drugs and sentenced to two years and six months in prison , but was released following an amnesty in december that year .
following his release , yoldoshev appealed to the justice department to have his book published officially .
he was subsequently re-arrested on 17 february 1999 and sentenced to 17 years in prison .
yodgora yoldoshev 's states that her husband forbids her to criticise the authorities , and especially not the president , as he says that " one becomes ruler at allah 's will .
acting against the ruler means acting against allah 's will . "
on 29 april the ferghana.ru website announced that the 23 defendants had gone on hunger strike and by 11 may reports emerged of a 4,000-strong protest outside andijan 's town court .
whatever the true aims or beliefs of the followers of akramjon yoldoshev , it now appears that events have taken over .

protesters rallied against the trial of 23 islamic businessmen the unrest in the eastern uzbek region of andijan was sparked by protests linked to the trial of 23 local businessmen which began in february this year .
their arrests occurred against the backdrop of allegations by human rights groups that president islam karimov 's regime systematically clamped down on islamic groups following a series of bombings in 1999 and 2004 linked to the militant islamic movement of turkestan .
prosecutors allege that the men in the andijan are members of a heterodox islamic sect known as akramiya , named after akramjon yoldoshev , a mathematics teacher from andijan .
in 1992 he authored a pamphlet entitled " iymonga yol " , or the " way to sacred islam " , in which he addressed questions of morality and stressed the superiority of the islamic worldview .
as a result , he attracted a group of followers that became known as akramiya .
it remains unclear whether the group has a distinct structure , or indeed comprises a group at all .
but the uzbek authorities have repeatedly claimed akramiya is an anti-constitutional extremist organisation who wish to impose sharia law and an islamic state in central asia .
others state that akramiya is a splinter group from hezb-e tahrir -lrb- party of liberation -rrb- , a trans-national islamic group that seeks to re-establish the caliphate in central asia , though by peaceful means .
' helping the poor ' in april 2005 , the regional newspaper andijonnoma stated that followers of the group propagate the idea that the solution to all problems in life - social and economic - can be found in the koran or hadith .
its slogan is " use wisdom in the right way " and the paper states that the group aims to create an " islamic environment " to attract followers by setting up small business enterprises in the spheres of construction , production and farming , providing members and followers with jobs and money .
in mid-march 2005 , an unrecognised youth group in the andijan region appealed to the international community to " help their 23 friends and colleagues " charged with involvement in the akramiya group .
the appeal stated that the defendants " were not religious extremists but successful businessmen who have carried out charitable activities and rendered assistance to needy people " .
their statement outlined that the andijan youth movement itself was established in 1994 with the aim of advancing economic reform in the country and they began to implement their plans in 1999 .
a limited liability partnership " qurilishsavdotaminot " -lrb- construction company -rrb- was set up and other enterprises were established later .
in 2004 , all the heads of these enterprises , the 23 defendants , were arrested by officers from the andijan regional branch of the national security service .
the appeal further stated that the " defendants and their friends do not deny that they were and still are muslims , and that they have rendered assistance to people , as prescribed by the koran " .
' no incitement ' those on trial may share the views of akramiya 's founder akramjon yoldoshev , but his book 's main aim , they say , is to prevent the young from joining organisations such as hezb-e tahrir .
other independent sources similarly claim that yoldoshev 's book does not address political questions .
on 11 march yoldoshev 's wife yodgora testified at the trial on behalf of the defence .
she stated that , although she did not know the defendants , she was attending to refute allegations that her husband 's book incited extremism .
her husband , she said , was arrested for the first time on 3 march 1998 , charged with possessing drugs and sentenced to two years and six months in prison , but was released following an amnesty in december that year .
following his release , yoldoshev appealed to the justice department to have his book published officially .
he was subsequently re-arrested on 17 february 1999 and sentenced to 17 years in prison .
yodgora yoldoshev 's states that her husband forbids her to criticise the authorities , and especially not the president , as he says that " one becomes ruler at allah 's will .
acting against the ruler means acting against allah 's will . "
on 29 april the ferghana.ru website announced that the 23 defendants had gone on hunger strike and by 11 may reports emerged of a 4,000-strong protest outside andijan 's town court .
whatever the true aims or beliefs of the followers of akramjon yoldoshev , it now appears that events have taken over .

mr rankin is calling for money spent on food in homes to be increased from an average of £ 18 to £ 28 a week and for more healthy menus to be introduced .
support groups say homes should be making better use of their budgets .
the drive comes after tv chef jamie oliver highlighted the standard of food given to children in schools .
mr rankin is a regular face on a number of tv cooking shows and runs a restaurant business in belfast .
he was inspired to address the issue after a friend who owns a nursing home in the city asked him to help out with the catering .
' educating the palate ' " the standard was not too bad , " mr rankin told bbc news 24 .
" they had a cook in there cooking everything fresh but there just was n't any real emphasis on quality tasty foods .
" a lot of the food was low in fibre and nutritional content , there was too much frying going on . "
he said he wants care homes to move away from using convenience meals and ingredients and serve " real food " .
" it 's an area i am particularly interested in .
i think healthy food goes right across the generations .
funding is only one of the challenges you face shelia scott , national care homes association " it 's just a process of education .
educating the palate , educating people as far as their health concerns are . "
gillian dalley , chief executive of the relatives and residents association , said food was a source of complaint in many care homes .
" an imaginative cook can do wonders with a very limited budget , " she said .
" on the other hand there can be a lot of waste and lack of imagination and residents get the same sort of meals churned out day after day . "
shelia scott from the national care homes association said its members were already spending a average of £ 20- £ 30 a week on meals for each resident .
" we really welcome the involve of people like paul rankin , " she added .
" we need assistance to ensure older peoples ' nutritional needs are met but also need to talk to older people themselves to find out what it is they will eat .
" funding is only one of the challenges you face when you 're trying to feed frail , vulnerable elderly people . "

despite having been annexed to hitler 's third reich , austria did not share the fate of post-war germany .
in 1955 it was granted full independence and escaped the yoke of communism .
the anniversary has re-awakened the emotional debate as to whether austria has done enough to confront its nazi past .
on 15 may 1955 , the austrian foreign minister , leopold figl , a concentration camp survivor , stepped out on the balcony of the belvedere palace in vienna brandishing the newly-signed state treaty . "
all the uncomfortable questions are left out " brigitte bailer " österreich ist frei " - he declared - austria is free .
it was the end of 10 years of occupation by britain , the united states , france and the soviet union .
fifty years on , the event is being marked by a huge party at the belvedere - thrown by the austrian government .
victims or perpetrators ?
but some austrians are concerned that the festivities gloss over austria 's dark nazi past .
brigitte bailer from the archive for the austrian resistance says she sometimes gets angry at the tone of the official ceremonies .
" they leave out what role the austrians had in the national socialist regime .
nobody asks why these occupation forces stayed in austria .
" i think that 's the worst way to present history to take some dates out of context .
that way people are made to believe again that we are just victims , that history was unjust to the poor austrians and all the uncomfortable questions are left out . "
it was the allies who described austria as hitler 's " first victim " .
but they also added that the country bore responsibility for its part in the war .
for many years , official austria clung to the victim description . "
it ca n't only be the question of condemning some people who took part in the nazi tyranny and who persecuted jews and minorities " werner fasselabend things began to change in the 1990s when chancellor franz vranitzky acknowledged responsibility for austrian involvement in nazi crimes .
in 1995 , a fund to compensate nazi victims was set up , and several other restitution packages have since been agreed .
the austrian president heinz fischer told the bbc that coming to terms with a brutal past was always painful , but that austria 's role as perpetrator was now established beyond doubt .
but shadows of the past remain .
painful memories jörg haider 's far-right party has been part of the coalition government since 2000 .
and the argument over victim and perpetrator is still very much alive .
" it ca n't only be the question of condemning some people who took part in the nazi tyranny and who persecuted jews and minorities , " said werner fasselabend from the ruling conservative party .
" on the other hand you also have the situation that after the war , there was n't really freedom for austria and the russians came and raped the women . "
" it was only two years ago that -lsb- my father -rsb- told his grandchildren that -lsb- ... -rsb- he had passed the mauthausen concentration camp .
he had never , ever talked about it before " veronika mandorfer some austrians feel there is too much emphasis on this period .
but many others disagree .
recently there was widespread outcry after a far-right politician questioned the existence of the gas chambers .
veronika mandorfer , a vienna school teacher , said talking about the past is essential .
" there are still too many things that have been covered up , " she said .
" my father never told me , but it was only two years ago that he told his grandchildren that when he was drafted into the army , he passed the mauthausen concentration camp .
he had never , ever talked about it before . "
however things are moving on .
students in mrs mandorfer 's class have been talking to their grandparents about the period as part of a school project .
" many people died , " said 13-year-old gabi .
" they did n't have a chance to live .
it was n't fair .
i think 1945 is better because it was the end of the war . "

the " pleistocene park " experiment will try to turn the wet , boggy tundra back to the dry grasslands that once were home to large herds of stampeding mammals .
these creatures included bison , horses , reindeer , musk-oxen , elk , saiga , and yaks and even woolly rhinos and mammoths .
there were top predators , too , such as cave lions and wolves .
it is hoped that by re-introducing some of the still-surviving species , grazing will begin again and restore the landscape .
" the idea is to do some scientific experiments which would explain why there was such a dramatic change in the ecosystem 10,000 years ago , " said sergey zimov , director of the northeast science station in cherskii , russia .
" we want to construct the ecosystem that existed here - an ecosystem that had a very big density of bison , horses , rhinos and many other herbivores and predators , " he told the bbc world service 's science in action programme .
theory tests dr zimov believes that the vegetation of an area is determined by the animals that live there - rather than the other way around .
he hopes that by putting a lot of large grazing animals on to the modern tundra , they will chew up the mosses that currently keep the soil moist .
the drier earth will then be suitable for grassland , which is what the animals prefer .
even if -lsb- humans -rsb- had the capacity to kill that many animals , why would they have needed to ?
pleistocene mammal expert professor adrian lister dr zimov plans to test his theory initially in a small area , and has the support of the government of the republic of yakutia to work in 160 sq km of ko lyma lowland .
the reintroduced herbivores will include reindeer , moose , yakutian horses and recently reintroduced musk-oxen , along with other smaller plant-eaters such as hares , marmots and ground squirrels .
eventually , as the numbers of animals climb , the boundaries of the park will be increased and bison will be brought in from canada .

the " pleistocene park " experiment will try to turn the wet , boggy tundra back to the dry grasslands that once were home to large herds of stampeding mammals .
these creatures included bison , horses , reindeer , musk-oxen , elk , saiga , and yaks and even woolly rhinos and mammoths .
there were top predators , too , such as cave lions and wolves .
it is hoped that by re-introducing some of the still-surviving species , grazing will begin again and restore the landscape .
" the idea is to do some scientific experiments which would explain why there was such a dramatic change in the ecosystem 10,000 years ago , " said sergey zimov , director of the northeast science station in cherskii , russia .
" we want to construct the ecosystem that existed here - an ecosystem that had a very big density of bison , horses , rhinos and many other herbivores and predators , " he told the bbc world service 's science in action programme .
theory tests dr zimov believes that the vegetation of an area is determined by the animals that live there - rather than the other way around .
he hopes that by putting a lot of large grazing animals on to the modern tundra , they will chew up the mosses that currently keep the soil moist .
the drier earth will then be suitable for grassland , which is what the animals prefer .
even if -lsb- humans -rsb- had the capacity to kill that many animals , why would they have needed to ?
pleistocene mammal expert professor adrian lister dr zimov plans to test his theory initially in a small area , and has the support of the government of the republic of yakutia to work in 160 sq km of ko lyma lowland .
the reintroduced herbivores will include reindeer , moose , yakutian horses and recently reintroduced musk-oxen , along with other smaller plant-eaters such as hares , marmots and ground squirrels .
eventually , as the numbers of animals climb , the boundaries of the park will be increased and bison will be brought in from canada .
ultimately , predators also will be re-introduced , such as siberian tigers .

bbc news -pipe- science / nature -pipe- ' pleistocene park ' experiment bbc news / science / nature graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- sunday , 15 may 2005 , 10:47 gmt 11:47 uk ' pleistocene park ' experiment efforts are under way to restore part of siberia to the way it was more than 10,000 years ago , before the end of the last ice age .
the " pleistocene park " experiment will try to turn the wet , boggy tundra back to the dry grasslands that once were home to large herds of stampeding mammals .
these creatures included bison , horses , reindeer , musk-oxen , elk , saiga , and yaks and even woolly rhinos and mammoths .
there were top predators , too , such as cave lions and wolves .
it is hoped that by re-introducing some of the still-surviving species , grazing will begin again and restore the landscape .
" the idea is to do some scientific experiments which would explain why there was such a dramatic change in the ecosystem 10,000 years ago , " said sergey zimov , director of the northeast science station in cherskii , russia .
" we want to construct the ecosystem that existed here - an ecosystem that had a very big density of bison , horses , rhinos and many other herbivores and predators , " he told the bbc world service 's science in action programme .
theory tests dr zimov believes that the vegetation of an area is determined by the animals that live there - rather than the other way around .
he hopes that by putting a lot of large grazing animals on to the modern tundra , they will chew up the mosses that currently keep the soil moist .
the drier earth will then be suitable for grassland , which is what the animals prefer . "
even if -lsb- humans -rsb- had the capacity to kill that many animals , why would they have needed to ? "
pleistocene mammal expert professor adrian lister dr zimov plans to test his theory initially in a small area , and has the support of the government of the republic of yakutia to work in 160 sq km of ko lyma lowland .
the reintroduced herbivores will include reindeer , moose , yakutian horses and recently reintroduced musk-oxen , along with other smaller plant-eaters such as hares , marmots and ground squirrels .
eventually , as the numbers of animals climb , the boundaries of the park will be increased and bison will be brought in from canada .
ultimately , predators also will be re-introduced , such as siberian tigers .
human hunters however , pleistocene mammal expert professor adrian lister , of university college london , uk , said that he did not know if this idea would actually work .
" -lsb- dr zimov -rsb- quite properly says that he appreciates that this is a theory , and i think the idea of massive landscape reconstruction on the basis of a theory is perhaps a bit dodgy , " he added .
america 's ' big wipe-out ' were humans really to blame ?
" but he says that he is going to take a relatively small area and try it out - take a fenced area , put some bison and horses in , and see if it works . "
one of the points of the experiment is to try to prove why some of the great beasts , such as the mammoth and woolly rhino , became extinct .
" one of the prevailing ideas is that the climate changed at the end of the last ice age ; it became wetter and warmer , and the normally accepted model is that that change turned the dry grasslands into the modern , wet tundra , " explained professor lister .
" there is another idea - which i think zimov is championing - which says it 's actually the entry of modern humans into these vast areas which killed off the animals ; they were over-hunted , and because those animals were no longer there to graze the grasses , it turned into this boggy tundra . "
dr lister said he had problems with this " overkill " model .
in particular , he explained that when people entered that area , it was in " pretty small numbers " .
" you 're talking about the extinction of probably millions of individuals , of huge animals like mammoth and woolly rhino .
even if they had the capacity to kill that many animals , why would they have needed to ? "
mammoth home one further proposed benefit of restoring the grassland at pleistocene park is that it may prevent a large amount of carbon currently locked up in the permafrost of the tundra from being released into the atmosphere - with obvious consequences for global warming .
" the amount of carbon now sequestered in soils of the former mammoth ecosystem , and that could end up as greenhouse gases if released into the atmosphere by rising global temperatures , surpasses the total carbon content of all of the planet 's rainforests , " dr zimov wrote in an essay in science magazine this month .
he believes the returning grasses and their root systems would help dry out and stabilise the soil .
" the albedo - or ability to reflect incoming sunlight skyward - of such ecosystems is high , so warming from solar radiation also is reduced .
and with lots of herbivores present , much of the wintertime snow would be trampled , exposing the ground to colder temperatures that prevent ice from melting .
" all of this suggests that reconstructed grassland ecosystems , such as the ones we are working on in pleistocene park , could prevent permafrost from thawing and thereby mitigate some negative consequences of climate warming , " he told science readers .

personalities should not be an issue at this stage , sir bill said .
the party should be concentrating on making sure private sector involvement in health and education does not risk the party 's popularity , he added .
he told gmtv 's the sunday programme mr blair " will do what is in the best interest of the party and the country " .
but he does need to " demonstrate that he is listening " to the electorate in light of the government 's reduced majority in parliament , sir bill said .
slippery slopes the former general secretary of the transport and general workers ' union said the government should limit the involvement of private firms in providing public services . "
i do not think the british electorate would be forgiving if we were seen to be rushing to have an internal election " sir bill morris the new health secretary , patricia hewitt , has said the use of the private sector to carry out nhs operations will double in the next five years .
" there can not be any magical figure but there has to be some recognition that at the end of the day nothing must be done that undermines the fundamental principle of the national health service free at the point of use , " sir bill said .
" the needs of the many would determine that the national health service should be strengthened , not weakened . "
similar practices should be avoided in education , he said .
" those are the slippery slopes that would derail the next government rather than issues around who is going to lead whom and when , " sir bill told the programme .
successor call mr blair has said he will complete a full third term before leaving downing street , but last week faced calls from some backbenchers to quit immediately .
sir bill said he wanted to see a successor appointed 18 months to two years before the next election .
" i do not think the british electorate would be forgiving if we were seen to be rushing to have an internal election , " he added .
" there is a small little rump within the parliamentary labour party seeking to rush headlong into the political wilderness of opposition . "
last year , sir bill said the party had lost its " ideological compass " and needed to regain its radical reforming streak .
