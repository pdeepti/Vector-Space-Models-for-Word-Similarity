" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement " i will be responsible for its success or failure , " he added . the controversial package of labor market reforms known as hartz iv will have a wide-reaching impact on the lives of 4.5 million people out of work in what is still europe 's economic powerhouse .
it is impossible to tell for the moment exactly how many unemployed will lose money under the new system or who will benefit from the changes . but those expected to feel the changes hardest are the long-term jobless and the 2.7 million people who the federal labor agency says have used up their benefits and now receive only minimum welfare payments .
the agency says less than 10 percent will lose their welfare payments altogether , a figure the unions reject .
they put the figure at 27 percent and say 48 percent will have their income reduced . to calculate the new benefits , the federal labor agency analyzes peoples ' estate , their expenditure and their needs , which is already sparking controversy .
generous system the government argues that overhauling germany 's generous social welfare system - once envied throughout the world - will persuade people who have been out of work for more than a year to accept a job , no matter how low paid .
but support groups for the unemployed have criticized a move they say will make the poor poorer . other observers have called for recognition that even after the reforms are introduced , the german welfare state will be relatively generous to the unemployed .
for example , the point at which the value of an unemployed person 's residential property is taken into consideration is € 200,000 -lrb- $ 270,000 -rrb- and only 9 percent of homes in western germany and three percent in eastern germany are valued higher . bildunterschrift : few protestors gathered outside a labor office in the western german town of duisburg on tuesday monday 's protests came in the wake of demonstrations last year which were held for weeks on mondays , similar to rallies which brought down former east germany 's communist regime in 1989 .
anti-hartz iv monday protests eventually fizzled out but widespread unease with the reform translated into severe electoral blows for chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de one euro , one way out of unemployment ?
for those out of work , the government has introduced a new category of low-paying jobs to supplement welfare .
so-called one-euro jobs are supposed to help the long-term unemployed back into the work force .

a run-off against jadranka kosor has been scheduled . on monday , official results showed croatia ’ s incumbent president had won the first round of elections , taking 49 percent of the vote compared to conservative candidate deputy prime minister kosor of the ruling croatian democratic union -lrb- hdz -rrb- , who received 20.18 percent of the ballots .
mesic ’ s take , however , was not enough to secure an outright victory , and the presidential race will go into a second round on jan .
16 , the electoral commission reported . mesic , who has his sites fixed on leading his country into the european union during the next five years , was jubilant after the results were announced .
although election precincts reported a lower than expected turnout , he said he was pleased with the outcome .
his candidacy has been endorsed by the three main center-left opposition parties who were defeated by the hdz in 2003 . the 70-year-old mesic called on all people in the former war-torn yugoslav republic to turn out in full strength for the run-off in two weeks . “ croatia must be a modern , european and democratic country with satisfied citizens , " he said .
" it will be possible only if we change many things .
we will decide where croatia is heading , to the 21st century or back in time . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voters cast their ballots at the polling station in zagreb , croatia on jan .
2 , 2005 .
about 4.4 million people , including 400,000 croats living abroad , voted .
observers believe mesic will most likely win a second term in the run-off against the more conservative kosor , who is widely seen as a close ally of prime minister ivo sanader . “ i think kosor has little chance of winning in the second round , ” analyst nenad zakosek told reuters after results were released just after midnight . a first for women kosor , who is the first woman to run for the presidency , said she was very pleased with the results of the first ballot . “ i am very happy that for the first time we have two candidates , one of which is a woman , ” she said .
“ this shows the maturity of voters since the most frequent question during the campaign was whether croatia was mature enough to have a woman for a president . ” the former journalist and deputy prime minister responsible for families and war veterans has stood by prime minister sanader and his efforts to turn the hdz from its nationalist past to a modern pro-european party . analysts , however , have criticized her campaign as lacking popular appeal and a strong political personality .
her position on the ballot was hotly contested by croatian-us businessman boris miksic , who finished third with 17.8 percent of the vote . the strong showing of miksic , an outsider on croatia ’ s political scene whose support was not expected to break out of the single digits , was described as a protest vote . ” this is a protest of croatian voters against the politics being led here , ” vesna pusic , a lawmaker with a leftist opposition party told afp . mesic and kosor both pledged a better future for croatians along the same lines – eu membership , the strengthening of the rule of law and fighting corruption . paving the way to europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatian president stipe mesic mesic , who said he was confident of winning re-election , owes much of his popularity to the role he played in ending the balkan nation ’ s international isolation and completing its democratic reforms after succeeding authoritarian leader franjo tudjman . he significantly reduced presidential powers as the country turned into a parliamentary democracy following changes in 2000 .
however , the president remains the supreme commander of the military and a co-creator of foreign policy along with the prime minister . the president will also oversee croatia ’ s entry into the european union , which is planned for 2009 .
croatia has been put on a fast track to accession with brussels deciding last month to launch membership talks in march .
zagreb hopes to fulfil membership criteria by 2007 but its bid depends on full cooperation with the un war crimes tribunal following the balkans wars of the 1990s which will be closely monitored by brussels . mesic has vowed to deliver the war crimes suspects to the international court , despite strong criticism from war veterans and nationalists . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de green lights for balkan trio the eu commission agrees to a date for romania and bulgaria to sign accession treaties and for croatia to start entry talks .

a run-off against jadranka kosor has been scheduled . on monday , official results showed croatia ’ s incumbent president had won the first round of elections , taking 49 percent of the vote compared to conservative candidate deputy prime minister kosor of the ruling croatian democratic union -lrb- hdz -rrb- , who received 20.18 percent of the ballots .
mesic ’ s take , however , was not enough to secure an outright victory , and the presidential race will go into a second round on jan .
16 , the electoral commission reported . mesic , who has his sites fixed on leading his country into the european union during the next five years , was jubilant after the results were announced .
although election precincts reported a lower than expected turnout , he said he was pleased with the outcome .
his candidacy has been endorsed by the three main center-left opposition parties who were defeated by the hdz in 2003 . the 70-year-old mesic called on all people in the former war-torn yugoslav republic to turn out in full strength for the run-off in two weeks . “ croatia must be a modern , european and democratic country with satisfied citizens , " he said .
" it will be possible only if we change many things .
we will decide where croatia is heading , to the 21st century or back in time . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voters cast their ballots at the polling station in zagreb , croatia on jan .
2 , 2005 .
about 4.4 million people , including 400,000 croats living abroad , voted .
observers believe mesic will most likely win a second term in the run-off against the more conservative kosor , who is widely seen as a close ally of prime minister ivo sanader . “ i think kosor has little chance of winning in the second round , ” analyst nenad zakosek told reuters after results were released just after midnight . a first for women kosor , who is the first woman to run for the presidency , said she was very pleased with the results of the first ballot . “ i am very happy that for the first time we have two candidates , one of which is a woman , ” she said .
“ this shows the maturity of voters since the most frequent question during the campaign was whether croatia was mature enough to have a woman for a president . ” the former journalist and deputy prime minister responsible for families and war veterans has stood by prime minister sanader and his efforts to turn the hdz from its nationalist past to a modern pro-european party . analysts , however , have criticized her campaign as lacking popular appeal and a strong political personality .
her position on the ballot was hotly contested by croatian-us businessman boris miksic , who finished third with 17.8 percent of the vote . the strong showing of miksic , an outsider on croatia ’ s political scene whose support was not expected to break out of the single digits , was described as a protest vote . ” this is a protest of croatian voters against the politics being led here , ” vesna pusic , a lawmaker with a leftist opposition party told afp . mesic and kosor both pledged a better future for croatians along the same lines – eu membership , the strengthening of the rule of law and fighting corruption . paving the way to europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatian president stipe mesic mesic , who said he was confident of winning re-election , owes much of his popularity to the role he played in ending the balkan nation ’ s international isolation and completing its democratic reforms after succeeding authoritarian leader franjo tudjman . he significantly reduced presidential powers as the country turned into a parliamentary democracy following changes in 2000 .
however , the president remains the supreme commander of the military and a co-creator of foreign policy along with the prime minister . the president will also oversee croatia ’ s entry into the european union , which is planned for 2009 .
croatia has been put on a fast track to accession with brussels deciding last month to launch membership talks in march .
zagreb hopes to fulfil membership criteria by 2007 but its bid depends on full cooperation with the un war crimes tribunal following the balkans wars of the 1990s which will be closely monitored by brussels . mesic has vowed to deliver the war crimes suspects to the international court , despite strong criticism from war veterans and nationalists . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de green lights for balkan trio the eu commission agrees to a date for romania and bulgaria to sign accession treaties and for croatia to start entry talks .

the german government now praises the technology which has been held up for 16 months by technical flaws costing germany billions in lost revenues . the expected long traffic jams at german border crossing points failed to materialize on monday morning and highway service stations also weren ’ t crammed with truckers at stationary toll machines .
german authorities say the country ’ s satellite-based tolls system is up and running smoothly and that trucking companies have apparently been well-prepared for the start of the system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an automatic toll surveillance bridge on a german highway " all parts of the system are working flawlessly , " said felix stenschke , a spokesman for the ministry of transportation .
" at the moment there is still only little traffic on german highways but nevertheless we are completely satisfied .
one year ago the situation was quite the contrary . " earlier problems the pioneering toll system is based on satellite technology which in the past 16 months was plagued by technical problems .
the delays were a major embarrassment for toll collect – the consortium made up of automaker daimlerchrysler , deutsche telekom and french motoway operator cofiroute which developed the system . germany has europe ’ s busiest highways and is now charging an average of 12 and a half eurocents -lrb- 10 us cents -rrb- per kilometer -lrb- 0.6 miles -rrb- .
about one third of the trucks that use its 12-thousand-kilometer highway network are foreign .
transport minister manfred stolpe -lrb- photo below -rrb- said truckers in neighboring poland and the netherlands were especially well prepared on monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe " i ’ ve been surprised by two things , " he said .
" first of all the number of on-board units ordered and installed by polish and dutch companies – the two countries which in my view are best prepared for the new system .
and secondly the degree of training undergone by truckers in advance . “ hefty fines but during the first two days after the toll system began operating , the government also nabbed about 500 fee dodgers .
they neither had special on-board units in their cabins that automatically pay the tolls nor did they pay for their journeys at toll machines set up in service stations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a picture of one of the first toll dodgers the dodgers were fined € 75 -lrb- $ 101 -rrb- and face a much stiffer penalty of up to € 20,000 if they will be caught again . rüdiger petri , a spokesman for the association of german hauliers , said the toll system will also lead to higher prices for german consumers . " we ’ ve repeatedly told our customers that german haulers are unable to carry the extra costs resulting from the toll system , " he said .
" our customers accepted that and said they saw no other alternative than passing them on to product prices paid by consumers . " the german government expects about € 2.5 billion in truck toll revenues each year .
in addition , it is currently seeking billions of euros in compensation from toll collect for 16 months of lost revenues .

the german government now praises the technology which has been held up for 16 months by technical flaws costing germany billions in lost revenues . the expected long traffic jams at german border crossing points failed to materialize on monday morning and highway service stations also weren ’ t crammed with truckers at stationary toll machines .
german authorities say the country ’ s satellite-based tolls system is up and running smoothly and that trucking companies have apparently been well-prepared for the start of the system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an automatic toll surveillance bridge on a german highway " all parts of the system are working flawlessly , " said felix stenschke , a spokesman for the ministry of transportation .
" at the moment there is still only little traffic on german highways but nevertheless we are completely satisfied .
one year ago the situation was quite the contrary . " earlier problems the pioneering toll system is based on satellite technology which in the past 16 months was plagued by technical problems .
the delays were a major embarrassment for toll collect – the consortium made up of automaker daimlerchrysler , deutsche telekom and french motoway operator cofiroute which developed the system . germany has europe ’ s busiest highways and is now charging an average of 12 and a half eurocents -lrb- 10 us cents -rrb- per kilometer -lrb- 0.6 miles -rrb- .
about one third of the trucks that use its 12-thousand-kilometer highway network are foreign .
transport minister manfred stolpe -lrb- photo below -rrb- said truckers in neighboring poland and the netherlands were especially well prepared on monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe " i ’ ve been surprised by two things , " he said .
" first of all the number of on-board units ordered and installed by polish and dutch companies – the two countries which in my view are best prepared for the new system .
and secondly the degree of training undergone by truckers in advance . “ hefty fines but during the first two days after the toll system began operating , the government also nabbed about 500 fee dodgers .
they neither had special on-board units in their cabins that automatically pay the tolls nor did they pay for their journeys at toll machines set up in service stations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a picture of one of the first toll dodgers the dodgers were fined € 75 -lrb- $ 101 -rrb- and face a much stiffer penalty of up to € 20,000 if they will be caught again . rüdiger petri , a spokesman for the association of german hauliers , said the toll system will also lead to higher prices for german consumers . " we ’ ve repeatedly told our customers that german haulers are unable to carry the extra costs resulting from the toll system , " he said .
" our customers accepted that and said they saw no other alternative than passing them on to product prices paid by consumers . " the german government expects about € 2.5 billion in truck toll revenues each year .
in addition , it is currently seeking billions of euros in compensation from toll collect for 16 months of lost revenues .
but economics minister wolfgang clement also hopes the state-of-the-art system will be an export hit doing away with the old-fashioned booths that still cause traffic congestions in many other european countries . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german road toll prepares for launch after a catolog of catastrophic technical faults and management blunders , germany ’ s road toll system for heavy vehicles is now scheduled for a january launch after its successful test phase ended on wednesday .

the delays were a major embarrassment for toll collect – the consortium made up of automaker daimlerchrysler , deutsche telekom and french motoway operator cofiroute which developed the system . germany has europe ’ s busiest highways and is now charging an average of 12 and a half eurocents -lrb- 10 us cents -rrb- per kilometer -lrb- 0.6 miles -rrb- .
about one third of the trucks that use its 12-thousand-kilometer highway network are foreign .
transport minister manfred stolpe -lrb- photo below -rrb- said truckers in neighboring poland and the netherlands were especially well prepared on monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe " i ’ ve been surprised by two things , " he said .

and secondly the degree of training undergone by truckers in advance . “ hefty fines but during the first two days after the toll system began operating , the government also nabbed about 500 fee dodgers .
they neither had special on-board units in their cabins that automatically pay the tolls nor did they pay for their journeys at toll machines set up in service stations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a picture of one of the first toll dodgers the dodgers were fined € 75 -lrb- $ 101 -rrb- and face a much stiffer penalty of up to € 20,000 if they will be caught again . rüdiger petri , a spokesman for the association of german hauliers , said the toll system will also lead to higher prices for german consumers . " we ’ ve repeatedly told our customers that german haulers are unable to carry the extra costs resulting from the toll system , " he said .
" our customers accepted that and said they saw no other alternative than passing them on to product prices paid by consumers . " the german government expects about € 2.5 billion in truck toll revenues each year .
in addition , it is currently seeking billions of euros in compensation from toll collect for 16 months of lost revenues .
but economics minister wolfgang clement also hopes the state-of-the-art system will be an export hit doing away with the old-fashioned booths that still cause traffic congestions in many other european countries . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german road toll prepares for launch after a catolog of catastrophic technical faults and management blunders , germany ’ s road toll system for heavy vehicles is now scheduled for a january launch after its successful test phase ended on wednesday .

the german government now praises the technology which has been held up for 16 months by technical flaws costing germany billions in lost revenues . the expected long traffic jams at german border crossing points failed to materialize on monday morning and highway service stations also weren ’ t crammed with truckers at stationary toll machines .
german authorities say the country ’ s satellite-based tolls system is up and running smoothly and that trucking companies have apparently been well-prepared for the start of the system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an automatic toll surveillance bridge on a german highway " all parts of the system are working flawlessly , " said felix stenschke , a spokesman for the ministry of transportation .
" at the moment there is still only little traffic on german highways but nevertheless we are completely satisfied .
one year ago the situation was quite the contrary . " earlier problems the pioneering toll system is based on satellite technology which in the past 16 months was plagued by technical problems .
the delays were a major embarrassment for toll collect – the consortium made up of automaker daimlerchrysler , deutsche telekom and french motoway operator cofiroute which developed the system . germany has europe ’ s busiest highways and is now charging an average of 12 and a half eurocents -lrb- 10 us cents -rrb- per kilometer -lrb- 0.6 miles -rrb- .
about one third of the trucks that use its 12-thousand-kilometer highway network are foreign .
transport minister manfred stolpe -lrb- photo below -rrb- said truckers in neighboring poland and the netherlands were especially well prepared on monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe " i ’ ve been surprised by two things , " he said .
" first of all the number of on-board units ordered and installed by polish and dutch companies – the two countries which in my view are best prepared for the new system .
and secondly the degree of training undergone by truckers in advance . “ hefty fines but during the first two days after the toll system began operating , the government also nabbed about 500 fee dodgers .
they neither had special on-board units in their cabins that automatically pay the tolls nor did they pay for their journeys at toll machines set up in service stations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a picture of one of the first toll dodgers the dodgers were fined € 75 -lrb- $ 101 -rrb- and face a much stiffer penalty of up to € 20,000 if they will be caught again . rüdiger petri , a spokesman for the association of german hauliers , said the toll system will also lead to higher prices for german consumers . " we ’ ve repeatedly told our customers that german haulers are unable to carry the extra costs resulting from the toll system , " he said .
" our customers accepted that and said they saw no other alternative than passing them on to product prices paid by consumers . " the german government expects about € 2.5 billion in truck toll revenues each year .
in addition , it is currently seeking billions of euros in compensation from toll collect for 16 months of lost revenues .
but economics minister wolfgang clement also hopes the state-of-the-art system will be an export hit doing away with the old-fashioned booths that still cause traffic congestions in many other european countries . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german road toll prepares for launch after a catolog of catastrophic technical faults and management blunders , germany ’ s road toll system for heavy vehicles is now scheduled for a january launch after its successful test phase ended on wednesday .

with more than 30 years experience , germany has sent its team of forensic scientists to the region . no matter where a catastrophe strikes , when germans are among its victims , the identification commission of the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- is called into action - the 1998 train disaster in eschede , the 2000 concorde crash in paris and now the tsunamis in south asia .
disasters that leave victims unrecognizable are the special focus of germany ’ s forensic science team . victims from many nations since dec .
29 , the german identification commission has been deployed to thailand where they are working around the clock to determine the identity of drowning victims , many of whom have been mutilated and dismembered by the torrential floods and distorted beyond recognition as their corpses begin to deteriorate in the tropical heat . even though time is of the essence – with each day , the number of new victims continues to grow while decay begins to set in – the forensic scientists could not begin their work until the start of the new year , after receiving the go-ahead from the thai government .
with experts from 19 different nations involved in the rescue and removal operation , it was crucial to coordinate methods .
it is the first time so many victims from so many different countries needed to be identified . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a foreigner tourist looks at photographs of survivors at the damaged khao lak national park .
the most difficult work for the criminologists will be in the tourist resorts of phuket and khao lak , where a buddhist temple has been converted into a makeshift morgue .
more than 300 corpses are stacked in the temple awaiting identification .
some 20 percent are estimated to be those of foreigners . “ i fear it ’ s a very high number of german victims , ” said peter finger , spokesman for the german embassy in bangkok . identifying victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bodies of victims are covered in plastic and stacked before they can be identified according to dirk büchner , spokesman for the bka , there are three key methods for determining the identity of a victim : fingerprints , dental analysis and dna .
but each of these requires a good deal of time and depends on comparing with available sample data from relatives . “ it could be a hair , a fingerprint or the x-rays from a dentist , ” büchner said .
serial numbers from pace makers or an artificial hip could help provide information on a victim ’ s identity as do eye color , the shape of earlobes , scars or tattoos . if a victim can not be immediately identified , the forensic scientists take a sample of dna from the thigh bone and save it for later comparison .

responding to fears that corpses could be buried or cremated before the criminologists had the chance to identify them , thailand ’ s chief forensic scientist , pornthip rojanasunant , said that no foreign corpse would be deposed of before an expert had the chance to examine it . given the sheer numbers of victims and the difficulty of proving origin , the foreign teams of forensic scientists acknowledged that it would take weeks or even years before all the victims could be identified .
the thai government on sunday said that it was quite possible that many of the corpses would remain forever unidentified . 30 years experience the german identification commission was founded in 1972 after an airplane crash on the canary island of teneriffa killed 155 people , many of them german tourists .
since then the commission has been involved in more than 24 missions both in germany and abroad ; 16 of which were airplane crashes . in its three decades of experience , the team of 110 forensic scientists has so far been able to identify 1,316 disaster victims beyond a doubt .

26 , 2004 . the massive tidal waves triggered by an undersea quake in the indian ocean reduced the postcard perfect holiday destinations into a scene of death and destruction .
tens of thousands of western tourists , among them an estimated 10,000 german holidaymakers , were swept up in the chaos and devastation . many did n't survive .
about half of thailand 's estimated 5,000 dead are believed to be foreigners .
the german government has confirmed that 60 nationals are dead while the search continues for more than 1,000 missing germans . a slow path to normalcy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volunteers help wash away tidal wave debris on patong beach , thailand more than a week after the disaster , efforts are underway in thailand to restore a degree of normalcy to its battered tourism industry , the second-biggest source of revenue for the country .
clean-up work is in full swing among the damaged tourist resorts on thailand 's southwestern coastal strip and even bars and discotheques are gradually reopening . but , for german tourists who survived the harrowing tragedy like reinhard janisch , a return to normal life will take time . janisch , who is from oberhausen in germany 's ruhr region , was caught unawares by the tidal waves while vacationing on the island of phuket . " when the wave came from the back , i did n't turn round any more , " janisch said , remembering the full force of the encounter .
" i thought a car hit me from the back . " the massive wall of water pushed janisch on the ground where he was pinned between beach chairs and floating debris . " i tried to free myself ´ , " he said .
" you know , you develop strength somehow .
i do n't know why .
and then i continued on . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tourist roland linz , 36 , a survivor at the damaged khao lak-lam ru national park in thailand miraculously , janisch managed to escape with just a few cuts and bruises . " my entire knee is cut up , " he said .
" but nothing 's broken .
you know , the doctors were amazed that we got out of there without any broken bones .
you do n't feel anything at first in the water .
you could cut off your arm and you would n't notice it . " it was only when he saw the corpses of other vacationers and local people lined up in the hospital that janisch realized just how lucky he was to be alive . " born again , you can say , " he said .
" i 'm afraid and i do n't know why .
i 'm totally wiped out . " a new lease on life others suffered the terrible anxiety of not knowing the fate of their loved ones .
monika sommerfeld from neuendorf in saxony-anhalt lost her family in the flood and only found them again days later .
her son bastian was torn away by the masses of water . " all i saw was the water racing towards me , " bastian said .
" then i was up to my neck in it .
we let go , crashed into the furniture and a glass pane .
the water got higher and higher .
then i was washed through the pane and then through a flat .
there was only one window and i had to get out through that . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german survivors arrive back home at frankfurt airport while bastian and his mother got away with a fright , her husband was badly injured , monika sommerfeld said . " he was pulled along by the wall of water , " she said .
" and all the debris injured him so badly .
half his arm was ripped off and he has grave knee injuries .
the doctor here gave his ' okay ' that he should join those being flown out .
he 's already on his way to cologne . " but , despite her harrowing experiences , sommerfeld said she was filled with a strange feeling of gratitude . " some nights you wake up and start to cry because you keep seeing these horrible pictures , " she said .
" but this country -lrb- thailand -rrb- ca n't be blamed .
there 's nothing it can do about it .
there 's no one here you can blame , or say , i 'm never going to come here again . " like janisch , sommerfeld said the experience was akin to getting a new lease on life . " you need peace and quiet first , " she said .
" we can be glad to be alive .
there are worse cases here of people having lost family members .
and we can say : we 've been reborn . " " the show must go on " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a thai elephant clears debris near bang nieng beach in khao lak , thailand many of the tourists said they are also grateful to the thais .
many reported self-sacrificing help .
some tourists who were only slightly injured said they want to stay for the rest of their holidays and leave as planned . reinhard seelig from mainz was one of them . " we do want to go home now , but not so fast , " he said .
" we do n't think it makes any sense to be sitting in the airport for three or four days .
we have a nice room here .
so i 'd rather wait another week or two . " things appear to have gone back to normal in the numerous bars dotting the beaches .
some tourists even speak of wild parties with which some holidaymakers celebrated their survival . but not everyone is comfortable with the idea .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement " i will be responsible for its success or failure , " he added . the controversial package of labor market reforms known as hartz iv will have a wide-reaching impact on the lives of 4.5 million people out of work in what is still europe 's economic powerhouse .
it is impossible to tell for the moment exactly how many unemployed will lose money under the new system or who will benefit from the changes . but those expected to feel the changes hardest are the long-term jobless and the 2.7 million people who the federal labor agency says have used up their benefits and now receive only minimum welfare payments .

they put the figure at 27 percent and say 48 percent will have their income reduced . to calculate the new benefits , the federal labor agency analyzes peoples ' estate , their expenditure and their needs , which is already sparking controversy .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement " i will be responsible for its success or failure , " he added . the controversial package of labor market reforms known as hartz iv will have a wide-reaching impact on the lives of 4.5 million people out of work in what is still europe 's economic powerhouse .
it is impossible to tell for the moment exactly how many unemployed will lose money under the new system or who will benefit from the changes . but those expected to feel the changes hardest are the long-term jobless and the 2.7 million people who the federal labor agency says have used up their benefits and now receive only minimum welfare payments .

they put the figure at 27 percent and say 48 percent will have their income reduced . to calculate the new benefits , the federal labor agency analyzes peoples ' estate , their expenditure and their needs , which is already sparking controversy .

but support groups for the unemployed have criticized a move they say will make the poor poorer . other observers have called for recognition that even after the reforms are introduced , the german welfare state will be relatively generous to the unemployed .

the german government now praises the technology which has been held up for 16 months by technical flaws costing germany billions in lost revenues . the expected long traffic jams at german border crossing points failed to materialize on monday morning and highway service stations also weren ’ t crammed with truckers at stationary toll machines .
german authorities say the country ’ s satellite-based tolls system is up and running smoothly and that trucking companies have apparently been well-prepared for the start of the system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an automatic toll surveillance bridge on a german highway " all parts of the system are working flawlessly , " said felix stenschke , a spokesman for the ministry of transportation .
" at the moment there is still only little traffic on german highways but nevertheless we are completely satisfied .
one year ago the situation was quite the contrary . " earlier problems the pioneering toll system is based on satellite technology which in the past 16 months was plagued by technical problems .
the delays were a major embarrassment for toll collect – the consortium made up of automaker daimlerchrysler , deutsche telekom and french motoway operator cofiroute which developed the system . germany has europe ’ s busiest highways and is now charging an average of 12 and a half eurocents -lrb- 10 us cents -rrb- per kilometer -lrb- 0.6 miles -rrb- .
about one third of the trucks that use its 12-thousand-kilometer highway network are foreign .
transport minister manfred stolpe -lrb- photo below -rrb- said truckers in neighboring poland and the netherlands were especially well prepared on monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe " i ’ ve been surprised by two things , " he said .
" first of all the number of on-board units ordered and installed by polish and dutch companies – the two countries which in my view are best prepared for the new system .
and secondly the degree of training undergone by truckers in advance . “ hefty fines but during the first two days after the toll system began operating , the government also nabbed about 500 fee dodgers .
they neither had special on-board units in their cabins that automatically pay the tolls nor did they pay for their journeys at toll machines set up in service stations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a picture of one of the first toll dodgers the dodgers were fined € 75 -lrb- $ 101 -rrb- and face a much stiffer penalty of up to € 20,000 if they will be caught again . rüdiger petri , a spokesman for the association of german hauliers , said the toll system will also lead to higher prices for german consumers . " we ’ ve repeatedly told our customers that german haulers are unable to carry the extra costs resulting from the toll system , " he said .
" our customers accepted that and said they saw no other alternative than passing them on to product prices paid by consumers . " the german government expects about € 2.5 billion in truck toll revenues each year .
in addition , it is currently seeking billions of euros in compensation from toll collect for 16 months of lost revenues .
but economics minister wolfgang clement also hopes the state-of-the-art system will be an export hit doing away with the old-fashioned booths that still cause traffic congestions in many other european countries . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german road toll prepares for launch after a catolog of catastrophic technical faults and management blunders , germany ’ s road toll system for heavy vehicles is now scheduled for a january launch after its successful test phase ended on wednesday .

a run-off against jadranka kosor has been scheduled . on monday , official results showed croatia ’ s incumbent president had won the first round of elections , taking 49 percent of the vote compared to conservative candidate deputy prime minister kosor of the ruling croatian democratic union -lrb- hdz -rrb- , who received 20.18 percent of the ballots .
mesic ’ s take , however , was not enough to secure an outright victory , and the presidential race will go into a second round on jan .
16 , the electoral commission reported . mesic , who has his sites fixed on leading his country into the european union during the next five years , was jubilant after the results were announced .
although election precincts reported a lower than expected turnout , he said he was pleased with the outcome .
his candidacy has been endorsed by the three main center-left opposition parties who were defeated by the hdz in 2003 . the 70-year-old mesic called on all people in the former war-torn yugoslav republic to turn out in full strength for the run-off in two weeks . “ croatia must be a modern , european and democratic country with satisfied citizens , " he said .
" it will be possible only if we change many things .
we will decide where croatia is heading , to the 21st century or back in time . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voters cast their ballots at the polling station in zagreb , croatia on jan .
2 , 2005 .
about 4.4 million people , including 400,000 croats living abroad , voted .
observers believe mesic will most likely win a second term in the run-off against the more conservative kosor , who is widely seen as a close ally of prime minister ivo sanader . “ i think kosor has little chance of winning in the second round , ” analyst nenad zakosek told reuters after results were released just after midnight . a first for women kosor , who is the first woman to run for the presidency , said she was very pleased with the results of the first ballot . “ i am very happy that for the first time we have two candidates , one of which is a woman , ” she said .
“ this shows the maturity of voters since the most frequent question during the campaign was whether croatia was mature enough to have a woman for a president . ” the former journalist and deputy prime minister responsible for families and war veterans has stood by prime minister sanader and his efforts to turn the hdz from its nationalist past to a modern pro-european party . analysts , however , have criticized her campaign as lacking popular appeal and a strong political personality .
her position on the ballot was hotly contested by croatian-us businessman boris miksic , who finished third with 17.8 percent of the vote . the strong showing of miksic , an outsider on croatia ’ s political scene whose support was not expected to break out of the single digits , was described as a protest vote . ” this is a protest of croatian voters against the politics being led here , ” vesna pusic , a lawmaker with a leftist opposition party told afp . mesic and kosor both pledged a better future for croatians along the same lines – eu membership , the strengthening of the rule of law and fighting corruption . paving the way to europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatian president stipe mesic mesic , who said he was confident of winning re-election , owes much of his popularity to the role he played in ending the balkan nation ’ s international isolation and completing its democratic reforms after succeeding authoritarian leader franjo tudjman . he significantly reduced presidential powers as the country turned into a parliamentary democracy following changes in 2000 .
however , the president remains the supreme commander of the military and a co-creator of foreign policy along with the prime minister . the president will also oversee croatia ’ s entry into the european union , which is planned for 2009 .
croatia has been put on a fast track to accession with brussels deciding last month to launch membership talks in march .
zagreb hopes to fulfil membership criteria by 2007 but its bid depends on full cooperation with the un war crimes tribunal following the balkans wars of the 1990s which will be closely monitored by brussels . mesic has vowed to deliver the war crimes suspects to the international court , despite strong criticism from war veterans and nationalists . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de green lights for balkan trio the eu commission agrees to a date for romania and bulgaria to sign accession treaties and for croatia to start entry talks .

with more than 30 years experience , germany has sent its team of forensic scientists to the region . no matter where a catastrophe strikes , when germans are among its victims , the identification commission of the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- is called into action - the 1998 train disaster in eschede , the 2000 concorde crash in paris and now the tsunamis in south asia .
disasters that leave victims unrecognizable are the special focus of germany ’ s forensic science team . victims from many nations since dec .
29 , the german identification commission has been deployed to thailand where they are working around the clock to determine the identity of drowning victims , many of whom have been mutilated and dismembered by the torrential floods and distorted beyond recognition as their corpses begin to deteriorate in the tropical heat . even though time is of the essence – with each day , the number of new victims continues to grow while decay begins to set in – the forensic scientists could not begin their work until the start of the new year , after receiving the go-ahead from the thai government .
with experts from 19 different nations involved in the rescue and removal operation , it was crucial to coordinate methods .
it is the first time so many victims from so many different countries needed to be identified . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a foreigner tourist looks at photographs of survivors at the damaged khao lak national park .
the most difficult work for the criminologists will be in the tourist resorts of phuket and khao lak , where a buddhist temple has been converted into a makeshift morgue .
more than 300 corpses are stacked in the temple awaiting identification .
some 20 percent are estimated to be those of foreigners . “ i fear it ’ s a very high number of german victims , ” said peter finger , spokesman for the german embassy in bangkok . identifying victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bodies of victims are covered in plastic and stacked before they can be identified according to dirk büchner , spokesman for the bka , there are three key methods for determining the identity of a victim : fingerprints , dental analysis and dna .
but each of these requires a good deal of time and depends on comparing with available sample data from relatives . “ it could be a hair , a fingerprint or the x-rays from a dentist , ” büchner said .
serial numbers from pace makers or an artificial hip could help provide information on a victim ’ s identity as do eye color , the shape of earlobes , scars or tattoos . if a victim can not be immediately identified , the forensic scientists take a sample of dna from the thigh bone and save it for later comparison .
to keep track of individual corpses , an electronic chip is attached to the body . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pyres of victims who were killed by tidal waves burn on the beach at alappad , in the southern indian state of kerala , wednesday , dec .

in indonesia , unicef has said reports are coming in of children starting to die of pneumonia . more than 100,000 people are living in temporary shelters and camps in indonesia alone , many suffering from diarrhea , fever , respiratory infections and stomach problems . european casualties europeans are bracing for the grim prospect that thousands of their nationals vacationing in the stricken areas may never come home . in sweden , finland and norway , which between them account for 87 confirmed dead and 4,700 missing , the loss of european life was being felt most keenly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german survivors of the asian disater return home the number of germans confirmed dead rose to 60 and well over 1,000 were still missing , foreign ministry state secretary klaus scharioth told reporters in berlin on sunday .
he warned that " there was no reason for any great optimism " that the missing would ever be found .
he has asked relatives to supply dna samples rather than photographs as this could be the only means of identification . scharioth said foreign minister joschka fischer plans to travel to the disaster area this week to see the situation there for himself . other european countries were also counting their dead .
italy has confirmed 18 dead but a further 660 are missing , mainly in thailand , while france said its death toll would probably exceed 150 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 03.01.2005 a gruesome task for criminologists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many bodies will never be identified in the wake of last week ’ s tsunamis , some 300 experts are working around the clock to identify victims .
with more than 30 years experience , germany has sent its team of forensic scientists to the region . no matter where a catastrophe strikes , when germans are among its victims , the identification commission of the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- is called into action - the 1998 train disaster in eschede , the 2000 concorde crash in paris and now the tsunamis in south asia .
disasters that leave victims unrecognizable are the special focus of germany ’ s forensic science team . victims from many nations since dec .
29 , the german identification commission has been deployed to thailand where they are working around the clock to determine the identity of drowning victims , many of whom have been mutilated and dismembered by the torrential floods and distorted beyond recognition as their corpses begin to deteriorate in the tropical heat . even though time is of the essence – with each day , the number of new victims continues to grow while decay begins to set in – the forensic scientists could not begin their work until the start of the new year , after receiving the go-ahead from the thai government .
with experts from 19 different nations involved in the rescue and removal operation , it was crucial to coordinate methods .
it is the first time so many victims from so many different countries needed to be identified . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a foreigner tourist looks at photographs of survivors at the damaged khao lak national park .
the most difficult work for the criminologists will be in the tourist resorts of phuket and khao lak , where a buddhist temple has been converted into a makeshift morgue .
more than 300 corpses are stacked in the temple awaiting identification .
some 20 percent are estimated to be those of foreigners . “ i fear it ’ s a very high number of german victims , ” said peter finger , spokesman for the german embassy in bangkok . identifying victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bodies of victims are covered in plastic and stacked before they can be identified according to dirk büchner , spokesman for the bka , there are three key methods for determining the identity of a victim : fingerprints , dental analysis and dna .
but each of these requires a good deal of time and depends on comparing with available sample data from relatives . “ it could be a hair , a fingerprint or the x-rays from a dentist , ” büchner said .
serial numbers from pace makers or an artificial hip could help provide information on a victim ’ s identity as do eye color , the shape of earlobes , scars or tattoos . if a victim can not be immediately identified , the forensic scientists take a sample of dna from the thigh bone and save it for later comparison .
to keep track of individual corpses , an electronic chip is attached to the body . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pyres of victims who were killed by tidal waves burn on the beach at alappad , in the southern indian state of kerala , wednesday , dec .
29 , 2004 .
responding to fears that corpses could be buried or cremated before the criminologists had the chance to identify them , thailand ’ s chief forensic scientist , pornthip rojanasunant , said that no foreign corpse would be deposed of before an expert had the chance to examine it . given the sheer numbers of victims and the difficulty of proving origin , the foreign teams of forensic scientists acknowledged that it would take weeks or even years before all the victims could be identified .
the thai government on sunday said that it was quite possible that many of the corpses would remain forever unidentified . 30 years experience the german identification commission was founded in 1972 after an airplane crash on the canary island of teneriffa killed 155 people , many of them german tourists .
since then the commission has been involved in more than 24 missions both in germany and abroad ; 16 of which were airplane crashes . in its three decades of experience , the team of 110 forensic scientists has so far been able to identify 1,316 disaster victims beyond a doubt .
working largely on a voluntary basis in a psychologically demanding field , the criminologists cooperate closely with forensic specialists throughout germany . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tsunamis claim nearly 140,000 lives so far the confirmed death toll from the tsunami that hit asian coastlines is still rising more than a week after the disaster even as a massive multinational relief operation gathers pace .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement " i will be responsible for its success or failure , " he added . the controversial package of labor market reforms known as hartz iv will have a wide-reaching impact on the lives of 4.5 million people out of work in what is still europe 's economic powerhouse .
it is impossible to tell for the moment exactly how many unemployed will lose money under the new system or who will benefit from the changes . but those expected to feel the changes hardest are the long-term jobless and the 2.7 million people who the federal labor agency says have used up their benefits and now receive only minimum welfare payments .
the agency says less than 10 percent will lose their welfare payments altogether , a figure the unions reject .
they put the figure at 27 percent and say 48 percent will have their income reduced . to calculate the new benefits , the federal labor agency analyzes peoples ' estate , their expenditure and their needs , which is already sparking controversy .
generous system the government argues that overhauling germany 's generous social welfare system - once envied throughout the world - will persuade people who have been out of work for more than a year to accept a job , no matter how low paid .
but support groups for the unemployed have criticized a move they say will make the poor poorer . other observers have called for recognition that even after the reforms are introduced , the german welfare state will be relatively generous to the unemployed .
for example , the point at which the value of an unemployed person 's residential property is taken into consideration is € 200,000 -lrb- $ 270,000 -rrb- and only 9 percent of homes in western germany and three percent in eastern germany are valued higher . bildunterschrift : few protestors gathered outside a labor office in the western german town of duisburg on tuesday monday 's protests came in the wake of demonstrations last year which were held for weeks on mondays , similar to rallies which brought down former east germany 's communist regime in 1989 .
anti-hartz iv monday protests eventually fizzled out but widespread unease with the reform translated into severe electoral blows for chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de one euro , one way out of unemployment ?

as the population mourns , the government in stockholm has come under fire for its handling of the catastrophe . instead of a spectacular fireworks display , distraught swedes ushered in the new year with a national day of mourning and candle-lit vigils . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thai rescue workers carry a body from the beach in khao lak around 20,000 swedes were on holiday in thailand when the indian ocean tsunami struck on dec .
26 , 2004 . with over 1,000 feared casualties , sweden may be the european country worst hit by the disaster . on sunday , swedish state secretary hans dahlgren revised downwards the figure from an initial total of 3,686 swedes missing in the region affected by the tsunami , to 2,915 .
ongoing double-checks of reports about swedes believed missing had enabled authorities to shorten the list by over 20 percent , dahlgren said . the government also revised the confirmed death toll to 52 swedes , from 59 earlier , but reiterated that it was expected to rise . national trauma there remains little doubt that the south asian tragedy has turned into a national trauma for the scandinavian country of nine million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish prime minister göran persson last week prime minister göran persson attempted to brace his country , unused to such large-scale loss of lives , for the worst . " it 's a catastrophe of enormous dimensions , the worst in our times .
the number of injured and dead will rise dramatically , " persson warned .
" we must rally together and support each other .
this will affect our lives for a long time to come . " coffins are scheduled to begin arriving this week as many of the recovered bodies still await dna analysis for identification . harrowing experiences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish tourists line up to check in for a flight home at phuket international airport meanwhile , hundreds of stunned and skimpily-clad swedish holidaymakers have been arriving daily in airports around sweden .
most of them are still in shock and traumatized as they try to come to grips with the disaster that many only narrowly survived . one of them , daniel haag , who landed at stockholm 's arlanda airport , recalled the first moments when tragedy struck . " i woke up just as my hotel room filled with water , " haag said .
" i was under water for almost a minute before i came up again .
i managed to catch on to the trunk of a car that was floating in the debris and heave myself up , " he said .
" and then i ran for my life . " the extraordinarily high number of swedish tourists in thailand is blamed on the weather , with many wishing to leave the nordic realms to escape the dark winter cold for sunnier locations . in total , some 4,500 people from sweden , norway , denmark and finland are missing . search for the missing however , the search for the missing has been hampered by the widespread destruction wrought by the tidal waves in the region . even as mass graves are dug in the face of fast-decomposing corpses , officials warn that all the bodies of the tourists may never be recovered because many could be washed out to sea . on sunday , persson 's government pushed for another search of the andaman sea coastline by thai and japanese navy vessels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a thai elephant clears debris near bang nieng beach in khao lak , thailand elephants have also joined the search for bodies in the popular khao lak tourist paradise in thailand , heading into debris-strewn forests with rescue teams to retrieve corpses where heavy earth-moving equipment can not go . government faces flak even as sweden reels from the disaster , prime minister persson and his center-left social democrats face scathing criticism for what many regard as failure to take prompt action following the tragedy . foreign minister laila freivalds and foreign aid minister carin jamtin have admitted that the government waited too long - four full days after the disaster took place - to send planes outfitted with doctors and medical supplies to the aid of citizens stranded in thailand . eight out of ten respondents to an internet poll of 5,289 people conducted by swedish daily svenska dagbladet said the government had mismanaged the crisis . lack of disaster management ? many have also drawn parallels to sweden 's last big tragedy 10 years ago , when 551 swedes died as the " estonia " ferry sank off the baltic coast .
at the time a committee investigating swedish rescue efforts after the sinking of the estonia recommended setting up a national disaster management system . but , that still has n't happened .
" i would have hoped that one would have drawn lessons from the estonia tragedy , " said kent härstedt , a social democratic parliamentarian .
" actually , there should have been a commissioner for such catastrophes and an authority that coordinates everything . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl nilsson of lulo , sweden , poses with a sigh saying his parent and brothers are missing in phuket , thailand .
but persson 's government has rejected the accusations . " we decided against a big authority for disaster management because it would only work in times of crisis and have nothing to do in normal times , " lars danielsson , a member of persson 's cabinet said . " instead we 're relying on existing mechanisms which are much more effective , " he added .

26 , 2004 . the massive tidal waves triggered by an undersea quake in the indian ocean reduced the postcard perfect holiday destinations into a scene of death and destruction .
tens of thousands of western tourists , among them an estimated 10,000 german holidaymakers , were swept up in the chaos and devastation . many did n't survive .
about half of thailand 's estimated 5,000 dead are believed to be foreigners .
the german government has confirmed that 60 nationals are dead while the search continues for more than 1,000 missing germans . a slow path to normalcy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volunteers help wash away tidal wave debris on patong beach , thailand more than a week after the disaster , efforts are underway in thailand to restore a degree of normalcy to its battered tourism industry , the second-biggest source of revenue for the country .
clean-up work is in full swing among the damaged tourist resorts on thailand 's southwestern coastal strip and even bars and discotheques are gradually reopening . but , for german tourists who survived the harrowing tragedy like reinhard janisch , a return to normal life will take time . janisch , who is from oberhausen in germany 's ruhr region , was caught unawares by the tidal waves while vacationing on the island of phuket . " when the wave came from the back , i did n't turn round any more , " janisch said , remembering the full force of the encounter .
" i thought a car hit me from the back . " the massive wall of water pushed janisch on the ground where he was pinned between beach chairs and floating debris . " i tried to free myself ´ , " he said .
" you know , you develop strength somehow .
i do n't know why .
and then i continued on . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tourist roland linz , 36 , a survivor at the damaged khao lak-lam ru national park in thailand miraculously , janisch managed to escape with just a few cuts and bruises . " my entire knee is cut up , " he said .
" but nothing 's broken .
you know , the doctors were amazed that we got out of there without any broken bones .
you do n't feel anything at first in the water .
you could cut off your arm and you would n't notice it . " it was only when he saw the corpses of other vacationers and local people lined up in the hospital that janisch realized just how lucky he was to be alive . " born again , you can say , " he said .
" i 'm afraid and i do n't know why .
i 'm totally wiped out . " a new lease on life others suffered the terrible anxiety of not knowing the fate of their loved ones .
monika sommerfeld from neuendorf in saxony-anhalt lost her family in the flood and only found them again days later .
her son bastian was torn away by the masses of water . " all i saw was the water racing towards me , " bastian said .
" then i was up to my neck in it .
we let go , crashed into the furniture and a glass pane .
the water got higher and higher .
then i was washed through the pane and then through a flat .
there was only one window and i had to get out through that . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german survivors arrive back home at frankfurt airport while bastian and his mother got away with a fright , her husband was badly injured , monika sommerfeld said . " he was pulled along by the wall of water , " she said .
" and all the debris injured him so badly .
half his arm was ripped off and he has grave knee injuries .
the doctor here gave his ' okay ' that he should join those being flown out .
he 's already on his way to cologne . " but , despite her harrowing experiences , sommerfeld said she was filled with a strange feeling of gratitude . " some nights you wake up and start to cry because you keep seeing these horrible pictures , " she said .
" but this country -lrb- thailand -rrb- ca n't be blamed .
there 's nothing it can do about it .
there 's no one here you can blame , or say , i 'm never going to come here again . " like janisch , sommerfeld said the experience was akin to getting a new lease on life . " you need peace and quiet first , " she said .
" we can be glad to be alive .
there are worse cases here of people having lost family members .
and we can say : we 've been reborn . " " the show must go on " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a thai elephant clears debris near bang nieng beach in khao lak , thailand many of the tourists said they are also grateful to the thais .
many reported self-sacrificing help .
some tourists who were only slightly injured said they want to stay for the rest of their holidays and leave as planned . reinhard seelig from mainz was one of them . " we do want to go home now , but not so fast , " he said .
" we do n't think it makes any sense to be sitting in the airport for three or four days .
we have a nice room here .
so i 'd rather wait another week or two . " things appear to have gone back to normal in the numerous bars dotting the beaches .
some tourists even speak of wild parties with which some holidaymakers celebrated their survival . but not everyone is comfortable with the idea .

26 , 2004 . the massive tidal waves triggered by an undersea quake in the indian ocean reduced the postcard perfect holiday destinations into a scene of death and destruction .
tens of thousands of western tourists , among them an estimated 10,000 german holidaymakers , were swept up in the chaos and devastation . many did n't survive .
about half of thailand 's estimated 5,000 dead are believed to be foreigners .

clean-up work is in full swing among the damaged tourist resorts on thailand 's southwestern coastal strip and even bars and discotheques are gradually reopening . but , for german tourists who survived the harrowing tragedy like reinhard janisch , a return to normal life will take time . janisch , who is from oberhausen in germany 's ruhr region , was caught unawares by the tidal waves while vacationing on the island of phuket . " when the wave came from the back , i did n't turn round any more , " janisch said , remembering the full force of the encounter .
" i thought a car hit me from the back . " the massive wall of water pushed janisch on the ground where he was pinned between beach chairs and floating debris . " i tried to free myself ´ , " he said .
" you know , you develop strength somehow .
i do n't know why .

you know , the doctors were amazed that we got out of there without any broken bones .
you do n't feel anything at first in the water .
you could cut off your arm and you would n't notice it . " it was only when he saw the corpses of other vacationers and local people lined up in the hospital that janisch realized just how lucky he was to be alive . " born again , you can say , " he said .
" i 'm afraid and i do n't know why .
i 'm totally wiped out . " a new lease on life others suffered the terrible anxiety of not knowing the fate of their loved ones .
monika sommerfeld from neuendorf in saxony-anhalt lost her family in the flood and only found them again days later .
her son bastian was torn away by the masses of water . " all i saw was the water racing towards me , " bastian said .
" then i was up to my neck in it .

the water got higher and higher .

half his arm was ripped off and he has grave knee injuries .
the doctor here gave his ' okay ' that he should join those being flown out .
he 's already on his way to cologne . " but , despite her harrowing experiences , sommerfeld said she was filled with a strange feeling of gratitude . " some nights you wake up and start to cry because you keep seeing these horrible pictures , " she said .
" but this country -lrb- thailand -rrb- ca n't be blamed .
there 's nothing it can do about it .
there 's no one here you can blame , or say , i 'm never going to come here again . " like janisch , sommerfeld said the experience was akin to getting a new lease on life . " you need peace and quiet first , " she said .

26 , 2004 . the massive tidal waves triggered by an undersea quake in the indian ocean reduced the postcard perfect holiday destinations into a scene of death and destruction .
tens of thousands of western tourists , among them an estimated 10,000 german holidaymakers , were swept up in the chaos and devastation . many did n't survive .
about half of thailand 's estimated 5,000 dead are believed to be foreigners .
the german government has confirmed that 60 nationals are dead while the search continues for more than 1,000 missing germans . a slow path to normalcy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volunteers help wash away tidal wave debris on patong beach , thailand more than a week after the disaster , efforts are underway in thailand to restore a degree of normalcy to its battered tourism industry , the second-biggest source of revenue for the country .

as the population mourns , the government in stockholm has come under fire for its handling of the catastrophe . instead of a spectacular fireworks display , distraught swedes ushered in the new year with a national day of mourning and candle-lit vigils . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thai rescue workers carry a body from the beach in khao lak around 20,000 swedes were on holiday in thailand when the indian ocean tsunami struck on dec .
26 , 2004 . with over 1,000 feared casualties , sweden may be the european country worst hit by the disaster . on sunday , swedish state secretary hans dahlgren revised downwards the figure from an initial total of 3,686 swedes missing in the region affected by the tsunami , to 2,915 .
ongoing double-checks of reports about swedes believed missing had enabled authorities to shorten the list by over 20 percent , dahlgren said . the government also revised the confirmed death toll to 52 swedes , from 59 earlier , but reiterated that it was expected to rise . national trauma there remains little doubt that the south asian tragedy has turned into a national trauma for the scandinavian country of nine million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish prime minister göran persson last week prime minister göran persson attempted to brace his country , unused to such large-scale loss of lives , for the worst . " it 's a catastrophe of enormous dimensions , the worst in our times .
the number of injured and dead will rise dramatically , " persson warned .
" we must rally together and support each other .
this will affect our lives for a long time to come . " coffins are scheduled to begin arriving this week as many of the recovered bodies still await dna analysis for identification . harrowing experiences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish tourists line up to check in for a flight home at phuket international airport meanwhile , hundreds of stunned and skimpily-clad swedish holidaymakers have been arriving daily in airports around sweden .
most of them are still in shock and traumatized as they try to come to grips with the disaster that many only narrowly survived . one of them , daniel haag , who landed at stockholm 's arlanda airport , recalled the first moments when tragedy struck . " i woke up just as my hotel room filled with water , " haag said .
" i was under water for almost a minute before i came up again .
i managed to catch on to the trunk of a car that was floating in the debris and heave myself up , " he said .
" and then i ran for my life . " the extraordinarily high number of swedish tourists in thailand is blamed on the weather , with many wishing to leave the nordic realms to escape the dark winter cold for sunnier locations . in total , some 4,500 people from sweden , norway , denmark and finland are missing . search for the missing however , the search for the missing has been hampered by the widespread destruction wrought by the tidal waves in the region . even as mass graves are dug in the face of fast-decomposing corpses , officials warn that all the bodies of the tourists may never be recovered because many could be washed out to sea . on sunday , persson 's government pushed for another search of the andaman sea coastline by thai and japanese navy vessels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a thai elephant clears debris near bang nieng beach in khao lak , thailand elephants have also joined the search for bodies in the popular khao lak tourist paradise in thailand , heading into debris-strewn forests with rescue teams to retrieve corpses where heavy earth-moving equipment can not go . government faces flak even as sweden reels from the disaster , prime minister persson and his center-left social democrats face scathing criticism for what many regard as failure to take prompt action following the tragedy . foreign minister laila freivalds and foreign aid minister carin jamtin have admitted that the government waited too long - four full days after the disaster took place - to send planes outfitted with doctors and medical supplies to the aid of citizens stranded in thailand . eight out of ten respondents to an internet poll of 5,289 people conducted by swedish daily svenska dagbladet said the government had mismanaged the crisis . lack of disaster management ? many have also drawn parallels to sweden 's last big tragedy 10 years ago , when 551 swedes died as the " estonia " ferry sank off the baltic coast .
at the time a committee investigating swedish rescue efforts after the sinking of the estonia recommended setting up a national disaster management system . but , that still has n't happened .
" i would have hoped that one would have drawn lessons from the estonia tragedy , " said kent härstedt , a social democratic parliamentarian .
" actually , there should have been a commissioner for such catastrophes and an authority that coordinates everything . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl nilsson of lulo , sweden , poses with a sigh saying his parent and brothers are missing in phuket , thailand .
but persson 's government has rejected the accusations . " we decided against a big authority for disaster management because it would only work in times of crisis and have nothing to do in normal times , " lars danielsson , a member of persson 's cabinet said . " instead we 're relying on existing mechanisms which are much more effective , " he added .
" the only drawback is that it sometimes takes a little longer until all measures are in place .

a run-off against jadranka kosor has been scheduled . on monday , official results showed croatia ’ s incumbent president had won the first round of elections , taking 49 percent of the vote compared to conservative candidate deputy prime minister kosor of the ruling croatian democratic union -lrb- hdz -rrb- , who received 20.18 percent of the ballots .
mesic ’ s take , however , was not enough to secure an outright victory , and the presidential race will go into a second round on jan .
16 , the electoral commission reported . mesic , who has his sites fixed on leading his country into the european union during the next five years , was jubilant after the results were announced .
although election precincts reported a lower than expected turnout , he said he was pleased with the outcome .
his candidacy has been endorsed by the three main center-left opposition parties who were defeated by the hdz in 2003 . the 70-year-old mesic called on all people in the former war-torn yugoslav republic to turn out in full strength for the run-off in two weeks . “ croatia must be a modern , european and democratic country with satisfied citizens , " he said .
" it will be possible only if we change many things .
we will decide where croatia is heading , to the 21st century or back in time . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voters cast their ballots at the polling station in zagreb , croatia on jan .
2 , 2005 .
about 4.4 million people , including 400,000 croats living abroad , voted .
observers believe mesic will most likely win a second term in the run-off against the more conservative kosor , who is widely seen as a close ally of prime minister ivo sanader . “ i think kosor has little chance of winning in the second round , ” analyst nenad zakosek told reuters after results were released just after midnight . a first for women kosor , who is the first woman to run for the presidency , said she was very pleased with the results of the first ballot . “ i am very happy that for the first time we have two candidates , one of which is a woman , ” she said .
“ this shows the maturity of voters since the most frequent question during the campaign was whether croatia was mature enough to have a woman for a president . ” the former journalist and deputy prime minister responsible for families and war veterans has stood by prime minister sanader and his efforts to turn the hdz from its nationalist past to a modern pro-european party . analysts , however , have criticized her campaign as lacking popular appeal and a strong political personality .
her position on the ballot was hotly contested by croatian-us businessman boris miksic , who finished third with 17.8 percent of the vote . the strong showing of miksic , an outsider on croatia ’ s political scene whose support was not expected to break out of the single digits , was described as a protest vote . ” this is a protest of croatian voters against the politics being led here , ” vesna pusic , a lawmaker with a leftist opposition party told afp . mesic and kosor both pledged a better future for croatians along the same lines – eu membership , the strengthening of the rule of law and fighting corruption . paving the way to europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatian president stipe mesic mesic , who said he was confident of winning re-election , owes much of his popularity to the role he played in ending the balkan nation ’ s international isolation and completing its democratic reforms after succeeding authoritarian leader franjo tudjman . he significantly reduced presidential powers as the country turned into a parliamentary democracy following changes in 2000 .
however , the president remains the supreme commander of the military and a co-creator of foreign policy along with the prime minister . the president will also oversee croatia ’ s entry into the european union , which is planned for 2009 .
croatia has been put on a fast track to accession with brussels deciding last month to launch membership talks in march .
zagreb hopes to fulfil membership criteria by 2007 but its bid depends on full cooperation with the un war crimes tribunal following the balkans wars of the 1990s which will be closely monitored by brussels . mesic has vowed to deliver the war crimes suspects to the international court , despite strong criticism from war veterans and nationalists . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de green lights for balkan trio the eu commission agrees to a date for romania and bulgaria to sign accession treaties and for croatia to start entry talks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.01.2005 croatian presidential race enters run-off großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatian president stipe mesic hopes for another five years croatia ’ s pro-western president stipe mesic narrowly missed victory on sunday , falling just below the 50-percent mark needed to win re-election outright .
a run-off against jadranka kosor has been scheduled . on monday , official results showed croatia ’ s incumbent president had won the first round of elections , taking 49 percent of the vote compared to conservative candidate deputy prime minister kosor of the ruling croatian democratic union -lrb- hdz -rrb- , who received 20.18 percent of the ballots .
mesic ’ s take , however , was not enough to secure an outright victory , and the presidential race will go into a second round on jan .
16 , the electoral commission reported . mesic , who has his sites fixed on leading his country into the european union during the next five years , was jubilant after the results were announced .
although election precincts reported a lower than expected turnout , he said he was pleased with the outcome .
his candidacy has been endorsed by the three main center-left opposition parties who were defeated by the hdz in 2003 . the 70-year-old mesic called on all people in the former war-torn yugoslav republic to turn out in full strength for the run-off in two weeks . “ croatia must be a modern , european and democratic country with satisfied citizens , " he said .
" it will be possible only if we change many things .
we will decide where croatia is heading , to the 21st century or back in time . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voters cast their ballots at the polling station in zagreb , croatia on jan .
2 , 2005 .
about 4.4 million people , including 400,000 croats living abroad , voted .
observers believe mesic will most likely win a second term in the run-off against the more conservative kosor , who is widely seen as a close ally of prime minister ivo sanader . “ i think kosor has little chance of winning in the second round , ” analyst nenad zakosek told reuters after results were released just after midnight . a first for women kosor , who is the first woman to run for the presidency , said she was very pleased with the results of the first ballot . “ i am very happy that for the first time we have two candidates , one of which is a woman , ” she said .
“ this shows the maturity of voters since the most frequent question during the campaign was whether croatia was mature enough to have a woman for a president . ” the former journalist and deputy prime minister responsible for families and war veterans has stood by prime minister sanader and his efforts to turn the hdz from its nationalist past to a modern pro-european party . analysts , however , have criticized her campaign as lacking popular appeal and a strong political personality .
her position on the ballot was hotly contested by croatian-us businessman boris miksic , who finished third with 17.8 percent of the vote . the strong showing of miksic , an outsider on croatia ’ s political scene whose support was not expected to break out of the single digits , was described as a protest vote . ” this is a protest of croatian voters against the politics being led here , ” vesna pusic , a lawmaker with a leftist opposition party told afp . mesic and kosor both pledged a better future for croatians along the same lines – eu membership , the strengthening of the rule of law and fighting corruption . paving the way to europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatian president stipe mesic mesic , who said he was confident of winning re-election , owes much of his popularity to the role he played in ending the balkan nation ’ s international isolation and completing its democratic reforms after succeeding authoritarian leader franjo tudjman . he significantly reduced presidential powers as the country turned into a parliamentary democracy following changes in 2000 .
however , the president remains the supreme commander of the military and a co-creator of foreign policy along with the prime minister . the president will also oversee croatia ’ s entry into the european union , which is planned for 2009 .
croatia has been put on a fast track to accession with brussels deciding last month to launch membership talks in march .
zagreb hopes to fulfil membership criteria by 2007 but its bid depends on full cooperation with the un war crimes tribunal following the balkans wars of the 1990s which will be closely monitored by brussels . mesic has vowed to deliver the war crimes suspects to the international court , despite strong criticism from war veterans and nationalists . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de green lights for balkan trio the eu commission agrees to a date for romania and bulgaria to sign accession treaties and for croatia to start entry talks .

3 , he was most feted for his work as the architect of modern china . the birthplace of china 's future architectural landmarks is the modest headquarters of von gerkan , marg , and partners -lrb- gmp -rrb- , overlooking the elbe river in hamburg , germany .
in addition to churches and two trade fair centers , the company is working on the ambitious luchao harbor city , a seaport for 300,000 inhabitants near shanghai . not long ago , gmp also won the competition to build a " grand theater " in qingdao , china .
now , they 'll be the ones to erect a cultural complex with three auditoriums for 3,300 audience members .
and until 2007 , the german firm will also be working on another prestige project - china 's new national museum in beijing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg architect meinhard von gerkan " we try to boil every design down to a few core questions , in order to find the most natural answer , " said von gerkan when asked to characterize his company 's concept . this approach is n't only evident in china but also in germany , von gerkan 's home .
lübeck 's congress hall , the new airports in hamburg and stuttgart , berlin 's new lehrter train station and dresdner bank office , or the new lecture halls for the technical university in chemnitz - despite plentiful use of steel and glass , meinhard von gerkan 's buildings never seem cold .
his work is a combination of timeless , modern elements and subtle , contemporary concessions . bildunterschrift : lecture halls at the technical university in chemnitz ; plan for a new football stadium in munich humble beginnings von gerkan was born in the latvian capital , riga , but after fleeing the east , grew up as an orphan with a foster family in hamburg .
he first studied law and then physics before switching to architecture . as students , von gerkan and his future partner volkwin marg began winning design competitions for other architects .
that laid the foundation for the success of their company , gmp .
forty years ago , the pair won the competition to design berlin 's tegel airport , and since then , they 've collected more than 160 top prizes . under marg 's direction , the firm completed down-to-earth projects like hamburg 's hanse-viertel downtown district , or the neue messe trade fair center in leipzig .
in contrast , von gerkan always pursued the novel .
today , the pair employ around 300 staff at their " idea factory , " which has several subsidiaries in addition to the hamburg headquarters . bildunterschrift : meinhard von gerkan , luchao harbor city in reality , von gerkan is n't a " star architect , " but rather , he 's known for being publicity-shy .
still , he is noticeably proud of gmp 's success in china .
the new national museum in beijing will have the dimensions of a giant congress hall - larger than three football fields . " we have to have something to set against the adjoining gigantic open space of tiananmen square , " von gerkan said .
with analogies to historic temple architecture , his plan attempts to meld the old and the new .

the german government now praises the technology which has been held up for 16 months by technical flaws costing germany billions in lost revenues . the expected long traffic jams at german border crossing points failed to materialize on monday morning and highway service stations also weren ’ t crammed with truckers at stationary toll machines .
german authorities say the country ’ s satellite-based tolls system is up and running smoothly and that trucking companies have apparently been well-prepared for the start of the system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an automatic toll surveillance bridge on a german highway " all parts of the system are working flawlessly , " said felix stenschke , a spokesman for the ministry of transportation .
" at the moment there is still only little traffic on german highways but nevertheless we are completely satisfied .
one year ago the situation was quite the contrary . " earlier problems the pioneering toll system is based on satellite technology which in the past 16 months was plagued by technical problems .
the delays were a major embarrassment for toll collect – the consortium made up of automaker daimlerchrysler , deutsche telekom and french motoway operator cofiroute which developed the system . germany has europe ’ s busiest highways and is now charging an average of 12 and a half eurocents -lrb- 10 us cents -rrb- per kilometer -lrb- 0.6 miles -rrb- .
about one third of the trucks that use its 12-thousand-kilometer highway network are foreign .
transport minister manfred stolpe -lrb- photo below -rrb- said truckers in neighboring poland and the netherlands were especially well prepared on monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe " i ’ ve been surprised by two things , " he said .
" first of all the number of on-board units ordered and installed by polish and dutch companies – the two countries which in my view are best prepared for the new system .

in addition to churches and two trade fair centers , the company is working on the ambitious luchao harbor city , a seaport for 300,000 inhabitants near shanghai . not long ago , gmp also won the competition to build a " grand theater " in qingdao , china .

lübeck 's congress hall , the new airports in hamburg and stuttgart , berlin 's new lehrter train station and dresdner bank office , or the new lecture halls for the technical university in chemnitz - despite plentiful use of steel and glass , meinhard von gerkan 's buildings never seem cold .

he first studied law and then physics before switching to architecture . as students , von gerkan and his future partner volkwin marg began winning design competitions for other architects .
that laid the foundation for the success of their company , gmp .
forty years ago , the pair won the competition to design berlin 's tegel airport , and since then , they 've collected more than 160 top prizes . under marg 's direction , the firm completed down-to-earth projects like hamburg 's hanse-viertel downtown district , or the neue messe trade fair center in leipzig .
in contrast , von gerkan always pursued the novel .
today , the pair employ around 300 staff at their " idea factory , " which has several subsidiaries in addition to the hamburg headquarters . bildunterschrift : meinhard von gerkan , luchao harbor city in reality , von gerkan is n't a " star architect , " but rather , he 's known for being publicity-shy .
still , he is noticeably proud of gmp 's success in china .
the new national museum in beijing will have the dimensions of a giant congress hall - larger than three football fields . " we have to have something to set against the adjoining gigantic open space of tiananmen square , " von gerkan said .
with analogies to historic temple architecture , his plan attempts to meld the old and the new .

as the population mourns , the government in stockholm has come under fire for its handling of the catastrophe . instead of a spectacular fireworks display , distraught swedes ushered in the new year with a national day of mourning and candle-lit vigils . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thai rescue workers carry a body from the beach in khao lak around 20,000 swedes were on holiday in thailand when the indian ocean tsunami struck on dec .
26 , 2004 . with over 1,000 feared casualties , sweden may be the european country worst hit by the disaster . on sunday , swedish state secretary hans dahlgren revised downwards the figure from an initial total of 3,686 swedes missing in the region affected by the tsunami , to 2,915 .
ongoing double-checks of reports about swedes believed missing had enabled authorities to shorten the list by over 20 percent , dahlgren said . the government also revised the confirmed death toll to 52 swedes , from 59 earlier , but reiterated that it was expected to rise . national trauma there remains little doubt that the south asian tragedy has turned into a national trauma for the scandinavian country of nine million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish prime minister göran persson last week prime minister göran persson attempted to brace his country , unused to such large-scale loss of lives , for the worst . " it 's a catastrophe of enormous dimensions , the worst in our times .
the number of injured and dead will rise dramatically , " persson warned .
" we must rally together and support each other .
this will affect our lives for a long time to come . " coffins are scheduled to begin arriving this week as many of the recovered bodies still await dna analysis for identification . harrowing experiences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish tourists line up to check in for a flight home at phuket international airport meanwhile , hundreds of stunned and skimpily-clad swedish holidaymakers have been arriving daily in airports around sweden .
most of them are still in shock and traumatized as they try to come to grips with the disaster that many only narrowly survived . one of them , daniel haag , who landed at stockholm 's arlanda airport , recalled the first moments when tragedy struck . " i woke up just as my hotel room filled with water , " haag said .
" i was under water for almost a minute before i came up again .
i managed to catch on to the trunk of a car that was floating in the debris and heave myself up , " he said .
" and then i ran for my life . " the extraordinarily high number of swedish tourists in thailand is blamed on the weather , with many wishing to leave the nordic realms to escape the dark winter cold for sunnier locations . in total , some 4,500 people from sweden , norway , denmark and finland are missing . search for the missing however , the search for the missing has been hampered by the widespread destruction wrought by the tidal waves in the region . even as mass graves are dug in the face of fast-decomposing corpses , officials warn that all the bodies of the tourists may never be recovered because many could be washed out to sea . on sunday , persson 's government pushed for another search of the andaman sea coastline by thai and japanese navy vessels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a thai elephant clears debris near bang nieng beach in khao lak , thailand elephants have also joined the search for bodies in the popular khao lak tourist paradise in thailand , heading into debris-strewn forests with rescue teams to retrieve corpses where heavy earth-moving equipment can not go . government faces flak even as sweden reels from the disaster , prime minister persson and his center-left social democrats face scathing criticism for what many regard as failure to take prompt action following the tragedy . foreign minister laila freivalds and foreign aid minister carin jamtin have admitted that the government waited too long - four full days after the disaster took place - to send planes outfitted with doctors and medical supplies to the aid of citizens stranded in thailand . eight out of ten respondents to an internet poll of 5,289 people conducted by swedish daily svenska dagbladet said the government had mismanaged the crisis . lack of disaster management ? many have also drawn parallels to sweden 's last big tragedy 10 years ago , when 551 swedes died as the " estonia " ferry sank off the baltic coast .
at the time a committee investigating swedish rescue efforts after the sinking of the estonia recommended setting up a national disaster management system . but , that still has n't happened .
" i would have hoped that one would have drawn lessons from the estonia tragedy , " said kent härstedt , a social democratic parliamentarian .
" actually , there should have been a commissioner for such catastrophes and an authority that coordinates everything . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl nilsson of lulo , sweden , poses with a sigh saying his parent and brothers are missing in phuket , thailand .
but persson 's government has rejected the accusations . " we decided against a big authority for disaster management because it would only work in times of crisis and have nothing to do in normal times , " lars danielsson , a member of persson 's cabinet said . " instead we 're relying on existing mechanisms which are much more effective , " he added .
" the only drawback is that it sometimes takes a little longer until all measures are in place .

26 , 2004 . the massive tidal waves triggered by an undersea quake in the indian ocean reduced the postcard perfect holiday destinations into a scene of death and destruction .
tens of thousands of western tourists , among them an estimated 10,000 german holidaymakers , were swept up in the chaos and devastation . many did n't survive .
about half of thailand 's estimated 5,000 dead are believed to be foreigners .
the german government has confirmed that 60 nationals are dead while the search continues for more than 1,000 missing germans . a slow path to normalcy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volunteers help wash away tidal wave debris on patong beach , thailand more than a week after the disaster , efforts are underway in thailand to restore a degree of normalcy to its battered tourism industry , the second-biggest source of revenue for the country .
clean-up work is in full swing among the damaged tourist resorts on thailand 's southwestern coastal strip and even bars and discotheques are gradually reopening . but , for german tourists who survived the harrowing tragedy like reinhard janisch , a return to normal life will take time . janisch , who is from oberhausen in germany 's ruhr region , was caught unawares by the tidal waves while vacationing on the island of phuket . " when the wave came from the back , i did n't turn round any more , " janisch said , remembering the full force of the encounter .
" i thought a car hit me from the back . " the massive wall of water pushed janisch on the ground where he was pinned between beach chairs and floating debris . " i tried to free myself ´ , " he said .
" you know , you develop strength somehow .
i do n't know why .
and then i continued on . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tourist roland linz , 36 , a survivor at the damaged khao lak-lam ru national park in thailand miraculously , janisch managed to escape with just a few cuts and bruises . " my entire knee is cut up , " he said .
" but nothing 's broken .
you know , the doctors were amazed that we got out of there without any broken bones .
you do n't feel anything at first in the water .
you could cut off your arm and you would n't notice it . " it was only when he saw the corpses of other vacationers and local people lined up in the hospital that janisch realized just how lucky he was to be alive . " born again , you can say , " he said .
" i 'm afraid and i do n't know why .
i 'm totally wiped out . " a new lease on life others suffered the terrible anxiety of not knowing the fate of their loved ones .
monika sommerfeld from neuendorf in saxony-anhalt lost her family in the flood and only found them again days later .
her son bastian was torn away by the masses of water . " all i saw was the water racing towards me , " bastian said .
" then i was up to my neck in it .
we let go , crashed into the furniture and a glass pane .
the water got higher and higher .
then i was washed through the pane and then through a flat .
there was only one window and i had to get out through that . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german survivors arrive back home at frankfurt airport while bastian and his mother got away with a fright , her husband was badly injured , monika sommerfeld said . " he was pulled along by the wall of water , " she said .
" and all the debris injured him so badly .
half his arm was ripped off and he has grave knee injuries .
the doctor here gave his ' okay ' that he should join those being flown out .
he 's already on his way to cologne . " but , despite her harrowing experiences , sommerfeld said she was filled with a strange feeling of gratitude . " some nights you wake up and start to cry because you keep seeing these horrible pictures , " she said .
" but this country -lrb- thailand -rrb- ca n't be blamed .
there 's nothing it can do about it .
there 's no one here you can blame , or say , i 'm never going to come here again . " like janisch , sommerfeld said the experience was akin to getting a new lease on life . " you need peace and quiet first , " she said .
" we can be glad to be alive .
there are worse cases here of people having lost family members .
and we can say : we 've been reborn . " " the show must go on " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a thai elephant clears debris near bang nieng beach in khao lak , thailand many of the tourists said they are also grateful to the thais .
many reported self-sacrificing help .
some tourists who were only slightly injured said they want to stay for the rest of their holidays and leave as planned . reinhard seelig from mainz was one of them . " we do want to go home now , but not so fast , " he said .
" we do n't think it makes any sense to be sitting in the airport for three or four days .
we have a nice room here .
so i 'd rather wait another week or two . " things appear to have gone back to normal in the numerous bars dotting the beaches .
some tourists even speak of wild parties with which some holidaymakers celebrated their survival . but not everyone is comfortable with the idea . " what gets me down is that we were out a bit last night and you know that the corpses are lying nearby - and people are celebrating and boozing , " said one german tourist .

a run-off against jadranka kosor has been scheduled . on monday , official results showed croatia ’ s incumbent president had won the first round of elections , taking 49 percent of the vote compared to conservative candidate deputy prime minister kosor of the ruling croatian democratic union -lrb- hdz -rrb- , who received 20.18 percent of the ballots .
mesic ’ s take , however , was not enough to secure an outright victory , and the presidential race will go into a second round on jan .
16 , the electoral commission reported . mesic , who has his sites fixed on leading his country into the european union during the next five years , was jubilant after the results were announced .
although election precincts reported a lower than expected turnout , he said he was pleased with the outcome .
his candidacy has been endorsed by the three main center-left opposition parties who were defeated by the hdz in 2003 . the 70-year-old mesic called on all people in the former war-torn yugoslav republic to turn out in full strength for the run-off in two weeks . “ croatia must be a modern , european and democratic country with satisfied citizens , " he said .
" it will be possible only if we change many things .
we will decide where croatia is heading , to the 21st century or back in time . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voters cast their ballots at the polling station in zagreb , croatia on jan .
2 , 2005 .
about 4.4 million people , including 400,000 croats living abroad , voted .
observers believe mesic will most likely win a second term in the run-off against the more conservative kosor , who is widely seen as a close ally of prime minister ivo sanader . “ i think kosor has little chance of winning in the second round , ” analyst nenad zakosek told reuters after results were released just after midnight . a first for women kosor , who is the first woman to run for the presidency , said she was very pleased with the results of the first ballot . “ i am very happy that for the first time we have two candidates , one of which is a woman , ” she said .
“ this shows the maturity of voters since the most frequent question during the campaign was whether croatia was mature enough to have a woman for a president . ” the former journalist and deputy prime minister responsible for families and war veterans has stood by prime minister sanader and his efforts to turn the hdz from its nationalist past to a modern pro-european party . analysts , however , have criticized her campaign as lacking popular appeal and a strong political personality .
her position on the ballot was hotly contested by croatian-us businessman boris miksic , who finished third with 17.8 percent of the vote . the strong showing of miksic , an outsider on croatia ’ s political scene whose support was not expected to break out of the single digits , was described as a protest vote . ” this is a protest of croatian voters against the politics being led here , ” vesna pusic , a lawmaker with a leftist opposition party told afp . mesic and kosor both pledged a better future for croatians along the same lines – eu membership , the strengthening of the rule of law and fighting corruption . paving the way to europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatian president stipe mesic mesic , who said he was confident of winning re-election , owes much of his popularity to the role he played in ending the balkan nation ’ s international isolation and completing its democratic reforms after succeeding authoritarian leader franjo tudjman . he significantly reduced presidential powers as the country turned into a parliamentary democracy following changes in 2000 .
however , the president remains the supreme commander of the military and a co-creator of foreign policy along with the prime minister . the president will also oversee croatia ’ s entry into the european union , which is planned for 2009 .
croatia has been put on a fast track to accession with brussels deciding last month to launch membership talks in march .
zagreb hopes to fulfil membership criteria by 2007 but its bid depends on full cooperation with the un war crimes tribunal following the balkans wars of the 1990s which will be closely monitored by brussels . mesic has vowed to deliver the war crimes suspects to the international court , despite strong criticism from war veterans and nationalists . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de green lights for balkan trio the eu commission agrees to a date for romania and bulgaria to sign accession treaties and for croatia to start entry talks .

a run-off against jadranka kosor has been scheduled . on monday , official results showed croatia ’ s incumbent president had won the first round of elections , taking 49 percent of the vote compared to conservative candidate deputy prime minister kosor of the ruling croatian democratic union -lrb- hdz -rrb- , who received 20.18 percent of the ballots .
mesic ’ s take , however , was not enough to secure an outright victory , and the presidential race will go into a second round on jan .
16 , the electoral commission reported . mesic , who has his sites fixed on leading his country into the european union during the next five years , was jubilant after the results were announced .
although election precincts reported a lower than expected turnout , he said he was pleased with the outcome .
his candidacy has been endorsed by the three main center-left opposition parties who were defeated by the hdz in 2003 . the 70-year-old mesic called on all people in the former war-torn yugoslav republic to turn out in full strength for the run-off in two weeks . “ croatia must be a modern , european and democratic country with satisfied citizens , " he said .
" it will be possible only if we change many things .
we will decide where croatia is heading , to the 21st century or back in time . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voters cast their ballots at the polling station in zagreb , croatia on jan .
2 , 2005 .
about 4.4 million people , including 400,000 croats living abroad , voted .
observers believe mesic will most likely win a second term in the run-off against the more conservative kosor , who is widely seen as a close ally of prime minister ivo sanader . “ i think kosor has little chance of winning in the second round , ” analyst nenad zakosek told reuters after results were released just after midnight . a first for women kosor , who is the first woman to run for the presidency , said she was very pleased with the results of the first ballot . “ i am very happy that for the first time we have two candidates , one of which is a woman , ” she said .

26 , 2004 . the massive tidal waves triggered by an undersea quake in the indian ocean reduced the postcard perfect holiday destinations into a scene of death and destruction .
tens of thousands of western tourists , among them an estimated 10,000 german holidaymakers , were swept up in the chaos and devastation . many did n't survive .
about half of thailand 's estimated 5,000 dead are believed to be foreigners .
the german government has confirmed that 60 nationals are dead while the search continues for more than 1,000 missing germans . a slow path to normalcy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volunteers help wash away tidal wave debris on patong beach , thailand more than a week after the disaster , efforts are underway in thailand to restore a degree of normalcy to its battered tourism industry , the second-biggest source of revenue for the country .
clean-up work is in full swing among the damaged tourist resorts on thailand 's southwestern coastal strip and even bars and discotheques are gradually reopening . but , for german tourists who survived the harrowing tragedy like reinhard janisch , a return to normal life will take time . janisch , who is from oberhausen in germany 's ruhr region , was caught unawares by the tidal waves while vacationing on the island of phuket . " when the wave came from the back , i did n't turn round any more , " janisch said , remembering the full force of the encounter .
" i thought a car hit me from the back . " the massive wall of water pushed janisch on the ground where he was pinned between beach chairs and floating debris . " i tried to free myself ´ , " he said .
" you know , you develop strength somehow .
i do n't know why .

" but nothing 's broken .
you know , the doctors were amazed that we got out of there without any broken bones .
you do n't feel anything at first in the water .
you could cut off your arm and you would n't notice it . " it was only when he saw the corpses of other vacationers and local people lined up in the hospital that janisch realized just how lucky he was to be alive . " born again , you can say , " he said .
" i 'm afraid and i do n't know why .
i 'm totally wiped out . " a new lease on life others suffered the terrible anxiety of not knowing the fate of their loved ones .
monika sommerfeld from neuendorf in saxony-anhalt lost her family in the flood and only found them again days later .
her son bastian was torn away by the masses of water . " all i saw was the water racing towards me , " bastian said .
" then i was up to my neck in it .

half his arm was ripped off and he has grave knee injuries .
the doctor here gave his ' okay ' that he should join those being flown out .
he 's already on his way to cologne . " but , despite her harrowing experiences , sommerfeld said she was filled with a strange feeling of gratitude . " some nights you wake up and start to cry because you keep seeing these horrible pictures , " she said .
" but this country -lrb- thailand -rrb- ca n't be blamed .
there 's nothing it can do about it .
there 's no one here you can blame , or say , i 'm never going to come here again . " like janisch , sommerfeld said the experience was akin to getting a new lease on life . " you need peace and quiet first , " she said .

" we do n't think it makes any sense to be sitting in the airport for three or four days .
we have a nice room here .

26 , 2004 . the massive tidal waves triggered by an undersea quake in the indian ocean reduced the postcard perfect holiday destinations into a scene of death and destruction .
tens of thousands of western tourists , among them an estimated 10,000 german holidaymakers , were swept up in the chaos and devastation . many did n't survive .
about half of thailand 's estimated 5,000 dead are believed to be foreigners .
the german government has confirmed that 60 nationals are dead while the search continues for more than 1,000 missing germans . a slow path to normalcy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volunteers help wash away tidal wave debris on patong beach , thailand more than a week after the disaster , efforts are underway in thailand to restore a degree of normalcy to its battered tourism industry , the second-biggest source of revenue for the country .

" when the wave came from the back , i did n't turn round any more , " janisch said , remembering the full force of the encounter .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.01.2005 croatian presidential race enters run-off großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatian president stipe mesic hopes for another five years croatia ’ s pro-western president stipe mesic narrowly missed victory on sunday , falling just below the 50-percent mark needed to win re-election outright .
a run-off against jadranka kosor has been scheduled . on monday , official results showed croatia ’ s incumbent president had won the first round of elections , taking 49 percent of the vote compared to conservative candidate deputy prime minister kosor of the ruling croatian democratic union -lrb- hdz -rrb- , who received 20.18 percent of the ballots .
mesic ’ s take , however , was not enough to secure an outright victory , and the presidential race will go into a second round on jan .
16 , the electoral commission reported . mesic , who has his sites fixed on leading his country into the european union during the next five years , was jubilant after the results were announced .
although election precincts reported a lower than expected turnout , he said he was pleased with the outcome .
his candidacy has been endorsed by the three main center-left opposition parties who were defeated by the hdz in 2003 . the 70-year-old mesic called on all people in the former war-torn yugoslav republic to turn out in full strength for the run-off in two weeks . “ croatia must be a modern , european and democratic country with satisfied citizens , " he said .
" it will be possible only if we change many things .
we will decide where croatia is heading , to the 21st century or back in time . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voters cast their ballots at the polling station in zagreb , croatia on jan .
2 , 2005 .
about 4.4 million people , including 400,000 croats living abroad , voted .
observers believe mesic will most likely win a second term in the run-off against the more conservative kosor , who is widely seen as a close ally of prime minister ivo sanader . “ i think kosor has little chance of winning in the second round , ” analyst nenad zakosek told reuters after results were released just after midnight . a first for women kosor , who is the first woman to run for the presidency , said she was very pleased with the results of the first ballot . “ i am very happy that for the first time we have two candidates , one of which is a woman , ” she said .

a run-off against jadranka kosor has been scheduled . on monday , official results showed croatia ’ s incumbent president had won the first round of elections , taking 49 percent of the vote compared to conservative candidate deputy prime minister kosor of the ruling croatian democratic union -lrb- hdz -rrb- , who received 20.18 percent of the ballots .
mesic ’ s take , however , was not enough to secure an outright victory , and the presidential race will go into a second round on jan .
16 , the electoral commission reported . mesic , who has his sites fixed on leading his country into the european union during the next five years , was jubilant after the results were announced .
although election precincts reported a lower than expected turnout , he said he was pleased with the outcome .
his candidacy has been endorsed by the three main center-left opposition parties who were defeated by the hdz in 2003 . the 70-year-old mesic called on all people in the former war-torn yugoslav republic to turn out in full strength for the run-off in two weeks . “ croatia must be a modern , european and democratic country with satisfied citizens , " he said .
" it will be possible only if we change many things .
we will decide where croatia is heading , to the 21st century or back in time . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voters cast their ballots at the polling station in zagreb , croatia on jan .
2 , 2005 .
about 4.4 million people , including 400,000 croats living abroad , voted .
observers believe mesic will most likely win a second term in the run-off against the more conservative kosor , who is widely seen as a close ally of prime minister ivo sanader . “ i think kosor has little chance of winning in the second round , ” analyst nenad zakosek told reuters after results were released just after midnight . a first for women kosor , who is the first woman to run for the presidency , said she was very pleased with the results of the first ballot . “ i am very happy that for the first time we have two candidates , one of which is a woman , ” she said .
“ this shows the maturity of voters since the most frequent question during the campaign was whether croatia was mature enough to have a woman for a president . ” the former journalist and deputy prime minister responsible for families and war veterans has stood by prime minister sanader and his efforts to turn the hdz from its nationalist past to a modern pro-european party . analysts , however , have criticized her campaign as lacking popular appeal and a strong political personality .

the german government now praises the technology which has been held up for 16 months by technical flaws costing germany billions in lost revenues . the expected long traffic jams at german border crossing points failed to materialize on monday morning and highway service stations also weren ’ t crammed with truckers at stationary toll machines .
german authorities say the country ’ s satellite-based tolls system is up and running smoothly and that trucking companies have apparently been well-prepared for the start of the system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an automatic toll surveillance bridge on a german highway " all parts of the system are working flawlessly , " said felix stenschke , a spokesman for the ministry of transportation .
" at the moment there is still only little traffic on german highways but nevertheless we are completely satisfied .
one year ago the situation was quite the contrary . " earlier problems the pioneering toll system is based on satellite technology which in the past 16 months was plagued by technical problems .
the delays were a major embarrassment for toll collect – the consortium made up of automaker daimlerchrysler , deutsche telekom and french motoway operator cofiroute which developed the system . germany has europe ’ s busiest highways and is now charging an average of 12 and a half eurocents -lrb- 10 us cents -rrb- per kilometer -lrb- 0.6 miles -rrb- .
about one third of the trucks that use its 12-thousand-kilometer highway network are foreign .
transport minister manfred stolpe -lrb- photo below -rrb- said truckers in neighboring poland and the netherlands were especially well prepared on monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe " i ’ ve been surprised by two things , " he said .
" first of all the number of on-board units ordered and installed by polish and dutch companies – the two countries which in my view are best prepared for the new system .
and secondly the degree of training undergone by truckers in advance . “ hefty fines but during the first two days after the toll system began operating , the government also nabbed about 500 fee dodgers .
they neither had special on-board units in their cabins that automatically pay the tolls nor did they pay for their journeys at toll machines set up in service stations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a picture of one of the first toll dodgers the dodgers were fined € 75 -lrb- $ 101 -rrb- and face a much stiffer penalty of up to € 20,000 if they will be caught again . rüdiger petri , a spokesman for the association of german hauliers , said the toll system will also lead to higher prices for german consumers . " we ’ ve repeatedly told our customers that german haulers are unable to carry the extra costs resulting from the toll system , " he said .
" our customers accepted that and said they saw no other alternative than passing them on to product prices paid by consumers . " the german government expects about € 2.5 billion in truck toll revenues each year .
in addition , it is currently seeking billions of euros in compensation from toll collect for 16 months of lost revenues .
but economics minister wolfgang clement also hopes the state-of-the-art system will be an export hit doing away with the old-fashioned booths that still cause traffic congestions in many other european countries . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german road toll prepares for launch after a catolog of catastrophic technical faults and management blunders , germany ’ s road toll system for heavy vehicles is now scheduled for a january launch after its successful test phase ended on wednesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.01.2005 croatian presidential race enters run-off großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatian president stipe mesic hopes for another five years croatia ’ s pro-western president stipe mesic narrowly missed victory on sunday , falling just below the 50-percent mark needed to win re-election outright .
a run-off against jadranka kosor has been scheduled . on monday , official results showed croatia ’ s incumbent president had won the first round of elections , taking 49 percent of the vote compared to conservative candidate deputy prime minister kosor of the ruling croatian democratic union -lrb- hdz -rrb- , who received 20.18 percent of the ballots .
mesic ’ s take , however , was not enough to secure an outright victory , and the presidential race will go into a second round on jan .
16 , the electoral commission reported . mesic , who has his sites fixed on leading his country into the european union during the next five years , was jubilant after the results were announced .
although election precincts reported a lower than expected turnout , he said he was pleased with the outcome .
his candidacy has been endorsed by the three main center-left opposition parties who were defeated by the hdz in 2003 . the 70-year-old mesic called on all people in the former war-torn yugoslav republic to turn out in full strength for the run-off in two weeks . “ croatia must be a modern , european and democratic country with satisfied citizens , " he said .
" it will be possible only if we change many things .
we will decide where croatia is heading , to the 21st century or back in time . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voters cast their ballots at the polling station in zagreb , croatia on jan .
2 , 2005 .
about 4.4 million people , including 400,000 croats living abroad , voted .
observers believe mesic will most likely win a second term in the run-off against the more conservative kosor , who is widely seen as a close ally of prime minister ivo sanader . “ i think kosor has little chance of winning in the second round , ” analyst nenad zakosek told reuters after results were released just after midnight . a first for women kosor , who is the first woman to run for the presidency , said she was very pleased with the results of the first ballot . “ i am very happy that for the first time we have two candidates , one of which is a woman , ” she said .
“ this shows the maturity of voters since the most frequent question during the campaign was whether croatia was mature enough to have a woman for a president . ” the former journalist and deputy prime minister responsible for families and war veterans has stood by prime minister sanader and his efforts to turn the hdz from its nationalist past to a modern pro-european party . analysts , however , have criticized her campaign as lacking popular appeal and a strong political personality .
her position on the ballot was hotly contested by croatian-us businessman boris miksic , who finished third with 17.8 percent of the vote . the strong showing of miksic , an outsider on croatia ’ s political scene whose support was not expected to break out of the single digits , was described as a protest vote . ” this is a protest of croatian voters against the politics being led here , ” vesna pusic , a lawmaker with a leftist opposition party told afp . mesic and kosor both pledged a better future for croatians along the same lines – eu membership , the strengthening of the rule of law and fighting corruption . paving the way to europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatian president stipe mesic mesic , who said he was confident of winning re-election , owes much of his popularity to the role he played in ending the balkan nation ’ s international isolation and completing its democratic reforms after succeeding authoritarian leader franjo tudjman . he significantly reduced presidential powers as the country turned into a parliamentary democracy following changes in 2000 .
however , the president remains the supreme commander of the military and a co-creator of foreign policy along with the prime minister . the president will also oversee croatia ’ s entry into the european union , which is planned for 2009 .
croatia has been put on a fast track to accession with brussels deciding last month to launch membership talks in march .
zagreb hopes to fulfil membership criteria by 2007 but its bid depends on full cooperation with the un war crimes tribunal following the balkans wars of the 1990s which will be closely monitored by brussels . mesic has vowed to deliver the war crimes suspects to the international court , despite strong criticism from war veterans and nationalists . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de green lights for balkan trio the eu commission agrees to a date for romania and bulgaria to sign accession treaties and for croatia to start entry talks .

the german government now praises the technology which has been held up for 16 months by technical flaws costing germany billions in lost revenues . the expected long traffic jams at german border crossing points failed to materialize on monday morning and highway service stations also weren ’ t crammed with truckers at stationary toll machines .
german authorities say the country ’ s satellite-based tolls system is up and running smoothly and that trucking companies have apparently been well-prepared for the start of the system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an automatic toll surveillance bridge on a german highway " all parts of the system are working flawlessly , " said felix stenschke , a spokesman for the ministry of transportation .

" we ’ ve repeatedly told our customers that german haulers are unable to carry the extra costs resulting from the toll system , " he said .
" our customers accepted that and said they saw no other alternative than passing them on to product prices paid by consumers . " the german government expects about € 2.5 billion in truck toll revenues each year .
in addition , it is currently seeking billions of euros in compensation from toll collect for 16 months of lost revenues .

the german government now praises the technology which has been held up for 16 months by technical flaws costing germany billions in lost revenues . the expected long traffic jams at german border crossing points failed to materialize on monday morning and highway service stations also weren ’ t crammed with truckers at stationary toll machines .
german authorities say the country ’ s satellite-based tolls system is up and running smoothly and that trucking companies have apparently been well-prepared for the start of the system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an automatic toll surveillance bridge on a german highway " all parts of the system are working flawlessly , " said felix stenschke , a spokesman for the ministry of transportation .
" at the moment there is still only little traffic on german highways but nevertheless we are completely satisfied .
one year ago the situation was quite the contrary . " earlier problems the pioneering toll system is based on satellite technology which in the past 16 months was plagued by technical problems .
the delays were a major embarrassment for toll collect – the consortium made up of automaker daimlerchrysler , deutsche telekom and french motoway operator cofiroute which developed the system . germany has europe ’ s busiest highways and is now charging an average of 12 and a half eurocents -lrb- 10 us cents -rrb- per kilometer -lrb- 0.6 miles -rrb- .
about one third of the trucks that use its 12-thousand-kilometer highway network are foreign .
transport minister manfred stolpe -lrb- photo below -rrb- said truckers in neighboring poland and the netherlands were especially well prepared on monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe " i ’ ve been surprised by two things , " he said .
" first of all the number of on-board units ordered and installed by polish and dutch companies – the two countries which in my view are best prepared for the new system .
and secondly the degree of training undergone by truckers in advance . “ hefty fines but during the first two days after the toll system began operating , the government also nabbed about 500 fee dodgers .
they neither had special on-board units in their cabins that automatically pay the tolls nor did they pay for their journeys at toll machines set up in service stations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a picture of one of the first toll dodgers the dodgers were fined € 75 -lrb- $ 101 -rrb- and face a much stiffer penalty of up to € 20,000 if they will be caught again . rüdiger petri , a spokesman for the association of german hauliers , said the toll system will also lead to higher prices for german consumers . " we ’ ve repeatedly told our customers that german haulers are unable to carry the extra costs resulting from the toll system , " he said .
" our customers accepted that and said they saw no other alternative than passing them on to product prices paid by consumers . " the german government expects about € 2.5 billion in truck toll revenues each year .
in addition , it is currently seeking billions of euros in compensation from toll collect for 16 months of lost revenues .
but economics minister wolfgang clement also hopes the state-of-the-art system will be an export hit doing away with the old-fashioned booths that still cause traffic congestions in many other european countries . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german road toll prepares for launch after a catolog of catastrophic technical faults and management blunders , germany ’ s road toll system for heavy vehicles is now scheduled for a january launch after its successful test phase ended on wednesday .

1 , 2004 -rrb- new german toll system works in first tests tests of a german highway toll system for trucks have been successfully completed , giving rise to the hope that the long-delayed project will both come into operation and do so in time for the january deadline .

it is impossible to tell for the moment exactly how many unemployed will lose money under the new system or who will benefit from the changes . but those expected to feel the changes hardest are the long-term jobless and the 2.7 million people who the federal labor agency says have used up their benefits and now receive only minimum welfare payments .

they put the figure at 27 percent and say 48 percent will have their income reduced . to calculate the new benefits , the federal labor agency analyzes peoples ' estate , their expenditure and their needs , which is already sparking controversy .

but support groups for the unemployed have criticized a move they say will make the poor poorer . other observers have called for recognition that even after the reforms are introduced , the german welfare state will be relatively generous to the unemployed .

3 , he was most feted for his work as the architect of modern china . the birthplace of china 's future architectural landmarks is the modest headquarters of von gerkan , marg , and partners -lrb- gmp -rrb- , overlooking the elbe river in hamburg , germany .
in addition to churches and two trade fair centers , the company is working on the ambitious luchao harbor city , a seaport for 300,000 inhabitants near shanghai . not long ago , gmp also won the competition to build a " grand theater " in qingdao , china .
now , they 'll be the ones to erect a cultural complex with three auditoriums for 3,300 audience members .
and until 2007 , the german firm will also be working on another prestige project - china 's new national museum in beijing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg architect meinhard von gerkan " we try to boil every design down to a few core questions , in order to find the most natural answer , " said von gerkan when asked to characterize his company 's concept . this approach is n't only evident in china but also in germany , von gerkan 's home .
lübeck 's congress hall , the new airports in hamburg and stuttgart , berlin 's new lehrter train station and dresdner bank office , or the new lecture halls for the technical university in chemnitz - despite plentiful use of steel and glass , meinhard von gerkan 's buildings never seem cold .
his work is a combination of timeless , modern elements and subtle , contemporary concessions . bildunterschrift : lecture halls at the technical university in chemnitz ; plan for a new football stadium in munich humble beginnings von gerkan was born in the latvian capital , riga , but after fleeing the east , grew up as an orphan with a foster family in hamburg .
he first studied law and then physics before switching to architecture . as students , von gerkan and his future partner volkwin marg began winning design competitions for other architects .
that laid the foundation for the success of their company , gmp .
forty years ago , the pair won the competition to design berlin 's tegel airport , and since then , they 've collected more than 160 top prizes . under marg 's direction , the firm completed down-to-earth projects like hamburg 's hanse-viertel downtown district , or the neue messe trade fair center in leipzig .
in contrast , von gerkan always pursued the novel .
today , the pair employ around 300 staff at their " idea factory , " which has several subsidiaries in addition to the hamburg headquarters . bildunterschrift : meinhard von gerkan , luchao harbor city in reality , von gerkan is n't a " star architect , " but rather , he 's known for being publicity-shy .
still , he is noticeably proud of gmp 's success in china .
the new national museum in beijing will have the dimensions of a giant congress hall - larger than three football fields . " we have to have something to set against the adjoining gigantic open space of tiananmen square , " von gerkan said .
with analogies to historic temple architecture , his plan attempts to meld the old and the new .
" for me , it 's important that people feel comfortable in a new building and are able to find that bridge to their own culture .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 03.01.2005 a gruesome task for criminologists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many bodies will never be identified in the wake of last week ’ s tsunamis , some 300 experts are working around the clock to identify victims .
with more than 30 years experience , germany has sent its team of forensic scientists to the region . no matter where a catastrophe strikes , when germans are among its victims , the identification commission of the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- is called into action - the 1998 train disaster in eschede , the 2000 concorde crash in paris and now the tsunamis in south asia .
disasters that leave victims unrecognizable are the special focus of germany ’ s forensic science team . victims from many nations since dec .
29 , the german identification commission has been deployed to thailand where they are working around the clock to determine the identity of drowning victims , many of whom have been mutilated and dismembered by the torrential floods and distorted beyond recognition as their corpses begin to deteriorate in the tropical heat . even though time is of the essence – with each day , the number of new victims continues to grow while decay begins to set in – the forensic scientists could not begin their work until the start of the new year , after receiving the go-ahead from the thai government .
with experts from 19 different nations involved in the rescue and removal operation , it was crucial to coordinate methods .
it is the first time so many victims from so many different countries needed to be identified . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a foreigner tourist looks at photographs of survivors at the damaged khao lak national park .
the most difficult work for the criminologists will be in the tourist resorts of phuket and khao lak , where a buddhist temple has been converted into a makeshift morgue .
more than 300 corpses are stacked in the temple awaiting identification .
some 20 percent are estimated to be those of foreigners . “ i fear it ’ s a very high number of german victims , ” said peter finger , spokesman for the german embassy in bangkok . identifying victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bodies of victims are covered in plastic and stacked before they can be identified according to dirk büchner , spokesman for the bka , there are three key methods for determining the identity of a victim : fingerprints , dental analysis and dna .
but each of these requires a good deal of time and depends on comparing with available sample data from relatives . “ it could be a hair , a fingerprint or the x-rays from a dentist , ” büchner said .
serial numbers from pace makers or an artificial hip could help provide information on a victim ’ s identity as do eye color , the shape of earlobes , scars or tattoos . if a victim can not be immediately identified , the forensic scientists take a sample of dna from the thigh bone and save it for later comparison .
to keep track of individual corpses , an electronic chip is attached to the body . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pyres of victims who were killed by tidal waves burn on the beach at alappad , in the southern indian state of kerala , wednesday , dec .
29 , 2004 .
responding to fears that corpses could be buried or cremated before the criminologists had the chance to identify them , thailand ’ s chief forensic scientist , pornthip rojanasunant , said that no foreign corpse would be deposed of before an expert had the chance to examine it . given the sheer numbers of victims and the difficulty of proving origin , the foreign teams of forensic scientists acknowledged that it would take weeks or even years before all the victims could be identified .
the thai government on sunday said that it was quite possible that many of the corpses would remain forever unidentified . 30 years experience the german identification commission was founded in 1972 after an airplane crash on the canary island of teneriffa killed 155 people , many of them german tourists .
since then the commission has been involved in more than 24 missions both in germany and abroad ; 16 of which were airplane crashes . in its three decades of experience , the team of 110 forensic scientists has so far been able to identify 1,316 disaster victims beyond a doubt .
working largely on a voluntary basis in a psychologically demanding field , the criminologists cooperate closely with forensic specialists throughout germany . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tsunamis claim nearly 140,000 lives so far the confirmed death toll from the tsunami that hit asian coastlines is still rising more than a week after the disaster even as a massive multinational relief operation gathers pace .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 03.01.2005 smooth start for german truck toll großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now in effect on german highways germany ’ s brand new highway toll system for heavy trucks has got off to a smooth start dispelling fears of potential traffic disasters on monday morning . the satellite-based system began operating already on saturday , but after a routine weekend traffic ban for trucks on german autobahns major glitches were expected at the beginning of the week .
the german government now praises the technology which has been held up for 16 months by technical flaws costing germany billions in lost revenues . the expected long traffic jams at german border crossing points failed to materialize on monday morning and highway service stations also weren ’ t crammed with truckers at stationary toll machines .
german authorities say the country ’ s satellite-based tolls system is up and running smoothly and that trucking companies have apparently been well-prepared for the start of the system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an automatic toll surveillance bridge on a german highway " all parts of the system are working flawlessly , " said felix stenschke , a spokesman for the ministry of transportation .
" at the moment there is still only little traffic on german highways but nevertheless we are completely satisfied .
one year ago the situation was quite the contrary . " earlier problems the pioneering toll system is based on satellite technology which in the past 16 months was plagued by technical problems .
the delays were a major embarrassment for toll collect – the consortium made up of automaker daimlerchrysler , deutsche telekom and french motoway operator cofiroute which developed the system . germany has europe ’ s busiest highways and is now charging an average of 12 and a half eurocents -lrb- 10 us cents -rrb- per kilometer -lrb- 0.6 miles -rrb- .
about one third of the trucks that use its 12-thousand-kilometer highway network are foreign .
transport minister manfred stolpe -lrb- photo below -rrb- said truckers in neighboring poland and the netherlands were especially well prepared on monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe " i ’ ve been surprised by two things , " he said .
" first of all the number of on-board units ordered and installed by polish and dutch companies – the two countries which in my view are best prepared for the new system .
and secondly the degree of training undergone by truckers in advance . “ hefty fines but during the first two days after the toll system began operating , the government also nabbed about 500 fee dodgers .
they neither had special on-board units in their cabins that automatically pay the tolls nor did they pay for their journeys at toll machines set up in service stations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a picture of one of the first toll dodgers the dodgers were fined € 75 -lrb- $ 101 -rrb- and face a much stiffer penalty of up to € 20,000 if they will be caught again . rüdiger petri , a spokesman for the association of german hauliers , said the toll system will also lead to higher prices for german consumers . " we ’ ve repeatedly told our customers that german haulers are unable to carry the extra costs resulting from the toll system , " he said .
" our customers accepted that and said they saw no other alternative than passing them on to product prices paid by consumers . " the german government expects about € 2.5 billion in truck toll revenues each year .
in addition , it is currently seeking billions of euros in compensation from toll collect for 16 months of lost revenues .
but economics minister wolfgang clement also hopes the state-of-the-art system will be an export hit doing away with the old-fashioned booths that still cause traffic congestions in many other european countries . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german road toll prepares for launch after a catolog of catastrophic technical faults and management blunders , germany ’ s road toll system for heavy vehicles is now scheduled for a january launch after its successful test phase ended on wednesday .

the german government now praises the technology which has been held up for 16 months by technical flaws costing germany billions in lost revenues . the expected long traffic jams at german border crossing points failed to materialize on monday morning and highway service stations also weren ’ t crammed with truckers at stationary toll machines .
german authorities say the country ’ s satellite-based tolls system is up and running smoothly and that trucking companies have apparently been well-prepared for the start of the system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an automatic toll surveillance bridge on a german highway " all parts of the system are working flawlessly , " said felix stenschke , a spokesman for the ministry of transportation .

" we ’ ve repeatedly told our customers that german haulers are unable to carry the extra costs resulting from the toll system , " he said .
" our customers accepted that and said they saw no other alternative than passing them on to product prices paid by consumers . " the german government expects about € 2.5 billion in truck toll revenues each year .
in addition , it is currently seeking billions of euros in compensation from toll collect for 16 months of lost revenues .

as the population mourns , the government in stockholm has come under fire for its handling of the catastrophe . instead of a spectacular fireworks display , distraught swedes ushered in the new year with a national day of mourning and candle-lit vigils . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thai rescue workers carry a body from the beach in khao lak around 20,000 swedes were on holiday in thailand when the indian ocean tsunami struck on dec .
26 , 2004 . with over 1,000 feared casualties , sweden may be the european country worst hit by the disaster . on sunday , swedish state secretary hans dahlgren revised downwards the figure from an initial total of 3,686 swedes missing in the region affected by the tsunami , to 2,915 .
ongoing double-checks of reports about swedes believed missing had enabled authorities to shorten the list by over 20 percent , dahlgren said . the government also revised the confirmed death toll to 52 swedes , from 59 earlier , but reiterated that it was expected to rise . national trauma there remains little doubt that the south asian tragedy has turned into a national trauma for the scandinavian country of nine million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish prime minister göran persson last week prime minister göran persson attempted to brace his country , unused to such large-scale loss of lives , for the worst . " it 's a catastrophe of enormous dimensions , the worst in our times .
the number of injured and dead will rise dramatically , " persson warned .
" we must rally together and support each other .
this will affect our lives for a long time to come . " coffins are scheduled to begin arriving this week as many of the recovered bodies still await dna analysis for identification . harrowing experiences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish tourists line up to check in for a flight home at phuket international airport meanwhile , hundreds of stunned and skimpily-clad swedish holidaymakers have been arriving daily in airports around sweden .
most of them are still in shock and traumatized as they try to come to grips with the disaster that many only narrowly survived . one of them , daniel haag , who landed at stockholm 's arlanda airport , recalled the first moments when tragedy struck . " i woke up just as my hotel room filled with water , " haag said .
" i was under water for almost a minute before i came up again .
i managed to catch on to the trunk of a car that was floating in the debris and heave myself up , " he said .
" and then i ran for my life . " the extraordinarily high number of swedish tourists in thailand is blamed on the weather , with many wishing to leave the nordic realms to escape the dark winter cold for sunnier locations . in total , some 4,500 people from sweden , norway , denmark and finland are missing . search for the missing however , the search for the missing has been hampered by the widespread destruction wrought by the tidal waves in the region . even as mass graves are dug in the face of fast-decomposing corpses , officials warn that all the bodies of the tourists may never be recovered because many could be washed out to sea . on sunday , persson 's government pushed for another search of the andaman sea coastline by thai and japanese navy vessels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a thai elephant clears debris near bang nieng beach in khao lak , thailand elephants have also joined the search for bodies in the popular khao lak tourist paradise in thailand , heading into debris-strewn forests with rescue teams to retrieve corpses where heavy earth-moving equipment can not go . government faces flak even as sweden reels from the disaster , prime minister persson and his center-left social democrats face scathing criticism for what many regard as failure to take prompt action following the tragedy . foreign minister laila freivalds and foreign aid minister carin jamtin have admitted that the government waited too long - four full days after the disaster took place - to send planes outfitted with doctors and medical supplies to the aid of citizens stranded in thailand . eight out of ten respondents to an internet poll of 5,289 people conducted by swedish daily svenska dagbladet said the government had mismanaged the crisis . lack of disaster management ? many have also drawn parallels to sweden 's last big tragedy 10 years ago , when 551 swedes died as the " estonia " ferry sank off the baltic coast .
at the time a committee investigating swedish rescue efforts after the sinking of the estonia recommended setting up a national disaster management system . but , that still has n't happened .
" i would have hoped that one would have drawn lessons from the estonia tragedy , " said kent härstedt , a social democratic parliamentarian .
" actually , there should have been a commissioner for such catastrophes and an authority that coordinates everything . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl nilsson of lulo , sweden , poses with a sigh saying his parent and brothers are missing in phuket , thailand .
but persson 's government has rejected the accusations . " we decided against a big authority for disaster management because it would only work in times of crisis and have nothing to do in normal times , " lars danielsson , a member of persson 's cabinet said . " instead we 're relying on existing mechanisms which are much more effective , " he added .
" the only drawback is that it sometimes takes a little longer until all measures are in place .

the german government now praises the technology which has been held up for 16 months by technical flaws costing germany billions in lost revenues . the expected long traffic jams at german border crossing points failed to materialize on monday morning and highway service stations also weren ’ t crammed with truckers at stationary toll machines .
german authorities say the country ’ s satellite-based tolls system is up and running smoothly and that trucking companies have apparently been well-prepared for the start of the system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an automatic toll surveillance bridge on a german highway " all parts of the system are working flawlessly , " said felix stenschke , a spokesman for the ministry of transportation .
" at the moment there is still only little traffic on german highways but nevertheless we are completely satisfied .
one year ago the situation was quite the contrary . " earlier problems the pioneering toll system is based on satellite technology which in the past 16 months was plagued by technical problems .
the delays were a major embarrassment for toll collect – the consortium made up of automaker daimlerchrysler , deutsche telekom and french motoway operator cofiroute which developed the system . germany has europe ’ s busiest highways and is now charging an average of 12 and a half eurocents -lrb- 10 us cents -rrb- per kilometer -lrb- 0.6 miles -rrb- .
about one third of the trucks that use its 12-thousand-kilometer highway network are foreign .
transport minister manfred stolpe -lrb- photo below -rrb- said truckers in neighboring poland and the netherlands were especially well prepared on monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe " i ’ ve been surprised by two things , " he said .
" first of all the number of on-board units ordered and installed by polish and dutch companies – the two countries which in my view are best prepared for the new system .
and secondly the degree of training undergone by truckers in advance . “ hefty fines but during the first two days after the toll system began operating , the government also nabbed about 500 fee dodgers .
they neither had special on-board units in their cabins that automatically pay the tolls nor did they pay for their journeys at toll machines set up in service stations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a picture of one of the first toll dodgers the dodgers were fined € 75 -lrb- $ 101 -rrb- and face a much stiffer penalty of up to € 20,000 if they will be caught again . rüdiger petri , a spokesman for the association of german hauliers , said the toll system will also lead to higher prices for german consumers . " we ’ ve repeatedly told our customers that german haulers are unable to carry the extra costs resulting from the toll system , " he said .
" our customers accepted that and said they saw no other alternative than passing them on to product prices paid by consumers . " the german government expects about € 2.5 billion in truck toll revenues each year .
in addition , it is currently seeking billions of euros in compensation from toll collect for 16 months of lost revenues .
but economics minister wolfgang clement also hopes the state-of-the-art system will be an export hit doing away with the old-fashioned booths that still cause traffic congestions in many other european countries . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german road toll prepares for launch after a catolog of catastrophic technical faults and management blunders , germany ’ s road toll system for heavy vehicles is now scheduled for a january launch after its successful test phase ended on wednesday .

1 , 2004 -rrb- new german toll system works in first tests tests of a german highway toll system for trucks have been successfully completed , giving rise to the hope that the long-delayed project will both come into operation and do so in time for the january deadline .
-lrb- june 23 , 2004 -rrb- germany mulls toll for cars a suggestion by germany ‘ s transport minister to introduce a car toll for some sections of the autobahn to bring in extra money has been criticized by automobile associations and politicians across the board .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.01.2005 croatian presidential race enters run-off großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatian president stipe mesic hopes for another five years croatia ’ s pro-western president stipe mesic narrowly missed victory on sunday , falling just below the 50-percent mark needed to win re-election outright .
a run-off against jadranka kosor has been scheduled . on monday , official results showed croatia ’ s incumbent president had won the first round of elections , taking 49 percent of the vote compared to conservative candidate deputy prime minister kosor of the ruling croatian democratic union -lrb- hdz -rrb- , who received 20.18 percent of the ballots .
mesic ’ s take , however , was not enough to secure an outright victory , and the presidential race will go into a second round on jan .
16 , the electoral commission reported . mesic , who has his sites fixed on leading his country into the european union during the next five years , was jubilant after the results were announced .
although election precincts reported a lower than expected turnout , he said he was pleased with the outcome .
his candidacy has been endorsed by the three main center-left opposition parties who were defeated by the hdz in 2003 . the 70-year-old mesic called on all people in the former war-torn yugoslav republic to turn out in full strength for the run-off in two weeks . “ croatia must be a modern , european and democratic country with satisfied citizens , " he said .
" it will be possible only if we change many things .
we will decide where croatia is heading , to the 21st century or back in time . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voters cast their ballots at the polling station in zagreb , croatia on jan .
2 , 2005 .
about 4.4 million people , including 400,000 croats living abroad , voted .
observers believe mesic will most likely win a second term in the run-off against the more conservative kosor , who is widely seen as a close ally of prime minister ivo sanader . “ i think kosor has little chance of winning in the second round , ” analyst nenad zakosek told reuters after results were released just after midnight . a first for women kosor , who is the first woman to run for the presidency , said she was very pleased with the results of the first ballot . “ i am very happy that for the first time we have two candidates , one of which is a woman , ” she said .
“ this shows the maturity of voters since the most frequent question during the campaign was whether croatia was mature enough to have a woman for a president . ” the former journalist and deputy prime minister responsible for families and war veterans has stood by prime minister sanader and his efforts to turn the hdz from its nationalist past to a modern pro-european party . analysts , however , have criticized her campaign as lacking popular appeal and a strong political personality .
her position on the ballot was hotly contested by croatian-us businessman boris miksic , who finished third with 17.8 percent of the vote . the strong showing of miksic , an outsider on croatia ’ s political scene whose support was not expected to break out of the single digits , was described as a protest vote . ” this is a protest of croatian voters against the politics being led here , ” vesna pusic , a lawmaker with a leftist opposition party told afp . mesic and kosor both pledged a better future for croatians along the same lines – eu membership , the strengthening of the rule of law and fighting corruption . paving the way to europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatian president stipe mesic mesic , who said he was confident of winning re-election , owes much of his popularity to the role he played in ending the balkan nation ’ s international isolation and completing its democratic reforms after succeeding authoritarian leader franjo tudjman . he significantly reduced presidential powers as the country turned into a parliamentary democracy following changes in 2000 .
however , the president remains the supreme commander of the military and a co-creator of foreign policy along with the prime minister . the president will also oversee croatia ’ s entry into the european union , which is planned for 2009 .
croatia has been put on a fast track to accession with brussels deciding last month to launch membership talks in march .
zagreb hopes to fulfil membership criteria by 2007 but its bid depends on full cooperation with the un war crimes tribunal following the balkans wars of the 1990s which will be closely monitored by brussels . mesic has vowed to deliver the war crimes suspects to the international court , despite strong criticism from war veterans and nationalists . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de green lights for balkan trio the eu commission agrees to a date for romania and bulgaria to sign accession treaties and for croatia to start entry talks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.01.2005 croatian presidential race enters run-off großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatian president stipe mesic hopes for another five years croatia ’ s pro-western president stipe mesic narrowly missed victory on sunday , falling just below the 50-percent mark needed to win re-election outright .
a run-off against jadranka kosor has been scheduled . on monday , official results showed croatia ’ s incumbent president had won the first round of elections , taking 49 percent of the vote compared to conservative candidate deputy prime minister kosor of the ruling croatian democratic union -lrb- hdz -rrb- , who received 20.18 percent of the ballots .
mesic ’ s take , however , was not enough to secure an outright victory , and the presidential race will go into a second round on jan .
16 , the electoral commission reported . mesic , who has his sites fixed on leading his country into the european union during the next five years , was jubilant after the results were announced .
although election precincts reported a lower than expected turnout , he said he was pleased with the outcome .
his candidacy has been endorsed by the three main center-left opposition parties who were defeated by the hdz in 2003 . the 70-year-old mesic called on all people in the former war-torn yugoslav republic to turn out in full strength for the run-off in two weeks . “ croatia must be a modern , european and democratic country with satisfied citizens , " he said .
" it will be possible only if we change many things .
we will decide where croatia is heading , to the 21st century or back in time . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voters cast their ballots at the polling station in zagreb , croatia on jan .
2 , 2005 .
about 4.4 million people , including 400,000 croats living abroad , voted .
observers believe mesic will most likely win a second term in the run-off against the more conservative kosor , who is widely seen as a close ally of prime minister ivo sanader . “ i think kosor has little chance of winning in the second round , ” analyst nenad zakosek told reuters after results were released just after midnight . a first for women kosor , who is the first woman to run for the presidency , said she was very pleased with the results of the first ballot . “ i am very happy that for the first time we have two candidates , one of which is a woman , ” she said .
“ this shows the maturity of voters since the most frequent question during the campaign was whether croatia was mature enough to have a woman for a president . ” the former journalist and deputy prime minister responsible for families and war veterans has stood by prime minister sanader and his efforts to turn the hdz from its nationalist past to a modern pro-european party . analysts , however , have criticized her campaign as lacking popular appeal and a strong political personality .
her position on the ballot was hotly contested by croatian-us businessman boris miksic , who finished third with 17.8 percent of the vote . the strong showing of miksic , an outsider on croatia ’ s political scene whose support was not expected to break out of the single digits , was described as a protest vote . ” this is a protest of croatian voters against the politics being led here , ” vesna pusic , a lawmaker with a leftist opposition party told afp . mesic and kosor both pledged a better future for croatians along the same lines – eu membership , the strengthening of the rule of law and fighting corruption . paving the way to europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatian president stipe mesic mesic , who said he was confident of winning re-election , owes much of his popularity to the role he played in ending the balkan nation ’ s international isolation and completing its democratic reforms after succeeding authoritarian leader franjo tudjman . he significantly reduced presidential powers as the country turned into a parliamentary democracy following changes in 2000 .
however , the president remains the supreme commander of the military and a co-creator of foreign policy along with the prime minister . the president will also oversee croatia ’ s entry into the european union , which is planned for 2009 .
croatia has been put on a fast track to accession with brussels deciding last month to launch membership talks in march .
zagreb hopes to fulfil membership criteria by 2007 but its bid depends on full cooperation with the un war crimes tribunal following the balkans wars of the 1990s which will be closely monitored by brussels . mesic has vowed to deliver the war crimes suspects to the international court , despite strong criticism from war veterans and nationalists . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de green lights for balkan trio the eu commission agrees to a date for romania and bulgaria to sign accession treaties and for croatia to start entry talks .

as the population mourns , the government in stockholm has come under fire for its handling of the catastrophe . instead of a spectacular fireworks display , distraught swedes ushered in the new year with a national day of mourning and candle-lit vigils . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thai rescue workers carry a body from the beach in khao lak around 20,000 swedes were on holiday in thailand when the indian ocean tsunami struck on dec .
26 , 2004 . with over 1,000 feared casualties , sweden may be the european country worst hit by the disaster . on sunday , swedish state secretary hans dahlgren revised downwards the figure from an initial total of 3,686 swedes missing in the region affected by the tsunami , to 2,915 .
ongoing double-checks of reports about swedes believed missing had enabled authorities to shorten the list by over 20 percent , dahlgren said . the government also revised the confirmed death toll to 52 swedes , from 59 earlier , but reiterated that it was expected to rise . national trauma there remains little doubt that the south asian tragedy has turned into a national trauma for the scandinavian country of nine million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish prime minister göran persson last week prime minister göran persson attempted to brace his country , unused to such large-scale loss of lives , for the worst . " it 's a catastrophe of enormous dimensions , the worst in our times .
the number of injured and dead will rise dramatically , " persson warned .
" we must rally together and support each other .
this will affect our lives for a long time to come . " coffins are scheduled to begin arriving this week as many of the recovered bodies still await dna analysis for identification . harrowing experiences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish tourists line up to check in for a flight home at phuket international airport meanwhile , hundreds of stunned and skimpily-clad swedish holidaymakers have been arriving daily in airports around sweden .
most of them are still in shock and traumatized as they try to come to grips with the disaster that many only narrowly survived . one of them , daniel haag , who landed at stockholm 's arlanda airport , recalled the first moments when tragedy struck . " i woke up just as my hotel room filled with water , " haag said .
" i was under water for almost a minute before i came up again .
i managed to catch on to the trunk of a car that was floating in the debris and heave myself up , " he said .
" and then i ran for my life . " the extraordinarily high number of swedish tourists in thailand is blamed on the weather , with many wishing to leave the nordic realms to escape the dark winter cold for sunnier locations . in total , some 4,500 people from sweden , norway , denmark and finland are missing . search for the missing however , the search for the missing has been hampered by the widespread destruction wrought by the tidal waves in the region . even as mass graves are dug in the face of fast-decomposing corpses , officials warn that all the bodies of the tourists may never be recovered because many could be washed out to sea . on sunday , persson 's government pushed for another search of the andaman sea coastline by thai and japanese navy vessels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a thai elephant clears debris near bang nieng beach in khao lak , thailand elephants have also joined the search for bodies in the popular khao lak tourist paradise in thailand , heading into debris-strewn forests with rescue teams to retrieve corpses where heavy earth-moving equipment can not go . government faces flak even as sweden reels from the disaster , prime minister persson and his center-left social democrats face scathing criticism for what many regard as failure to take prompt action following the tragedy . foreign minister laila freivalds and foreign aid minister carin jamtin have admitted that the government waited too long - four full days after the disaster took place - to send planes outfitted with doctors and medical supplies to the aid of citizens stranded in thailand . eight out of ten respondents to an internet poll of 5,289 people conducted by swedish daily svenska dagbladet said the government had mismanaged the crisis . lack of disaster management ? many have also drawn parallels to sweden 's last big tragedy 10 years ago , when 551 swedes died as the " estonia " ferry sank off the baltic coast .
at the time a committee investigating swedish rescue efforts after the sinking of the estonia recommended setting up a national disaster management system . but , that still has n't happened .
" i would have hoped that one would have drawn lessons from the estonia tragedy , " said kent härstedt , a social democratic parliamentarian .
" actually , there should have been a commissioner for such catastrophes and an authority that coordinates everything . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl nilsson of lulo , sweden , poses with a sigh saying his parent and brothers are missing in phuket , thailand .
but persson 's government has rejected the accusations . " we decided against a big authority for disaster management because it would only work in times of crisis and have nothing to do in normal times , " lars danielsson , a member of persson 's cabinet said . " instead we 're relying on existing mechanisms which are much more effective , " he added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.01.2005 croatian presidential race enters run-off großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatian president stipe mesic hopes for another five years croatia ’ s pro-western president stipe mesic narrowly missed victory on sunday , falling just below the 50-percent mark needed to win re-election outright .
a run-off against jadranka kosor has been scheduled . on monday , official results showed croatia ’ s incumbent president had won the first round of elections , taking 49 percent of the vote compared to conservative candidate deputy prime minister kosor of the ruling croatian democratic union -lrb- hdz -rrb- , who received 20.18 percent of the ballots .
mesic ’ s take , however , was not enough to secure an outright victory , and the presidential race will go into a second round on jan .
16 , the electoral commission reported . mesic , who has his sites fixed on leading his country into the european union during the next five years , was jubilant after the results were announced .
although election precincts reported a lower than expected turnout , he said he was pleased with the outcome .
his candidacy has been endorsed by the three main center-left opposition parties who were defeated by the hdz in 2003 . the 70-year-old mesic called on all people in the former war-torn yugoslav republic to turn out in full strength for the run-off in two weeks . “ croatia must be a modern , european and democratic country with satisfied citizens , " he said .
" it will be possible only if we change many things .
we will decide where croatia is heading , to the 21st century or back in time . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voters cast their ballots at the polling station in zagreb , croatia on jan .
2 , 2005 .
about 4.4 million people , including 400,000 croats living abroad , voted .
observers believe mesic will most likely win a second term in the run-off against the more conservative kosor , who is widely seen as a close ally of prime minister ivo sanader . “ i think kosor has little chance of winning in the second round , ” analyst nenad zakosek told reuters after results were released just after midnight . a first for women kosor , who is the first woman to run for the presidency , said she was very pleased with the results of the first ballot . “ i am very happy that for the first time we have two candidates , one of which is a woman , ” she said .
“ this shows the maturity of voters since the most frequent question during the campaign was whether croatia was mature enough to have a woman for a president . ” the former journalist and deputy prime minister responsible for families and war veterans has stood by prime minister sanader and his efforts to turn the hdz from its nationalist past to a modern pro-european party . analysts , however , have criticized her campaign as lacking popular appeal and a strong political personality .
her position on the ballot was hotly contested by croatian-us businessman boris miksic , who finished third with 17.8 percent of the vote . the strong showing of miksic , an outsider on croatia ’ s political scene whose support was not expected to break out of the single digits , was described as a protest vote . ” this is a protest of croatian voters against the politics being led here , ” vesna pusic , a lawmaker with a leftist opposition party told afp . mesic and kosor both pledged a better future for croatians along the same lines – eu membership , the strengthening of the rule of law and fighting corruption . paving the way to europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatian president stipe mesic mesic , who said he was confident of winning re-election , owes much of his popularity to the role he played in ending the balkan nation ’ s international isolation and completing its democratic reforms after succeeding authoritarian leader franjo tudjman . he significantly reduced presidential powers as the country turned into a parliamentary democracy following changes in 2000 .
however , the president remains the supreme commander of the military and a co-creator of foreign policy along with the prime minister . the president will also oversee croatia ’ s entry into the european union , which is planned for 2009 .
croatia has been put on a fast track to accession with brussels deciding last month to launch membership talks in march .
zagreb hopes to fulfil membership criteria by 2007 but its bid depends on full cooperation with the un war crimes tribunal following the balkans wars of the 1990s which will be closely monitored by brussels . mesic has vowed to deliver the war crimes suspects to the international court , despite strong criticism from war veterans and nationalists . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de green lights for balkan trio the eu commission agrees to a date for romania and bulgaria to sign accession treaties and for croatia to start entry talks .

3 , he was most feted for his work as the architect of modern china . the birthplace of china 's future architectural landmarks is the modest headquarters of von gerkan , marg , and partners -lrb- gmp -rrb- , overlooking the elbe river in hamburg , germany .
in addition to churches and two trade fair centers , the company is working on the ambitious luchao harbor city , a seaport for 300,000 inhabitants near shanghai . not long ago , gmp also won the competition to build a " grand theater " in qingdao , china .
now , they 'll be the ones to erect a cultural complex with three auditoriums for 3,300 audience members .
and until 2007 , the german firm will also be working on another prestige project - china 's new national museum in beijing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg architect meinhard von gerkan " we try to boil every design down to a few core questions , in order to find the most natural answer , " said von gerkan when asked to characterize his company 's concept . this approach is n't only evident in china but also in germany , von gerkan 's home .
lübeck 's congress hall , the new airports in hamburg and stuttgart , berlin 's new lehrter train station and dresdner bank office , or the new lecture halls for the technical university in chemnitz - despite plentiful use of steel and glass , meinhard von gerkan 's buildings never seem cold .
his work is a combination of timeless , modern elements and subtle , contemporary concessions . bildunterschrift : lecture halls at the technical university in chemnitz ; plan for a new football stadium in munich humble beginnings von gerkan was born in the latvian capital , riga , but after fleeing the east , grew up as an orphan with a foster family in hamburg .
he first studied law and then physics before switching to architecture . as students , von gerkan and his future partner volkwin marg began winning design competitions for other architects .
that laid the foundation for the success of their company , gmp .
forty years ago , the pair won the competition to design berlin 's tegel airport , and since then , they 've collected more than 160 top prizes . under marg 's direction , the firm completed down-to-earth projects like hamburg 's hanse-viertel downtown district , or the neue messe trade fair center in leipzig .
in contrast , von gerkan always pursued the novel .
today , the pair employ around 300 staff at their " idea factory , " which has several subsidiaries in addition to the hamburg headquarters . bildunterschrift : meinhard von gerkan , luchao harbor city in reality , von gerkan is n't a " star architect , " but rather , he 's known for being publicity-shy .
still , he is noticeably proud of gmp 's success in china .
the new national museum in beijing will have the dimensions of a giant congress hall - larger than three football fields . " we have to have something to set against the adjoining gigantic open space of tiananmen square , " von gerkan said .
with analogies to historic temple architecture , his plan attempts to meld the old and the new .
" for me , it 's important that people feel comfortable in a new building and are able to find that bridge to their own culture .

26 , 2004 . the massive tidal waves triggered by an undersea quake in the indian ocean reduced the postcard perfect holiday destinations into a scene of death and destruction .
tens of thousands of western tourists , among them an estimated 10,000 german holidaymakers , were swept up in the chaos and devastation . many did n't survive .
about half of thailand 's estimated 5,000 dead are believed to be foreigners .
the german government has confirmed that 60 nationals are dead while the search continues for more than 1,000 missing germans . a slow path to normalcy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volunteers help wash away tidal wave debris on patong beach , thailand more than a week after the disaster , efforts are underway in thailand to restore a degree of normalcy to its battered tourism industry , the second-biggest source of revenue for the country .
clean-up work is in full swing among the damaged tourist resorts on thailand 's southwestern coastal strip and even bars and discotheques are gradually reopening . but , for german tourists who survived the harrowing tragedy like reinhard janisch , a return to normal life will take time . janisch , who is from oberhausen in germany 's ruhr region , was caught unawares by the tidal waves while vacationing on the island of phuket . " when the wave came from the back , i did n't turn round any more , " janisch said , remembering the full force of the encounter .
" i thought a car hit me from the back . " the massive wall of water pushed janisch on the ground where he was pinned between beach chairs and floating debris . " i tried to free myself ´ , " he said .
" you know , you develop strength somehow .
i do n't know why .
and then i continued on . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tourist roland linz , 36 , a survivor at the damaged khao lak-lam ru national park in thailand miraculously , janisch managed to escape with just a few cuts and bruises . " my entire knee is cut up , " he said .
" but nothing 's broken .
you know , the doctors were amazed that we got out of there without any broken bones .

3 , he was most feted for his work as the architect of modern china . the birthplace of china 's future architectural landmarks is the modest headquarters of von gerkan , marg , and partners -lrb- gmp -rrb- , overlooking the elbe river in hamburg , germany .
in addition to churches and two trade fair centers , the company is working on the ambitious luchao harbor city , a seaport for 300,000 inhabitants near shanghai . not long ago , gmp also won the competition to build a " grand theater " in qingdao , china .
now , they 'll be the ones to erect a cultural complex with three auditoriums for 3,300 audience members .
and until 2007 , the german firm will also be working on another prestige project - china 's new national museum in beijing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg architect meinhard von gerkan " we try to boil every design down to a few core questions , in order to find the most natural answer , " said von gerkan when asked to characterize his company 's concept . this approach is n't only evident in china but also in germany , von gerkan 's home .
lübeck 's congress hall , the new airports in hamburg and stuttgart , berlin 's new lehrter train station and dresdner bank office , or the new lecture halls for the technical university in chemnitz - despite plentiful use of steel and glass , meinhard von gerkan 's buildings never seem cold .
his work is a combination of timeless , modern elements and subtle , contemporary concessions . bildunterschrift : lecture halls at the technical university in chemnitz ; plan for a new football stadium in munich humble beginnings von gerkan was born in the latvian capital , riga , but after fleeing the east , grew up as an orphan with a foster family in hamburg .
he first studied law and then physics before switching to architecture . as students , von gerkan and his future partner volkwin marg began winning design competitions for other architects .
that laid the foundation for the success of their company , gmp .
forty years ago , the pair won the competition to design berlin 's tegel airport , and since then , they 've collected more than 160 top prizes . under marg 's direction , the firm completed down-to-earth projects like hamburg 's hanse-viertel downtown district , or the neue messe trade fair center in leipzig .
in contrast , von gerkan always pursued the novel .
today , the pair employ around 300 staff at their " idea factory , " which has several subsidiaries in addition to the hamburg headquarters . bildunterschrift : meinhard von gerkan , luchao harbor city in reality , von gerkan is n't a " star architect , " but rather , he 's known for being publicity-shy .
still , he is noticeably proud of gmp 's success in china .
the new national museum in beijing will have the dimensions of a giant congress hall - larger than three football fields . " we have to have something to set against the adjoining gigantic open space of tiananmen square , " von gerkan said .
with analogies to historic temple architecture , his plan attempts to meld the old and the new .
" for me , it 's important that people feel comfortable in a new building and are able to find that bridge to their own culture . " dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de catching the slow boat to china hamburg-based architects gerkan , marg und partner have won an international competition to build the national museum of china in beijing .

26 , 2004 . the massive tidal waves triggered by an undersea quake in the indian ocean reduced the postcard perfect holiday destinations into a scene of death and destruction .
tens of thousands of western tourists , among them an estimated 10,000 german holidaymakers , were swept up in the chaos and devastation . many did n't survive .
about half of thailand 's estimated 5,000 dead are believed to be foreigners .
the german government has confirmed that 60 nationals are dead while the search continues for more than 1,000 missing germans . a slow path to normalcy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volunteers help wash away tidal wave debris on patong beach , thailand more than a week after the disaster , efforts are underway in thailand to restore a degree of normalcy to its battered tourism industry , the second-biggest source of revenue for the country .

you do n't feel anything at first in the water .
you could cut off your arm and you would n't notice it . " it was only when he saw the corpses of other vacationers and local people lined up in the hospital that janisch realized just how lucky he was to be alive . " born again , you can say , " he said .

berlin is to place a further stake of 12 percent in deutsche post , valued at an estimated € 1.7 billion -lrb- $ 2.3 billion -rrb- with the bank , which the government traditionally uses as a privatization vehicle , next week , the spokeswoman said .
once the transaction had been completed , berlin 's direct shareholding in deutsche post would sink to eight percent , while kfw 's would rise to 48 percent , the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung calculated .
the government usually places its shares in state-owned companies with kfw which then sells them on the open market when conditions are favorable .

a run-off against jadranka kosor has been scheduled . on monday , official results showed croatia ’ s incumbent president had won the first round of elections , taking 49 percent of the vote compared to conservative candidate deputy prime minister kosor of the ruling croatian democratic union -lrb- hdz -rrb- , who received 20.18 percent of the ballots .
mesic ’ s take , however , was not enough to secure an outright victory , and the presidential race will go into a second round on jan .
16 , the electoral commission reported . mesic , who has his sites fixed on leading his country into the european union during the next five years , was jubilant after the results were announced .
although election precincts reported a lower than expected turnout , he said he was pleased with the outcome .
his candidacy has been endorsed by the three main center-left opposition parties who were defeated by the hdz in 2003 . the 70-year-old mesic called on all people in the former war-torn yugoslav republic to turn out in full strength for the run-off in two weeks . “ croatia must be a modern , european and democratic country with satisfied citizens , " he said .
" it will be possible only if we change many things .
we will decide where croatia is heading , to the 21st century or back in time . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voters cast their ballots at the polling station in zagreb , croatia on jan .
2 , 2005 .
about 4.4 million people , including 400,000 croats living abroad , voted .
observers believe mesic will most likely win a second term in the run-off against the more conservative kosor , who is widely seen as a close ally of prime minister ivo sanader . “ i think kosor has little chance of winning in the second round , ” analyst nenad zakosek told reuters after results were released just after midnight . a first for women kosor , who is the first woman to run for the presidency , said she was very pleased with the results of the first ballot . “ i am very happy that for the first time we have two candidates , one of which is a woman , ” she said .
“ this shows the maturity of voters since the most frequent question during the campaign was whether croatia was mature enough to have a woman for a president . ” the former journalist and deputy prime minister responsible for families and war veterans has stood by prime minister sanader and his efforts to turn the hdz from its nationalist past to a modern pro-european party . analysts , however , have criticized her campaign as lacking popular appeal and a strong political personality .
her position on the ballot was hotly contested by croatian-us businessman boris miksic , who finished third with 17.8 percent of the vote . the strong showing of miksic , an outsider on croatia ’ s political scene whose support was not expected to break out of the single digits , was described as a protest vote . ” this is a protest of croatian voters against the politics being led here , ” vesna pusic , a lawmaker with a leftist opposition party told afp . mesic and kosor both pledged a better future for croatians along the same lines – eu membership , the strengthening of the rule of law and fighting corruption . paving the way to europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatian president stipe mesic mesic , who said he was confident of winning re-election , owes much of his popularity to the role he played in ending the balkan nation ’ s international isolation and completing its democratic reforms after succeeding authoritarian leader franjo tudjman . he significantly reduced presidential powers as the country turned into a parliamentary democracy following changes in 2000 .
however , the president remains the supreme commander of the military and a co-creator of foreign policy along with the prime minister . the president will also oversee croatia ’ s entry into the european union , which is planned for 2009 .
croatia has been put on a fast track to accession with brussels deciding last month to launch membership talks in march .
zagreb hopes to fulfil membership criteria by 2007 but its bid depends on full cooperation with the un war crimes tribunal following the balkans wars of the 1990s which will be closely monitored by brussels . mesic has vowed to deliver the war crimes suspects to the international court , despite strong criticism from war veterans and nationalists . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de green lights for balkan trio the eu commission agrees to a date for romania and bulgaria to sign accession treaties and for croatia to start entry talks .

a run-off against jadranka kosor has been scheduled . on monday , official results showed croatia ’ s incumbent president had won the first round of elections , taking 49 percent of the vote compared to conservative candidate deputy prime minister kosor of the ruling croatian democratic union -lrb- hdz -rrb- , who received 20.18 percent of the ballots .
mesic ’ s take , however , was not enough to secure an outright victory , and the presidential race will go into a second round on jan .
16 , the electoral commission reported . mesic , who has his sites fixed on leading his country into the european union during the next five years , was jubilant after the results were announced .
although election precincts reported a lower than expected turnout , he said he was pleased with the outcome .
his candidacy has been endorsed by the three main center-left opposition parties who were defeated by the hdz in 2003 . the 70-year-old mesic called on all people in the former war-torn yugoslav republic to turn out in full strength for the run-off in two weeks . “ croatia must be a modern , european and democratic country with satisfied citizens , " he said .
" it will be possible only if we change many things .
we will decide where croatia is heading , to the 21st century or back in time . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voters cast their ballots at the polling station in zagreb , croatia on jan .
2 , 2005 .
about 4.4 million people , including 400,000 croats living abroad , voted .
observers believe mesic will most likely win a second term in the run-off against the more conservative kosor , who is widely seen as a close ally of prime minister ivo sanader . “ i think kosor has little chance of winning in the second round , ” analyst nenad zakosek told reuters after results were released just after midnight . a first for women kosor , who is the first woman to run for the presidency , said she was very pleased with the results of the first ballot . “ i am very happy that for the first time we have two candidates , one of which is a woman , ” she said .
“ this shows the maturity of voters since the most frequent question during the campaign was whether croatia was mature enough to have a woman for a president . ” the former journalist and deputy prime minister responsible for families and war veterans has stood by prime minister sanader and his efforts to turn the hdz from its nationalist past to a modern pro-european party . analysts , however , have criticized her campaign as lacking popular appeal and a strong political personality .
her position on the ballot was hotly contested by croatian-us businessman boris miksic , who finished third with 17.8 percent of the vote . the strong showing of miksic , an outsider on croatia ’ s political scene whose support was not expected to break out of the single digits , was described as a protest vote . ” this is a protest of croatian voters against the politics being led here , ” vesna pusic , a lawmaker with a leftist opposition party told afp . mesic and kosor both pledged a better future for croatians along the same lines – eu membership , the strengthening of the rule of law and fighting corruption . paving the way to europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatian president stipe mesic mesic , who said he was confident of winning re-election , owes much of his popularity to the role he played in ending the balkan nation ’ s international isolation and completing its democratic reforms after succeeding authoritarian leader franjo tudjman . he significantly reduced presidential powers as the country turned into a parliamentary democracy following changes in 2000 .
however , the president remains the supreme commander of the military and a co-creator of foreign policy along with the prime minister . the president will also oversee croatia ’ s entry into the european union , which is planned for 2009 .
croatia has been put on a fast track to accession with brussels deciding last month to launch membership talks in march .
zagreb hopes to fulfil membership criteria by 2007 but its bid depends on full cooperation with the un war crimes tribunal following the balkans wars of the 1990s which will be closely monitored by brussels . mesic has vowed to deliver the war crimes suspects to the international court , despite strong criticism from war veterans and nationalists . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de green lights for balkan trio the eu commission agrees to a date for romania and bulgaria to sign accession treaties and for croatia to start entry talks .

his candidacy has been endorsed by the three main center-left opposition parties who were defeated by the hdz in 2003 . the 70-year-old mesic called on all people in the former war-torn yugoslav republic to turn out in full strength for the run-off in two weeks . “ croatia must be a modern , european and democratic country with satisfied citizens , " he said .
" it will be possible only if we change many things .

about 4.4 million people , including 400,000 croats living abroad , voted .
observers believe mesic will most likely win a second term in the run-off against the more conservative kosor , who is widely seen as a close ally of prime minister ivo sanader . “ i think kosor has little chance of winning in the second round , ” analyst nenad zakosek told reuters after results were released just after midnight . a first for women kosor , who is the first woman to run for the presidency , said she was very pleased with the results of the first ballot . “ i am very happy that for the first time we have two candidates , one of which is a woman , ” she said .

her position on the ballot was hotly contested by croatian-us businessman boris miksic , who finished third with 17.8 percent of the vote . the strong showing of miksic , an outsider on croatia ’ s political scene whose support was not expected to break out of the single digits , was described as a protest vote . ” this is a protest of croatian voters against the politics being led here , ” vesna pusic , a lawmaker with a leftist opposition party told afp . mesic and kosor both pledged a better future for croatians along the same lines – eu membership , the strengthening of the rule of law and fighting corruption . paving the way to europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatian president stipe mesic mesic , who said he was confident of winning re-election , owes much of his popularity to the role he played in ending the balkan nation ’ s international isolation and completing its democratic reforms after succeeding authoritarian leader franjo tudjman . he significantly reduced presidential powers as the country turned into a parliamentary democracy following changes in 2000 .

berlin is to place a further stake of 12 percent in deutsche post , valued at an estimated € 1.7 billion -lrb- $ 2.3 billion -rrb- with the bank , which the government traditionally uses as a privatization vehicle , next week , the spokeswoman said .
once the transaction had been completed , berlin 's direct shareholding in deutsche post would sink to eight percent , while kfw 's would rise to 48 percent , the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung calculated .
the government usually places its shares in state-owned companies with kfw which then sells them on the open market when conditions are favorable .

3 , he was most feted for his work as the architect of modern china . the birthplace of china 's future architectural landmarks is the modest headquarters of von gerkan , marg , and partners -lrb- gmp -rrb- , overlooking the elbe river in hamburg , germany .
in addition to churches and two trade fair centers , the company is working on the ambitious luchao harbor city , a seaport for 300,000 inhabitants near shanghai . not long ago , gmp also won the competition to build a " grand theater " in qingdao , china .
now , they 'll be the ones to erect a cultural complex with three auditoriums for 3,300 audience members .
and until 2007 , the german firm will also be working on another prestige project - china 's new national museum in beijing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg architect meinhard von gerkan " we try to boil every design down to a few core questions , in order to find the most natural answer , " said von gerkan when asked to characterize his company 's concept . this approach is n't only evident in china but also in germany , von gerkan 's home .
lübeck 's congress hall , the new airports in hamburg and stuttgart , berlin 's new lehrter train station and dresdner bank office , or the new lecture halls for the technical university in chemnitz - despite plentiful use of steel and glass , meinhard von gerkan 's buildings never seem cold .
his work is a combination of timeless , modern elements and subtle , contemporary concessions . bildunterschrift : lecture halls at the technical university in chemnitz ; plan for a new football stadium in munich humble beginnings von gerkan was born in the latvian capital , riga , but after fleeing the east , grew up as an orphan with a foster family in hamburg .
he first studied law and then physics before switching to architecture . as students , von gerkan and his future partner volkwin marg began winning design competitions for other architects .
that laid the foundation for the success of their company , gmp .
forty years ago , the pair won the competition to design berlin 's tegel airport , and since then , they 've collected more than 160 top prizes . under marg 's direction , the firm completed down-to-earth projects like hamburg 's hanse-viertel downtown district , or the neue messe trade fair center in leipzig .
in contrast , von gerkan always pursued the novel .
today , the pair employ around 300 staff at their " idea factory , " which has several subsidiaries in addition to the hamburg headquarters . bildunterschrift : meinhard von gerkan , luchao harbor city in reality , von gerkan is n't a " star architect , " but rather , he 's known for being publicity-shy .
still , he is noticeably proud of gmp 's success in china .
the new national museum in beijing will have the dimensions of a giant congress hall - larger than three football fields . " we have to have something to set against the adjoining gigantic open space of tiananmen square , " von gerkan said .
with analogies to historic temple architecture , his plan attempts to meld the old and the new .
" for me , it 's important that people feel comfortable in a new building and are able to find that bridge to their own culture .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 03.01.2005 a gruesome task for criminologists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many bodies will never be identified in the wake of last week ’ s tsunamis , some 300 experts are working around the clock to identify victims .
with more than 30 years experience , germany has sent its team of forensic scientists to the region . no matter where a catastrophe strikes , when germans are among its victims , the identification commission of the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- is called into action - the 1998 train disaster in eschede , the 2000 concorde crash in paris and now the tsunamis in south asia .
disasters that leave victims unrecognizable are the special focus of germany ’ s forensic science team . victims from many nations since dec .
29 , the german identification commission has been deployed to thailand where they are working around the clock to determine the identity of drowning victims , many of whom have been mutilated and dismembered by the torrential floods and distorted beyond recognition as their corpses begin to deteriorate in the tropical heat . even though time is of the essence – with each day , the number of new victims continues to grow while decay begins to set in – the forensic scientists could not begin their work until the start of the new year , after receiving the go-ahead from the thai government .
with experts from 19 different nations involved in the rescue and removal operation , it was crucial to coordinate methods .
it is the first time so many victims from so many different countries needed to be identified . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a foreigner tourist looks at photographs of survivors at the damaged khao lak national park .
the most difficult work for the criminologists will be in the tourist resorts of phuket and khao lak , where a buddhist temple has been converted into a makeshift morgue .
more than 300 corpses are stacked in the temple awaiting identification .
some 20 percent are estimated to be those of foreigners . “ i fear it ’ s a very high number of german victims , ” said peter finger , spokesman for the german embassy in bangkok . identifying victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bodies of victims are covered in plastic and stacked before they can be identified according to dirk büchner , spokesman for the bka , there are three key methods for determining the identity of a victim : fingerprints , dental analysis and dna .
but each of these requires a good deal of time and depends on comparing with available sample data from relatives . “ it could be a hair , a fingerprint or the x-rays from a dentist , ” büchner said .
serial numbers from pace makers or an artificial hip could help provide information on a victim ’ s identity as do eye color , the shape of earlobes , scars or tattoos . if a victim can not be immediately identified , the forensic scientists take a sample of dna from the thigh bone and save it for later comparison .
to keep track of individual corpses , an electronic chip is attached to the body . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pyres of victims who were killed by tidal waves burn on the beach at alappad , in the southern indian state of kerala , wednesday , dec .

the german government now praises the technology which has been held up for 16 months by technical flaws costing germany billions in lost revenues . the expected long traffic jams at german border crossing points failed to materialize on monday morning and highway service stations also weren ’ t crammed with truckers at stationary toll machines .
german authorities say the country ’ s satellite-based tolls system is up and running smoothly and that trucking companies have apparently been well-prepared for the start of the system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an automatic toll surveillance bridge on a german highway " all parts of the system are working flawlessly , " said felix stenschke , a spokesman for the ministry of transportation .

" we ’ ve repeatedly told our customers that german haulers are unable to carry the extra costs resulting from the toll system , " he said .
" our customers accepted that and said they saw no other alternative than passing them on to product prices paid by consumers . " the german government expects about € 2.5 billion in truck toll revenues each year .
in addition , it is currently seeking billions of euros in compensation from toll collect for 16 months of lost revenues .

transport minister manfred stolpe -lrb- photo below -rrb- said truckers in neighboring poland and the netherlands were especially well prepared on monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe " i ’ ve been surprised by two things , " he said .
" first of all the number of on-board units ordered and installed by polish and dutch companies – the two countries which in my view are best prepared for the new system .
and secondly the degree of training undergone by truckers in advance . “ hefty fines but during the first two days after the toll system began operating , the government also nabbed about 500 fee dodgers .
they neither had special on-board units in their cabins that automatically pay the tolls nor did they pay for their journeys at toll machines set up in service stations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a picture of one of the first toll dodgers the dodgers were fined € 75 -lrb- $ 101 -rrb- and face a much stiffer penalty of up to € 20,000 if they will be caught again . rüdiger petri , a spokesman for the association of german hauliers , said the toll system will also lead to higher prices for german consumers . " we ’ ve repeatedly told our customers that german haulers are unable to carry the extra costs resulting from the toll system , " he said .
" our customers accepted that and said they saw no other alternative than passing them on to product prices paid by consumers . " the german government expects about € 2.5 billion in truck toll revenues each year .
in addition , it is currently seeking billions of euros in compensation from toll collect for 16 months of lost revenues .

a run-off against jadranka kosor has been scheduled . on monday , official results showed croatia ’ s incumbent president had won the first round of elections , taking 49 percent of the vote compared to conservative candidate deputy prime minister kosor of the ruling croatian democratic union -lrb- hdz -rrb- , who received 20.18 percent of the ballots .
mesic ’ s take , however , was not enough to secure an outright victory , and the presidential race will go into a second round on jan .
16 , the electoral commission reported . mesic , who has his sites fixed on leading his country into the european union during the next five years , was jubilant after the results were announced .
although election precincts reported a lower than expected turnout , he said he was pleased with the outcome .
his candidacy has been endorsed by the three main center-left opposition parties who were defeated by the hdz in 2003 . the 70-year-old mesic called on all people in the former war-torn yugoslav republic to turn out in full strength for the run-off in two weeks . “ croatia must be a modern , european and democratic country with satisfied citizens , " he said .
" it will be possible only if we change many things .
we will decide where croatia is heading , to the 21st century or back in time . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voters cast their ballots at the polling station in zagreb , croatia on jan .
2 , 2005 .
about 4.4 million people , including 400,000 croats living abroad , voted .
observers believe mesic will most likely win a second term in the run-off against the more conservative kosor , who is widely seen as a close ally of prime minister ivo sanader . “ i think kosor has little chance of winning in the second round , ” analyst nenad zakosek told reuters after results were released just after midnight . a first for women kosor , who is the first woman to run for the presidency , said she was very pleased with the results of the first ballot . “ i am very happy that for the first time we have two candidates , one of which is a woman , ” she said .
“ this shows the maturity of voters since the most frequent question during the campaign was whether croatia was mature enough to have a woman for a president . ” the former journalist and deputy prime minister responsible for families and war veterans has stood by prime minister sanader and his efforts to turn the hdz from its nationalist past to a modern pro-european party . analysts , however , have criticized her campaign as lacking popular appeal and a strong political personality .
her position on the ballot was hotly contested by croatian-us businessman boris miksic , who finished third with 17.8 percent of the vote . the strong showing of miksic , an outsider on croatia ’ s political scene whose support was not expected to break out of the single digits , was described as a protest vote . ” this is a protest of croatian voters against the politics being led here , ” vesna pusic , a lawmaker with a leftist opposition party told afp . mesic and kosor both pledged a better future for croatians along the same lines – eu membership , the strengthening of the rule of law and fighting corruption . paving the way to europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatian president stipe mesic mesic , who said he was confident of winning re-election , owes much of his popularity to the role he played in ending the balkan nation ’ s international isolation and completing its democratic reforms after succeeding authoritarian leader franjo tudjman . he significantly reduced presidential powers as the country turned into a parliamentary democracy following changes in 2000 .
however , the president remains the supreme commander of the military and a co-creator of foreign policy along with the prime minister . the president will also oversee croatia ’ s entry into the european union , which is planned for 2009 .
croatia has been put on a fast track to accession with brussels deciding last month to launch membership talks in march .
zagreb hopes to fulfil membership criteria by 2007 but its bid depends on full cooperation with the un war crimes tribunal following the balkans wars of the 1990s which will be closely monitored by brussels . mesic has vowed to deliver the war crimes suspects to the international court , despite strong criticism from war veterans and nationalists . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de green lights for balkan trio the eu commission agrees to a date for romania and bulgaria to sign accession treaties and for croatia to start entry talks .

the german government now praises the technology which has been held up for 16 months by technical flaws costing germany billions in lost revenues . the expected long traffic jams at german border crossing points failed to materialize on monday morning and highway service stations also weren ’ t crammed with truckers at stationary toll machines .
german authorities say the country ’ s satellite-based tolls system is up and running smoothly and that trucking companies have apparently been well-prepared for the start of the system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an automatic toll surveillance bridge on a german highway " all parts of the system are working flawlessly , " said felix stenschke , a spokesman for the ministry of transportation .
" at the moment there is still only little traffic on german highways but nevertheless we are completely satisfied .
one year ago the situation was quite the contrary . " earlier problems the pioneering toll system is based on satellite technology which in the past 16 months was plagued by technical problems .
the delays were a major embarrassment for toll collect – the consortium made up of automaker daimlerchrysler , deutsche telekom and french motoway operator cofiroute which developed the system . germany has europe ’ s busiest highways and is now charging an average of 12 and a half eurocents -lrb- 10 us cents -rrb- per kilometer -lrb- 0.6 miles -rrb- .
about one third of the trucks that use its 12-thousand-kilometer highway network are foreign .
transport minister manfred stolpe -lrb- photo below -rrb- said truckers in neighboring poland and the netherlands were especially well prepared on monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe " i ’ ve been surprised by two things , " he said .
" first of all the number of on-board units ordered and installed by polish and dutch companies – the two countries which in my view are best prepared for the new system .
and secondly the degree of training undergone by truckers in advance . “ hefty fines but during the first two days after the toll system began operating , the government also nabbed about 500 fee dodgers .
they neither had special on-board units in their cabins that automatically pay the tolls nor did they pay for their journeys at toll machines set up in service stations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a picture of one of the first toll dodgers the dodgers were fined € 75 -lrb- $ 101 -rrb- and face a much stiffer penalty of up to € 20,000 if they will be caught again . rüdiger petri , a spokesman for the association of german hauliers , said the toll system will also lead to higher prices for german consumers . " we ’ ve repeatedly told our customers that german haulers are unable to carry the extra costs resulting from the toll system , " he said .
" our customers accepted that and said they saw no other alternative than passing them on to product prices paid by consumers . " the german government expects about € 2.5 billion in truck toll revenues each year .
in addition , it is currently seeking billions of euros in compensation from toll collect for 16 months of lost revenues .
but economics minister wolfgang clement also hopes the state-of-the-art system will be an export hit doing away with the old-fashioned booths that still cause traffic congestions in many other european countries . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german road toll prepares for launch after a catolog of catastrophic technical faults and management blunders , germany ’ s road toll system for heavy vehicles is now scheduled for a january launch after its successful test phase ended on wednesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.01.2005 few protest as welfare cuts take hold großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-reform demonstrators in mainz a small number of protestors hit the streets in 10 german cities monday , a day after a sweeping reform of welfare payments aimed to cut long-term unemployment went into effect . unfazed by the protests , labor and economics minister wolfgang clement -lrb- photo below -rrb- told the weekly bild am sonntag he was confident " that the most comprehensive reform of the job market in the history of the federal republic of germany will eventually be a success . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement " i will be responsible for its success or failure , " he added . the controversial package of labor market reforms known as hartz iv will have a wide-reaching impact on the lives of 4.5 million people out of work in what is still europe 's economic powerhouse .
it is impossible to tell for the moment exactly how many unemployed will lose money under the new system or who will benefit from the changes . but those expected to feel the changes hardest are the long-term jobless and the 2.7 million people who the federal labor agency says have used up their benefits and now receive only minimum welfare payments .
the agency says less than 10 percent will lose their welfare payments altogether , a figure the unions reject .
they put the figure at 27 percent and say 48 percent will have their income reduced . to calculate the new benefits , the federal labor agency analyzes peoples ' estate , their expenditure and their needs , which is already sparking controversy .
generous system the government argues that overhauling germany 's generous social welfare system - once envied throughout the world - will persuade people who have been out of work for more than a year to accept a job , no matter how low paid .
but support groups for the unemployed have criticized a move they say will make the poor poorer . other observers have called for recognition that even after the reforms are introduced , the german welfare state will be relatively generous to the unemployed .
for example , the point at which the value of an unemployed person 's residential property is taken into consideration is € 200,000 -lrb- $ 270,000 -rrb- and only 9 percent of homes in western germany and three percent in eastern germany are valued higher . bildunterschrift : few protestors gathered outside a labor office in the western german town of duisburg on tuesday monday 's protests came in the wake of demonstrations last year which were held for weeks on mondays , similar to rallies which brought down former east germany 's communist regime in 1989 .
anti-hartz iv monday protests eventually fizzled out but widespread unease with the reform translated into severe electoral blows for chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de one euro , one way out of unemployment ?

3 , he was most feted for his work as the architect of modern china . the birthplace of china 's future architectural landmarks is the modest headquarters of von gerkan , marg , and partners -lrb- gmp -rrb- , overlooking the elbe river in hamburg , germany .
in addition to churches and two trade fair centers , the company is working on the ambitious luchao harbor city , a seaport for 300,000 inhabitants near shanghai . not long ago , gmp also won the competition to build a " grand theater " in qingdao , china .
now , they 'll be the ones to erect a cultural complex with three auditoriums for 3,300 audience members .
and until 2007 , the german firm will also be working on another prestige project - china 's new national museum in beijing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg architect meinhard von gerkan " we try to boil every design down to a few core questions , in order to find the most natural answer , " said von gerkan when asked to characterize his company 's concept . this approach is n't only evident in china but also in germany , von gerkan 's home .
lübeck 's congress hall , the new airports in hamburg and stuttgart , berlin 's new lehrter train station and dresdner bank office , or the new lecture halls for the technical university in chemnitz - despite plentiful use of steel and glass , meinhard von gerkan 's buildings never seem cold .
his work is a combination of timeless , modern elements and subtle , contemporary concessions . bildunterschrift : lecture halls at the technical university in chemnitz ; plan for a new football stadium in munich humble beginnings von gerkan was born in the latvian capital , riga , but after fleeing the east , grew up as an orphan with a foster family in hamburg .
he first studied law and then physics before switching to architecture . as students , von gerkan and his future partner volkwin marg began winning design competitions for other architects .
that laid the foundation for the success of their company , gmp .
forty years ago , the pair won the competition to design berlin 's tegel airport , and since then , they 've collected more than 160 top prizes . under marg 's direction , the firm completed down-to-earth projects like hamburg 's hanse-viertel downtown district , or the neue messe trade fair center in leipzig .
in contrast , von gerkan always pursued the novel .
today , the pair employ around 300 staff at their " idea factory , " which has several subsidiaries in addition to the hamburg headquarters . bildunterschrift : meinhard von gerkan , luchao harbor city in reality , von gerkan is n't a " star architect , " but rather , he 's known for being publicity-shy .
still , he is noticeably proud of gmp 's success in china .
the new national museum in beijing will have the dimensions of a giant congress hall - larger than three football fields . " we have to have something to set against the adjoining gigantic open space of tiananmen square , " von gerkan said .
with analogies to historic temple architecture , his plan attempts to meld the old and the new .
" for me , it 's important that people feel comfortable in a new building and are able to find that bridge to their own culture .

3 , he was most feted for his work as the architect of modern china . the birthplace of china 's future architectural landmarks is the modest headquarters of von gerkan , marg , and partners -lrb- gmp -rrb- , overlooking the elbe river in hamburg , germany .
in addition to churches and two trade fair centers , the company is working on the ambitious luchao harbor city , a seaport for 300,000 inhabitants near shanghai . not long ago , gmp also won the competition to build a " grand theater " in qingdao , china .
now , they 'll be the ones to erect a cultural complex with three auditoriums for 3,300 audience members .
and until 2007 , the german firm will also be working on another prestige project - china 's new national museum in beijing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg architect meinhard von gerkan " we try to boil every design down to a few core questions , in order to find the most natural answer , " said von gerkan when asked to characterize his company 's concept . this approach is n't only evident in china but also in germany , von gerkan 's home .
lübeck 's congress hall , the new airports in hamburg and stuttgart , berlin 's new lehrter train station and dresdner bank office , or the new lecture halls for the technical university in chemnitz - despite plentiful use of steel and glass , meinhard von gerkan 's buildings never seem cold .
his work is a combination of timeless , modern elements and subtle , contemporary concessions . bildunterschrift : lecture halls at the technical university in chemnitz ; plan for a new football stadium in munich humble beginnings von gerkan was born in the latvian capital , riga , but after fleeing the east , grew up as an orphan with a foster family in hamburg .
he first studied law and then physics before switching to architecture . as students , von gerkan and his future partner volkwin marg began winning design competitions for other architects .
that laid the foundation for the success of their company , gmp .
forty years ago , the pair won the competition to design berlin 's tegel airport , and since then , they 've collected more than 160 top prizes . under marg 's direction , the firm completed down-to-earth projects like hamburg 's hanse-viertel downtown district , or the neue messe trade fair center in leipzig .
in contrast , von gerkan always pursued the novel .
today , the pair employ around 300 staff at their " idea factory , " which has several subsidiaries in addition to the hamburg headquarters . bildunterschrift : meinhard von gerkan , luchao harbor city in reality , von gerkan is n't a " star architect , " but rather , he 's known for being publicity-shy .
still , he is noticeably proud of gmp 's success in china .
the new national museum in beijing will have the dimensions of a giant congress hall - larger than three football fields . " we have to have something to set against the adjoining gigantic open space of tiananmen square , " von gerkan said .
with analogies to historic temple architecture , his plan attempts to meld the old and the new .
" for me , it 's important that people feel comfortable in a new building and are able to find that bridge to their own culture .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.01.2005 few protest as welfare cuts take hold großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-reform demonstrators in mainz a small number of protestors hit the streets in 10 german cities monday , a day after a sweeping reform of welfare payments aimed to cut long-term unemployment went into effect . unfazed by the protests , labor and economics minister wolfgang clement -lrb- photo below -rrb- told the weekly bild am sonntag he was confident " that the most comprehensive reform of the job market in the history of the federal republic of germany will eventually be a success . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement " i will be responsible for its success or failure , " he added . the controversial package of labor market reforms known as hartz iv will have a wide-reaching impact on the lives of 4.5 million people out of work in what is still europe 's economic powerhouse .
it is impossible to tell for the moment exactly how many unemployed will lose money under the new system or who will benefit from the changes . but those expected to feel the changes hardest are the long-term jobless and the 2.7 million people who the federal labor agency says have used up their benefits and now receive only minimum welfare payments .
the agency says less than 10 percent will lose their welfare payments altogether , a figure the unions reject .
they put the figure at 27 percent and say 48 percent will have their income reduced . to calculate the new benefits , the federal labor agency analyzes peoples ' estate , their expenditure and their needs , which is already sparking controversy .
generous system the government argues that overhauling germany 's generous social welfare system - once envied throughout the world - will persuade people who have been out of work for more than a year to accept a job , no matter how low paid .
but support groups for the unemployed have criticized a move they say will make the poor poorer . other observers have called for recognition that even after the reforms are introduced , the german welfare state will be relatively generous to the unemployed .
for example , the point at which the value of an unemployed person 's residential property is taken into consideration is € 200,000 -lrb- $ 270,000 -rrb- and only 9 percent of homes in western germany and three percent in eastern germany are valued higher . bildunterschrift : few protestors gathered outside a labor office in the western german town of duisburg on tuesday monday 's protests came in the wake of demonstrations last year which were held for weeks on mondays , similar to rallies which brought down former east germany 's communist regime in 1989 .
anti-hartz iv monday protests eventually fizzled out but widespread unease with the reform translated into severe electoral blows for chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de one euro , one way out of unemployment ?

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement " i will be responsible for its success or failure , " he added . the controversial package of labor market reforms known as hartz iv will have a wide-reaching impact on the lives of 4.5 million people out of work in what is still europe 's economic powerhouse .
it is impossible to tell for the moment exactly how many unemployed will lose money under the new system or who will benefit from the changes . but those expected to feel the changes hardest are the long-term jobless and the 2.7 million people who the federal labor agency says have used up their benefits and now receive only minimum welfare payments .
the agency says less than 10 percent will lose their welfare payments altogether , a figure the unions reject .
they put the figure at 27 percent and say 48 percent will have their income reduced . to calculate the new benefits , the federal labor agency analyzes peoples ' estate , their expenditure and their needs , which is already sparking controversy .
generous system the government argues that overhauling germany 's generous social welfare system - once envied throughout the world - will persuade people who have been out of work for more than a year to accept a job , no matter how low paid .
but support groups for the unemployed have criticized a move they say will make the poor poorer . other observers have called for recognition that even after the reforms are introduced , the german welfare state will be relatively generous to the unemployed .
for example , the point at which the value of an unemployed person 's residential property is taken into consideration is € 200,000 -lrb- $ 270,000 -rrb- and only 9 percent of homes in western germany and three percent in eastern germany are valued higher . bildunterschrift : few protestors gathered outside a labor office in the western german town of duisburg on tuesday monday 's protests came in the wake of demonstrations last year which were held for weeks on mondays , similar to rallies which brought down former east germany 's communist regime in 1989 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.01.2005 croatian presidential race enters run-off großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatian president stipe mesic hopes for another five years croatia ’ s pro-western president stipe mesic narrowly missed victory on sunday , falling just below the 50-percent mark needed to win re-election outright .
a run-off against jadranka kosor has been scheduled . on monday , official results showed croatia ’ s incumbent president had won the first round of elections , taking 49 percent of the vote compared to conservative candidate deputy prime minister kosor of the ruling croatian democratic union -lrb- hdz -rrb- , who received 20.18 percent of the ballots .
mesic ’ s take , however , was not enough to secure an outright victory , and the presidential race will go into a second round on jan .
16 , the electoral commission reported . mesic , who has his sites fixed on leading his country into the european union during the next five years , was jubilant after the results were announced .
although election precincts reported a lower than expected turnout , he said he was pleased with the outcome .
his candidacy has been endorsed by the three main center-left opposition parties who were defeated by the hdz in 2003 . the 70-year-old mesic called on all people in the former war-torn yugoslav republic to turn out in full strength for the run-off in two weeks . “ croatia must be a modern , european and democratic country with satisfied citizens , " he said .
" it will be possible only if we change many things .
we will decide where croatia is heading , to the 21st century or back in time . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voters cast their ballots at the polling station in zagreb , croatia on jan .
2 , 2005 .
about 4.4 million people , including 400,000 croats living abroad , voted .
observers believe mesic will most likely win a second term in the run-off against the more conservative kosor , who is widely seen as a close ally of prime minister ivo sanader . “ i think kosor has little chance of winning in the second round , ” analyst nenad zakosek told reuters after results were released just after midnight . a first for women kosor , who is the first woman to run for the presidency , said she was very pleased with the results of the first ballot . “ i am very happy that for the first time we have two candidates , one of which is a woman , ” she said .
“ this shows the maturity of voters since the most frequent question during the campaign was whether croatia was mature enough to have a woman for a president . ” the former journalist and deputy prime minister responsible for families and war veterans has stood by prime minister sanader and his efforts to turn the hdz from its nationalist past to a modern pro-european party . analysts , however , have criticized her campaign as lacking popular appeal and a strong political personality .
her position on the ballot was hotly contested by croatian-us businessman boris miksic , who finished third with 17.8 percent of the vote . the strong showing of miksic , an outsider on croatia ’ s political scene whose support was not expected to break out of the single digits , was described as a protest vote . ” this is a protest of croatian voters against the politics being led here , ” vesna pusic , a lawmaker with a leftist opposition party told afp . mesic and kosor both pledged a better future for croatians along the same lines – eu membership , the strengthening of the rule of law and fighting corruption . paving the way to europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatian president stipe mesic mesic , who said he was confident of winning re-election , owes much of his popularity to the role he played in ending the balkan nation ’ s international isolation and completing its democratic reforms after succeeding authoritarian leader franjo tudjman . he significantly reduced presidential powers as the country turned into a parliamentary democracy following changes in 2000 .
however , the president remains the supreme commander of the military and a co-creator of foreign policy along with the prime minister . the president will also oversee croatia ’ s entry into the european union , which is planned for 2009 .
croatia has been put on a fast track to accession with brussels deciding last month to launch membership talks in march .
zagreb hopes to fulfil membership criteria by 2007 but its bid depends on full cooperation with the un war crimes tribunal following the balkans wars of the 1990s which will be closely monitored by brussels . mesic has vowed to deliver the war crimes suspects to the international court , despite strong criticism from war veterans and nationalists . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de green lights for balkan trio the eu commission agrees to a date for romania and bulgaria to sign accession treaties and for croatia to start entry talks .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement " i will be responsible for its success or failure , " he added . the controversial package of labor market reforms known as hartz iv will have a wide-reaching impact on the lives of 4.5 million people out of work in what is still europe 's economic powerhouse .
it is impossible to tell for the moment exactly how many unemployed will lose money under the new system or who will benefit from the changes . but those expected to feel the changes hardest are the long-term jobless and the 2.7 million people who the federal labor agency says have used up their benefits and now receive only minimum welfare payments .
the agency says less than 10 percent will lose their welfare payments altogether , a figure the unions reject .
they put the figure at 27 percent and say 48 percent will have their income reduced . to calculate the new benefits , the federal labor agency analyzes peoples ' estate , their expenditure and their needs , which is already sparking controversy .
generous system the government argues that overhauling germany 's generous social welfare system - once envied throughout the world - will persuade people who have been out of work for more than a year to accept a job , no matter how low paid .
but support groups for the unemployed have criticized a move they say will make the poor poorer . other observers have called for recognition that even after the reforms are introduced , the german welfare state will be relatively generous to the unemployed .
for example , the point at which the value of an unemployed person 's residential property is taken into consideration is € 200,000 -lrb- $ 270,000 -rrb- and only 9 percent of homes in western germany and three percent in eastern germany are valued higher . bildunterschrift : few protestors gathered outside a labor office in the western german town of duisburg on tuesday monday 's protests came in the wake of demonstrations last year which were held for weeks on mondays , similar to rallies which brought down former east germany 's communist regime in 1989 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 03.01.2005 a gruesome task for criminologists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many bodies will never be identified in the wake of last week ’ s tsunamis , some 300 experts are working around the clock to identify victims .
with more than 30 years experience , germany has sent its team of forensic scientists to the region . no matter where a catastrophe strikes , when germans are among its victims , the identification commission of the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- is called into action - the 1998 train disaster in eschede , the 2000 concorde crash in paris and now the tsunamis in south asia .
disasters that leave victims unrecognizable are the special focus of germany ’ s forensic science team . victims from many nations since dec .
29 , the german identification commission has been deployed to thailand where they are working around the clock to determine the identity of drowning victims , many of whom have been mutilated and dismembered by the torrential floods and distorted beyond recognition as their corpses begin to deteriorate in the tropical heat . even though time is of the essence – with each day , the number of new victims continues to grow while decay begins to set in – the forensic scientists could not begin their work until the start of the new year , after receiving the go-ahead from the thai government .
with experts from 19 different nations involved in the rescue and removal operation , it was crucial to coordinate methods .
it is the first time so many victims from so many different countries needed to be identified . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a foreigner tourist looks at photographs of survivors at the damaged khao lak national park .
the most difficult work for the criminologists will be in the tourist resorts of phuket and khao lak , where a buddhist temple has been converted into a makeshift morgue .
more than 300 corpses are stacked in the temple awaiting identification .
some 20 percent are estimated to be those of foreigners . “ i fear it ’ s a very high number of german victims , ” said peter finger , spokesman for the german embassy in bangkok . identifying victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bodies of victims are covered in plastic and stacked before they can be identified according to dirk büchner , spokesman for the bka , there are three key methods for determining the identity of a victim : fingerprints , dental analysis and dna .
but each of these requires a good deal of time and depends on comparing with available sample data from relatives . “ it could be a hair , a fingerprint or the x-rays from a dentist , ” büchner said .
serial numbers from pace makers or an artificial hip could help provide information on a victim ’ s identity as do eye color , the shape of earlobes , scars or tattoos . if a victim can not be immediately identified , the forensic scientists take a sample of dna from the thigh bone and save it for later comparison .
to keep track of individual corpses , an electronic chip is attached to the body . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pyres of victims who were killed by tidal waves burn on the beach at alappad , in the southern indian state of kerala , wednesday , dec .
29 , 2004 .
responding to fears that corpses could be buried or cremated before the criminologists had the chance to identify them , thailand ’ s chief forensic scientist , pornthip rojanasunant , said that no foreign corpse would be deposed of before an expert had the chance to examine it . given the sheer numbers of victims and the difficulty of proving origin , the foreign teams of forensic scientists acknowledged that it would take weeks or even years before all the victims could be identified .
the thai government on sunday said that it was quite possible that many of the corpses would remain forever unidentified . 30 years experience the german identification commission was founded in 1972 after an airplane crash on the canary island of teneriffa killed 155 people , many of them german tourists .
since then the commission has been involved in more than 24 missions both in germany and abroad ; 16 of which were airplane crashes . in its three decades of experience , the team of 110 forensic scientists has so far been able to identify 1,316 disaster victims beyond a doubt .
working largely on a voluntary basis in a psychologically demanding field , the criminologists cooperate closely with forensic specialists throughout germany . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tsunamis claim nearly 140,000 lives so far the confirmed death toll from the tsunami that hit asian coastlines is still rising more than a week after the disaster even as a massive multinational relief operation gathers pace .

the device lets the doctor assess how much force they are using to manoeuvre the baby into a better position for a vaginal delivery .
this should help avoid unnecessary trauma to the mother and baby .
the device has already been tested during 15 real-life deliveries by the team from johns hopkins university .
we can measure what is happening to the baby during birth lead researcher dr edith gurewitsch in about 5 % of births , the baby 's shoulders become stuck in the birth canal .
the delivering doctor can perform several different manoeuvres to free the baby safely .
but in about a quarter of these deliveries , the baby is injured by the handling .
scientists and students at johns hopkins university set out to design a device that could monitor the amount of force being used to deliver a baby , in order to warn the doctor when he / she might be pulling too hard .
the device consists of three electrodes which are attached to the forearm of the doctor who is performing the delivery .
difficult deliveries the electrodes send information , via a small metal box that rests in the doctor 's pocket , to a remote computer which stores and processes the data .
the device gives an accurate record of the force being used during delivery by comparing it to calibrated force readings for the individual user .
dr edith gurewitsch , assistant professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at the university , said : " while further studies are necessary before we can make definitive recommendations on the use of one procedure over another , our initial laboratory results demonstrate that we can measure what is happening to the baby during birth , and we can alter our technique to create a safer environment for delivery . "
when they performed 30 mock deliveries , using three-dimensional models of the mother 's pelvis and a baby , the team found turning the baby so its spine faces the mother 's belly was the safest way to proceed if the baby 's shoulders were stuck in the birth canal .
this manoeuvre was associated with the least amount of force - 6.5 pounds - to the baby 's head necessary to achieve delivery .
in comparison , turning the baby so its spine faced the mother 's spine applied 8.5 pounds and moving the mother 's legs back to widen the pelvis applied 16 pounds .
dr gurewitsch has been using the device clinically , and believes it could help train future doctors and midwives .
dr shagaf bakour , consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist at city hospital in birmingham , said : " it could have an important role in the practical training of junior obstetricians in their structured postgraduate training .
" it would allow the trainee to acquire a personal experience in dealing with shoulder dystocia - every obstetrician 's nightmare - not only imagining it . "
the research was funded by the us centers for disease control and prevention .

bbc news -pipe- entertainment -pipe- sound of 2005 : kaiser chiefs bbc news / entertainment graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- entertainment contents : arts & culture monday , 3 january , 2005 , 08:07 gmt sound of 2005 : kaiser chiefs by ian youngs bbc news entertainment reporter leeds band kaiser chiefs , who want to lead a britpop revival , have come fifth in the bbc news website 's sound of 2005 survey to find the best new music talent .
tips from more than 100 influential music critics and broadcasters have been compiled into a list of artists to watch in the next 12 months .
we will reveal one artist from the top five every day this week until friday , when the winner and full top 10 will be announced .
singer ricky wilson takes issue with the suggestion kaiser chiefs are at the forefront of britpop mark ii .
" it 's not mark ii mate , it never stopped , " he says .
" we 're just reviving it , we 've got the electric shock things out and they 're on the chest . "
the british have always done it best - from franz ferdinand all the way back to the beatles " ricky wilson kaiser chiefs wilson , 25 , describes britpop as " the best thing that happened in british music for the last 20 years " .
" i was pretty young when that started off and it just gave me so much pride to be british and pride to be a music-lover . "
the frontman says kaiser chiefs will merely be the next name on the list of great british songwriters from the kinks to blur via the clash and madness .
the uk 's music scene has lost its way in recent years because bands are trying to copy american styles , he argues .
' spooky pop ' " there 's some great bands that have come out of america and australia , but we do n't have to rely on them to give us our music , to fill our charts .
" the british have always done it best - from franz ferdinand all the way back to the beatles . "
kaiser chiefs were born out of the ashes of wilson 's old band parva who , he says , " were trying to fit in and be like an american garage band " .
but he had an epiphany when he started writing about things closer to home .
kaiser chiefs ' songs are about " life in leeds and being british and young and hip " , he says , describing their music as " british , quirky , sometimes spooky pop " .
that formula got them to number 22 in the uk chart in november with single i predict a riot .
it was a punk-pop chronicle of saturday night on the town with blokes who are " drunk , try and put their hand up a girl 's skirt and have a fight at the end of the night " .
writing about everyday english life has not been in fashion since the days of pulp and blur .
" i do love that kind of songwriting - getting under the skin of the british people , " wilson says .
drummer nick hodgson comes up with ideas for songs before wilson finishes the lyrics and the rest of the band develop the music .
' number three ' " you could say he 's the boss , " wilson says , reeling off a list of other acts with songwriting drummers .
" slipknot , genesis , erm , french kicks . "
when i looked at my itinerary for next year , my girlfriend wept " ricky wilson " it 's not weird that he plays the drums because when we 're in practice , he acts very much like kind of a conductor .
he can point at us with his big sticks . "
wilson says it would be his " ultimate dream " to have a number one album and a number three single .
not a number one single ?
" no , that would be the death of a band like us .
" coldplay got a number three , franz ferdinand got a number three , i think keane got number three , " he says , not entirely accurately .
" it 's kind of the indie seal of approval . "
ambition if his dream comes true , it would be a remarkable rise for a band whose first gig was in october 2003 .
" when i looked at my itinerary for next year , my girlfriend wept , " he says .
" we are booked up pretty solid for a long time now .
" but it 's going to be exciting and it 's what i 've been wanting to do since i was 10 .
" so there 's no point complaining now that i do n't get a day off here and there .
it 's the best job in the world . "

tips from more than 100 influential music critics and broadcasters have been compiled into a list of artists to watch in the next 12 months .
we will reveal one artist from the top five every day this week until friday , when the winner and full top 10 will be announced .
singer ricky wilson takes issue with the suggestion kaiser chiefs are at the forefront of britpop mark ii .
" it 's not mark ii mate , it never stopped , " he says .
" we 're just reviving it , we 've got the electric shock things out and they 're on the chest .
the british have always done it best - from franz ferdinand all the way back to the beatles ricky wilson kaiser chiefs wilson , 25 , describes britpop as " the best thing that happened in british music for the last 20 years " .
" i was pretty young when that started off and it just gave me so much pride to be british and pride to be a music-lover . "
the frontman says kaiser chiefs will merely be the next name on the list of great british songwriters from the kinks to blur via the clash and madness .
the uk 's music scene has lost its way in recent years because bands are trying to copy american styles , he argues .
' spooky pop ' " there 's some great bands that have come out of america and australia , but we do n't have to rely on them to give us our music , to fill our charts .
" the british have always done it best - from franz ferdinand all the way back to the beatles . "
kaiser chiefs say britpop was british music 's best era for 20 years kaiser chiefs were born out of the ashes of wilson 's old band parva who , he says , " were trying to fit in and be like an american garage band " .
but he had an epiphany when he started writing about things closer to home .
kaiser chiefs ' songs are about " life in leeds and being british and young and hip " , he says , describing their music as " british , quirky , sometimes spooky pop " .
that formula got them to number 22 in the uk chart in november with single i predict a riot .
it was a punk-pop chronicle of saturday night on the town with blokes who are " drunk , try and put their hand up a girl 's skirt and have a fight at the end of the night " .
writing about everyday english life has not been in fashion since the days of pulp and blur .
" i do love that kind of songwriting - getting under the skin of the british people , " wilson says .

" slipknot , genesis , erm , french kicks .
when i looked at my itinerary for next year , my girlfriend wept ricky wilson " it 's not weird that he plays the drums because when we 're in practice , he acts very much like kind of a conductor .
he can point at us with his big sticks . "
wilson says it would be his " ultimate dream " to have a number one album and a number three single .
not a number one single ?
" no , that would be the death of a band like us .
" coldplay got a number three , franz ferdinand got a number three , i think keane got number three , " he says , not entirely accurately .

the advance , the second-fastest in asia after china , was led by growth of 13.1 % in the key manufacturing sector .

in the fourth quarter , the city state 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- rose at an annual rate of 2.4 % .
that was up from the third quarter , when it fell 3.0 % , but was well below analyst forecasts .
" i am surprised at the weak fourth quarter number .
the main drag came from electronics , " said lian chia liang , economist at jp morgan chase .
singapore 's economy had contracted over the summer , weighed down by soaring oil prices .
the economy 's poor performance in the july to september period followed four consecutive quarters of double-digit growth as singapore bounced back strongly from the effects of the deadly sars virus in 2003 .

google remained everyone 's favourite but it faced more competition than ever as sites such as ask jeeves , msn , yahoo and a host of small start-ups tried to grab a share of the searching audience .
that is not surprising given that 80 % of all excursions online start at a search site of one sort or another .
this means that taking a look at the top queries of a few search sites will be a good guide to the topics that net users were most curious about .
search snapshot according to statistics gathered by msn uk , the top query among british users was for the big brother tv show on channel 4 .
top msn uk searches 1 -rrb- big brother 2 -rrb- inland revenue 3 -rrb- horoscopes 4 -rrb- eastenders 5 -rrb- football 6 -rrb- alton towers 7 -rrb- jordan 8 -rrb- cricket 9 -rrb- barbie 10 -rrb- harry potter although the viewing audience for big brother was down from its peak , the fifth series of the show was the second most popular of the series .
part of its renewed appeal was down to winner of the show , portuguese transsexual nadia almada .
the show was at number 2 in top uk queries on google and was pipped to the top slot by the bbc news website .
by contrast msn 's second place query was a different type of big brother , namely the inland revenue .
the increasing numbers of people who file tax returns online was thought to be behind this placing .
taking a more global view from google 's zeitgeist , the top query around the world was for fading pop singer britney spears .
ms spear 's multiple marriages and split with her long time manager have helped to keep her in the headlines , despite her desire to take a career break in late 2004 .
following ms spears in google 's list of top queries were four other high-profile blonde women : paris hilton , christina aquilera and pamela anderson .
glamour model jordan -lrb- aka katie price -rrb- who was the most-queried woman on the msn site , did not even make it in to google 's top female query list .
ms price came in at number 7 in the top 100 msn queries of 2004 .
big news msn also reported that david beckham , who was hard to escape in 2004 for personal and professional reasons , did not feature very highly in its list of top searches .
google global top ten 1 -rrb- britney spears 2 -rrb- paris hilton 3 -rrb- christina aguilera 4 -rrb- pamela anderson 5 -rrb- chat 6 -rrb- games 7 -rrb- carmen electra 8 -rrb- orlando bloom 9 -rrb- harry potter 10 -rrb- mp3 beckham was the 70th most popular query among british searchers , down a whopping 56 places from his position at number 14 in 2003 .
unkind commentators might say that there was perhaps no need to search for him because he was so ubiquitous .
google 's results were kinder to mr beckham which put him at number 6 in global queries and number 3 in uk-only searches .
on google the most popular man around the world was former elf orlando bloom .
he was not popular all over the world though .
google 's regional breakdown of popular searches showed that though he was the most popular man among norwegian searchers , germans preferred pop star usher and canadians johnny depp .
for the first time , google also supplied data from froogle its shopping comparison site .
the swift growth of online music services has led to the ipod music player being the most searched for item .
the popularity of the ipod led to shortages of the player in shops which perhaps helped to boost the ranking of the sleek gadget .
when it came to news stories , it was perhaps no surprise that iraq was the most searched for term among uk google users .
but for the bbc , the most popular story of the year , in terms of readers , was the school siege in beslan , russia that took place in september .
the bbc news website coverage of the siege as it unfolded was the most read story among both uk and international visitors to the site .
the victory of george bush in the us presidential election was the second most popular story of the year .
the statistics were gathered before the tsunami disaster struck in asia which has resulted in a significant seasonal increase in visitors to the bbc news website .

the show was at number 2 in top uk queries on google and was pipped to the top slot by the bbc news website .
by contrast msn 's second place query was a different type of big brother , namely the inland revenue .
the increasing numbers of people who file tax returns online was thought to be behind this placing .

the royal college of physicians said there was already an " epidemic " of binge drinking and the plan " flies in the face of common sense " .
but licensing minister richard caborn said the government was tackling the causes and the symptoms of the problem .
the changes are due next year as part of an overhaul of licensing laws .
it is hoped permitting pubs and clubs to stay open all day will stagger closing times and avoid drinkers spilling onto the streets at the same time .
but the royal college of physicians ' licensing committee chairman , professor ian gilmore , pointed to warning signs from abroad .
it is fanciful to think we can turn ourselves into a french-style wine tippling culture merely by abolishing licensing regulations royal college of physicians ' licensing committee chairman , professor ian gilmore violence had increased in pubs and bars allowed to open one hour later in perth , australia , he told bbc news .
and there was similar data from iceland , as well as anecdotal evidence from dublin , ireland .
prof gilmore said the college was not opposed to drinking - but alcohol was now cheaper and more readily available through supermarkets and other outlets .
one out of every four people in britain were now drinking at potentially hazardous rates .
and the past 30 years had seen a 10-fold rise in cirrhosis rates .
the only way to stem the problem was the politically unpalatable option of raising prices and cutting availability , prof gilmore added .
the fact large groups of people will be coming out at 3am or 4am will mean we have to man up the streets to deliver a service to ensure these people behave sir john stevens advocates of the law change , passed in 2003 , suggest the uk can mimic the cafe-style culture seen in some european countries .
but prof gilmore said : " it is fanciful to think we can turn ourselves into a french-style wine tippling culture merely by abolishing licensing regulations . "
his warning comes after the outgoing metropolitan police commissioner voiced concerns about the impact of the licensing act .
sir john stevens said the change of closing hours would take resources away from other areas of policing , as officers will be diverted to covering the streets in the early hours .
" the fact large groups of people will be coming out at 3am or 4am will mean we have to man up the streets to deliver a service to ensure these people behave , " he said .
the government says the law change could cut crime .
we are working very closely with the trade to make sure their employees do not sell to drunken people richard caborn culture minister mr caborn said police and local councils would be given greater powers to deal with irresponsible licensees .
" we are working very closely with the trade to make sure their employees do not sell to drunken people , do not sell to young people under age , " he added .
there was also a programme to educate both staff and the general public about alcohol abuse , said mr caborn .
the plans were being introduced over a three-year period .
and london had enjoyed 36-hour opening times for the millennium celebrations .

the royal college of physicians said there was already an " epidemic " of binge drinking and the plan " flies in the face of common sense " .
but licensing minister richard caborn said the government was tackling the causes and the symptoms of the problem .
the changes are due next year as part of an overhaul of licensing laws .
it is hoped permitting pubs and clubs to stay open all day will stagger closing times and avoid drinkers spilling onto the streets at the same time .
but the royal college of physicians ' licensing committee chairman , professor ian gilmore , pointed to warning signs from abroad .
it is fanciful to think we can turn ourselves into a french-style wine tippling culture merely by abolishing licensing regulations royal college of physicians ' licensing committee chairman , professor ian gilmore violence had increased in pubs and bars allowed to open one hour later in perth , australia , he told bbc news .
and there was similar data from iceland , as well as anecdotal evidence from dublin , ireland .
prof gilmore said the college was not opposed to drinking - but alcohol was now cheaper and more readily available through supermarkets and other outlets .
one out of every four people in britain were now drinking at potentially hazardous rates .
and the past 30 years had seen a 10-fold rise in cirrhosis rates .
the only way to stem the problem was the politically unpalatable option of raising prices and cutting availability , prof gilmore added .
the fact large groups of people will be coming out at 3am or 4am will mean we have to man up the streets to deliver a service to ensure these people behave sir john stevens advocates of the law change , passed in 2003 , suggest the uk can mimic the cafe-style culture seen in some european countries .
but prof gilmore said : " it is fanciful to think we can turn ourselves into a french-style wine tippling culture merely by abolishing licensing regulations . "
his warning comes after the outgoing metropolitan police commissioner voiced concerns about the impact of the licensing act .
sir john stevens said the change of closing hours would take resources away from other areas of policing , as officers will be diverted to covering the streets in the early hours .

anwar was out at sea in his tiny fishing boat when the earthquake struck .
this is his story : i had gone out fishing after morning prayers .
i had been out at sea for about an hour and a half when the earthquake struck .
the boat started shaking .
not long after that the waves got bigger - and the sea turned white with foam .
' everything was flat .
all the houses had gone ' then i saw that the bridge on the mainland had disappeared .
everywhere was covered with water .
suddenly a huge wave came towards me , so i turned towards it and really revved my engine .
somehow i managed to get over it .
i do n't know how .
if i had n't done that , i would have been tipped over .
the wave was more than 10m high .
when i was over the wave i looked back .
everything was flat .
all the houses had gone .
i was so scared .
i just sailed around .
i was too frightened to go back to land .
' nothing left ' but around four o 'clock , when everything had calmed down , i did go ashore .
waves carried boats into the heart of the city i saw so many people among the debris , just crying for help .
i took about 10 of them in my boat .
i could n't find my family .
at about five o 'clock i got back on land .
the water had already started to go down .
i saw dead bodies everywhere on the street .
i went back to my village .
there was nothing left .
i lost 11 members of my family .
my home used to be close to the sea .
now it 's completely destroyed .
you ca n't even see where it was .
