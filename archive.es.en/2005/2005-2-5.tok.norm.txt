" reads the poster during a protest march in saxony german president horst köhler has called on all germans to actively oppose anti-semitism , while politicians across the spectrum debate banning the right-wing npd party . freshly returned from a four-day visit to israel , köhler sounded the alarm for all levels of german society to take up action and protest what he fears is a broadening of anti-semitism . in an interview with deutschlandradio berlin , the president said although germany was not experiencing a “ giant wave , ” there was ample reason to be concerned about new facets of anti-semitism which expressed themselves most outwardly in criticism of israel and the us .
the events two weeks ago in the state parliament of saxony , in which members of the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- boycotted a tribute to victims of the holocaust , served as a “ wake-up call , ” köhler said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst köhler next to the eternal flame in the hall of remembrance at the yad vashem holocaust museum in jerusalem on tuesday , feb .
1 , 2005 .
germany must now respond to these hateful sentiments not with panic but with well thought out and rational actions , he said .
the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii on may 8 , 1945 , and the events leading up to the historic date provide the perfect opportunity to demonstrate germany ’ s resolve in combating right-wing extremism and anti-semitism of all sorts . government protests against far-right the initiative purportedly has the support from the highest levels of german politics .
chancellor gerhard schröder is said to have backed plans for organizing a mass protest against the far-right .
according to his spokesman , bela anda , schröder said he believed it is the responsibility of all major parties to join forces and organize an official demonstration on may 8 against anti-semitism and intolerance . there must be “ powerful proof from the upright and righteous public ” that germany does not tolerate right-wing extremism , anda said quoting schröder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the 60th anniversary of the freeing of auschwitz , a german puts a candle on the former rail track leading from berlin to auschwitz .
israel ’ s former ambassador to germany , avi primor , recalling the chains of lights and rallies of the early 1990s when tens of thousands of germans protested against right-wing extremism , said something similar is needed today . social democrats leader franz müntefering said contacts were already underway between the mainstream political parties to organize a protest march on may 8 in front of the brandenburg gate in berlin .
“ there are contacts between the parties , the churches and the trade unions .
we all agree we should not leave the place to the neo-nazis , ” müntefering told german public broadcaster ard . the announcement comes after germany ’ s resurgent far-right parties , which last year scored electoral success in two eastern state assemblies and plan to join forces for the 2006 general election , let it be known that they plan to mark the end of world war ii with their own marches in front of the brandenburg gate on may 7 and 8 . party ban for right-wing extremists in light of the recent attention the right-wing parties have generated in recent weeks – most specifically the npd in saxony with their criticism of honoring holocaust victims – many in the government and across political parties have resumed the call to ban right-wing parties .
a mass protest is not enough , they claim ; the government needs to prove that such extremism is against the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " nazis out " reads a poster during a protest in kiel on jan .
30 , 2005 .
fraction leader for junior coalition partner the greens , katrin göring-eckard , said the npd needs to be outlawed .
if it is foreseeable that national-socialism will be glorified and nazi victims disparaged as part of a party ’ s ideology , then there must be a legal option for prohibiting the party ’ s assemblies and forcing it to disband . vice president for the central council of jews in germany charlotte knobloch criticized the government for not being more forceful in its opposition to the npd and right-wing extremism .
a party that is allowed to build itself on the basis of anti-semitism and hatred of foreigners and can continue to demonstrate freely is a sign of a government ’ s weakness . it is time for the government to push for a new ban on the npd , she told the welt am sonntag newspaper .
the initiative , however , has yet to be officially embraced by schröder ’ s government .
in 2003 , the center-left government tried to have the party outlawed on the grounds that it stirred racial hatred , but the case was rejected in the supreme court . since then the npd has continued to grow in popularity , especially in the economically depressed eastern states such as saxony , where it produced the far-right ’ s best showing in six years when it won nearly 10 percent of the vote in september ’ s parliamentary election . recollections of 1932 ? schröder ’ s government is largely to blame for the rise of the far-right , according to christian social union leader edmund stoiber .
“ the failure of schröder ’ s economic policies and the extensive unemployment creates the environment in which extremism thrives , ” the former chancellor candidate told welt am sonntag . with five million jobless , germany has broken an absolute record , stoiber said , and added that if the 1.5 million people economics minister wolfgang clement said are involved in work programs are added to the figure , “ germany will find itself in a situation not unlike that of 1932 . ” spd party leader münterfering dismissed the parallel to pre-hitler germany .
speaking to the local newspaper pinneberger tageblatt , he said neither the spd nor the opposition was responsible for the rise of the far-right in saxony .
“ only the voters are to blame , ” he said . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de köhler : holocaust part of german identity german president horst köhler addressed the israeli parliament wednesday , telling the knesset that responsibility for the holocaust was part of germany 's national identity .

" reads the poster during a protest march in saxony german president horst köhler has called on all germans to actively oppose anti-semitism , while politicians across the spectrum debate banning the right-wing npd party . freshly returned from a four-day visit to israel , köhler sounded the alarm for all levels of german society to take up action and protest what he fears is a broadening of anti-semitism . in an interview with deutschlandradio berlin , the president said although germany was not experiencing a “ giant wave , ” there was ample reason to be concerned about new facets of anti-semitism which expressed themselves most outwardly in criticism of israel and the us .
the events two weeks ago in the state parliament of saxony , in which members of the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- boycotted a tribute to victims of the holocaust , served as a “ wake-up call , ” köhler said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst köhler next to the eternal flame in the hall of remembrance at the yad vashem holocaust museum in jerusalem on tuesday , feb .
1 , 2005 .
germany must now respond to these hateful sentiments not with panic but with well thought out and rational actions , he said .
the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii on may 8 , 1945 , and the events leading up to the historic date provide the perfect opportunity to demonstrate germany ’ s resolve in combating right-wing extremism and anti-semitism of all sorts . government protests against far-right the initiative purportedly has the support from the highest levels of german politics .
chancellor gerhard schröder is said to have backed plans for organizing a mass protest against the far-right .
according to his spokesman , bela anda , schröder said he believed it is the responsibility of all major parties to join forces and organize an official demonstration on may 8 against anti-semitism and intolerance . there must be “ powerful proof from the upright and righteous public ” that germany does not tolerate right-wing extremism , anda said quoting schröder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the 60th anniversary of the freeing of auschwitz , a german puts a candle on the former rail track leading from berlin to auschwitz .
israel ’ s former ambassador to germany , avi primor , recalling the chains of lights and rallies of the early 1990s when tens of thousands of germans protested against right-wing extremism , said something similar is needed today . social democrats leader franz müntefering said contacts were already underway between the mainstream political parties to organize a protest march on may 8 in front of the brandenburg gate in berlin .
“ there are contacts between the parties , the churches and the trade unions .
we all agree we should not leave the place to the neo-nazis , ” müntefering told german public broadcaster ard . the announcement comes after germany ’ s resurgent far-right parties , which last year scored electoral success in two eastern state assemblies and plan to join forces for the 2006 general election , let it be known that they plan to mark the end of world war ii with their own marches in front of the brandenburg gate on may 7 and 8 . party ban for right-wing extremists in light of the recent attention the right-wing parties have generated in recent weeks – most specifically the npd in saxony with their criticism of honoring holocaust victims – many in the government and across political parties have resumed the call to ban right-wing parties .
a mass protest is not enough , they claim ; the government needs to prove that such extremism is against the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " nazis out " reads a poster during a protest in kiel on jan .
30 , 2005 .
fraction leader for junior coalition partner the greens , katrin göring-eckard , said the npd needs to be outlawed .
if it is foreseeable that national-socialism will be glorified and nazi victims disparaged as part of a party ’ s ideology , then there must be a legal option for prohibiting the party ’ s assemblies and forcing it to disband . vice president for the central council of jews in germany charlotte knobloch criticized the government for not being more forceful in its opposition to the npd and right-wing extremism .
a party that is allowed to build itself on the basis of anti-semitism and hatred of foreigners and can continue to demonstrate freely is a sign of a government ’ s weakness . it is time for the government to push for a new ban on the npd , she told the welt am sonntag newspaper .
the initiative , however , has yet to be officially embraced by schröder ’ s government .
in 2003 , the center-left government tried to have the party outlawed on the grounds that it stirred racial hatred , but the case was rejected in the supreme court . since then the npd has continued to grow in popularity , especially in the economically depressed eastern states such as saxony , where it produced the far-right ’ s best showing in six years when it won nearly 10 percent of the vote in september ’ s parliamentary election . recollections of 1932 ? schröder ’ s government is largely to blame for the rise of the far-right , according to christian social union leader edmund stoiber .
“ the failure of schröder ’ s economic policies and the extensive unemployment creates the environment in which extremism thrives , ” the former chancellor candidate told welt am sonntag . with five million jobless , germany has broken an absolute record , stoiber said , and added that if the 1.5 million people economics minister wolfgang clement said are involved in work programs are added to the figure , “ germany will find itself in a situation not unlike that of 1932 . ” spd party leader münterfering dismissed the parallel to pre-hitler germany .

" reads the poster during a protest march in saxony german president horst köhler has called on all germans to actively oppose anti-semitism , while politicians across the spectrum debate banning the right-wing npd party . freshly returned from a four-day visit to israel , köhler sounded the alarm for all levels of german society to take up action and protest what he fears is a broadening of anti-semitism . in an interview with deutschlandradio berlin , the president said although germany was not experiencing a “ giant wave , ” there was ample reason to be concerned about new facets of anti-semitism which expressed themselves most outwardly in criticism of israel and the us .
the events two weeks ago in the state parliament of saxony , in which members of the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- boycotted a tribute to victims of the holocaust , served as a “ wake-up call , ” köhler said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst köhler next to the eternal flame in the hall of remembrance at the yad vashem holocaust museum in jerusalem on tuesday , feb .
1 , 2005 .
germany must now respond to these hateful sentiments not with panic but with well thought out and rational actions , he said .
the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii on may 8 , 1945 , and the events leading up to the historic date provide the perfect opportunity to demonstrate germany ’ s resolve in combating right-wing extremism and anti-semitism of all sorts . government protests against far-right the initiative purportedly has the support from the highest levels of german politics .
chancellor gerhard schröder is said to have backed plans for organizing a mass protest against the far-right .
according to his spokesman , bela anda , schröder said he believed it is the responsibility of all major parties to join forces and organize an official demonstration on may 8 against anti-semitism and intolerance . there must be “ powerful proof from the upright and righteous public ” that germany does not tolerate right-wing extremism , anda said quoting schröder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the 60th anniversary of the freeing of auschwitz , a german puts a candle on the former rail track leading from berlin to auschwitz .
israel ’ s former ambassador to germany , avi primor , recalling the chains of lights and rallies of the early 1990s when tens of thousands of germans protested against right-wing extremism , said something similar is needed today . social democrats leader franz müntefering said contacts were already underway between the mainstream political parties to organize a protest march on may 8 in front of the brandenburg gate in berlin .
“ there are contacts between the parties , the churches and the trade unions .
we all agree we should not leave the place to the neo-nazis , ” müntefering told german public broadcaster ard . the announcement comes after germany ’ s resurgent far-right parties , which last year scored electoral success in two eastern state assemblies and plan to join forces for the 2006 general election , let it be known that they plan to mark the end of world war ii with their own marches in front of the brandenburg gate on may 7 and 8 . party ban for right-wing extremists in light of the recent attention the right-wing parties have generated in recent weeks – most specifically the npd in saxony with their criticism of honoring holocaust victims – many in the government and across political parties have resumed the call to ban right-wing parties .
a mass protest is not enough , they claim ; the government needs to prove that such extremism is against the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " nazis out " reads a poster during a protest in kiel on jan .
30 , 2005 .
fraction leader for junior coalition partner the greens , katrin göring-eckard , said the npd needs to be outlawed .
if it is foreseeable that national-socialism will be glorified and nazi victims disparaged as part of a party ’ s ideology , then there must be a legal option for prohibiting the party ’ s assemblies and forcing it to disband . vice president for the central council of jews in germany charlotte knobloch criticized the government for not being more forceful in its opposition to the npd and right-wing extremism .
a party that is allowed to build itself on the basis of anti-semitism and hatred of foreigners and can continue to demonstrate freely is a sign of a government ’ s weakness . it is time for the government to push for a new ban on the npd , she told the welt am sonntag newspaper .
the initiative , however , has yet to be officially embraced by schröder ’ s government .
in 2003 , the center-left government tried to have the party outlawed on the grounds that it stirred racial hatred , but the case was rejected in the supreme court . since then the npd has continued to grow in popularity , especially in the economically depressed eastern states such as saxony , where it produced the far-right ’ s best showing in six years when it won nearly 10 percent of the vote in september ’ s parliamentary election . recollections of 1932 ? schröder ’ s government is largely to blame for the rise of the far-right , according to christian social union leader edmund stoiber .
“ the failure of schröder ’ s economic policies and the extensive unemployment creates the environment in which extremism thrives , ” the former chancellor candidate told welt am sonntag . with five million jobless , germany has broken an absolute record , stoiber said , and added that if the 1.5 million people economics minister wolfgang clement said are involved in work programs are added to the figure , “ germany will find itself in a situation not unlike that of 1932 . ” spd party leader münterfering dismissed the parallel to pre-hitler germany .
speaking to the local newspaper pinneberger tageblatt , he said neither the spd nor the opposition was responsible for the rise of the far-right in saxony .

the events two weeks ago in the state parliament of saxony , in which members of the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- boycotted a tribute to victims of the holocaust , served as a “ wake-up call , ” köhler said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst köhler next to the eternal flame in the hall of remembrance at the yad vashem holocaust museum in jerusalem on tuesday , feb .

germany must now respond to these hateful sentiments not with panic but with well thought out and rational actions , he said .
the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii on may 8 , 1945 , and the events leading up to the historic date provide the perfect opportunity to demonstrate germany ’ s resolve in combating right-wing extremism and anti-semitism of all sorts . government protests against far-right the initiative purportedly has the support from the highest levels of german politics .
chancellor gerhard schröder is said to have backed plans for organizing a mass protest against the far-right .
according to his spokesman , bela anda , schröder said he believed it is the responsibility of all major parties to join forces and organize an official demonstration on may 8 against anti-semitism and intolerance . there must be “ powerful proof from the upright and righteous public ” that germany does not tolerate right-wing extremism , anda said quoting schröder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the 60th anniversary of the freeing of auschwitz , a german puts a candle on the former rail track leading from berlin to auschwitz .
israel ’ s former ambassador to germany , avi primor , recalling the chains of lights and rallies of the early 1990s when tens of thousands of germans protested against right-wing extremism , said something similar is needed today . social democrats leader franz müntefering said contacts were already underway between the mainstream political parties to organize a protest march on may 8 in front of the brandenburg gate in berlin .
“ there are contacts between the parties , the churches and the trade unions .
we all agree we should not leave the place to the neo-nazis , ” müntefering told german public broadcaster ard . the announcement comes after germany ’ s resurgent far-right parties , which last year scored electoral success in two eastern state assemblies and plan to join forces for the 2006 general election , let it be known that they plan to mark the end of world war ii with their own marches in front of the brandenburg gate on may 7 and 8 . party ban for right-wing extremists in light of the recent attention the right-wing parties have generated in recent weeks – most specifically the npd in saxony with their criticism of honoring holocaust victims – many in the government and across political parties have resumed the call to ban right-wing parties .
a mass protest is not enough , they claim ; the government needs to prove that such extremism is against the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " nazis out " reads a poster during a protest in kiel on jan .
30 , 2005 .
fraction leader for junior coalition partner the greens , katrin göring-eckard , said the npd needs to be outlawed .
if it is foreseeable that national-socialism will be glorified and nazi victims disparaged as part of a party ’ s ideology , then there must be a legal option for prohibiting the party ’ s assemblies and forcing it to disband . vice president for the central council of jews in germany charlotte knobloch criticized the government for not being more forceful in its opposition to the npd and right-wing extremism .
a party that is allowed to build itself on the basis of anti-semitism and hatred of foreigners and can continue to demonstrate freely is a sign of a government ’ s weakness . it is time for the government to push for a new ban on the npd , she told the welt am sonntag newspaper .
the initiative , however , has yet to be officially embraced by schröder ’ s government .
in 2003 , the center-left government tried to have the party outlawed on the grounds that it stirred racial hatred , but the case was rejected in the supreme court . since then the npd has continued to grow in popularity , especially in the economically depressed eastern states such as saxony , where it produced the far-right ’ s best showing in six years when it won nearly 10 percent of the vote in september ’ s parliamentary election . recollections of 1932 ? schröder ’ s government is largely to blame for the rise of the far-right , according to christian social union leader edmund stoiber .
“ the failure of schröder ’ s economic policies and the extensive unemployment creates the environment in which extremism thrives , ” the former chancellor candidate told welt am sonntag . with five million jobless , germany has broken an absolute record , stoiber said , and added that if the 1.5 million people economics minister wolfgang clement said are involved in work programs are added to the figure , “ germany will find itself in a situation not unlike that of 1932 . ” spd party leader münterfering dismissed the parallel to pre-hitler germany .

the events two weeks ago in the state parliament of saxony , in which members of the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- boycotted a tribute to victims of the holocaust , served as a “ wake-up call , ” köhler said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst köhler next to the eternal flame in the hall of remembrance at the yad vashem holocaust museum in jerusalem on tuesday , feb .

germany must now respond to these hateful sentiments not with panic but with well thought out and rational actions , he said .
the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii on may 8 , 1945 , and the events leading up to the historic date provide the perfect opportunity to demonstrate germany ’ s resolve in combating right-wing extremism and anti-semitism of all sorts . government protests against far-right the initiative purportedly has the support from the highest levels of german politics .
chancellor gerhard schröder is said to have backed plans for organizing a mass protest against the far-right .
according to his spokesman , bela anda , schröder said he believed it is the responsibility of all major parties to join forces and organize an official demonstration on may 8 against anti-semitism and intolerance . there must be “ powerful proof from the upright and righteous public ” that germany does not tolerate right-wing extremism , anda said quoting schröder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the 60th anniversary of the freeing of auschwitz , a german puts a candle on the former rail track leading from berlin to auschwitz .
israel ’ s former ambassador to germany , avi primor , recalling the chains of lights and rallies of the early 1990s when tens of thousands of germans protested against right-wing extremism , said something similar is needed today . social democrats leader franz müntefering said contacts were already underway between the mainstream political parties to organize a protest march on may 8 in front of the brandenburg gate in berlin .
“ there are contacts between the parties , the churches and the trade unions .
we all agree we should not leave the place to the neo-nazis , ” müntefering told german public broadcaster ard . the announcement comes after germany ’ s resurgent far-right parties , which last year scored electoral success in two eastern state assemblies and plan to join forces for the 2006 general election , let it be known that they plan to mark the end of world war ii with their own marches in front of the brandenburg gate on may 7 and 8 . party ban for right-wing extremists in light of the recent attention the right-wing parties have generated in recent weeks – most specifically the npd in saxony with their criticism of honoring holocaust victims – many in the government and across political parties have resumed the call to ban right-wing parties .
a mass protest is not enough , they claim ; the government needs to prove that such extremism is against the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " nazis out " reads a poster during a protest in kiel on jan .
30 , 2005 .
fraction leader for junior coalition partner the greens , katrin göring-eckard , said the npd needs to be outlawed .
if it is foreseeable that national-socialism will be glorified and nazi victims disparaged as part of a party ’ s ideology , then there must be a legal option for prohibiting the party ’ s assemblies and forcing it to disband . vice president for the central council of jews in germany charlotte knobloch criticized the government for not being more forceful in its opposition to the npd and right-wing extremism .
a party that is allowed to build itself on the basis of anti-semitism and hatred of foreigners and can continue to demonstrate freely is a sign of a government ’ s weakness . it is time for the government to push for a new ban on the npd , she told the welt am sonntag newspaper .
the initiative , however , has yet to be officially embraced by schröder ’ s government .
in 2003 , the center-left government tried to have the party outlawed on the grounds that it stirred racial hatred , but the case was rejected in the supreme court . since then the npd has continued to grow in popularity , especially in the economically depressed eastern states such as saxony , where it produced the far-right ’ s best showing in six years when it won nearly 10 percent of the vote in september ’ s parliamentary election . recollections of 1932 ? schröder ’ s government is largely to blame for the rise of the far-right , according to christian social union leader edmund stoiber .
“ the failure of schröder ’ s economic policies and the extensive unemployment creates the environment in which extremism thrives , ” the former chancellor candidate told welt am sonntag . with five million jobless , germany has broken an absolute record , stoiber said , and added that if the 1.5 million people economics minister wolfgang clement said are involved in work programs are added to the figure , “ germany will find itself in a situation not unlike that of 1932 . ” spd party leader münterfering dismissed the parallel to pre-hitler germany .

despite a vibrant emotional appeal for action by former south african president nelson mandela , the group of seven remained deeply divided over the issue of increasing development aid for the world ’ s poorest countries . ministers met at the home of british chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown early saturday after failing to reach common ground on third world development aid during a working dinner the previous night .
finance chiefs and central bankers from britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and the united states had met friday with mandela who urged them to back a doubling in annual development assistance to 100 billion dollars and approve 100 percent debt cancellation for africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south africa 's former president nelson mandela speaks in london 's trafalgar square during the ' make poverty history ' rally thursday feb .

"
the hipc initiative is a joint initiative of the world bank and the international monetary fund that offers debt relief to the world ’ s most impoverished nations which agree to undertake economic reform . " this is the first time as much as 100 percent debt relief has ever been detailed in a g7 communique , " brown told reporters at the end of a two-day meeting . us-european differences the last-minute expression of willingness came none too soon , as europe and the us threatened to leave the g7 session in a deadlock over the issue .
in earlier talks , according to german secretary of state for finance caio koch-weser , " the americans -lrb- were -rrb- in a completely different frame of mind from the europeans . " us undersecretary of the treasury john taylor said friday an additional plan spearheaded by britain to increase development assistance up to 100 billion dollars a year " does n't work " for the united states .
us officials have cited legal problems in connection with the plan , known as the international finance facility -lrb- iff -rrb- . " for the united states it does n't fit in to our budget process , " taylor said in a bbc radio interview on the fringes of g7 meeting .
he said the us did not object to the british plan because of any suspicion about its soundness but simply because it requires governments to commit money for years ahead .
us government rules mean spending can only be agreed a year at a time . britain , however , put on a brave face saturday , with international development secretary hilary benn saying he believed a solution would be found , with or without the backing of the americans , when g7 leaders plus russia meet for a group of eight summit in gleneagles , scotland in july . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman sits outside her squatter shack at alexandra , johannesburg , south africa .

" one way or the other , what is inconceivable is that the world will come to gleneagles without having found ways of raising the additional money that we know is needed to save children 's lives and to give developing countries the helping hand they need as they help themselves out of poverty , " he said . france and germany launch initiative france and germany meanwhile agreed on the sidelines of the meeting to announce their own joint development plan to increase resources devoted to development financing in the world ’ s poorest countries . finance officials from the two countries said their proposal , which would be put to other european union countries , would consist of an immunization program financed by a mechanism similar to the international finance facility -lrb- iff -rrb- devised by britain .
under the scheme , wealthy countries would guarantee bonds issued by poor nations to raise development funds . a second measure in the french-german proposal could include " airline fuel taxation and charges on plane tickets , " the statement said .

" reads the poster during a protest march in saxony german president horst köhler has called on all germans to actively oppose anti-semitism , while politicians across the spectrum debate banning the right-wing npd party . freshly returned from a four-day visit to israel , köhler sounded the alarm for all levels of german society to take up action and protest what he fears is a broadening of anti-semitism . in an interview with deutschlandradio berlin , the president said although germany was not experiencing a “ giant wave , ” there was ample reason to be concerned about new facets of anti-semitism which expressed themselves most outwardly in criticism of israel and the us .
the events two weeks ago in the state parliament of saxony , in which members of the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- boycotted a tribute to victims of the holocaust , served as a “ wake-up call , ” köhler said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst köhler next to the eternal flame in the hall of remembrance at the yad vashem holocaust museum in jerusalem on tuesday , feb .
1 , 2005 .
germany must now respond to these hateful sentiments not with panic but with well thought out and rational actions , he said .
the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii on may 8 , 1945 , and the events leading up to the historic date provide the perfect opportunity to demonstrate germany ’ s resolve in combating right-wing extremism and anti-semitism of all sorts . government protests against far-right the initiative purportedly has the support from the highest levels of german politics .
chancellor gerhard schröder is said to have backed plans for organizing a mass protest against the far-right .
according to his spokesman , bela anda , schröder said he believed it is the responsibility of all major parties to join forces and organize an official demonstration on may 8 against anti-semitism and intolerance . there must be “ powerful proof from the upright and righteous public ” that germany does not tolerate right-wing extremism , anda said quoting schröder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the 60th anniversary of the freeing of auschwitz , a german puts a candle on the former rail track leading from berlin to auschwitz .
israel ’ s former ambassador to germany , avi primor , recalling the chains of lights and rallies of the early 1990s when tens of thousands of germans protested against right-wing extremism , said something similar is needed today . social democrats leader franz müntefering said contacts were already underway between the mainstream political parties to organize a protest march on may 8 in front of the brandenburg gate in berlin .
“ there are contacts between the parties , the churches and the trade unions .
we all agree we should not leave the place to the neo-nazis , ” müntefering told german public broadcaster ard . the announcement comes after germany ’ s resurgent far-right parties , which last year scored electoral success in two eastern state assemblies and plan to join forces for the 2006 general election , let it be known that they plan to mark the end of world war ii with their own marches in front of the brandenburg gate on may 7 and 8 . party ban for right-wing extremists in light of the recent attention the right-wing parties have generated in recent weeks – most specifically the npd in saxony with their criticism of honoring holocaust victims – many in the government and across political parties have resumed the call to ban right-wing parties .
a mass protest is not enough , they claim ; the government needs to prove that such extremism is against the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " nazis out " reads a poster during a protest in kiel on jan .
30 , 2005 .
fraction leader for junior coalition partner the greens , katrin göring-eckard , said the npd needs to be outlawed .
if it is foreseeable that national-socialism will be glorified and nazi victims disparaged as part of a party ’ s ideology , then there must be a legal option for prohibiting the party ’ s assemblies and forcing it to disband . vice president for the central council of jews in germany charlotte knobloch criticized the government for not being more forceful in its opposition to the npd and right-wing extremism .
a party that is allowed to build itself on the basis of anti-semitism and hatred of foreigners and can continue to demonstrate freely is a sign of a government ’ s weakness . it is time for the government to push for a new ban on the npd , she told the welt am sonntag newspaper .
the initiative , however , has yet to be officially embraced by schröder ’ s government .
in 2003 , the center-left government tried to have the party outlawed on the grounds that it stirred racial hatred , but the case was rejected in the supreme court . since then the npd has continued to grow in popularity , especially in the economically depressed eastern states such as saxony , where it produced the far-right ’ s best showing in six years when it won nearly 10 percent of the vote in september ’ s parliamentary election . recollections of 1932 ? schröder ’ s government is largely to blame for the rise of the far-right , according to christian social union leader edmund stoiber .
“ the failure of schröder ’ s economic policies and the extensive unemployment creates the environment in which extremism thrives , ” the former chancellor candidate told welt am sonntag . with five million jobless , germany has broken an absolute record , stoiber said , and added that if the 1.5 million people economics minister wolfgang clement said are involved in work programs are added to the figure , “ germany will find itself in a situation not unlike that of 1932 . ” spd party leader münterfering dismissed the parallel to pre-hitler germany .
speaking to the local newspaper pinneberger tageblatt , he said neither the spd nor the opposition was responsible for the rise of the far-right in saxony .
“ only the voters are to blame , ” he said . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de köhler : holocaust part of german identity german president horst köhler addressed the israeli parliament wednesday , telling the knesset that responsibility for the holocaust was part of germany 's national identity .

germany must now respond to these hateful sentiments not with panic but with well thought out and rational actions , he said .
the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii on may 8 , 1945 , and the events leading up to the historic date provide the perfect opportunity to demonstrate germany ’ s resolve in combating right-wing extremism and anti-semitism of all sorts . government protests against far-right the initiative purportedly has the support from the highest levels of german politics .
chancellor gerhard schröder is said to have backed plans for organizing a mass protest against the far-right .
according to his spokesman , bela anda , schröder said he believed it is the responsibility of all major parties to join forces and organize an official demonstration on may 8 against anti-semitism and intolerance . there must be “ powerful proof from the upright and righteous public ” that germany does not tolerate right-wing extremism , anda said quoting schröder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the 60th anniversary of the freeing of auschwitz , a german puts a candle on the former rail track leading from berlin to auschwitz .
israel ’ s former ambassador to germany , avi primor , recalling the chains of lights and rallies of the early 1990s when tens of thousands of germans protested against right-wing extremism , said something similar is needed today . social democrats leader franz müntefering said contacts were already underway between the mainstream political parties to organize a protest march on may 8 in front of the brandenburg gate in berlin .
“ there are contacts between the parties , the churches and the trade unions .
we all agree we should not leave the place to the neo-nazis , ” müntefering told german public broadcaster ard . the announcement comes after germany ’ s resurgent far-right parties , which last year scored electoral success in two eastern state assemblies and plan to join forces for the 2006 general election , let it be known that they plan to mark the end of world war ii with their own marches in front of the brandenburg gate on may 7 and 8 . party ban for right-wing extremists in light of the recent attention the right-wing parties have generated in recent weeks – most specifically the npd in saxony with their criticism of honoring holocaust victims – many in the government and across political parties have resumed the call to ban right-wing parties .
a mass protest is not enough , they claim ; the government needs to prove that such extremism is against the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " nazis out " reads a poster during a protest in kiel on jan .
30 , 2005 .
fraction leader for junior coalition partner the greens , katrin göring-eckard , said the npd needs to be outlawed .
if it is foreseeable that national-socialism will be glorified and nazi victims disparaged as part of a party ’ s ideology , then there must be a legal option for prohibiting the party ’ s assemblies and forcing it to disband . vice president for the central council of jews in germany charlotte knobloch criticized the government for not being more forceful in its opposition to the npd and right-wing extremism .
a party that is allowed to build itself on the basis of anti-semitism and hatred of foreigners and can continue to demonstrate freely is a sign of a government ’ s weakness . it is time for the government to push for a new ban on the npd , she told the welt am sonntag newspaper .
the initiative , however , has yet to be officially embraced by schröder ’ s government .
in 2003 , the center-left government tried to have the party outlawed on the grounds that it stirred racial hatred , but the case was rejected in the supreme court . since then the npd has continued to grow in popularity , especially in the economically depressed eastern states such as saxony , where it produced the far-right ’ s best showing in six years when it won nearly 10 percent of the vote in september ’ s parliamentary election . recollections of 1932 ? schröder ’ s government is largely to blame for the rise of the far-right , according to christian social union leader edmund stoiber .
“ the failure of schröder ’ s economic policies and the extensive unemployment creates the environment in which extremism thrives , ” the former chancellor candidate told welt am sonntag . with five million jobless , germany has broken an absolute record , stoiber said , and added that if the 1.5 million people economics minister wolfgang clement said are involved in work programs are added to the figure , “ germany will find itself in a situation not unlike that of 1932 . ” spd party leader münterfering dismissed the parallel to pre-hitler germany .
speaking to the local newspaper pinneberger tageblatt , he said neither the spd nor the opposition was responsible for the rise of the far-right in saxony .

but ideas of beauty are changing . the curtain goes up , the spotlight is on , and a beautiful woman strides along the catwalk , radiating pure sexiness .
it does n't matter that iris schain is wearing a size 14 .
twiggy she is n't .
schain works for " bella donna " in cologne , a modeling agency for full-figured women .
the 42-year-old stands by her pounds and is happy that " normal " women like her are finally receiving attention on catwalks and on television .
" when i wander through the stores , i keep noticing that certain sizes are left : 6 , 8 and 10 , " she said .
" that really says it all . "

women " in full form " are exactly the right size at " bella donna . "
the cologne agency only works with full-figured models .
all ten women working here wear size 12 or up .
renate schmidt , who founded the agency , said there is a gap in the market , and women with realistic measurements - that is to say with curves - are conquering more and more public space .
schmidt keeps her eyes open for potential full-size models .
" looking around on the streets of cologne , i ca n't help thinking that there are really enough women with nice measurements , great proportions and personal magnetism , who are beautiful and would be quite right for the modeling profession , " she said . xl direct in the meantime , finding clients who are interested in the full-figured beauties is not a problem anymore , schmidt said .
the xl models from " bella donna " get requests for photo shoots and fashion shows .
companies do not only want to advertise with skinny beauties anymore , when in reality no average woman can identify with them , schmidt said .
jens hofmann , manager of a fashion store in cologne , agrees that the majority of women do n't fit today 's idealized type , or petit sizes .
" in my opinion , this world view has to be put in the right place . "
statistics show that german women swing back and forth between sizes 10 and 16 .
bildunterschrift : casting for full-figured models .
full-figured , not fat modern women are becoming more self-assured and have come to accept the way they look , said hofmann , who added that he has observed new self-confidence .
" looking at young women today , many of whom are really not that skinny at all , you notice that they have a different body consciousness than just a few years ago , " he said .
" nowadays you easily walk the streets in a tight-fitting outfit . "
according to renate schmidt , corpulent women feel increasingly less like torturing themselves with strict diets and sports to achieve the super slim ideal .
she 's pleased they 're willing to accept their love handles , but said beauty is as varied as women are .
" we do n't wish for the common concept of beauty to concentrate exclusively on women with a little more , " she said .

despite a vibrant emotional appeal for action by former south african president nelson mandela , the group of seven remained deeply divided over the issue of increasing development aid for the world ’ s poorest countries . ministers met at the home of british chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown early saturday after failing to reach common ground on third world development aid during a working dinner the previous night .
finance chiefs and central bankers from britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and the united states had met friday with mandela who urged them to back a doubling in annual development assistance to 100 billion dollars and approve 100 percent debt cancellation for africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south africa 's former president nelson mandela speaks in london 's trafalgar square during the ' make poverty history ' rally thursday feb .
3 , 2005 .
" i urge you to act tonight , do not delay when poor people continue to suffer , " mandela said . 100 percent debt relief after a marathon session , a widening rift between europe and the us was thwarted in the final stage of discussion when gordon brown announced that finance ministers from the g7 had in fact for the first time expressed firm willingness to provide as much as 100 percent debt relief for the world ’ s poorest countries . finance chiefs from the g7 countries " agreed on a case-by-case analysis ” of heavily indebted poor countries -lrb- hipc -rrb- to provide as much as “ 100 percent multilateral debt relief . "
the hipc initiative is a joint initiative of the world bank and the international monetary fund that offers debt relief to the world ’ s most impoverished nations which agree to undertake economic reform . " this is the first time as much as 100 percent debt relief has ever been detailed in a g7 communique , " brown told reporters at the end of a two-day meeting . us-european differences the last-minute expression of willingness came none too soon , as europe and the us threatened to leave the g7 session in a deadlock over the issue .
in earlier talks , according to german secretary of state for finance caio koch-weser , " the americans -lrb- were -rrb- in a completely different frame of mind from the europeans . " us undersecretary of the treasury john taylor said friday an additional plan spearheaded by britain to increase development assistance up to 100 billion dollars a year " does n't work " for the united states .
us officials have cited legal problems in connection with the plan , known as the international finance facility -lrb- iff -rrb- . " for the united states it does n't fit in to our budget process , " taylor said in a bbc radio interview on the fringes of g7 meeting .
he said the us did not object to the british plan because of any suspicion about its soundness but simply because it requires governments to commit money for years ahead .
us government rules mean spending can only be agreed a year at a time . britain , however , put on a brave face saturday , with international development secretary hilary benn saying he believed a solution would be found , with or without the backing of the americans , when g7 leaders plus russia meet for a group of eight summit in gleneagles , scotland in july . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman sits outside her squatter shack at alexandra , johannesburg , south africa .
" you do n't need everybody on board to launch the iff , " benn told the bbc .
" one way or the other , what is inconceivable is that the world will come to gleneagles without having found ways of raising the additional money that we know is needed to save children 's lives and to give developing countries the helping hand they need as they help themselves out of poverty , " he said . france and germany launch initiative france and germany meanwhile agreed on the sidelines of the meeting to announce their own joint development plan to increase resources devoted to development financing in the world ’ s poorest countries . finance officials from the two countries said their proposal , which would be put to other european union countries , would consist of an immunization program financed by a mechanism similar to the international finance facility -lrb- iff -rrb- devised by britain .
under the scheme , wealthy countries would guarantee bonds issued by poor nations to raise development funds . a second measure in the french-german proposal could include " airline fuel taxation and charges on plane tickets , " the statement said .
" the proceeds of such a tax could help tackle the health challenges in the poorest countries , especially in africa , in particular severe pandemics like aids and , importantly , later refinance the pilot iff .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.02.2005 germany fights right-wing extremism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " nazis out ! " reads the poster during a protest march in saxony german president horst köhler has called on all germans to actively oppose anti-semitism , while politicians across the spectrum debate banning the right-wing npd party . freshly returned from a four-day visit to israel , köhler sounded the alarm for all levels of german society to take up action and protest what he fears is a broadening of anti-semitism . in an interview with deutschlandradio berlin , the president said although germany was not experiencing a “ giant wave , ” there was ample reason to be concerned about new facets of anti-semitism which expressed themselves most outwardly in criticism of israel and the us .
the events two weeks ago in the state parliament of saxony , in which members of the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- boycotted a tribute to victims of the holocaust , served as a “ wake-up call , ” köhler said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst köhler next to the eternal flame in the hall of remembrance at the yad vashem holocaust museum in jerusalem on tuesday , feb .
1 , 2005 .
germany must now respond to these hateful sentiments not with panic but with well thought out and rational actions , he said .
the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii on may 8 , 1945 , and the events leading up to the historic date provide the perfect opportunity to demonstrate germany ’ s resolve in combating right-wing extremism and anti-semitism of all sorts . government protests against far-right the initiative purportedly has the support from the highest levels of german politics .
chancellor gerhard schröder is said to have backed plans for organizing a mass protest against the far-right .
according to his spokesman , bela anda , schröder said he believed it is the responsibility of all major parties to join forces and organize an official demonstration on may 8 against anti-semitism and intolerance . there must be “ powerful proof from the upright and righteous public ” that germany does not tolerate right-wing extremism , anda said quoting schröder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the 60th anniversary of the freeing of auschwitz , a german puts a candle on the former rail track leading from berlin to auschwitz .
israel ’ s former ambassador to germany , avi primor , recalling the chains of lights and rallies of the early 1990s when tens of thousands of germans protested against right-wing extremism , said something similar is needed today . social democrats leader franz müntefering said contacts were already underway between the mainstream political parties to organize a protest march on may 8 in front of the brandenburg gate in berlin .
“ there are contacts between the parties , the churches and the trade unions .
we all agree we should not leave the place to the neo-nazis , ” müntefering told german public broadcaster ard . the announcement comes after germany ’ s resurgent far-right parties , which last year scored electoral success in two eastern state assemblies and plan to join forces for the 2006 general election , let it be known that they plan to mark the end of world war ii with their own marches in front of the brandenburg gate on may 7 and 8 . party ban for right-wing extremists in light of the recent attention the right-wing parties have generated in recent weeks – most specifically the npd in saxony with their criticism of honoring holocaust victims – many in the government and across political parties have resumed the call to ban right-wing parties .
a mass protest is not enough , they claim ; the government needs to prove that such extremism is against the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " nazis out " reads a poster during a protest in kiel on jan .
30 , 2005 .
fraction leader for junior coalition partner the greens , katrin göring-eckard , said the npd needs to be outlawed .
if it is foreseeable that national-socialism will be glorified and nazi victims disparaged as part of a party ’ s ideology , then there must be a legal option for prohibiting the party ’ s assemblies and forcing it to disband . vice president for the central council of jews in germany charlotte knobloch criticized the government for not being more forceful in its opposition to the npd and right-wing extremism .
a party that is allowed to build itself on the basis of anti-semitism and hatred of foreigners and can continue to demonstrate freely is a sign of a government ’ s weakness . it is time for the government to push for a new ban on the npd , she told the welt am sonntag newspaper .
the initiative , however , has yet to be officially embraced by schröder ’ s government .
in 2003 , the center-left government tried to have the party outlawed on the grounds that it stirred racial hatred , but the case was rejected in the supreme court . since then the npd has continued to grow in popularity , especially in the economically depressed eastern states such as saxony , where it produced the far-right ’ s best showing in six years when it won nearly 10 percent of the vote in september ’ s parliamentary election . recollections of 1932 ? schröder ’ s government is largely to blame for the rise of the far-right , according to christian social union leader edmund stoiber .
“ the failure of schröder ’ s economic policies and the extensive unemployment creates the environment in which extremism thrives , ” the former chancellor candidate told welt am sonntag . with five million jobless , germany has broken an absolute record , stoiber said , and added that if the 1.5 million people economics minister wolfgang clement said are involved in work programs are added to the figure , “ germany will find itself in a situation not unlike that of 1932 . ” spd party leader münterfering dismissed the parallel to pre-hitler germany .
speaking to the local newspaper pinneberger tageblatt , he said neither the spd nor the opposition was responsible for the rise of the far-right in saxony .
“ only the voters are to blame , ” he said . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de köhler : holocaust part of german identity german president horst köhler addressed the israeli parliament wednesday , telling the knesset that responsibility for the holocaust was part of germany 's national identity .

" reads the poster during a protest march in saxony german president horst köhler has called on all germans to actively oppose anti-semitism , while politicians across the spectrum debate banning the right-wing npd party . freshly returned from a four-day visit to israel , köhler sounded the alarm for all levels of german society to take up action and protest what he fears is a broadening of anti-semitism . in an interview with deutschlandradio berlin , the president said although germany was not experiencing a “ giant wave , ” there was ample reason to be concerned about new facets of anti-semitism which expressed themselves most outwardly in criticism of israel and the us .
the events two weeks ago in the state parliament of saxony , in which members of the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- boycotted a tribute to victims of the holocaust , served as a “ wake-up call , ” köhler said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst köhler next to the eternal flame in the hall of remembrance at the yad vashem holocaust museum in jerusalem on tuesday , feb .
1 , 2005 .
germany must now respond to these hateful sentiments not with panic but with well thought out and rational actions , he said .
the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii on may 8 , 1945 , and the events leading up to the historic date provide the perfect opportunity to demonstrate germany ’ s resolve in combating right-wing extremism and anti-semitism of all sorts . government protests against far-right the initiative purportedly has the support from the highest levels of german politics .
chancellor gerhard schröder is said to have backed plans for organizing a mass protest against the far-right .
according to his spokesman , bela anda , schröder said he believed it is the responsibility of all major parties to join forces and organize an official demonstration on may 8 against anti-semitism and intolerance . there must be “ powerful proof from the upright and righteous public ” that germany does not tolerate right-wing extremism , anda said quoting schröder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the 60th anniversary of the freeing of auschwitz , a german puts a candle on the former rail track leading from berlin to auschwitz .
israel ’ s former ambassador to germany , avi primor , recalling the chains of lights and rallies of the early 1990s when tens of thousands of germans protested against right-wing extremism , said something similar is needed today . social democrats leader franz müntefering said contacts were already underway between the mainstream political parties to organize a protest march on may 8 in front of the brandenburg gate in berlin .
“ there are contacts between the parties , the churches and the trade unions .
we all agree we should not leave the place to the neo-nazis , ” müntefering told german public broadcaster ard . the announcement comes after germany ’ s resurgent far-right parties , which last year scored electoral success in two eastern state assemblies and plan to join forces for the 2006 general election , let it be known that they plan to mark the end of world war ii with their own marches in front of the brandenburg gate on may 7 and 8 . party ban for right-wing extremists in light of the recent attention the right-wing parties have generated in recent weeks – most specifically the npd in saxony with their criticism of honoring holocaust victims – many in the government and across political parties have resumed the call to ban right-wing parties .
a mass protest is not enough , they claim ; the government needs to prove that such extremism is against the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " nazis out " reads a poster during a protest in kiel on jan .
30 , 2005 .
fraction leader for junior coalition partner the greens , katrin göring-eckard , said the npd needs to be outlawed .
if it is foreseeable that national-socialism will be glorified and nazi victims disparaged as part of a party ’ s ideology , then there must be a legal option for prohibiting the party ’ s assemblies and forcing it to disband . vice president for the central council of jews in germany charlotte knobloch criticized the government for not being more forceful in its opposition to the npd and right-wing extremism .
a party that is allowed to build itself on the basis of anti-semitism and hatred of foreigners and can continue to demonstrate freely is a sign of a government ’ s weakness . it is time for the government to push for a new ban on the npd , she told the welt am sonntag newspaper .
the initiative , however , has yet to be officially embraced by schröder ’ s government .
in 2003 , the center-left government tried to have the party outlawed on the grounds that it stirred racial hatred , but the case was rejected in the supreme court . since then the npd has continued to grow in popularity , especially in the economically depressed eastern states such as saxony , where it produced the far-right ’ s best showing in six years when it won nearly 10 percent of the vote in september ’ s parliamentary election . recollections of 1932 ? schröder ’ s government is largely to blame for the rise of the far-right , according to christian social union leader edmund stoiber .
“ the failure of schröder ’ s economic policies and the extensive unemployment creates the environment in which extremism thrives , ” the former chancellor candidate told welt am sonntag . with five million jobless , germany has broken an absolute record , stoiber said , and added that if the 1.5 million people economics minister wolfgang clement said are involved in work programs are added to the figure , “ germany will find itself in a situation not unlike that of 1932 . ” spd party leader münterfering dismissed the parallel to pre-hitler germany .
speaking to the local newspaper pinneberger tageblatt , he said neither the spd nor the opposition was responsible for the rise of the far-right in saxony .

despite a vibrant emotional appeal for action by former south african president nelson mandela , the group of seven remained deeply divided over the issue of increasing development aid for the world ’ s poorest countries . ministers met at the home of british chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown early saturday after failing to reach common ground on third world development aid during a working dinner the previous night .

" reads the poster during a protest march in saxony german president horst köhler has called on all germans to actively oppose anti-semitism , while politicians across the spectrum debate banning the right-wing npd party . freshly returned from a four-day visit to israel , köhler sounded the alarm for all levels of german society to take up action and protest what he fears is a broadening of anti-semitism . in an interview with deutschlandradio berlin , the president said although germany was not experiencing a “ giant wave , ” there was ample reason to be concerned about new facets of anti-semitism which expressed themselves most outwardly in criticism of israel and the us .
the events two weeks ago in the state parliament of saxony , in which members of the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- boycotted a tribute to victims of the holocaust , served as a “ wake-up call , ” köhler said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst köhler next to the eternal flame in the hall of remembrance at the yad vashem holocaust museum in jerusalem on tuesday , feb .
1 , 2005 .
germany must now respond to these hateful sentiments not with panic but with well thought out and rational actions , he said .
the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii on may 8 , 1945 , and the events leading up to the historic date provide the perfect opportunity to demonstrate germany ’ s resolve in combating right-wing extremism and anti-semitism of all sorts . government protests against far-right the initiative purportedly has the support from the highest levels of german politics .
chancellor gerhard schröder is said to have backed plans for organizing a mass protest against the far-right .
according to his spokesman , bela anda , schröder said he believed it is the responsibility of all major parties to join forces and organize an official demonstration on may 8 against anti-semitism and intolerance . there must be “ powerful proof from the upright and righteous public ” that germany does not tolerate right-wing extremism , anda said quoting schröder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the 60th anniversary of the freeing of auschwitz , a german puts a candle on the former rail track leading from berlin to auschwitz .
israel ’ s former ambassador to germany , avi primor , recalling the chains of lights and rallies of the early 1990s when tens of thousands of germans protested against right-wing extremism , said something similar is needed today . social democrats leader franz müntefering said contacts were already underway between the mainstream political parties to organize a protest march on may 8 in front of the brandenburg gate in berlin .
“ there are contacts between the parties , the churches and the trade unions .
we all agree we should not leave the place to the neo-nazis , ” müntefering told german public broadcaster ard . the announcement comes after germany ’ s resurgent far-right parties , which last year scored electoral success in two eastern state assemblies and plan to join forces for the 2006 general election , let it be known that they plan to mark the end of world war ii with their own marches in front of the brandenburg gate on may 7 and 8 . party ban for right-wing extremists in light of the recent attention the right-wing parties have generated in recent weeks – most specifically the npd in saxony with their criticism of honoring holocaust victims – many in the government and across political parties have resumed the call to ban right-wing parties .
a mass protest is not enough , they claim ; the government needs to prove that such extremism is against the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " nazis out " reads a poster during a protest in kiel on jan .
30 , 2005 .
fraction leader for junior coalition partner the greens , katrin göring-eckard , said the npd needs to be outlawed .
if it is foreseeable that national-socialism will be glorified and nazi victims disparaged as part of a party ’ s ideology , then there must be a legal option for prohibiting the party ’ s assemblies and forcing it to disband . vice president for the central council of jews in germany charlotte knobloch criticized the government for not being more forceful in its opposition to the npd and right-wing extremism .
a party that is allowed to build itself on the basis of anti-semitism and hatred of foreigners and can continue to demonstrate freely is a sign of a government ’ s weakness . it is time for the government to push for a new ban on the npd , she told the welt am sonntag newspaper .
the initiative , however , has yet to be officially embraced by schröder ’ s government .
in 2003 , the center-left government tried to have the party outlawed on the grounds that it stirred racial hatred , but the case was rejected in the supreme court . since then the npd has continued to grow in popularity , especially in the economically depressed eastern states such as saxony , where it produced the far-right ’ s best showing in six years when it won nearly 10 percent of the vote in september ’ s parliamentary election . recollections of 1932 ? schröder ’ s government is largely to blame for the rise of the far-right , according to christian social union leader edmund stoiber .
“ the failure of schröder ’ s economic policies and the extensive unemployment creates the environment in which extremism thrives , ” the former chancellor candidate told welt am sonntag . with five million jobless , germany has broken an absolute record , stoiber said , and added that if the 1.5 million people economics minister wolfgang clement said are involved in work programs are added to the figure , “ germany will find itself in a situation not unlike that of 1932 . ” spd party leader münterfering dismissed the parallel to pre-hitler germany .
speaking to the local newspaper pinneberger tageblatt , he said neither the spd nor the opposition was responsible for the rise of the far-right in saxony .

the events two weeks ago in the state parliament of saxony , in which members of the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- boycotted a tribute to victims of the holocaust , served as a “ wake-up call , ” köhler said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst köhler next to the eternal flame in the hall of remembrance at the yad vashem holocaust museum in jerusalem on tuesday , feb .

germany must now respond to these hateful sentiments not with panic but with well thought out and rational actions , he said .
the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii on may 8 , 1945 , and the events leading up to the historic date provide the perfect opportunity to demonstrate germany ’ s resolve in combating right-wing extremism and anti-semitism of all sorts . government protests against far-right the initiative purportedly has the support from the highest levels of german politics .
chancellor gerhard schröder is said to have backed plans for organizing a mass protest against the far-right .
according to his spokesman , bela anda , schröder said he believed it is the responsibility of all major parties to join forces and organize an official demonstration on may 8 against anti-semitism and intolerance . there must be “ powerful proof from the upright and righteous public ” that germany does not tolerate right-wing extremism , anda said quoting schröder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the 60th anniversary of the freeing of auschwitz , a german puts a candle on the former rail track leading from berlin to auschwitz .
israel ’ s former ambassador to germany , avi primor , recalling the chains of lights and rallies of the early 1990s when tens of thousands of germans protested against right-wing extremism , said something similar is needed today . social democrats leader franz müntefering said contacts were already underway between the mainstream political parties to organize a protest march on may 8 in front of the brandenburg gate in berlin .
“ there are contacts between the parties , the churches and the trade unions .
we all agree we should not leave the place to the neo-nazis , ” müntefering told german public broadcaster ard . the announcement comes after germany ’ s resurgent far-right parties , which last year scored electoral success in two eastern state assemblies and plan to join forces for the 2006 general election , let it be known that they plan to mark the end of world war ii with their own marches in front of the brandenburg gate on may 7 and 8 . party ban for right-wing extremists in light of the recent attention the right-wing parties have generated in recent weeks – most specifically the npd in saxony with their criticism of honoring holocaust victims – many in the government and across political parties have resumed the call to ban right-wing parties .
a mass protest is not enough , they claim ; the government needs to prove that such extremism is against the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " nazis out " reads a poster during a protest in kiel on jan .
30 , 2005 .
fraction leader for junior coalition partner the greens , katrin göring-eckard , said the npd needs to be outlawed .
if it is foreseeable that national-socialism will be glorified and nazi victims disparaged as part of a party ’ s ideology , then there must be a legal option for prohibiting the party ’ s assemblies and forcing it to disband . vice president for the central council of jews in germany charlotte knobloch criticized the government for not being more forceful in its opposition to the npd and right-wing extremism .
a party that is allowed to build itself on the basis of anti-semitism and hatred of foreigners and can continue to demonstrate freely is a sign of a government ’ s weakness . it is time for the government to push for a new ban on the npd , she told the welt am sonntag newspaper .
the initiative , however , has yet to be officially embraced by schröder ’ s government .
in 2003 , the center-left government tried to have the party outlawed on the grounds that it stirred racial hatred , but the case was rejected in the supreme court . since then the npd has continued to grow in popularity , especially in the economically depressed eastern states such as saxony , where it produced the far-right ’ s best showing in six years when it won nearly 10 percent of the vote in september ’ s parliamentary election . recollections of 1932 ? schröder ’ s government is largely to blame for the rise of the far-right , according to christian social union leader edmund stoiber .
“ the failure of schröder ’ s economic policies and the extensive unemployment creates the environment in which extremism thrives , ” the former chancellor candidate told welt am sonntag . with five million jobless , germany has broken an absolute record , stoiber said , and added that if the 1.5 million people economics minister wolfgang clement said are involved in work programs are added to the figure , “ germany will find itself in a situation not unlike that of 1932 . ” spd party leader münterfering dismissed the parallel to pre-hitler germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : a stain on the soul of german soccer key man in match rigging scandal released soccer chiefs debate betting post-hoyzer referee scandal rears its ugly head former dortmund player admits to bribe germany -pipe- 05.02.2005 dodgy dealings mark german bookmaking the german bookmaking scene , in the spotlight since the eruption of the soccer match-fixing scandal , is worth billions .
but the presence of private bookies along with state companies makes the market tough to monitor . when news that a berlin referee fixed soccer matches in order to win bets broke two weeks ago , it was not hard for local authorities to believe . intelligence authorities say the german capital , the home of tainted referee robert hoyzer -lrb- photo -rrb- who has triggered one of the worst scandals in german soccer history , is a paradise for illegal bookies .
alongside established , state-controlled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert hoyzer companies like oddset , private companies , some of them with dubious operating licenses , have set up shop in berlin and the rest of germany .
it 's not hard to see why : bookmaking in germany is a € 1.2 billion business , and sports has around 80 percent share of that figure .
the private firms are almost impossible for intelligence authorities to track because they keep changing their operations .
and the more lucrative options the companies offer bettors have helped them grow in influence , something that worries soccer officials . " this whole bookmaking scene has changed a lot , " said theo zwanziger , president of the german football association .
" in particular , the private bookies , who are increasingly intervening in the actual course of the game . " cracking down on private firms unlike oddset , which allows combination betting on three games , private companies allow a number of different combinations .
for example , bettors can wager on the first yellow card , the first objection or the first free kick of the soccer game .

" reads the poster during a protest march in saxony german president horst köhler has called on all germans to actively oppose anti-semitism , while politicians across the spectrum debate banning the right-wing npd party . freshly returned from a four-day visit to israel , köhler sounded the alarm for all levels of german society to take up action and protest what he fears is a broadening of anti-semitism . in an interview with deutschlandradio berlin , the president said although germany was not experiencing a “ giant wave , ” there was ample reason to be concerned about new facets of anti-semitism which expressed themselves most outwardly in criticism of israel and the us .
the events two weeks ago in the state parliament of saxony , in which members of the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- boycotted a tribute to victims of the holocaust , served as a “ wake-up call , ” köhler said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst köhler next to the eternal flame in the hall of remembrance at the yad vashem holocaust museum in jerusalem on tuesday , feb .
1 , 2005 .
germany must now respond to these hateful sentiments not with panic but with well thought out and rational actions , he said .
the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii on may 8 , 1945 , and the events leading up to the historic date provide the perfect opportunity to demonstrate germany ’ s resolve in combating right-wing extremism and anti-semitism of all sorts . government protests against far-right the initiative purportedly has the support from the highest levels of german politics .
chancellor gerhard schröder is said to have backed plans for organizing a mass protest against the far-right .
according to his spokesman , bela anda , schröder said he believed it is the responsibility of all major parties to join forces and organize an official demonstration on may 8 against anti-semitism and intolerance . there must be “ powerful proof from the upright and righteous public ” that germany does not tolerate right-wing extremism , anda said quoting schröder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the 60th anniversary of the freeing of auschwitz , a german puts a candle on the former rail track leading from berlin to auschwitz .
israel ’ s former ambassador to germany , avi primor , recalling the chains of lights and rallies of the early 1990s when tens of thousands of germans protested against right-wing extremism , said something similar is needed today . social democrats leader franz müntefering said contacts were already underway between the mainstream political parties to organize a protest march on may 8 in front of the brandenburg gate in berlin .
“ there are contacts between the parties , the churches and the trade unions .
we all agree we should not leave the place to the neo-nazis , ” müntefering told german public broadcaster ard . the announcement comes after germany ’ s resurgent far-right parties , which last year scored electoral success in two eastern state assemblies and plan to join forces for the 2006 general election , let it be known that they plan to mark the end of world war ii with their own marches in front of the brandenburg gate on may 7 and 8 . party ban for right-wing extremists in light of the recent attention the right-wing parties have generated in recent weeks – most specifically the npd in saxony with their criticism of honoring holocaust victims – many in the government and across political parties have resumed the call to ban right-wing parties .
a mass protest is not enough , they claim ; the government needs to prove that such extremism is against the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " nazis out " reads a poster during a protest in kiel on jan .
30 , 2005 .
fraction leader for junior coalition partner the greens , katrin göring-eckard , said the npd needs to be outlawed .
if it is foreseeable that national-socialism will be glorified and nazi victims disparaged as part of a party ’ s ideology , then there must be a legal option for prohibiting the party ’ s assemblies and forcing it to disband . vice president for the central council of jews in germany charlotte knobloch criticized the government for not being more forceful in its opposition to the npd and right-wing extremism .
a party that is allowed to build itself on the basis of anti-semitism and hatred of foreigners and can continue to demonstrate freely is a sign of a government ’ s weakness . it is time for the government to push for a new ban on the npd , she told the welt am sonntag newspaper .
the initiative , however , has yet to be officially embraced by schröder ’ s government .
in 2003 , the center-left government tried to have the party outlawed on the grounds that it stirred racial hatred , but the case was rejected in the supreme court . since then the npd has continued to grow in popularity , especially in the economically depressed eastern states such as saxony , where it produced the far-right ’ s best showing in six years when it won nearly 10 percent of the vote in september ’ s parliamentary election . recollections of 1932 ? schröder ’ s government is largely to blame for the rise of the far-right , according to christian social union leader edmund stoiber .
“ the failure of schröder ’ s economic policies and the extensive unemployment creates the environment in which extremism thrives , ” the former chancellor candidate told welt am sonntag . with five million jobless , germany has broken an absolute record , stoiber said , and added that if the 1.5 million people economics minister wolfgang clement said are involved in work programs are added to the figure , “ germany will find itself in a situation not unlike that of 1932 . ” spd party leader münterfering dismissed the parallel to pre-hitler germany .
speaking to the local newspaper pinneberger tageblatt , he said neither the spd nor the opposition was responsible for the rise of the far-right in saxony .
“ only the voters are to blame , ” he said . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de köhler : holocaust part of german identity german president horst köhler addressed the israeli parliament wednesday , telling the knesset that responsibility for the holocaust was part of germany 's national identity .

" reads the poster during a protest march in saxony german president horst köhler has called on all germans to actively oppose anti-semitism , while politicians across the spectrum debate banning the right-wing npd party . freshly returned from a four-day visit to israel , köhler sounded the alarm for all levels of german society to take up action and protest what he fears is a broadening of anti-semitism . in an interview with deutschlandradio berlin , the president said although germany was not experiencing a “ giant wave , ” there was ample reason to be concerned about new facets of anti-semitism which expressed themselves most outwardly in criticism of israel and the us .
the events two weeks ago in the state parliament of saxony , in which members of the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- boycotted a tribute to victims of the holocaust , served as a “ wake-up call , ” köhler said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst köhler next to the eternal flame in the hall of remembrance at the yad vashem holocaust museum in jerusalem on tuesday , feb .
1 , 2005 .
germany must now respond to these hateful sentiments not with panic but with well thought out and rational actions , he said .
the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii on may 8 , 1945 , and the events leading up to the historic date provide the perfect opportunity to demonstrate germany ’ s resolve in combating right-wing extremism and anti-semitism of all sorts . government protests against far-right the initiative purportedly has the support from the highest levels of german politics .
chancellor gerhard schröder is said to have backed plans for organizing a mass protest against the far-right .
according to his spokesman , bela anda , schröder said he believed it is the responsibility of all major parties to join forces and organize an official demonstration on may 8 against anti-semitism and intolerance . there must be “ powerful proof from the upright and righteous public ” that germany does not tolerate right-wing extremism , anda said quoting schröder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the 60th anniversary of the freeing of auschwitz , a german puts a candle on the former rail track leading from berlin to auschwitz .
israel ’ s former ambassador to germany , avi primor , recalling the chains of lights and rallies of the early 1990s when tens of thousands of germans protested against right-wing extremism , said something similar is needed today . social democrats leader franz müntefering said contacts were already underway between the mainstream political parties to organize a protest march on may 8 in front of the brandenburg gate in berlin .
“ there are contacts between the parties , the churches and the trade unions .
we all agree we should not leave the place to the neo-nazis , ” müntefering told german public broadcaster ard . the announcement comes after germany ’ s resurgent far-right parties , which last year scored electoral success in two eastern state assemblies and plan to join forces for the 2006 general election , let it be known that they plan to mark the end of world war ii with their own marches in front of the brandenburg gate on may 7 and 8 . party ban for right-wing extremists in light of the recent attention the right-wing parties have generated in recent weeks – most specifically the npd in saxony with their criticism of honoring holocaust victims – many in the government and across political parties have resumed the call to ban right-wing parties .
a mass protest is not enough , they claim ; the government needs to prove that such extremism is against the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " nazis out " reads a poster during a protest in kiel on jan .
30 , 2005 .
fraction leader for junior coalition partner the greens , katrin göring-eckard , said the npd needs to be outlawed .
if it is foreseeable that national-socialism will be glorified and nazi victims disparaged as part of a party ’ s ideology , then there must be a legal option for prohibiting the party ’ s assemblies and forcing it to disband . vice president for the central council of jews in germany charlotte knobloch criticized the government for not being more forceful in its opposition to the npd and right-wing extremism .
a party that is allowed to build itself on the basis of anti-semitism and hatred of foreigners and can continue to demonstrate freely is a sign of a government ’ s weakness . it is time for the government to push for a new ban on the npd , she told the welt am sonntag newspaper .
the initiative , however , has yet to be officially embraced by schröder ’ s government .
in 2003 , the center-left government tried to have the party outlawed on the grounds that it stirred racial hatred , but the case was rejected in the supreme court . since then the npd has continued to grow in popularity , especially in the economically depressed eastern states such as saxony , where it produced the far-right ’ s best showing in six years when it won nearly 10 percent of the vote in september ’ s parliamentary election . recollections of 1932 ? schröder ’ s government is largely to blame for the rise of the far-right , according to christian social union leader edmund stoiber .
“ the failure of schröder ’ s economic policies and the extensive unemployment creates the environment in which extremism thrives , ” the former chancellor candidate told welt am sonntag . with five million jobless , germany has broken an absolute record , stoiber said , and added that if the 1.5 million people economics minister wolfgang clement said are involved in work programs are added to the figure , “ germany will find itself in a situation not unlike that of 1932 . ” spd party leader münterfering dismissed the parallel to pre-hitler germany .
speaking to the local newspaper pinneberger tageblatt , he said neither the spd nor the opposition was responsible for the rise of the far-right in saxony .
“ only the voters are to blame , ” he said . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de köhler : holocaust part of german identity german president horst köhler addressed the israeli parliament wednesday , telling the knesset that responsibility for the holocaust was part of germany 's national identity .

" reads the poster during a protest march in saxony german president horst köhler has called on all germans to actively oppose anti-semitism , while politicians across the spectrum debate banning the right-wing npd party . freshly returned from a four-day visit to israel , köhler sounded the alarm for all levels of german society to take up action and protest what he fears is a broadening of anti-semitism . in an interview with deutschlandradio berlin , the president said although germany was not experiencing a “ giant wave , ” there was ample reason to be concerned about new facets of anti-semitism which expressed themselves most outwardly in criticism of israel and the us .
the events two weeks ago in the state parliament of saxony , in which members of the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- boycotted a tribute to victims of the holocaust , served as a “ wake-up call , ” köhler said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst köhler next to the eternal flame in the hall of remembrance at the yad vashem holocaust museum in jerusalem on tuesday , feb .
1 , 2005 .
germany must now respond to these hateful sentiments not with panic but with well thought out and rational actions , he said .
the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii on may 8 , 1945 , and the events leading up to the historic date provide the perfect opportunity to demonstrate germany ’ s resolve in combating right-wing extremism and anti-semitism of all sorts . government protests against far-right the initiative purportedly has the support from the highest levels of german politics .
chancellor gerhard schröder is said to have backed plans for organizing a mass protest against the far-right .
according to his spokesman , bela anda , schröder said he believed it is the responsibility of all major parties to join forces and organize an official demonstration on may 8 against anti-semitism and intolerance . there must be “ powerful proof from the upright and righteous public ” that germany does not tolerate right-wing extremism , anda said quoting schröder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the 60th anniversary of the freeing of auschwitz , a german puts a candle on the former rail track leading from berlin to auschwitz .
israel ’ s former ambassador to germany , avi primor , recalling the chains of lights and rallies of the early 1990s when tens of thousands of germans protested against right-wing extremism , said something similar is needed today . social democrats leader franz müntefering said contacts were already underway between the mainstream political parties to organize a protest march on may 8 in front of the brandenburg gate in berlin .
“ there are contacts between the parties , the churches and the trade unions .
we all agree we should not leave the place to the neo-nazis , ” müntefering told german public broadcaster ard . the announcement comes after germany ’ s resurgent far-right parties , which last year scored electoral success in two eastern state assemblies and plan to join forces for the 2006 general election , let it be known that they plan to mark the end of world war ii with their own marches in front of the brandenburg gate on may 7 and 8 . party ban for right-wing extremists in light of the recent attention the right-wing parties have generated in recent weeks – most specifically the npd in saxony with their criticism of honoring holocaust victims – many in the government and across political parties have resumed the call to ban right-wing parties .
a mass protest is not enough , they claim ; the government needs to prove that such extremism is against the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " nazis out " reads a poster during a protest in kiel on jan .
30 , 2005 .
fraction leader for junior coalition partner the greens , katrin göring-eckard , said the npd needs to be outlawed .
if it is foreseeable that national-socialism will be glorified and nazi victims disparaged as part of a party ’ s ideology , then there must be a legal option for prohibiting the party ’ s assemblies and forcing it to disband . vice president for the central council of jews in germany charlotte knobloch criticized the government for not being more forceful in its opposition to the npd and right-wing extremism .
a party that is allowed to build itself on the basis of anti-semitism and hatred of foreigners and can continue to demonstrate freely is a sign of a government ’ s weakness . it is time for the government to push for a new ban on the npd , she told the welt am sonntag newspaper .
the initiative , however , has yet to be officially embraced by schröder ’ s government .
in 2003 , the center-left government tried to have the party outlawed on the grounds that it stirred racial hatred , but the case was rejected in the supreme court . since then the npd has continued to grow in popularity , especially in the economically depressed eastern states such as saxony , where it produced the far-right ’ s best showing in six years when it won nearly 10 percent of the vote in september ’ s parliamentary election . recollections of 1932 ? schröder ’ s government is largely to blame for the rise of the far-right , according to christian social union leader edmund stoiber .
“ the failure of schröder ’ s economic policies and the extensive unemployment creates the environment in which extremism thrives , ” the former chancellor candidate told welt am sonntag . with five million jobless , germany has broken an absolute record , stoiber said , and added that if the 1.5 million people economics minister wolfgang clement said are involved in work programs are added to the figure , “ germany will find itself in a situation not unlike that of 1932 . ” spd party leader münterfering dismissed the parallel to pre-hitler germany .
speaking to the local newspaper pinneberger tageblatt , he said neither the spd nor the opposition was responsible for the rise of the far-right in saxony .
“ only the voters are to blame , ” he said . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de köhler : holocaust part of german identity german president horst köhler addressed the israeli parliament wednesday , telling the knesset that responsibility for the holocaust was part of germany 's national identity .

but the presence of private bookies along with state companies makes the market tough to monitor . when news that a berlin referee fixed soccer matches in order to win bets broke two weeks ago , it was not hard for local authorities to believe . intelligence authorities say the german capital , the home of tainted referee robert hoyzer -lrb- photo -rrb- who has triggered one of the worst scandals in german soccer history , is a paradise for illegal bookies .
alongside established , state-controlled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert hoyzer companies like oddset , private companies , some of them with dubious operating licenses , have set up shop in berlin and the rest of germany .
it 's not hard to see why : bookmaking in germany is a € 1.2 billion business , and sports has around 80 percent share of that figure .
the private firms are almost impossible for intelligence authorities to track because they keep changing their operations .
and the more lucrative options the companies offer bettors have helped them grow in influence , something that worries soccer officials . " this whole bookmaking scene has changed a lot , " said theo zwanziger , president of the german football association .
" in particular , the private bookies , who are increasingly intervening in the actual course of the game . " cracking down on private firms unlike oddset , which allows combination betting on three games , private companies allow a number of different combinations .
for example , bettors can wager on the first yellow card , the first objection or the first free kick of the soccer game .
according to critics , it 's exactly these special betting tactics that lead to manipulation and fixing of games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoyzer , right , admitted to fixing a tournament game between hsv hamburg and sc paderborn to counter the problem , the dfb together is now pushing for a better monitoring system that would be activated as soon as there was suspicion of foul play . " that means when the bookmakers notice that a particular match is marked by an extraordinarily high number of bets on an outsider team then it does signalize that there 's something amiss , " said zwanziger .
" that could perhaps give the dfb and the committee of referees the possibility of swapping out referees at the last minute . " officials are aided by the fact that private bookies , unlike companies like oddset , require the identification or credit card numbers of their clients . no general betting ban yet for players there are also calls for a general betting ban on participating players , club owners and politicians .
but many doubt such a rule 's effectiveness . rudi assauer , manager of bundesliga team schalke 04 say it will be easy to get around it .
" i can bet the way i want via a frontman , " assauer said .
" only thing is , at the end when the lid 's blown off then you 'll be in deep trouble . " german politicians have now avowed to step up the fight against illegal bookmakes in order to minimize the risk of fraud .
but , concrete proposals are still to come and the situation is made worse by the fact that the legal process to nab illegal bookies is highly complicated . arnulf boettcher -lrb- sp / dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cops raid homes in soccer scandal a mass police raid on the premises of 19 football match-fixing suspects has uncovered more proof of manipulation , the berlin public prosecuter 's office confirmed on wednesday .

but the presence of private bookies along with state companies makes the market tough to monitor . when news that a berlin referee fixed soccer matches in order to win bets broke two weeks ago , it was not hard for local authorities to believe . intelligence authorities say the german capital , the home of tainted referee robert hoyzer -lrb- photo -rrb- who has triggered one of the worst scandals in german soccer history , is a paradise for illegal bookies .
alongside established , state-controlled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert hoyzer companies like oddset , private companies , some of them with dubious operating licenses , have set up shop in berlin and the rest of germany .
it 's not hard to see why : bookmaking in germany is a € 1.2 billion business , and sports has around 80 percent share of that figure .
the private firms are almost impossible for intelligence authorities to track because they keep changing their operations .
and the more lucrative options the companies offer bettors have helped them grow in influence , something that worries soccer officials . " this whole bookmaking scene has changed a lot , " said theo zwanziger , president of the german football association .
" in particular , the private bookies , who are increasingly intervening in the actual course of the game . " cracking down on private firms unlike oddset , which allows combination betting on three games , private companies allow a number of different combinations .
for example , bettors can wager on the first yellow card , the first objection or the first free kick of the soccer game .
according to critics , it 's exactly these special betting tactics that lead to manipulation and fixing of games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoyzer , right , admitted to fixing a tournament game between hsv hamburg and sc paderborn to counter the problem , the dfb together is now pushing for a better monitoring system that would be activated as soon as there was suspicion of foul play . " that means when the bookmakers notice that a particular match is marked by an extraordinarily high number of bets on an outsider team then it does signalize that there 's something amiss , " said zwanziger .
" that could perhaps give the dfb and the committee of referees the possibility of swapping out referees at the last minute .

" reads the poster during a protest march in saxony german president horst köhler has called on all germans to actively oppose anti-semitism , while politicians across the spectrum debate banning the right-wing npd party . freshly returned from a four-day visit to israel , köhler sounded the alarm for all levels of german society to take up action and protest what he fears is a broadening of anti-semitism . in an interview with deutschlandradio berlin , the president said although germany was not experiencing a “ giant wave , ” there was ample reason to be concerned about new facets of anti-semitism which expressed themselves most outwardly in criticism of israel and the us .
the events two weeks ago in the state parliament of saxony , in which members of the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- boycotted a tribute to victims of the holocaust , served as a “ wake-up call , ” köhler said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst köhler next to the eternal flame in the hall of remembrance at the yad vashem holocaust museum in jerusalem on tuesday , feb .
1 , 2005 .
germany must now respond to these hateful sentiments not with panic but with well thought out and rational actions , he said .
the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii on may 8 , 1945 , and the events leading up to the historic date provide the perfect opportunity to demonstrate germany ’ s resolve in combating right-wing extremism and anti-semitism of all sorts . government protests against far-right the initiative purportedly has the support from the highest levels of german politics .
chancellor gerhard schröder is said to have backed plans for organizing a mass protest against the far-right .
according to his spokesman , bela anda , schröder said he believed it is the responsibility of all major parties to join forces and organize an official demonstration on may 8 against anti-semitism and intolerance . there must be “ powerful proof from the upright and righteous public ” that germany does not tolerate right-wing extremism , anda said quoting schröder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the 60th anniversary of the freeing of auschwitz , a german puts a candle on the former rail track leading from berlin to auschwitz .
israel ’ s former ambassador to germany , avi primor , recalling the chains of lights and rallies of the early 1990s when tens of thousands of germans protested against right-wing extremism , said something similar is needed today . social democrats leader franz müntefering said contacts were already underway between the mainstream political parties to organize a protest march on may 8 in front of the brandenburg gate in berlin .
“ there are contacts between the parties , the churches and the trade unions .
we all agree we should not leave the place to the neo-nazis , ” müntefering told german public broadcaster ard . the announcement comes after germany ’ s resurgent far-right parties , which last year scored electoral success in two eastern state assemblies and plan to join forces for the 2006 general election , let it be known that they plan to mark the end of world war ii with their own marches in front of the brandenburg gate on may 7 and 8 . party ban for right-wing extremists in light of the recent attention the right-wing parties have generated in recent weeks – most specifically the npd in saxony with their criticism of honoring holocaust victims – many in the government and across political parties have resumed the call to ban right-wing parties .
a mass protest is not enough , they claim ; the government needs to prove that such extremism is against the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " nazis out " reads a poster during a protest in kiel on jan .
30 , 2005 .
fraction leader for junior coalition partner the greens , katrin göring-eckard , said the npd needs to be outlawed .
if it is foreseeable that national-socialism will be glorified and nazi victims disparaged as part of a party ’ s ideology , then there must be a legal option for prohibiting the party ’ s assemblies and forcing it to disband . vice president for the central council of jews in germany charlotte knobloch criticized the government for not being more forceful in its opposition to the npd and right-wing extremism .
a party that is allowed to build itself on the basis of anti-semitism and hatred of foreigners and can continue to demonstrate freely is a sign of a government ’ s weakness . it is time for the government to push for a new ban on the npd , she told the welt am sonntag newspaper .
the initiative , however , has yet to be officially embraced by schröder ’ s government .
in 2003 , the center-left government tried to have the party outlawed on the grounds that it stirred racial hatred , but the case was rejected in the supreme court . since then the npd has continued to grow in popularity , especially in the economically depressed eastern states such as saxony , where it produced the far-right ’ s best showing in six years when it won nearly 10 percent of the vote in september ’ s parliamentary election . recollections of 1932 ? schröder ’ s government is largely to blame for the rise of the far-right , according to christian social union leader edmund stoiber .
“ the failure of schröder ’ s economic policies and the extensive unemployment creates the environment in which extremism thrives , ” the former chancellor candidate told welt am sonntag . with five million jobless , germany has broken an absolute record , stoiber said , and added that if the 1.5 million people economics minister wolfgang clement said are involved in work programs are added to the figure , “ germany will find itself in a situation not unlike that of 1932 . ” spd party leader münterfering dismissed the parallel to pre-hitler germany .
speaking to the local newspaper pinneberger tageblatt , he said neither the spd nor the opposition was responsible for the rise of the far-right in saxony .
“ only the voters are to blame , ” he said . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de köhler : holocaust part of german identity german president horst köhler addressed the israeli parliament wednesday , telling the knesset that responsibility for the holocaust was part of germany 's national identity .

" reads the poster during a protest march in saxony german president horst köhler has called on all germans to actively oppose anti-semitism , while politicians across the spectrum debate banning the right-wing npd party . freshly returned from a four-day visit to israel , köhler sounded the alarm for all levels of german society to take up action and protest what he fears is a broadening of anti-semitism . in an interview with deutschlandradio berlin , the president said although germany was not experiencing a “ giant wave , ” there was ample reason to be concerned about new facets of anti-semitism which expressed themselves most outwardly in criticism of israel and the us .
the events two weeks ago in the state parliament of saxony , in which members of the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- boycotted a tribute to victims of the holocaust , served as a “ wake-up call , ” köhler said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst köhler next to the eternal flame in the hall of remembrance at the yad vashem holocaust museum in jerusalem on tuesday , feb .
1 , 2005 .
germany must now respond to these hateful sentiments not with panic but with well thought out and rational actions , he said .
the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii on may 8 , 1945 , and the events leading up to the historic date provide the perfect opportunity to demonstrate germany ’ s resolve in combating right-wing extremism and anti-semitism of all sorts . government protests against far-right the initiative purportedly has the support from the highest levels of german politics .
chancellor gerhard schröder is said to have backed plans for organizing a mass protest against the far-right .
according to his spokesman , bela anda , schröder said he believed it is the responsibility of all major parties to join forces and organize an official demonstration on may 8 against anti-semitism and intolerance . there must be “ powerful proof from the upright and righteous public ” that germany does not tolerate right-wing extremism , anda said quoting schröder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the 60th anniversary of the freeing of auschwitz , a german puts a candle on the former rail track leading from berlin to auschwitz .
israel ’ s former ambassador to germany , avi primor , recalling the chains of lights and rallies of the early 1990s when tens of thousands of germans protested against right-wing extremism , said something similar is needed today . social democrats leader franz müntefering said contacts were already underway between the mainstream political parties to organize a protest march on may 8 in front of the brandenburg gate in berlin .
“ there are contacts between the parties , the churches and the trade unions .
we all agree we should not leave the place to the neo-nazis , ” müntefering told german public broadcaster ard . the announcement comes after germany ’ s resurgent far-right parties , which last year scored electoral success in two eastern state assemblies and plan to join forces for the 2006 general election , let it be known that they plan to mark the end of world war ii with their own marches in front of the brandenburg gate on may 7 and 8 . party ban for right-wing extremists in light of the recent attention the right-wing parties have generated in recent weeks – most specifically the npd in saxony with their criticism of honoring holocaust victims – many in the government and across political parties have resumed the call to ban right-wing parties .
a mass protest is not enough , they claim ; the government needs to prove that such extremism is against the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " nazis out " reads a poster during a protest in kiel on jan .
30 , 2005 .
fraction leader for junior coalition partner the greens , katrin göring-eckard , said the npd needs to be outlawed .
if it is foreseeable that national-socialism will be glorified and nazi victims disparaged as part of a party ’ s ideology , then there must be a legal option for prohibiting the party ’ s assemblies and forcing it to disband . vice president for the central council of jews in germany charlotte knobloch criticized the government for not being more forceful in its opposition to the npd and right-wing extremism .
a party that is allowed to build itself on the basis of anti-semitism and hatred of foreigners and can continue to demonstrate freely is a sign of a government ’ s weakness . it is time for the government to push for a new ban on the npd , she told the welt am sonntag newspaper .
the initiative , however , has yet to be officially embraced by schröder ’ s government .
in 2003 , the center-left government tried to have the party outlawed on the grounds that it stirred racial hatred , but the case was rejected in the supreme court . since then the npd has continued to grow in popularity , especially in the economically depressed eastern states such as saxony , where it produced the far-right ’ s best showing in six years when it won nearly 10 percent of the vote in september ’ s parliamentary election . recollections of 1932 ? schröder ’ s government is largely to blame for the rise of the far-right , according to christian social union leader edmund stoiber .
“ the failure of schröder ’ s economic policies and the extensive unemployment creates the environment in which extremism thrives , ” the former chancellor candidate told welt am sonntag . with five million jobless , germany has broken an absolute record , stoiber said , and added that if the 1.5 million people economics minister wolfgang clement said are involved in work programs are added to the figure , “ germany will find itself in a situation not unlike that of 1932 . ” spd party leader münterfering dismissed the parallel to pre-hitler germany .
speaking to the local newspaper pinneberger tageblatt , he said neither the spd nor the opposition was responsible for the rise of the far-right in saxony .
“ only the voters are to blame , ” he said . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de köhler : holocaust part of german identity german president horst köhler addressed the israeli parliament wednesday , telling the knesset that responsibility for the holocaust was part of germany 's national identity .

but ideas of beauty are changing . the curtain goes up , the spotlight is on , and a beautiful woman strides along the catwalk , radiating pure sexiness .
it does n't matter that iris schain is wearing a size 14 .
twiggy she is n't .
schain works for " bella donna " in cologne , a modeling agency for full-figured women .
the 42-year-old stands by her pounds and is happy that " normal " women like her are finally receiving attention on catwalks and on television .
" when i wander through the stores , i keep noticing that certain sizes are left : 6 , 8 and 10 , " she said .

women " in full form " are exactly the right size at " bella donna . "
the cologne agency only works with full-figured models .
all ten women working here wear size 12 or up .
renate schmidt , who founded the agency , said there is a gap in the market , and women with realistic measurements - that is to say with curves - are conquering more and more public space .
schmidt keeps her eyes open for potential full-size models .
" looking around on the streets of cologne , i ca n't help thinking that there are really enough women with nice measurements , great proportions and personal magnetism , who are beautiful and would be quite right for the modeling profession , " she said . xl direct in the meantime , finding clients who are interested in the full-figured beauties is not a problem anymore , schmidt said .
the xl models from " bella donna " get requests for photo shoots and fashion shows .
companies do not only want to advertise with skinny beauties anymore , when in reality no average woman can identify with them , schmidt said .
jens hofmann , manager of a fashion store in cologne , agrees that the majority of women do n't fit today 's idealized type , or petit sizes .
" in my opinion , this world view has to be put in the right place . "
statistics show that german women swing back and forth between sizes 10 and 16 .
bildunterschrift : casting for full-figured models .
full-figured , not fat modern women are becoming more self-assured and have come to accept the way they look , said hofmann , who added that he has observed new self-confidence .
" looking at young women today , many of whom are really not that skinny at all , you notice that they have a different body consciousness than just a few years ago , " he said .
" nowadays you easily walk the streets in a tight-fitting outfit . "
according to renate schmidt , corpulent women feel increasingly less like torturing themselves with strict diets and sports to achieve the super slim ideal .
she 's pleased they 're willing to accept their love handles , but said beauty is as varied as women are .
" we do n't wish for the common concept of beauty to concentrate exclusively on women with a little more , " she said .

" reads the poster during a protest march in saxony german president horst köhler has called on all germans to actively oppose anti-semitism , while politicians across the spectrum debate banning the right-wing npd party . freshly returned from a four-day visit to israel , köhler sounded the alarm for all levels of german society to take up action and protest what he fears is a broadening of anti-semitism . in an interview with deutschlandradio berlin , the president said although germany was not experiencing a “ giant wave , ” there was ample reason to be concerned about new facets of anti-semitism which expressed themselves most outwardly in criticism of israel and the us .
the events two weeks ago in the state parliament of saxony , in which members of the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- boycotted a tribute to victims of the holocaust , served as a “ wake-up call , ” köhler said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst köhler next to the eternal flame in the hall of remembrance at the yad vashem holocaust museum in jerusalem on tuesday , feb .
1 , 2005 .
germany must now respond to these hateful sentiments not with panic but with well thought out and rational actions , he said .
the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii on may 8 , 1945 , and the events leading up to the historic date provide the perfect opportunity to demonstrate germany ’ s resolve in combating right-wing extremism and anti-semitism of all sorts . government protests against far-right the initiative purportedly has the support from the highest levels of german politics .
chancellor gerhard schröder is said to have backed plans for organizing a mass protest against the far-right .
according to his spokesman , bela anda , schröder said he believed it is the responsibility of all major parties to join forces and organize an official demonstration on may 8 against anti-semitism and intolerance . there must be “ powerful proof from the upright and righteous public ” that germany does not tolerate right-wing extremism , anda said quoting schröder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the 60th anniversary of the freeing of auschwitz , a german puts a candle on the former rail track leading from berlin to auschwitz .
israel ’ s former ambassador to germany , avi primor , recalling the chains of lights and rallies of the early 1990s when tens of thousands of germans protested against right-wing extremism , said something similar is needed today . social democrats leader franz müntefering said contacts were already underway between the mainstream political parties to organize a protest march on may 8 in front of the brandenburg gate in berlin .
“ there are contacts between the parties , the churches and the trade unions .
we all agree we should not leave the place to the neo-nazis , ” müntefering told german public broadcaster ard . the announcement comes after germany ’ s resurgent far-right parties , which last year scored electoral success in two eastern state assemblies and plan to join forces for the 2006 general election , let it be known that they plan to mark the end of world war ii with their own marches in front of the brandenburg gate on may 7 and 8 . party ban for right-wing extremists in light of the recent attention the right-wing parties have generated in recent weeks – most specifically the npd in saxony with their criticism of honoring holocaust victims – many in the government and across political parties have resumed the call to ban right-wing parties .
a mass protest is not enough , they claim ; the government needs to prove that such extremism is against the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " nazis out " reads a poster during a protest in kiel on jan .
30 , 2005 .
fraction leader for junior coalition partner the greens , katrin göring-eckard , said the npd needs to be outlawed .
if it is foreseeable that national-socialism will be glorified and nazi victims disparaged as part of a party ’ s ideology , then there must be a legal option for prohibiting the party ’ s assemblies and forcing it to disband . vice president for the central council of jews in germany charlotte knobloch criticized the government for not being more forceful in its opposition to the npd and right-wing extremism .
a party that is allowed to build itself on the basis of anti-semitism and hatred of foreigners and can continue to demonstrate freely is a sign of a government ’ s weakness . it is time for the government to push for a new ban on the npd , she told the welt am sonntag newspaper .
the initiative , however , has yet to be officially embraced by schröder ’ s government .
in 2003 , the center-left government tried to have the party outlawed on the grounds that it stirred racial hatred , but the case was rejected in the supreme court . since then the npd has continued to grow in popularity , especially in the economically depressed eastern states such as saxony , where it produced the far-right ’ s best showing in six years when it won nearly 10 percent of the vote in september ’ s parliamentary election . recollections of 1932 ? schröder ’ s government is largely to blame for the rise of the far-right , according to christian social union leader edmund stoiber .
“ the failure of schröder ’ s economic policies and the extensive unemployment creates the environment in which extremism thrives , ” the former chancellor candidate told welt am sonntag . with five million jobless , germany has broken an absolute record , stoiber said , and added that if the 1.5 million people economics minister wolfgang clement said are involved in work programs are added to the figure , “ germany will find itself in a situation not unlike that of 1932 . ” spd party leader münterfering dismissed the parallel to pre-hitler germany .
speaking to the local newspaper pinneberger tageblatt , he said neither the spd nor the opposition was responsible for the rise of the far-right in saxony .

but ideas of beauty are changing . the curtain goes up , the spotlight is on , and a beautiful woman strides along the catwalk , radiating pure sexiness .
it does n't matter that iris schain is wearing a size 14 .
twiggy she is n't .
schain works for " bella donna " in cologne , a modeling agency for full-figured women .
the 42-year-old stands by her pounds and is happy that " normal " women like her are finally receiving attention on catwalks and on television .
" when i wander through the stores , i keep noticing that certain sizes are left : 6 , 8 and 10 , " she said .
" that really says it all . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julia wolters -lrb- left -rrb- und renate schmidt , head of " bella donna . "
women " in full form " are exactly the right size at " bella donna . "
the cologne agency only works with full-figured models .
all ten women working here wear size 12 or up .
renate schmidt , who founded the agency , said there is a gap in the market , and women with realistic measurements - that is to say with curves - are conquering more and more public space .
schmidt keeps her eyes open for potential full-size models .
" looking around on the streets of cologne , i ca n't help thinking that there are really enough women with nice measurements , great proportions and personal magnetism , who are beautiful and would be quite right for the modeling profession , " she said . xl direct in the meantime , finding clients who are interested in the full-figured beauties is not a problem anymore , schmidt said .
the xl models from " bella donna " get requests for photo shoots and fashion shows .
companies do not only want to advertise with skinny beauties anymore , when in reality no average woman can identify with them , schmidt said .
jens hofmann , manager of a fashion store in cologne , agrees that the majority of women do n't fit today 's idealized type , or petit sizes .
" in my opinion , this world view has to be put in the right place . "
statistics show that german women swing back and forth between sizes 10 and 16 .
bildunterschrift : casting for full-figured models .
full-figured , not fat modern women are becoming more self-assured and have come to accept the way they look , said hofmann , who added that he has observed new self-confidence .
" looking at young women today , many of whom are really not that skinny at all , you notice that they have a different body consciousness than just a few years ago , " he said .
" nowadays you easily walk the streets in a tight-fitting outfit . "
according to renate schmidt , corpulent women feel increasingly less like torturing themselves with strict diets and sports to achieve the super slim ideal .
she 's pleased they 're willing to accept their love handles , but said beauty is as varied as women are .
" we do n't wish for the common concept of beauty to concentrate exclusively on women with a little more , " she said .

but the presence of private bookies along with state companies makes the market tough to monitor . when news that a berlin referee fixed soccer matches in order to win bets broke two weeks ago , it was not hard for local authorities to believe . intelligence authorities say the german capital , the home of tainted referee robert hoyzer -lrb- photo -rrb- who has triggered one of the worst scandals in german soccer history , is a paradise for illegal bookies .
alongside established , state-controlled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert hoyzer companies like oddset , private companies , some of them with dubious operating licenses , have set up shop in berlin and the rest of germany .
it 's not hard to see why : bookmaking in germany is a € 1.2 billion business , and sports has around 80 percent share of that figure .
the private firms are almost impossible for intelligence authorities to track because they keep changing their operations .
and the more lucrative options the companies offer bettors have helped them grow in influence , something that worries soccer officials . " this whole bookmaking scene has changed a lot , " said theo zwanziger , president of the german football association .
" in particular , the private bookies , who are increasingly intervening in the actual course of the game . " cracking down on private firms unlike oddset , which allows combination betting on three games , private companies allow a number of different combinations .
for example , bettors can wager on the first yellow card , the first objection or the first free kick of the soccer game .
according to critics , it 's exactly these special betting tactics that lead to manipulation and fixing of games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoyzer , right , admitted to fixing a tournament game between hsv hamburg and sc paderborn to counter the problem , the dfb together is now pushing for a better monitoring system that would be activated as soon as there was suspicion of foul play . " that means when the bookmakers notice that a particular match is marked by an extraordinarily high number of bets on an outsider team then it does signalize that there 's something amiss , " said zwanziger .
" that could perhaps give the dfb and the committee of referees the possibility of swapping out referees at the last minute . " officials are aided by the fact that private bookies , unlike companies like oddset , require the identification or credit card numbers of their clients . no general betting ban yet for players there are also calls for a general betting ban on participating players , club owners and politicians .
but many doubt such a rule 's effectiveness . rudi assauer , manager of bundesliga team schalke 04 say it will be easy to get around it .
" i can bet the way i want via a frontman , " assauer said .
" only thing is , at the end when the lid 's blown off then you 'll be in deep trouble . " german politicians have now avowed to step up the fight against illegal bookmakes in order to minimize the risk of fraud .
but , concrete proposals are still to come and the situation is made worse by the fact that the legal process to nab illegal bookies is highly complicated . arnulf boettcher -lrb- sp / dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : german cops raid homes in soccer scandal a mass police raid on the premises of 19 football match-fixing suspects has uncovered more proof of manipulation , the berlin public prosecuter 's office confirmed on wednesday .

that is because of growing concerns over the nation 's low birth rate and ageing population as well as fears of business leaders of a future scarcity of skilled workers in fields like computer science and engineering . it follows the so-called " green card " program , a less-than-successful initiative that aimed to lure thousands of engineers and computer scientists to work in german companies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a special german passion " there is usually tension " even though it is colourful and includes many photos and drawings , the guide is not a book to read from a to z. instead , it is structured in a way so that foreigners can easily look up the chapters they 're most interested in .

tobacco stocks rose sharply on wall street after the 2-1 decision .
the court in washington found the case - filed by the clinton administration in 1999 - could not be brought under federal anti-racketeering laws .
anti-smoking groups urge the government to fight on , but the justice department has not said if it will appeal .
among the accused were altria group , rj reynolds tobacco , lorillard tobacco , liggett group and brown and williamson .
they were delighted by the decision , which sent reynolds shares up 4.5 % and altria shares up 5.11 % .
the ruling should not be an excuse for this administration to seek a weak settlement that lets the tobacco industry off the hook william corr campaign for tobacco-free kids charles a blixt , executive vice-president of rj reynolds tobacco , said the ruling " dramatically transforms " the government 's lawsuit .
altria group said , in a statement , the government now " must not only prove that the companies have engaged in fraudulent behaviour in the past , but that they are likely to do so in the future . "
' reviewing ruling ' the government had claimed tobacco firms manipulated nicotine levels to increase addiction targeted teenagers with multi-billion dollar advertising campaigns lied about the dangers of smoking and ignored research to the contrary.prosecutors wanted the cigarette firms to " disgorge " $ 280bn in profits accumulated over the past 50 years and impose tougher rules on marketing their products .

the three-judge panel in the district of columbia 's court of appeals ruled on friday that the us government could not sue the firms under the anti-racketeering laws .
judge david sentelle , in his ruling , said such laws were aimed at putting an end to illegal conduct going forward .
" we hold that the language of -lrb- the law -rrb- and the comprehensive remedial scheme of -lrb- the law -rrb- preclude disgorgement as a possible remedy in this case , " he wrote .
the justice department refused to say if it would appeal .
" all we 're saying today is that we have received the ruling and are reviewing it , " a spokeswoman said on friday .
but william corr of the campaign for tobacco-free kids urged the government to continue pressing its case .

tobacco stocks rose sharply on wall street after the 2-1 decision .
the court in washington found the case - filed by the clinton administration in 1999 - could not be brought under federal anti-racketeering laws .
anti-smoking groups urge the government to fight on , but the justice department has not said if it will appeal .
among the accused were altria group , rj reynolds tobacco , lorillard tobacco , liggett group and brown and williamson .
they were delighted by the decision , which sent reynolds shares up 4.5 % and altria shares up 5.11 % .
the ruling should not be an excuse for this administration to seek a weak settlement that lets the tobacco industry off the hook william corr campaign for tobacco-free kids charles a blixt , executive vice-president of rj reynolds tobacco , said the ruling " dramatically transforms " the government 's lawsuit .
altria group said , in a statement , the government now " must not only prove that the companies have engaged in fraudulent behaviour in the past , but that they are likely to do so in the future . "
' reviewing ruling ' the government had claimed tobacco firms manipulated nicotine levels to increase addiction targeted teenagers with multi-billion dollar advertising campaigns lied about the dangers of smoking and ignored research to the contrary.prosecutors wanted the cigarette firms to " disgorge " $ 280bn in profits accumulated over the past 50 years and impose tougher rules on marketing their products .
they brought the case under racketeering laws , which were passed to deny mafia gangs the profits of their crimes .
but the tobacco companies denied that they illegally conspired to promote smoking and defraud the public .
they also said they had already met many of the government 's demands in a landmark $ 206bn settlement reached with 46 states in 1998 .
the three-judge panel in the district of columbia 's court of appeals ruled on friday that the us government could not sue the firms under the anti-racketeering laws .

philip morris and other tobacco companies were accused of conspiring and running " racketeer influenced and corrupt organisations " .
under the rico legislation , which was designed to break organised crime rings , the companies were accused of conspiring to defraud the public for 50 years .
the department of justice sought the " disgorgement " of the profits from this alleged fraud , a cool $ 280bn .
plaza plot the conspiracy , the government said , started on 15 december , 1953 at a grand room in the plaza hotel on the south-east corner of central park in new york .
there is no doubt that executives from the major tobacco companies met there and discussed the state of the industry , including the scientific research on the effects of smoking .
it was the government 's contention that they then agreed to present a unified strategy denying the harmful effects - and that added up to fraud .
scientific evidence was mounting that tobacco was both addictive and harmful .
despite that evidence , the industry devised a scheme to , according to the charges , " preserve and enhance the tobacco industry 's profits by maximising the number of smokers " and to avoid adverse liability judgements " linked to the adverse affects of nicotine .
' in good faith ' this meant , for example , denying that nicotine was addictive .
eleven years ago , there was a moment of true drama at a congressional hearing when the presidents of the big tobacco companies sat in a line in a congressional hearing and were asked whether they thought nicotine was addictive .
in the space of 30 seconds , each of them , one by one , denied their product 's addictive quality .
that , the government alleges , was part of the conspiracy .
the companies have changed their stance over the years .
philip morris , part of altria , now accepts that nicotine is harmful .
altria 's general counsel , william ohlemeyer , told the bbc last year that statements made in the past may have been wrong but they were not dishonest .
in other words , that when the executives said nicotine was not addictive , they were stating what they believed , and not behaving like mobsters defrauding the public .
up in smoke the government presented internal industry documents that its lawyers hoped would indicate beyond doubt that scientists within the companies knew exactly what the true nature of tobacco was , even though the view presented to the public was much more benign .
the real question for the purposes of this case has been how long the deceit lasted .
william ohlemeyer said , when the case came to court last september , that to get the full " disgorgement " of profits under the rico legislation , the government would have to prove that the conspiracy was still going on and that it would continue .
since the tobacco industry now accepts that nicotine is harmful , it is hard to argue that it continues to deceive the public .
and two of the three judges at the district of colombia 's court of appeals appear to have agreed .
judge david sentelle wrote in his ruling that " disgorgement is not an available remedy " under the legislation .
he went on , " even if disgorgement were available , the government 's model fails the ... test for permissible disgorgement that will ' prevent and restrain ' future violations " .

the city council recently announced that stanstead school in rise park may close in 2007 - despite previous assurances it would not .
the lea has admitted plans to merge some of the city 's primary schools were unlawful due to over-crowding issues .
now parents are worried the school 's future could be in doubt and have formed an action group to defend it .
falling numbers mandy jackson , a parent-governor at stanstead , said : " -lrb- the parents -rrb- are adamant that they will fight this all the way and we are backing them all the way .
" it could be that we have to go down the legal route and we are currently looking at where we stand and what help we can get .
" the children do not want to go anywhere else and it is frightening for the little ones to be faced with this . "
the council has said that a falling number of pupils in the area means there are too many places left unfilled .

the mid and west wales fire and rescue service said it would free fire fighters for ' more meaningful work ' . "
this is one of the last great eyesores in llanelli " mark james , carmarthenshire council county commander gethin davies said : " it has been derelict for a number of years .
" in the last four years we have dealt with approximately 35 calls which does take firefighters away from more meaningful work .
" because it is a large site it was not possible to completely secure it as it could be accessed from so many sides .
knocking it down takes away the problem for us . "
during one incident two years ago the main coastal link road had to be closed as firefighters spent more than six hours fighting a blaze there .
householders were told to stay indoors because of the smoke and keep their windows closed .
carmarthenshire council has been in talks for some time to buy the land , close to the millennium coastal park .
chief executive mark james said the authority wants to see a multi-screen cinema , bowling alley and retail development there .
" this is one of the last great eyesores in llanelli and we have been working hard to secure the site in order that it can be cleared and developed , " he said .
" i am very pleased we have now reached agreement with the owners and can proceed with plans to regenerate this part of llanelli . "
