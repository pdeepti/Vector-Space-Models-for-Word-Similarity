in the german town of paderborn , primary school kids take the " walking bus " to class . obesity has reached the dimensions of a global epidemic , according to the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- .
not only adults are affected ; in germany , 36 percent of seven-year-old boys are significantly overweight as are 30 percent of seven-year-old girls . the medical effects are alarming : high blood pressure and type-two diabetes are phenomena that people under 40 generally do n't have to be concerned about .
but ever more children are being diagnosed with these maladies .
while kids do n't necessarily eat more than they did in the past , what has changed is that nowadays people in the west hardly walk anywhere . today 's sedentary lifestyles start at a young age .
traffic jams develop in front of primary schools on a regular basis , says wolf-dietrich brettschneider , who lives near one .
but there at least , the morning congestion has come to an end .

the difference is that this bus is not an actual bus , not a vehicle .

" our aim is for children to see movement as a something routine , " said head teacher helga berling .
her charges are keen on the walking bus , too , including many who have to go out of their way to get to one of the bus stops .
the route takes them through quiet neighborhood streets where they 're exposed to fewer exhaust fumes than on the more main road leading to the school . " it 's that much nicer , " said 8-year-old mara .
" then you can talk longer with your girlfriends . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids taking the walking bus are more alert when they get to class that too is one of the benefits of the walking bus .

it was originally formed to facilitate war-torn germany 's integration into the west .
today , the bundeswehr maintains the peace in hot spots around the world . germany 's armed forces will formally conclude the ongoing celebrations to mark 50 years of its existence on saturday .
nov 12 is a special day for the army because on that day 50 years ago , the first voluntary recruits of the bundeswehr received their certificates in barracks in bonn . only 10 years after the end of world war ii , in 1955 west germany 's army , the bundeswehr took shape . chancellor konrad adenauer wanted the country 's own armed forces to contribute to the federal republic 's integration into western structures . during the cold war , the western allied attitude towards re-establishment of german armed forces changed quickly since germany was located directly on the dividing line between the two blocs . west germany was expected to be able to make its own contribution to defending its territory .
but a return of the " wehrmacht , " the name the german army was known by under hitler , was out of the question .
west germany 's new constitution ensured that there would never be a return to the times when the army was a state within the state . even so , parliament was made responsible for keeping the bundeswehr on a short leash and the army was closely integrated into nato .
still , the social democratic opposition as well as a large part of the population objected to rearmament .
the fact that the bundeswehr could n't possibly get by without experienced wehrmacht officers only increased people 's mistrust . away from slavish obedience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on nov .
12 , 1955 , west germany swore in its army 's first recruits , in bonn the military leadership focused on the new concept of " internal leadership " in developing the bundeswehr .
the idea was that soldiers should be " citizens in uniform " and that slavish obedience and brutal regiments would be a thing of the past . but in the beginning that was easier said than done : in 1957 , the same year that conscription was introduced , 15 recruits died after being ordered to cross the iller river without proper safety measures being taken .
elsewhere too , excessively tough training methods were part of the daily grind . sociologist martin kutz said that it took long before the idea of " internal leadership " found acceptance among the soldiers . " ' internal leadership was brought into the bundeswehr by the younger generation in the mid-60s , " kutz said .
" it has to do with the fact that the bundeswehr had an enormous shortage of young people and took whoever they could get .
thus , young people of the simplest means joined the army and caused a break in tradition that the old -lrb- military -rrb- families had -lrb- previously -rrb- prevented . " in addition to the special circumstances within the bundeswehr , which had 270,000 soldiers in 1960 , its arms cache was a central issue right from the start .
the west responded to nuclear armament in the east by developing its own nuclear arsenal .
however , chancellor adenauer 's government had committed itself to neither produce nor acquire its own nuclear weapons .
the solution was for the bundeswehr to get carriers , while the americans administered the nuclear warheads that went on them . " fight nuclear death " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz-josef strauß " we do n't want the bundeswehr equipped as a german army with tactical nuclear weapons , " then-defense minister franz-josef strauß explained .
" we want nothing more and nothing less than nato 's entire defense planning requires , which envisions for every nation from canada to turkey particular duties so that it 's acceptable for the individual -lrb- state -rrb- , so that it 's affordable for the individual -lrb- state -rrb- and so that collective security keeps the aggressor at bay . " large parts of the population and of the officers ' corps rejected strauß 's plans .
over a million germans took to the streets with the slogan " fight nuclear death . "
but in the end , the government prevailed .
in march 1958 , the bundestag , west germany 's lower house of parliament , decided after four days of debate to equip the bundeswehr with carriers for nuclear weapons .
german pilots from then on were trained to drop nuclear bombs over germany and destroy their homes in case of emergency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans mobilized in masses to protest nuclear weapons being stationed in west germany but that did n't put an end to the conflict over the german armed forces ' nuclear armament .
in the 1980s , the government allowed nuclear missiles to be stationed in the country in accordance with the nato " double-track " decision despite great resistance from the people . " there were massive differences in the army over the nuclear issue , " kutz said .
" then , more than half of the staff officers disagreed with it -lrb- stationing nuclear weapons in germany -rrb- .
of course , in the end they were fended off , but is very clear that in those days the bundeswehr was more pluralistic than today . " when the berlin wall fell , around half a million men in west germany were in the armed forces .
after german unification in 1990 , the east german armed forces , the nva , was dissolved and a portion of its soldiers integrated into the bundeswehr .
shortly thereafter , the restructuring of the armed forces began and which still continues to this day . the bundeswehr was not only too big and cumbersome , but it also needed a new orientation after the collapse of the " enemy from the east . "
defending germany on foreign soil the bundeswehr 's classic duties of national defense now faced new threats - above all from terrorism . for the first time , the bundeswehr started taking part in un-mandated peace missions , although germany 's constitution only envisages its deployment for defensive purposes - that is , in the case of an attack on the country .
the german constitutional court cleared the legal fog in 1994 when bundeswehr soldiers participated in the un peacekeeping mission in somalia .
in 1999 , german soldiers were deployed for combat for the first time when nato bombed serbia during the kosovo war - a crucial test for the green party , the junior partner in the governing coalition with the social democrats .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers now take part in un and nato peacekeeping missions as a result , foreign deployments - every one of which must be approved by the bundestag - finally were accepted as a political reality .
the bundestag gave its blessing to the initially controversial afghanistan deployment after sept .
11 attacks as well . up to 10,000 german soldiers , including special forces , have been temporarily stationed abroad . half a century after the bundeswehr 's foundation , outgoing defense minister peter struck , who was instrumental in advancing reform , summed up the development of germany 's armed forces : " i will surely go down in history with the sentence : germany is also defended on the hindu kush .
and with the other sentence : the bundeswehr 's operational area is the whole world .

they all have to win two-legged playoffs if they do n't want to face their fans ' scorn .
the first games are saturday , with the final decision coming on wednesday . the stress that comes with having to win a playoff was best summed up by slovakian coach dusan galis , who wants to lead his team to the world cup finals for the first time since the nation gained its independence 12 years ago . " i 'm not interested in anything else .
having a good feeling from a good performance and losing with honor - i will not be satisfied with anything like that , " galis told reporters .
" we have gone this far , so we are able to make the last step . " slovakia looks to fate to beat spain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain will start the playoffs in front of a home crowd but arsenal striker jose antonio reyes is confident he and the rest of the heavily favored spanish team have enough class to beat the slovakians and make it to their eighth consecutive world cup finals . " we are the better team and we are going to prove it , " reyes said .
" i am convinced we are going to score goals , and a 2-0 score line would be ideal to take to slovakia . " slovakia hope to fate on their side , spain has qualified for every finals since 1974 , when they were held , ironically , in west germany .
morale in the slovakian camp is also at a high after they eliminated russia from the finals .

germany won the game 4-0 and improved their chances at going to the 2007 world cup in china . five months after claiming the european championship the german national team 's clear win over switzerland saturday evening put germany on top of their qualification group ahead of russia . germany head coach silvia neid 's team dominated the game in front of 15 , 637 fans in ulm , and put the defensive-minded swiss under pressure quickly , starting their shower of goals after just 10 minutes . quick , aggressive german style " i wanted us to score a goal in the first minutes , and we did , " neid said after the match .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german celebration started early - and never stopped after watching the ball bounce dangerously through the penalty area a number of time and one shot ding off the crossbar , steffi jones scored germany 's first goal of the match in the 100th appearance for the national team . german playmaker renate lingor put in an excellent match and helped her teammates keep control of the game .
she struck the well-placed free-kick jones headed into goal as well as a number of dangerous crosses . after the first goal , the swiss tried , in vain , to stack their defense with as many as nine players in the penalty area at one time .
but germany were up 3-0 at half-time with first half goals from petra wimbersky and britta carlson , who also tallied a second goal in the 62nd minute . second half slow down the german team shifted down a gear after coming out of the locker room .

it was originally formed to facilitate war-torn germany 's integration into the west .
today , the bundeswehr maintains the peace in hot spots around the world . germany 's armed forces will formally conclude the ongoing celebrations to mark 50 years of its existence on saturday .
nov 12 is a special day for the army because on that day 50 years ago , the first voluntary recruits of the bundeswehr received their certificates in barracks in bonn . only 10 years after the end of world war ii , in 1955 west germany 's army , the bundeswehr took shape . chancellor konrad adenauer wanted the country 's own armed forces to contribute to the federal republic 's integration into western structures . during the cold war , the western allied attitude towards re-establishment of german armed forces changed quickly since germany was located directly on the dividing line between the two blocs . west germany was expected to be able to make its own contribution to defending its territory .
but a return of the " wehrmacht , " the name the german army was known by under hitler , was out of the question .
west germany 's new constitution ensured that there would never be a return to the times when the army was a state within the state . even so , parliament was made responsible for keeping the bundeswehr on a short leash and the army was closely integrated into nato .
still , the social democratic opposition as well as a large part of the population objected to rearmament .
the fact that the bundeswehr could n't possibly get by without experienced wehrmacht officers only increased people 's mistrust . away from slavish obedience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on nov .
12 , 1955 , west germany swore in its army 's first recruits , in bonn the military leadership focused on the new concept of " internal leadership " in developing the bundeswehr .
the idea was that soldiers should be " citizens in uniform " and that slavish obedience and brutal regiments would be a thing of the past . but in the beginning that was easier said than done : in 1957 , the same year that conscription was introduced , 15 recruits died after being ordered to cross the iller river without proper safety measures being taken .
elsewhere too , excessively tough training methods were part of the daily grind . sociologist martin kutz said that it took long before the idea of " internal leadership " found acceptance among the soldiers . " ' internal leadership was brought into the bundeswehr by the younger generation in the mid-60s , " kutz said .
" it has to do with the fact that the bundeswehr had an enormous shortage of young people and took whoever they could get .
thus , young people of the simplest means joined the army and caused a break in tradition that the old -lrb- military -rrb- families had -lrb- previously -rrb- prevented . " in addition to the special circumstances within the bundeswehr , which had 270,000 soldiers in 1960 , its arms cache was a central issue right from the start .
the west responded to nuclear armament in the east by developing its own nuclear arsenal .
however , chancellor adenauer 's government had committed itself to neither produce nor acquire its own nuclear weapons .
the solution was for the bundeswehr to get carriers , while the americans administered the nuclear warheads that went on them . " fight nuclear death " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz-josef strauß " we do n't want the bundeswehr equipped as a german army with tactical nuclear weapons , " then-defense minister franz-josef strauß explained .
" we want nothing more and nothing less than nato 's entire defense planning requires , which envisions for every nation from canada to turkey particular duties so that it 's acceptable for the individual -lrb- state -rrb- , so that it 's affordable for the individual -lrb- state -rrb- and so that collective security keeps the aggressor at bay . " large parts of the population and of the officers ' corps rejected strauß 's plans .
over a million germans took to the streets with the slogan " fight nuclear death . "
but in the end , the government prevailed .
in march 1958 , the bundestag , west germany 's lower house of parliament , decided after four days of debate to equip the bundeswehr with carriers for nuclear weapons .
german pilots from then on were trained to drop nuclear bombs over germany and destroy their homes in case of emergency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans mobilized in masses to protest nuclear weapons being stationed in west germany but that did n't put an end to the conflict over the german armed forces ' nuclear armament .
in the 1980s , the government allowed nuclear missiles to be stationed in the country in accordance with the nato " double-track " decision despite great resistance from the people . " there were massive differences in the army over the nuclear issue , " kutz said .
" then , more than half of the staff officers disagreed with it -lrb- stationing nuclear weapons in germany -rrb- .
of course , in the end they were fended off , but is very clear that in those days the bundeswehr was more pluralistic than today . " when the berlin wall fell , around half a million men in west germany were in the armed forces .
after german unification in 1990 , the east german armed forces , the nva , was dissolved and a portion of its soldiers integrated into the bundeswehr .
shortly thereafter , the restructuring of the armed forces began and which still continues to this day . the bundeswehr was not only too big and cumbersome , but it also needed a new orientation after the collapse of the " enemy from the east . "
defending germany on foreign soil the bundeswehr 's classic duties of national defense now faced new threats - above all from terrorism . for the first time , the bundeswehr started taking part in un-mandated peace missions , although germany 's constitution only envisages its deployment for defensive purposes - that is , in the case of an attack on the country .
the german constitutional court cleared the legal fog in 1994 when bundeswehr soldiers participated in the un peacekeeping mission in somalia .
in 1999 , german soldiers were deployed for combat for the first time when nato bombed serbia during the kosovo war - a crucial test for the green party , the junior partner in the governing coalition with the social democrats .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers now take part in un and nato peacekeeping missions as a result , foreign deployments - every one of which must be approved by the bundestag - finally were accepted as a political reality .
the bundestag gave its blessing to the initially controversial afghanistan deployment after sept .
11 attacks as well . up to 10,000 german soldiers , including special forces , have been temporarily stationed abroad . half a century after the bundeswehr 's foundation , outgoing defense minister peter struck , who was instrumental in advancing reform , summed up the development of germany 's armed forces : " i will surely go down in history with the sentence : germany is also defended on the hindu kush .

german pilots from then on were trained to drop nuclear bombs over germany and destroy their homes in case of emergency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans mobilized in masses to protest nuclear weapons being stationed in west germany but that did n't put an end to the conflict over the german armed forces ' nuclear armament .
in the 1980s , the government allowed nuclear missiles to be stationed in the country in accordance with the nato " double-track " decision despite great resistance from the people . " there were massive differences in the army over the nuclear issue , " kutz said .
" then , more than half of the staff officers disagreed with it -lrb- stationing nuclear weapons in germany -rrb- .
of course , in the end they were fended off , but is very clear that in those days the bundeswehr was more pluralistic than today . " when the berlin wall fell , around half a million men in west germany were in the armed forces .
after german unification in 1990 , the east german armed forces , the nva , was dissolved and a portion of its soldiers integrated into the bundeswehr .
shortly thereafter , the restructuring of the armed forces began and which still continues to this day . the bundeswehr was not only too big and cumbersome , but it also needed a new orientation after the collapse of the " enemy from the east . "
defending germany on foreign soil the bundeswehr 's classic duties of national defense now faced new threats - above all from terrorism . for the first time , the bundeswehr started taking part in un-mandated peace missions , although germany 's constitution only envisages its deployment for defensive purposes - that is , in the case of an attack on the country .
the german constitutional court cleared the legal fog in 1994 when bundeswehr soldiers participated in the un peacekeeping mission in somalia .
in 1999 , german soldiers were deployed for combat for the first time when nato bombed serbia during the kosovo war - a crucial test for the green party , the junior partner in the governing coalition with the social democrats .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers now take part in un and nato peacekeeping missions as a result , foreign deployments - every one of which must be approved by the bundestag - finally were accepted as a political reality .

it was originally formed to facilitate war-torn germany 's integration into the west .
today , the bundeswehr maintains the peace in hot spots around the world . germany 's armed forces will formally conclude the ongoing celebrations to mark 50 years of its existence on saturday .
nov 12 is a special day for the army because on that day 50 years ago , the first voluntary recruits of the bundeswehr received their certificates in barracks in bonn . only 10 years after the end of world war ii , in 1955 west germany 's army , the bundeswehr took shape . chancellor konrad adenauer wanted the country 's own armed forces to contribute to the federal republic 's integration into western structures . during the cold war , the western allied attitude towards re-establishment of german armed forces changed quickly since germany was located directly on the dividing line between the two blocs . west germany was expected to be able to make its own contribution to defending its territory .
but a return of the " wehrmacht , " the name the german army was known by under hitler , was out of the question .
west germany 's new constitution ensured that there would never be a return to the times when the army was a state within the state . even so , parliament was made responsible for keeping the bundeswehr on a short leash and the army was closely integrated into nato .
still , the social democratic opposition as well as a large part of the population objected to rearmament .
the fact that the bundeswehr could n't possibly get by without experienced wehrmacht officers only increased people 's mistrust . away from slavish obedience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on nov .
12 , 1955 , west germany swore in its army 's first recruits , in bonn the military leadership focused on the new concept of " internal leadership " in developing the bundeswehr .
the idea was that soldiers should be " citizens in uniform " and that slavish obedience and brutal regiments would be a thing of the past . but in the beginning that was easier said than done : in 1957 , the same year that conscription was introduced , 15 recruits died after being ordered to cross the iller river without proper safety measures being taken .
elsewhere too , excessively tough training methods were part of the daily grind . sociologist martin kutz said that it took long before the idea of " internal leadership " found acceptance among the soldiers . " ' internal leadership was brought into the bundeswehr by the younger generation in the mid-60s , " kutz said .
" it has to do with the fact that the bundeswehr had an enormous shortage of young people and took whoever they could get .
thus , young people of the simplest means joined the army and caused a break in tradition that the old -lrb- military -rrb- families had -lrb- previously -rrb- prevented . " in addition to the special circumstances within the bundeswehr , which had 270,000 soldiers in 1960 , its arms cache was a central issue right from the start .
the west responded to nuclear armament in the east by developing its own nuclear arsenal .
however , chancellor adenauer 's government had committed itself to neither produce nor acquire its own nuclear weapons .
the solution was for the bundeswehr to get carriers , while the americans administered the nuclear warheads that went on them . " fight nuclear death " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz-josef strauß " we do n't want the bundeswehr equipped as a german army with tactical nuclear weapons , " then-defense minister franz-josef strauß explained .
" we want nothing more and nothing less than nato 's entire defense planning requires , which envisions for every nation from canada to turkey particular duties so that it 's acceptable for the individual -lrb- state -rrb- , so that it 's affordable for the individual -lrb- state -rrb- and so that collective security keeps the aggressor at bay . " large parts of the population and of the officers ' corps rejected strauß 's plans .
over a million germans took to the streets with the slogan " fight nuclear death . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.11.2005 walking bus gets kids moving - and thinking großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walking to school is good for kids ' minds and bodies concerned at the growing ranks of obese children , a sports professor has come up with an unusual solution to prevent tubbiness .
in the german town of paderborn , primary school kids take the " walking bus " to class . obesity has reached the dimensions of a global epidemic , according to the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- .
not only adults are affected ; in germany , 36 percent of seven-year-old boys are significantly overweight as are 30 percent of seven-year-old girls . the medical effects are alarming : high blood pressure and type-two diabetes are phenomena that people under 40 generally do n't have to be concerned about .
but ever more children are being diagnosed with these maladies .
while kids do n't necessarily eat more than they did in the past , what has changed is that nowadays people in the west hardly walk anywhere . today 's sedentary lifestyles start at a young age .
traffic jams develop in front of primary schools on a regular basis , says wolf-dietrich brettschneider , who lives near one .
but there at least , the morning congestion has come to an end .
brettschneider and co-worker christoph malek have established the first german " walking bus " at the margarethenschule in paderborn . bus without wheels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reflective vests ensure that car drivers see the walking bus each morning , two kilometers -lrb- one mile -rrb- away from the school , the bus starts up .
students are collected at three bus stops and again dropped off after class .
the difference is that this bus is not an actual bus , not a vehicle .
the " bus " is a group of walkers .
adult volunteers accompany the children and make sure they make it safely to school .
that reassures parents who are used to driving their kids to class - whether for safety 's sake or to save time . aside from encouraging mobility , local police traffic safety advisor norbert meier is convinced that the walking bus has other benefits . " children come into contact with the reality of traffic earlier than if they 're always put in a car , " he said , adding that it helps kids learn independence and traffic safety rules faster . " our aim is for children to see movement as a something routine , " said head teacher helga berling .
her charges are keen on the walking bus , too , including many who have to go out of their way to get to one of the bus stops .
the route takes them through quiet neighborhood streets where they 're exposed to fewer exhaust fumes than on the more main road leading to the school . " it 's that much nicer , " said 8-year-old mara .
" then you can talk longer with your girlfriends . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids taking the walking bus are more alert when they get to class that too is one of the benefits of the walking bus .
" when kids walk to school they are more relaxed when they arrive in class , " explained brettschneider .
" they 've talked among themselves and also gotten lots of fresh air .
their ability to concentrate and learn is better . " beyond school so far , that seems to be the case .
" the children are more awake in any case , " said berlin after having observed the project for several months . ideally , the walking bus should motivate kids to be more physically active in their free time too .
in order to check whether that is the case , christoph malek plans to start a study in late november to observe the behavior and concentration levels of walking bus participants over a period of months . sixty german schools have already contacted brettschneider 's team about the walking bus .
three have gotten the idea going so far and five more aim to have it up and running by the end of the year .
the idea has also attracted interest from abroad , which is why brettschneider and malek will present the walking bus project at an international conference on the role of education and sports in lisbon in mid-november . johanna tüntsch -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us and germany fight battle of the bulge as the number of german children getting fatter increases , german officials are looking for ways to combat this trend and turning to americans for assistance .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the road to the chancellery opinion : germany 's new opposition the crunch issues schröder confirms exit ; slams bush the chancellor vote explained germany -pipe- 12.11.2005 experts say merkel will bring change in style , not policy for us großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's always favored close relations with the us germany finally has a coalition deal , paving the way for angela merkel to become chancellor .
experts say foreign policy under her will lead to warmer ties with the us , but it wo n't translate into major policy changes . germany 's conservatives led by angela merkel and the social democrats agreed on the second so-called " grand coalition " in germany 's postwar history on friday . the move paves the way for 51-year-old angela merkel , a former scientist who grew up in the communist former east germany , to become germany 's first female chancellor .
she is expected to be sworn in later this month provided separate party conferences on monday endorse the coalition deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's rival politicians have forged a power-sharing deal on friday , merkel was optimistic that the new grand coalition would work for germany .
" i think that this can be a coalition of new possibilities , " merkel said , adding it offered germany " a real chance " to pull itself out of its ongoing economic crisis . the new government 's power-sharing agreement broadly outlines reform measures aimed at reviving the stagnant german economy , slashing mounting public deficit and tackling the chronically high unemployment rate . " change in style and rhetoric " analysts however are n't expecting significant change on the foreign policy front .
they do however admit that german relations with the us will be become warmer given that merkel 's conservatives are overwhelmingly in favor of closer transatlantic ties and repairing the damage inflicted upon it by chancellor schröder 's government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush , left , and merkel in mainz in germany " i think the big change you 're going see is one in style and rhetoric , " karen donfried , senior director of the german marshall fund in washington . " it will be very different under angela merkel , " she said .
" the role of the central east europeans will be more prominent and central east europeans are very close us allies . " reform drive crucial for better ties with us jackson james , executive director of the american institute for contemporary german studies , said transatlantic relations under the new government hinge on whether merkel can make headway on the domestic front with critical economic reforms . " the success of germany 's reforms will have important implications for europe and the united states , " james told a congressional hearing this week on the german elections and their implications for us-german ties . " the ability of germany to meet its foreign policy responsibilities in terms of defense allocations , its presence in regional hot spots like the balkans and the middle east , and its role in the international financial institutions will depend on achieving a sustainable level of economic growth .

" i am convinced we are going to score goals , and a 2-0 score line would be ideal to take to slovakia . " slovakia hope to fate on their side , spain has qualified for every finals since 1974 , when they were held , ironically , in west germany .
morale in the slovakian camp is also at a high after they eliminated russia from the finals .

" it 's two big games against the czech republic but we have beaten big teams before and we will do it again , " the 24-year-old blackburn rovers player told uefa.com. the czechs have already complained about oslo 's wet , muddy pitch that could hamper their passing game , and even though norway finished second in their group , they will have a lot of improving to do before they make it germany . closest match between turkey and switzerland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey beat germany 2-1 in october whichever of the evenly matched teams wins saturday will have an even bigger psychological advantage than usual going into wednesday 's final in turkey . turkish coach fatih terim is already resigned to fielding a team in berne without hertha berlin midfielder yildiray basturk and besiktas midfielder ibrahim akin with knee problems , and now major fitness doubts hanging over striker hasan sas and defender tolga seyhan as well . in what may amount to matches between the walking wounded , switzerland coach köbi kuhn has injury concerns of his own , with striker johan vonlanthen tearing a ligament in his foot in training on thursday and there are also doubts over captain johann vogel and defender boris smiljanic 's fitness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uruguay striker diego forlan will attack the socceroos two intercontinental playoffs remain two-time world cup winners uruguay are hoping to take a huge step towards the 2006 tournament by sending out an attack-minded line-up for playoff against australia . the maturing socceroos ' chances of making it to their first world cup since 1974 appear more positive under the guidance of dutchman guus hiddink .
the aussies ' main problem will be up front in the offense .
harry kewell , who has played for liverpool just twice since returning from groin surgery , could however come off the bench late in the match in an attempt to steal a vital away goal in uruguay . " i think it will be a very closely contested game , and it will also be physical , " said uruguay defender dario rodriguez , who plays club soccer for schalke 04 .

are they good enough to beat a slowed , but still strong les bleus ? the last time germany beat france , holocaust author eli wiesel won the nobel peace prize , scientology founder l. ron hubbard died and tom cruise was riding the skies of soviet fighters in " top gun . " west germany beat france 2-0 in the semifinal of the 1986 world cup , going on to lose to argentina 3-2 in the final , with diego maradona providing some unforgettable on-field magic . germany and france meet again in an exhibition friendly at paris ' stade de france on saturday evening .
while the meeting is not nearly as important as a world cup semi-final , it is the last litmus test for jürgen klinsmann 's team of yearlings against a squad still considered one of the world 's best . " we 'll see where we stand against a team like that , it 'll be a real test of where we are , " said germany captain michael ballack . paris shoot-out ballack and striker miroslav klose , both injured and unable to take part in germany 's 2-1 embarrassment against turkey a few weeks ago , are ready to roll .
their talents on the attack will be desperately needed in what could shape up to be a shoot-out with les bleus , who , even without playmaker zinadine zidane , boast some of the world 's best strikers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thierry henry is one of the best strikers in the world arsenal 's thierry henry capped a second-half comeback against costa rica in a friendly match on wednesday by knocking in the go-ahead goal with his heel .
david trezeguet , who plays for juventus turin , beat bayern munich in a champion 's league match last week with a second-half goal .
if they 're coming up blank , france still has liverpool 's djibril cisse as well as the enigmatic and controversial nicolas anelka ready for a go from the bench after having marked his national team comeback with a goal on wednesday . german defense put to true test absorbing this attack will be the young german defense that has yet to find its rhythm .
germany 's backline is by far klinsmann 's biggest problem area at the moment .
youth and inexperience are the main culprits in a defense that has shown itself to be more sieve than wall and has become the pundits ' punching bag in the months leading up to june 's world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann will spend more time worrying about his defense than taking in the paris sights hopes that the dortmund back christoph metzelder , still on the comeback trail from a devastating injury sustained after his break-out performance in the 2002 world cup , would be able to help anchor germany 's defense were dashed on wednesday when he pulled up lame in training .
it will be offensive-minded arne friedrich , chelsea substitute robert huth and 20-year-old lukas sinkewiecz who will be there to pick up the slack . france also is not exactly shining at the moment .
despite only losing once in the past 38 games , les bleus struggled mightily in their qualification group , finishing first -and avoiding a play-off - only after switzerland failed to score a goal against ireland in the last match .
switzerland will play turkey saturday in the first of two play-off matches . oldies still goodies many experts credit the team 's last minute surge to the return of midfield superstar zidane , who decided to rethink his retirement from the national team .
midfielder claude makalele and defensive bedrock liliam thuram followed his lead and rejoined the team as well , rebuilding the core that led france to glory in the 1998 world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the soccer god is back - will it make a difference in the world cup ? german soccer " kaiser " franz beckenbauer said the hope for the german team might be that the match is more important for klinsmann 's youngsters than it is to france 's established superstars . " a win , or an exciting 90 minutes will provide jürgen klinsmann and his team the right atmosphere to go into the world cup year , " he wrote in his weekly column in the tabloid bild newspaper on friday . klinsmann himself emphasized this week the importance of going into the three-month international break with fond memories . going out with a bang , and extra protection " it 's the last match of a moving year , and the impressions will stay , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : extra protection for the german team after the riots of the past few weeks french authorities are hoping the impressions of the past two weeks of rioting wo n't be present the day the two teams play .

experts say foreign policy under her will lead to warmer ties with the us , but it wo n't translate into major policy changes . germany 's conservatives led by angela merkel and the social democrats agreed on the second so-called " grand coalition " in germany 's postwar history on friday . the move paves the way for 51-year-old angela merkel , a former scientist who grew up in the communist former east germany , to become germany 's first female chancellor .
she is expected to be sworn in later this month provided separate party conferences on monday endorse the coalition deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's rival politicians have forged a power-sharing deal on friday , merkel was optimistic that the new grand coalition would work for germany .
" i think that this can be a coalition of new possibilities , " merkel said , adding it offered germany " a real chance " to pull itself out of its ongoing economic crisis . the new government 's power-sharing agreement broadly outlines reform measures aimed at reviving the stagnant german economy , slashing mounting public deficit and tackling the chronically high unemployment rate . " change in style and rhetoric " analysts however are n't expecting significant change on the foreign policy front .
they do however admit that german relations with the us will be become warmer given that merkel 's conservatives are overwhelmingly in favor of closer transatlantic ties and repairing the damage inflicted upon it by chancellor schröder 's government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush , left , and merkel in mainz in germany " i think the big change you 're going see is one in style and rhetoric , " karen donfried , senior director of the german marshall fund in washington . " it will be very different under angela merkel , " she said .
" the role of the central east europeans will be more prominent and central east europeans are very close us allies . " reform drive crucial for better ties with us jackson james , executive director of the american institute for contemporary german studies , said transatlantic relations under the new government hinge on whether merkel can make headway on the domestic front with critical economic reforms . " the success of germany 's reforms will have important implications for europe and the united states , " james told a congressional hearing this week on the german elections and their implications for us-german ties . " the ability of germany to meet its foreign policy responsibilities in terms of defense allocations , its presence in regional hot spots like the balkans and the middle east , and its role in the international financial institutions will depend on achieving a sustainable level of economic growth . " thomas kleine brockhoff , washington bureau chief of the german newsweekly die zeit , summed up merkel 's foreign policy agenda saying it would include " less france and more united states , less russia and more poland , no eu-membership for turkey . " analysts , however , noted that though merkel is opposed to turkey joining the european union , there was no indication that she would stand in the way of the 10 to 15 year negotiating process , by which time she is not expected to still be chancellor . german public opinion a hurdle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans demonstrate against the us-led iraq war in 2003 in berlin they added that however much merkel may wish to improve ties with washington , one inescapable constraint will be german public opinion , which is fiercely opposed to the bush administration and its international policies . " given the unambiguous , negative view among the german public of us foreign policy and the merkel government 's need to have domestic backing for its economic and social reforms , it is difficult to see the new chancellor blazing new foreign policy paths together with washington , " donfried , who also testified this week before the committee on international relations in the us house of representatives , said . " if merkel closes the gap between the rhetoric and the policy , i think it would restore some of the trust between berlin and washington and that then probably might lead over into public opinion , " she added . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new government program comes under attack incoming chancellor angela merkel called saturday for germans to make sacrifices to help put their struggling economy back on track , but her future government 's policies are already under fire .

it was originally formed to facilitate war-torn germany 's integration into the west .
today , the bundeswehr maintains the peace in hot spots around the world . germany 's armed forces will formally conclude the ongoing celebrations to mark 50 years of its existence on saturday .
nov 12 is a special day for the army because on that day 50 years ago , the first voluntary recruits of the bundeswehr received their certificates in barracks in bonn . only 10 years after the end of world war ii , in 1955 west germany 's army , the bundeswehr took shape . chancellor konrad adenauer wanted the country 's own armed forces to contribute to the federal republic 's integration into western structures . during the cold war , the western allied attitude towards re-establishment of german armed forces changed quickly since germany was located directly on the dividing line between the two blocs . west germany was expected to be able to make its own contribution to defending its territory .
but a return of the " wehrmacht , " the name the german army was known by under hitler , was out of the question .
west germany 's new constitution ensured that there would never be a return to the times when the army was a state within the state . even so , parliament was made responsible for keeping the bundeswehr on a short leash and the army was closely integrated into nato .
still , the social democratic opposition as well as a large part of the population objected to rearmament .
the fact that the bundeswehr could n't possibly get by without experienced wehrmacht officers only increased people 's mistrust . away from slavish obedience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on nov .
12 , 1955 , west germany swore in its army 's first recruits , in bonn the military leadership focused on the new concept of " internal leadership " in developing the bundeswehr .
the idea was that soldiers should be " citizens in uniform " and that slavish obedience and brutal regiments would be a thing of the past . but in the beginning that was easier said than done : in 1957 , the same year that conscription was introduced , 15 recruits died after being ordered to cross the iller river without proper safety measures being taken .
elsewhere too , excessively tough training methods were part of the daily grind . sociologist martin kutz said that it took long before the idea of " internal leadership " found acceptance among the soldiers . " ' internal leadership was brought into the bundeswehr by the younger generation in the mid-60s , " kutz said .
" it has to do with the fact that the bundeswehr had an enormous shortage of young people and took whoever they could get .
thus , young people of the simplest means joined the army and caused a break in tradition that the old -lrb- military -rrb- families had -lrb- previously -rrb- prevented . " in addition to the special circumstances within the bundeswehr , which had 270,000 soldiers in 1960 , its arms cache was a central issue right from the start .
the west responded to nuclear armament in the east by developing its own nuclear arsenal .
however , chancellor adenauer 's government had committed itself to neither produce nor acquire its own nuclear weapons .
the solution was for the bundeswehr to get carriers , while the americans administered the nuclear warheads that went on them . " fight nuclear death " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz-josef strauß " we do n't want the bundeswehr equipped as a german army with tactical nuclear weapons , " then-defense minister franz-josef strauß explained .
" we want nothing more and nothing less than nato 's entire defense planning requires , which envisions for every nation from canada to turkey particular duties so that it 's acceptable for the individual -lrb- state -rrb- , so that it 's affordable for the individual -lrb- state -rrb- and so that collective security keeps the aggressor at bay . " large parts of the population and of the officers ' corps rejected strauß 's plans .
over a million germans took to the streets with the slogan " fight nuclear death . "
but in the end , the government prevailed .
in march 1958 , the bundestag , west germany 's lower house of parliament , decided after four days of debate to equip the bundeswehr with carriers for nuclear weapons .
german pilots from then on were trained to drop nuclear bombs over germany and destroy their homes in case of emergency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans mobilized in masses to protest nuclear weapons being stationed in west germany but that did n't put an end to the conflict over the german armed forces ' nuclear armament .
in the 1980s , the government allowed nuclear missiles to be stationed in the country in accordance with the nato " double-track " decision despite great resistance from the people . " there were massive differences in the army over the nuclear issue , " kutz said .
" then , more than half of the staff officers disagreed with it -lrb- stationing nuclear weapons in germany -rrb- .
of course , in the end they were fended off , but is very clear that in those days the bundeswehr was more pluralistic than today . " when the berlin wall fell , around half a million men in west germany were in the armed forces .
after german unification in 1990 , the east german armed forces , the nva , was dissolved and a portion of its soldiers integrated into the bundeswehr .
shortly thereafter , the restructuring of the armed forces began and which still continues to this day . the bundeswehr was not only too big and cumbersome , but it also needed a new orientation after the collapse of the " enemy from the east . "
defending germany on foreign soil the bundeswehr 's classic duties of national defense now faced new threats - above all from terrorism . for the first time , the bundeswehr started taking part in un-mandated peace missions , although germany 's constitution only envisages its deployment for defensive purposes - that is , in the case of an attack on the country .
the german constitutional court cleared the legal fog in 1994 when bundeswehr soldiers participated in the un peacekeeping mission in somalia .
in 1999 , german soldiers were deployed for combat for the first time when nato bombed serbia during the kosovo war - a crucial test for the green party , the junior partner in the governing coalition with the social democrats .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers now take part in un and nato peacekeeping missions as a result , foreign deployments - every one of which must be approved by the bundestag - finally were accepted as a political reality .
the bundestag gave its blessing to the initially controversial afghanistan deployment after sept .
11 attacks as well . up to 10,000 german soldiers , including special forces , have been temporarily stationed abroad . half a century after the bundeswehr 's foundation , outgoing defense minister peter struck , who was instrumental in advancing reform , summed up the development of germany 's armed forces : " i will surely go down in history with the sentence : germany is also defended on the hindu kush .

it was originally formed to facilitate war-torn germany 's integration into the west .
today , the bundeswehr maintains the peace in hot spots around the world . germany 's armed forces will formally conclude the ongoing celebrations to mark 50 years of its existence on saturday .
nov 12 is a special day for the army because on that day 50 years ago , the first voluntary recruits of the bundeswehr received their certificates in barracks in bonn . only 10 years after the end of world war ii , in 1955 west germany 's army , the bundeswehr took shape . chancellor konrad adenauer wanted the country 's own armed forces to contribute to the federal republic 's integration into western structures . during the cold war , the western allied attitude towards re-establishment of german armed forces changed quickly since germany was located directly on the dividing line between the two blocs . west germany was expected to be able to make its own contribution to defending its territory .
but a return of the " wehrmacht , " the name the german army was known by under hitler , was out of the question .
west germany 's new constitution ensured that there would never be a return to the times when the army was a state within the state . even so , parliament was made responsible for keeping the bundeswehr on a short leash and the army was closely integrated into nato .
still , the social democratic opposition as well as a large part of the population objected to rearmament .
the fact that the bundeswehr could n't possibly get by without experienced wehrmacht officers only increased people 's mistrust . away from slavish obedience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on nov .
12 , 1955 , west germany swore in its army 's first recruits , in bonn the military leadership focused on the new concept of " internal leadership " in developing the bundeswehr .
the idea was that soldiers should be " citizens in uniform " and that slavish obedience and brutal regiments would be a thing of the past . but in the beginning that was easier said than done : in 1957 , the same year that conscription was introduced , 15 recruits died after being ordered to cross the iller river without proper safety measures being taken .
elsewhere too , excessively tough training methods were part of the daily grind . sociologist martin kutz said that it took long before the idea of " internal leadership " found acceptance among the soldiers . " ' internal leadership was brought into the bundeswehr by the younger generation in the mid-60s , " kutz said .
" it has to do with the fact that the bundeswehr had an enormous shortage of young people and took whoever they could get .
thus , young people of the simplest means joined the army and caused a break in tradition that the old -lrb- military -rrb- families had -lrb- previously -rrb- prevented . " in addition to the special circumstances within the bundeswehr , which had 270,000 soldiers in 1960 , its arms cache was a central issue right from the start .
the west responded to nuclear armament in the east by developing its own nuclear arsenal .
however , chancellor adenauer 's government had committed itself to neither produce nor acquire its own nuclear weapons .
the solution was for the bundeswehr to get carriers , while the americans administered the nuclear warheads that went on them . " fight nuclear death " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz-josef strauß " we do n't want the bundeswehr equipped as a german army with tactical nuclear weapons , " then-defense minister franz-josef strauß explained .
" we want nothing more and nothing less than nato 's entire defense planning requires , which envisions for every nation from canada to turkey particular duties so that it 's acceptable for the individual -lrb- state -rrb- , so that it 's affordable for the individual -lrb- state -rrb- and so that collective security keeps the aggressor at bay . " large parts of the population and of the officers ' corps rejected strauß 's plans .
over a million germans took to the streets with the slogan " fight nuclear death . "
but in the end , the government prevailed .
in march 1958 , the bundestag , west germany 's lower house of parliament , decided after four days of debate to equip the bundeswehr with carriers for nuclear weapons .
german pilots from then on were trained to drop nuclear bombs over germany and destroy their homes in case of emergency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans mobilized in masses to protest nuclear weapons being stationed in west germany but that did n't put an end to the conflict over the german armed forces ' nuclear armament .
in the 1980s , the government allowed nuclear missiles to be stationed in the country in accordance with the nato " double-track " decision despite great resistance from the people . " there were massive differences in the army over the nuclear issue , " kutz said .
" then , more than half of the staff officers disagreed with it -lrb- stationing nuclear weapons in germany -rrb- .
of course , in the end they were fended off , but is very clear that in those days the bundeswehr was more pluralistic than today . " when the berlin wall fell , around half a million men in west germany were in the armed forces .
after german unification in 1990 , the east german armed forces , the nva , was dissolved and a portion of its soldiers integrated into the bundeswehr .
shortly thereafter , the restructuring of the armed forces began and which still continues to this day . the bundeswehr was not only too big and cumbersome , but it also needed a new orientation after the collapse of the " enemy from the east . "
defending germany on foreign soil the bundeswehr 's classic duties of national defense now faced new threats - above all from terrorism . for the first time , the bundeswehr started taking part in un-mandated peace missions , although germany 's constitution only envisages its deployment for defensive purposes - that is , in the case of an attack on the country .

it was originally formed to facilitate war-torn germany 's integration into the west .
today , the bundeswehr maintains the peace in hot spots around the world . germany 's armed forces will formally conclude the ongoing celebrations to mark 50 years of its existence on saturday .
nov 12 is a special day for the army because on that day 50 years ago , the first voluntary recruits of the bundeswehr received their certificates in barracks in bonn . only 10 years after the end of world war ii , in 1955 west germany 's army , the bundeswehr took shape . chancellor konrad adenauer wanted the country 's own armed forces to contribute to the federal republic 's integration into western structures . during the cold war , the western allied attitude towards re-establishment of german armed forces changed quickly since germany was located directly on the dividing line between the two blocs . west germany was expected to be able to make its own contribution to defending its territory .
but a return of the " wehrmacht , " the name the german army was known by under hitler , was out of the question .
west germany 's new constitution ensured that there would never be a return to the times when the army was a state within the state . even so , parliament was made responsible for keeping the bundeswehr on a short leash and the army was closely integrated into nato .
still , the social democratic opposition as well as a large part of the population objected to rearmament .
the fact that the bundeswehr could n't possibly get by without experienced wehrmacht officers only increased people 's mistrust . away from slavish obedience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on nov .
12 , 1955 , west germany swore in its army 's first recruits , in bonn the military leadership focused on the new concept of " internal leadership " in developing the bundeswehr .
the idea was that soldiers should be " citizens in uniform " and that slavish obedience and brutal regiments would be a thing of the past . but in the beginning that was easier said than done : in 1957 , the same year that conscription was introduced , 15 recruits died after being ordered to cross the iller river without proper safety measures being taken .
elsewhere too , excessively tough training methods were part of the daily grind . sociologist martin kutz said that it took long before the idea of " internal leadership " found acceptance among the soldiers . " ' internal leadership was brought into the bundeswehr by the younger generation in the mid-60s , " kutz said .
" it has to do with the fact that the bundeswehr had an enormous shortage of young people and took whoever they could get .
thus , young people of the simplest means joined the army and caused a break in tradition that the old -lrb- military -rrb- families had -lrb- previously -rrb- prevented . " in addition to the special circumstances within the bundeswehr , which had 270,000 soldiers in 1960 , its arms cache was a central issue right from the start .
the west responded to nuclear armament in the east by developing its own nuclear arsenal .
however , chancellor adenauer 's government had committed itself to neither produce nor acquire its own nuclear weapons .
the solution was for the bundeswehr to get carriers , while the americans administered the nuclear warheads that went on them . " fight nuclear death " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz-josef strauß " we do n't want the bundeswehr equipped as a german army with tactical nuclear weapons , " then-defense minister franz-josef strauß explained .
" we want nothing more and nothing less than nato 's entire defense planning requires , which envisions for every nation from canada to turkey particular duties so that it 's acceptable for the individual -lrb- state -rrb- , so that it 's affordable for the individual -lrb- state -rrb- and so that collective security keeps the aggressor at bay . " large parts of the population and of the officers ' corps rejected strauß 's plans .
over a million germans took to the streets with the slogan " fight nuclear death . "
but in the end , the government prevailed .
in march 1958 , the bundestag , west germany 's lower house of parliament , decided after four days of debate to equip the bundeswehr with carriers for nuclear weapons .
german pilots from then on were trained to drop nuclear bombs over germany and destroy their homes in case of emergency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans mobilized in masses to protest nuclear weapons being stationed in west germany but that did n't put an end to the conflict over the german armed forces ' nuclear armament .
in the 1980s , the government allowed nuclear missiles to be stationed in the country in accordance with the nato " double-track " decision despite great resistance from the people . " there were massive differences in the army over the nuclear issue , " kutz said .
" then , more than half of the staff officers disagreed with it -lrb- stationing nuclear weapons in germany -rrb- .
of course , in the end they were fended off , but is very clear that in those days the bundeswehr was more pluralistic than today . " when the berlin wall fell , around half a million men in west germany were in the armed forces .
after german unification in 1990 , the east german armed forces , the nva , was dissolved and a portion of its soldiers integrated into the bundeswehr .
shortly thereafter , the restructuring of the armed forces began and which still continues to this day . the bundeswehr was not only too big and cumbersome , but it also needed a new orientation after the collapse of the " enemy from the east . "
defending germany on foreign soil the bundeswehr 's classic duties of national defense now faced new threats - above all from terrorism . for the first time , the bundeswehr started taking part in un-mandated peace missions , although germany 's constitution only envisages its deployment for defensive purposes - that is , in the case of an attack on the country .
the german constitutional court cleared the legal fog in 1994 when bundeswehr soldiers participated in the un peacekeeping mission in somalia .
in 1999 , german soldiers were deployed for combat for the first time when nato bombed serbia during the kosovo war - a crucial test for the green party , the junior partner in the governing coalition with the social democrats .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers now take part in un and nato peacekeeping missions as a result , foreign deployments - every one of which must be approved by the bundestag - finally were accepted as a political reality .
the bundestag gave its blessing to the initially controversial afghanistan deployment after sept .
11 attacks as well . up to 10,000 german soldiers , including special forces , have been temporarily stationed abroad . half a century after the bundeswehr 's foundation , outgoing defense minister peter struck , who was instrumental in advancing reform , summed up the development of germany 's armed forces : " i will surely go down in history with the sentence : germany is also defended on the hindu kush .
and with the other sentence : the bundeswehr 's operational area is the whole world .

while the meeting is not nearly as important as a world cup semi-final , it is the last litmus test for jürgen klinsmann 's team of yearlings against a squad still considered one of the world 's best . " we 'll see where we stand against a team like that , it 'll be a real test of where we are , " said germany captain michael ballack . paris shoot-out ballack and striker miroslav klose , both injured and unable to take part in germany 's 2-1 embarrassment against turkey a few weeks ago , are ready to roll .
their talents on the attack will be desperately needed in what could shape up to be a shoot-out with les bleus , who , even without playmaker zinadine zidane , boast some of the world 's best strikers .

it will be offensive-minded arne friedrich , chelsea substitute robert huth and 20-year-old lukas sinkewiecz who will be there to pick up the slack . france also is not exactly shining at the moment .
despite only losing once in the past 38 games , les bleus struggled mightily in their qualification group , finishing first -and avoiding a play-off - only after switzerland failed to score a goal against ireland in the last match .

it reveals a sordid saga and estimates wrongdoing among senior management cost vw millions . fraud and betrayal , lavish parties and visits to the red light district at the company ’ s cost ...
they sound like the plot elements of a thriller , but the allegations that have been flying around volkswagen headquarters in wolfsburg in recent months are very real . volkswagen hired auditing firm kpmg to scrutinize company procedures on the first of july , three days after it asked german prosecutors to investigate two former human resources executives for fraud . it was alleged helmuth schuster and klaus-joachim gebauer had set up shell companies in a number of countries , including india and the czech republic , to win business from the carmaker . sleaze and bribery members of the company ’ s works council were allegedly ‘ bought ’ , while personnel managers , on the other hand , made deals that weren ’ t in the interest of the company , incurring losses worth millions of euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vw logo which has stood for sturdy quality is now tarnished but , the most sensational element of the volkswagen scandal story is the allegation that the company ’ s board sent members of the works council on expensive sex holidays .
in return , works council members rubber-stamped board resolutions .
the procedure saw unconfirmed expense claims of up to 30,000 euros approved . the volkswagen scandal became public after a network of letter-box companies was uncovered .
it ’ s alleged helmuth schuster , the former personnel chief of vw-subsidiary skoda , used the companies as a front to channel funds into his own pockets . an indian state government also accuses schuster of demanding two million euros in kickbacks in exchange for his promise that volkswagen would build a plant in their region . wrongdoing right up to top rungs it wasn ’ t long before investigations into the network of front companies turned up another name : klaus-joachim gebauer , volkswagen ’ s former personnel manager .
it ’ s alleged he organized several sex parties that later came to haunt several members of the works council . " some of the things that have been said are true , " gebauer said .
" the one thing i regret is that , through other people , i got into a situation i don ’ t want to be in . " but the scandal doesn ’ t end there .
even the long-serving and influential head of the works council , klaus volkert , has caught the eye of prosecutors . but volkert maintains fraud allegations are unfounded . " the short version is : i ’ m not aware of any wrongdoing .
i have no idea why i have the ‘ honor ’ of being subject to this media witch-hunt , " volkert said . hartz resignation trade union officials say the scandal is partly a conspiracy to weaken employee representation at volkswagen .
they argue that a strong works council and union have long been a thorn in the side of volkswagen ’ s top management . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beleagured vw manager peter hartz stepped down recently fraud allegations also led to recent resignation of human resources executive peter hartz .
for years hartz stood as one of the supporting pillars of the so-called “ vw-system ” of close cooperation between top management and employee representatives . he “ invented ” of the four-day-week - cutting working hours without compensatory wage increases - and even had national labor market reforms named after him , before he had to admit he ’ d made mistakes at volkswagen by not keeping tight enough control of his employees . vw moves to stem damage all in all , the kpmg report estimates the scandal has cost volkswagen a total of five million euros , although further investigations could see that figure rise . as the initial fallout of the scandal settles , chief executive bernd pischetsrieder says he ’ s taking steps to make volkswagen a ‘ more transparent company internally and externally ’ . under a new ombudsman system , volkswagen will assign two lawyers to deal with allegations throughout the corporation .
company employees will then be able to give them anonymous tips on corrupt activities . top management at wolfsburg say they want investigators to get to the bottom of the scandal . it ’ s a call echoed by the premier of the of lower saxony christian wulff .
his federal state is volkswagen ’ s largest shareholder . " those guilty of wrongdoing will have to clear their desks and accept responsibility for what they did , ” wulff said . “ then we ’ ll put systems in place to ensure this can never be repeated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst neumann faces a challenging time at vw volkswagen announced on friday that horst neumann has been named to replace hartz . neumann , who currently oversees human resources as a board member at volkswagen ’ s subsidiary audi , will start his new job on december 1 . monika lohmüller -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany rocked by damning report on un scandal news of the involvement of leading german companies in kickbacks to saddam hussein 's regime during the un oil-for-food program has stunned germany and prompted calls for speedy legal action .

they all have to win two-legged playoffs if they do n't want to face their fans ' scorn .
the first games are saturday , with the final decision coming on wednesday . the stress that comes with having to win a playoff was best summed up by slovakian coach dusan galis , who wants to lead his team to the world cup finals for the first time since the nation gained its independence 12 years ago . " i 'm not interested in anything else .
having a good feeling from a good performance and losing with honor - i will not be satisfied with anything like that , " galis told reporters .
" we have gone this far , so we are able to make the last step . " slovakia looks to fate to beat spain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain will start the playoffs in front of a home crowd but arsenal striker jose antonio reyes is confident he and the rest of the heavily favored spanish team have enough class to beat the slovakians and make it to their eighth consecutive world cup finals . " we are the better team and we are going to prove it , " reyes said .
" i am convinced we are going to score goals , and a 2-0 score line would be ideal to take to slovakia . " slovakia hope to fate on their side , spain has qualified for every finals since 1974 , when they were held , ironically , in west germany .
morale in the slovakian camp is also at a high after they eliminated russia from the finals .
if galis ' team can keep spain from running rampant saturday in madrid , they may still have a chance wednesday in bratislava , where they have n't lost since june 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norway surprised brazil , now they 'll try to beat the czechs for a trip to the world cup norway always good for a surprise norway will be rated underdogs against the czechs who are rated the fourth best team in the world in fifa 's rankings and come into the playoff as firm favorites .
but norway will hope to rekindle the spirit of ' 98 when they stunned brazil 2-1 in the first round of the world cup in france . norway midfielder morten gamst pedersen said he smells an upset in the oslo air and is confident his team will make it to their first finals since 1998 . " it 's two big games against the czech republic but we have beaten big teams before and we will do it again , " the 24-year-old blackburn rovers player told uefa.com. the czechs have already complained about oslo 's wet , muddy pitch that could hamper their passing game , and even though norway finished second in their group , they will have a lot of improving to do before they make it germany . closest match between turkey and switzerland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey beat germany 2-1 in october whichever of the evenly matched teams wins saturday will have an even bigger psychological advantage than usual going into wednesday 's final in turkey . turkish coach fatih terim is already resigned to fielding a team in berne without hertha berlin midfielder yildiray basturk and besiktas midfielder ibrahim akin with knee problems , and now major fitness doubts hanging over striker hasan sas and defender tolga seyhan as well . in what may amount to matches between the walking wounded , switzerland coach köbi kuhn has injury concerns of his own , with striker johan vonlanthen tearing a ligament in his foot in training on thursday and there are also doubts over captain johann vogel and defender boris smiljanic 's fitness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uruguay striker diego forlan will attack the socceroos two intercontinental playoffs remain two-time world cup winners uruguay are hoping to take a huge step towards the 2006 tournament by sending out an attack-minded line-up for playoff against australia . the maturing socceroos ' chances of making it to their first world cup since 1974 appear more positive under the guidance of dutchman guus hiddink .
the aussies ' main problem will be up front in the offense .

it reveals a sordid saga and estimates wrongdoing among senior management cost vw millions . fraud and betrayal , lavish parties and visits to the red light district at the company ’ s cost ...
they sound like the plot elements of a thriller , but the allegations that have been flying around volkswagen headquarters in wolfsburg in recent months are very real . volkswagen hired auditing firm kpmg to scrutinize company procedures on the first of july , three days after it asked german prosecutors to investigate two former human resources executives for fraud . it was alleged helmuth schuster and klaus-joachim gebauer had set up shell companies in a number of countries , including india and the czech republic , to win business from the carmaker . sleaze and bribery members of the company ’ s works council were allegedly ‘ bought ’ , while personnel managers , on the other hand , made deals that weren ’ t in the interest of the company , incurring losses worth millions of euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vw logo which has stood for sturdy quality is now tarnished but , the most sensational element of the volkswagen scandal story is the allegation that the company ’ s board sent members of the works council on expensive sex holidays .
in return , works council members rubber-stamped board resolutions .
the procedure saw unconfirmed expense claims of up to 30,000 euros approved . the volkswagen scandal became public after a network of letter-box companies was uncovered .
it ’ s alleged helmuth schuster , the former personnel chief of vw-subsidiary skoda , used the companies as a front to channel funds into his own pockets . an indian state government also accuses schuster of demanding two million euros in kickbacks in exchange for his promise that volkswagen would build a plant in their region . wrongdoing right up to top rungs it wasn ’ t long before investigations into the network of front companies turned up another name : klaus-joachim gebauer , volkswagen ’ s former personnel manager .
it ’ s alleged he organized several sex parties that later came to haunt several members of the works council . " some of the things that have been said are true , " gebauer said .
" the one thing i regret is that , through other people , i got into a situation i don ’ t want to be in . " but the scandal doesn ’ t end there .
even the long-serving and influential head of the works council , klaus volkert , has caught the eye of prosecutors . but volkert maintains fraud allegations are unfounded . " the short version is : i ’ m not aware of any wrongdoing .
i have no idea why i have the ‘ honor ’ of being subject to this media witch-hunt , " volkert said . hartz resignation trade union officials say the scandal is partly a conspiracy to weaken employee representation at volkswagen .
they argue that a strong works council and union have long been a thorn in the side of volkswagen ’ s top management . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beleagured vw manager peter hartz stepped down recently fraud allegations also led to recent resignation of human resources executive peter hartz .
for years hartz stood as one of the supporting pillars of the so-called “ vw-system ” of close cooperation between top management and employee representatives . he “ invented ” of the four-day-week - cutting working hours without compensatory wage increases - and even had national labor market reforms named after him , before he had to admit he ’ d made mistakes at volkswagen by not keeping tight enough control of his employees . vw moves to stem damage all in all , the kpmg report estimates the scandal has cost volkswagen a total of five million euros , although further investigations could see that figure rise . as the initial fallout of the scandal settles , chief executive bernd pischetsrieder says he ’ s taking steps to make volkswagen a ‘ more transparent company internally and externally ’ . under a new ombudsman system , volkswagen will assign two lawyers to deal with allegations throughout the corporation .
company employees will then be able to give them anonymous tips on corrupt activities . top management at wolfsburg say they want investigators to get to the bottom of the scandal . it ’ s a call echoed by the premier of the of lower saxony christian wulff .
his federal state is volkswagen ’ s largest shareholder . " those guilty of wrongdoing will have to clear their desks and accept responsibility for what they did , ” wulff said . “ then we ’ ll put systems in place to ensure this can never be repeated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst neumann faces a challenging time at vw volkswagen announced on friday that horst neumann has been named to replace hartz . neumann , who currently oversees human resources as a board member at volkswagen ’ s subsidiary audi , will start his new job on december 1 . monika lohmüller -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany rocked by damning report on un scandal news of the involvement of leading german companies in kickbacks to saddam hussein 's regime during the un oil-for-food program has stunned germany and prompted calls for speedy legal action .

it will be offensive-minded arne friedrich , chelsea substitute robert huth and 20-year-old lukas sinkewiecz who will be there to pick up the slack . france also is not exactly shining at the moment .
despite only losing once in the past 38 games , les bleus struggled mightily in their qualification group , finishing first -and avoiding a play-off - only after switzerland failed to score a goal against ireland in the last match .
switzerland will play turkey saturday in the first of two play-off matches . oldies still goodies many experts credit the team 's last minute surge to the return of midfield superstar zidane , who decided to rethink his retirement from the national team .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.11.2005 walking bus gets kids moving - and thinking großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walking to school is good for kids ' minds and bodies concerned at the growing ranks of obese children , a sports professor has come up with an unusual solution to prevent tubbiness .
in the german town of paderborn , primary school kids take the " walking bus " to class . obesity has reached the dimensions of a global epidemic , according to the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- .
not only adults are affected ; in germany , 36 percent of seven-year-old boys are significantly overweight as are 30 percent of seven-year-old girls . the medical effects are alarming : high blood pressure and type-two diabetes are phenomena that people under 40 generally do n't have to be concerned about .
but ever more children are being diagnosed with these maladies .
while kids do n't necessarily eat more than they did in the past , what has changed is that nowadays people in the west hardly walk anywhere . today 's sedentary lifestyles start at a young age .
traffic jams develop in front of primary schools on a regular basis , says wolf-dietrich brettschneider , who lives near one .
but there at least , the morning congestion has come to an end .
brettschneider and co-worker christoph malek have established the first german " walking bus " at the margarethenschule in paderborn . bus without wheels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reflective vests ensure that car drivers see the walking bus each morning , two kilometers -lrb- one mile -rrb- away from the school , the bus starts up .
students are collected at three bus stops and again dropped off after class .
the difference is that this bus is not an actual bus , not a vehicle .
the " bus " is a group of walkers .
adult volunteers accompany the children and make sure they make it safely to school .
that reassures parents who are used to driving their kids to class - whether for safety 's sake or to save time . aside from encouraging mobility , local police traffic safety advisor norbert meier is convinced that the walking bus has other benefits . " children come into contact with the reality of traffic earlier than if they 're always put in a car , " he said , adding that it helps kids learn independence and traffic safety rules faster . " our aim is for children to see movement as a something routine , " said head teacher helga berling .
her charges are keen on the walking bus , too , including many who have to go out of their way to get to one of the bus stops .
the route takes them through quiet neighborhood streets where they 're exposed to fewer exhaust fumes than on the more main road leading to the school . " it 's that much nicer , " said 8-year-old mara .
" then you can talk longer with your girlfriends . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids taking the walking bus are more alert when they get to class that too is one of the benefits of the walking bus .
" when kids walk to school they are more relaxed when they arrive in class , " explained brettschneider .
" they 've talked among themselves and also gotten lots of fresh air .
their ability to concentrate and learn is better . " beyond school so far , that seems to be the case .
" the children are more awake in any case , " said berlin after having observed the project for several months . ideally , the walking bus should motivate kids to be more physically active in their free time too .
in order to check whether that is the case , christoph malek plans to start a study in late november to observe the behavior and concentration levels of walking bus participants over a period of months . sixty german schools have already contacted brettschneider 's team about the walking bus .
three have gotten the idea going so far and five more aim to have it up and running by the end of the year .
the idea has also attracted interest from abroad , which is why brettschneider and malek will present the walking bus project at an international conference on the role of education and sports in lisbon in mid-november . johanna tüntsch -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us and germany fight battle of the bulge as the number of german children getting fatter increases , german officials are looking for ways to combat this trend and turning to americans for assistance .

she is expected to be sworn in later this month provided separate party conferences on monday endorse the coalition deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's rival politicians have forged a power-sharing deal on friday , merkel was optimistic that the new grand coalition would work for germany .
" i think that this can be a coalition of new possibilities , " merkel said , adding it offered germany " a real chance " to pull itself out of its ongoing economic crisis . the new government 's power-sharing agreement broadly outlines reform measures aimed at reviving the stagnant german economy , slashing mounting public deficit and tackling the chronically high unemployment rate .

" the ability of germany to meet its foreign policy responsibilities in terms of defense allocations , its presence in regional hot spots like the balkans and the middle east , and its role in the international financial institutions will depend on achieving a sustainable level of economic growth . " thomas kleine brockhoff , washington bureau chief of the german newsweekly die zeit , summed up merkel 's foreign policy agenda saying it would include " less france and more united states , less russia and more poland , no eu-membership for turkey .

brettschneider and co-worker christoph malek have established the first german " walking bus " at the margarethenschule in paderborn . bus without wheels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reflective vests ensure that car drivers see the walking bus each morning , two kilometers -lrb- one mile -rrb- away from the school , the bus starts up .
students are collected at three bus stops and again dropped off after class .
the difference is that this bus is not an actual bus , not a vehicle .
the " bus " is a group of walkers .
adult volunteers accompany the children and make sure they make it safely to school .
that reassures parents who are used to driving their kids to class - whether for safety 's sake or to save time . aside from encouraging mobility , local police traffic safety advisor norbert meier is convinced that the walking bus has other benefits . " children come into contact with the reality of traffic earlier than if they 're always put in a car , " he said , adding that it helps kids learn independence and traffic safety rules faster . " our aim is for children to see movement as a something routine , " said head teacher helga berling .
her charges are keen on the walking bus , too , including many who have to go out of their way to get to one of the bus stops .
the route takes them through quiet neighborhood streets where they 're exposed to fewer exhaust fumes than on the more main road leading to the school . " it 's that much nicer , " said 8-year-old mara .
" then you can talk longer with your girlfriends . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids taking the walking bus are more alert when they get to class that too is one of the benefits of the walking bus .
" when kids walk to school they are more relaxed when they arrive in class , " explained brettschneider .

" the children are more awake in any case , " said berlin after having observed the project for several months . ideally , the walking bus should motivate kids to be more physically active in their free time too .
in order to check whether that is the case , christoph malek plans to start a study in late november to observe the behavior and concentration levels of walking bus participants over a period of months . sixty german schools have already contacted brettschneider 's team about the walking bus .
three have gotten the idea going so far and five more aim to have it up and running by the end of the year .

in the german town of paderborn , primary school kids take the " walking bus " to class . obesity has reached the dimensions of a global epidemic , according to the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- .
not only adults are affected ; in germany , 36 percent of seven-year-old boys are significantly overweight as are 30 percent of seven-year-old girls . the medical effects are alarming : high blood pressure and type-two diabetes are phenomena that people under 40 generally do n't have to be concerned about .
but ever more children are being diagnosed with these maladies .
while kids do n't necessarily eat more than they did in the past , what has changed is that nowadays people in the west hardly walk anywhere . today 's sedentary lifestyles start at a young age .

they all have to win two-legged playoffs if they do n't want to face their fans ' scorn .
the first games are saturday , with the final decision coming on wednesday . the stress that comes with having to win a playoff was best summed up by slovakian coach dusan galis , who wants to lead his team to the world cup finals for the first time since the nation gained its independence 12 years ago . " i 'm not interested in anything else .
having a good feeling from a good performance and losing with honor - i will not be satisfied with anything like that , " galis told reporters .
" we have gone this far , so we are able to make the last step . " slovakia looks to fate to beat spain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain will start the playoffs in front of a home crowd but arsenal striker jose antonio reyes is confident he and the rest of the heavily favored spanish team have enough class to beat the slovakians and make it to their eighth consecutive world cup finals . " we are the better team and we are going to prove it , " reyes said .
" i am convinced we are going to score goals , and a 2-0 score line would be ideal to take to slovakia . " slovakia hope to fate on their side , spain has qualified for every finals since 1974 , when they were held , ironically , in west germany .
morale in the slovakian camp is also at a high after they eliminated russia from the finals .
if galis ' team can keep spain from running rampant saturday in madrid , they may still have a chance wednesday in bratislava , where they have n't lost since june 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norway surprised brazil , now they 'll try to beat the czechs for a trip to the world cup norway always good for a surprise norway will be rated underdogs against the czechs who are rated the fourth best team in the world in fifa 's rankings and come into the playoff as firm favorites .
but norway will hope to rekindle the spirit of ' 98 when they stunned brazil 2-1 in the first round of the world cup in france . norway midfielder morten gamst pedersen said he smells an upset in the oslo air and is confident his team will make it to their first finals since 1998 . " it 's two big games against the czech republic but we have beaten big teams before and we will do it again , " the 24-year-old blackburn rovers player told uefa.com. the czechs have already complained about oslo 's wet , muddy pitch that could hamper their passing game , and even though norway finished second in their group , they will have a lot of improving to do before they make it germany . closest match between turkey and switzerland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey beat germany 2-1 in october whichever of the evenly matched teams wins saturday will have an even bigger psychological advantage than usual going into wednesday 's final in turkey . turkish coach fatih terim is already resigned to fielding a team in berne without hertha berlin midfielder yildiray basturk and besiktas midfielder ibrahim akin with knee problems , and now major fitness doubts hanging over striker hasan sas and defender tolga seyhan as well . in what may amount to matches between the walking wounded , switzerland coach köbi kuhn has injury concerns of his own , with striker johan vonlanthen tearing a ligament in his foot in training on thursday and there are also doubts over captain johann vogel and defender boris smiljanic 's fitness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uruguay striker diego forlan will attack the socceroos two intercontinental playoffs remain two-time world cup winners uruguay are hoping to take a huge step towards the 2006 tournament by sending out an attack-minded line-up for playoff against australia . the maturing socceroos ' chances of making it to their first world cup since 1974 appear more positive under the guidance of dutchman guus hiddink .
the aussies ' main problem will be up front in the offense .
harry kewell , who has played for liverpool just twice since returning from groin surgery , could however come off the bench late in the match in an attempt to steal a vital away goal in uruguay . " i think it will be a very closely contested game , and it will also be physical , " said uruguay defender dario rodriguez , who plays club soccer for schalke 04 .
" for us the objective is simple .
we have to go out and get three points so that we can travel to australia with no pressure . " gifts promised to bahrain 's goal scorers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bahrain 's mohammed hubail , left , tied with uzbekistan to qualify for the playoffs trinidad and tobago are approaching the last of the world cup playoffs against bahrain with the same setup they used in qualifying . " why should i change anything ? "
trinidad and tobago coach leo beenhakker said .
" little by little the team has been growing and playing better and better . " the two matches will be a clash of styles as beenhakker 's side is known for its attacking flair while bahrain are known for layering their rearguard and patiently biding time for the perfect counterattack . according to media reports bahrain players , however , will have an added incentive to score in the playoffs .
while bahrain team manager abdul razzaq mohammed denied players would receive the rumored $ 1 million for scoring -lrb- 1.17 million euros -rrb- , he admitted that gifts had been promised to goal scorers . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de can germany pass its french test ?

experts say foreign policy under her will lead to warmer ties with the us , but it wo n't translate into major policy changes . germany 's conservatives led by angela merkel and the social democrats agreed on the second so-called " grand coalition " in germany 's postwar history on friday . the move paves the way for 51-year-old angela merkel , a former scientist who grew up in the communist former east germany , to become germany 's first female chancellor .
she is expected to be sworn in later this month provided separate party conferences on monday endorse the coalition deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's rival politicians have forged a power-sharing deal on friday , merkel was optimistic that the new grand coalition would work for germany .
" i think that this can be a coalition of new possibilities , " merkel said , adding it offered germany " a real chance " to pull itself out of its ongoing economic crisis . the new government 's power-sharing agreement broadly outlines reform measures aimed at reviving the stagnant german economy , slashing mounting public deficit and tackling the chronically high unemployment rate . " change in style and rhetoric " analysts however are n't expecting significant change on the foreign policy front .
they do however admit that german relations with the us will be become warmer given that merkel 's conservatives are overwhelmingly in favor of closer transatlantic ties and repairing the damage inflicted upon it by chancellor schröder 's government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush , left , and merkel in mainz in germany " i think the big change you 're going see is one in style and rhetoric , " karen donfried , senior director of the german marshall fund in washington . " it will be very different under angela merkel , " she said .
" the role of the central east europeans will be more prominent and central east europeans are very close us allies . " reform drive crucial for better ties with us jackson james , executive director of the american institute for contemporary german studies , said transatlantic relations under the new government hinge on whether merkel can make headway on the domestic front with critical economic reforms . " the success of germany 's reforms will have important implications for europe and the united states , " james told a congressional hearing this week on the german elections and their implications for us-german ties . " the ability of germany to meet its foreign policy responsibilities in terms of defense allocations , its presence in regional hot spots like the balkans and the middle east , and its role in the international financial institutions will depend on achieving a sustainable level of economic growth . " thomas kleine brockhoff , washington bureau chief of the german newsweekly die zeit , summed up merkel 's foreign policy agenda saying it would include " less france and more united states , less russia and more poland , no eu-membership for turkey . " analysts , however , noted that though merkel is opposed to turkey joining the european union , there was no indication that she would stand in the way of the 10 to 15 year negotiating process , by which time she is not expected to still be chancellor . german public opinion a hurdle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans demonstrate against the us-led iraq war in 2003 in berlin they added that however much merkel may wish to improve ties with washington , one inescapable constraint will be german public opinion , which is fiercely opposed to the bush administration and its international policies . " given the unambiguous , negative view among the german public of us foreign policy and the merkel government 's need to have domestic backing for its economic and social reforms , it is difficult to see the new chancellor blazing new foreign policy paths together with washington , " donfried , who also testified this week before the committee on international relations in the us house of representatives , said . " if merkel closes the gap between the rhetoric and the policy , i think it would restore some of the trust between berlin and washington and that then probably might lead over into public opinion , " she added . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new government program comes under attack incoming chancellor angela merkel called saturday for germans to make sacrifices to help put their struggling economy back on track , but her future government 's policies are already under fire .

it was originally formed to facilitate war-torn germany 's integration into the west .
today , the bundeswehr maintains the peace in hot spots around the world . germany 's armed forces will formally conclude the ongoing celebrations to mark 50 years of its existence on saturday .
nov 12 is a special day for the army because on that day 50 years ago , the first voluntary recruits of the bundeswehr received their certificates in barracks in bonn . only 10 years after the end of world war ii , in 1955 west germany 's army , the bundeswehr took shape . chancellor konrad adenauer wanted the country 's own armed forces to contribute to the federal republic 's integration into western structures . during the cold war , the western allied attitude towards re-establishment of german armed forces changed quickly since germany was located directly on the dividing line between the two blocs . west germany was expected to be able to make its own contribution to defending its territory .
but a return of the " wehrmacht , " the name the german army was known by under hitler , was out of the question .
west germany 's new constitution ensured that there would never be a return to the times when the army was a state within the state . even so , parliament was made responsible for keeping the bundeswehr on a short leash and the army was closely integrated into nato .
still , the social democratic opposition as well as a large part of the population objected to rearmament .
the fact that the bundeswehr could n't possibly get by without experienced wehrmacht officers only increased people 's mistrust . away from slavish obedience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on nov .
12 , 1955 , west germany swore in its army 's first recruits , in bonn the military leadership focused on the new concept of " internal leadership " in developing the bundeswehr .
the idea was that soldiers should be " citizens in uniform " and that slavish obedience and brutal regiments would be a thing of the past . but in the beginning that was easier said than done : in 1957 , the same year that conscription was introduced , 15 recruits died after being ordered to cross the iller river without proper safety measures being taken .
elsewhere too , excessively tough training methods were part of the daily grind . sociologist martin kutz said that it took long before the idea of " internal leadership " found acceptance among the soldiers . " ' internal leadership was brought into the bundeswehr by the younger generation in the mid-60s , " kutz said .
" it has to do with the fact that the bundeswehr had an enormous shortage of young people and took whoever they could get .
thus , young people of the simplest means joined the army and caused a break in tradition that the old -lrb- military -rrb- families had -lrb- previously -rrb- prevented . " in addition to the special circumstances within the bundeswehr , which had 270,000 soldiers in 1960 , its arms cache was a central issue right from the start .
the west responded to nuclear armament in the east by developing its own nuclear arsenal .
however , chancellor adenauer 's government had committed itself to neither produce nor acquire its own nuclear weapons .
the solution was for the bundeswehr to get carriers , while the americans administered the nuclear warheads that went on them . " fight nuclear death " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz-josef strauß " we do n't want the bundeswehr equipped as a german army with tactical nuclear weapons , " then-defense minister franz-josef strauß explained .
" we want nothing more and nothing less than nato 's entire defense planning requires , which envisions for every nation from canada to turkey particular duties so that it 's acceptable for the individual -lrb- state -rrb- , so that it 's affordable for the individual -lrb- state -rrb- and so that collective security keeps the aggressor at bay . " large parts of the population and of the officers ' corps rejected strauß 's plans .
over a million germans took to the streets with the slogan " fight nuclear death . "
but in the end , the government prevailed .
in march 1958 , the bundestag , west germany 's lower house of parliament , decided after four days of debate to equip the bundeswehr with carriers for nuclear weapons .
german pilots from then on were trained to drop nuclear bombs over germany and destroy their homes in case of emergency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans mobilized in masses to protest nuclear weapons being stationed in west germany but that did n't put an end to the conflict over the german armed forces ' nuclear armament .
in the 1980s , the government allowed nuclear missiles to be stationed in the country in accordance with the nato " double-track " decision despite great resistance from the people . " there were massive differences in the army over the nuclear issue , " kutz said .
" then , more than half of the staff officers disagreed with it -lrb- stationing nuclear weapons in germany -rrb- .
of course , in the end they were fended off , but is very clear that in those days the bundeswehr was more pluralistic than today . " when the berlin wall fell , around half a million men in west germany were in the armed forces .
after german unification in 1990 , the east german armed forces , the nva , was dissolved and a portion of its soldiers integrated into the bundeswehr .
shortly thereafter , the restructuring of the armed forces began and which still continues to this day . the bundeswehr was not only too big and cumbersome , but it also needed a new orientation after the collapse of the " enemy from the east . "
defending germany on foreign soil the bundeswehr 's classic duties of national defense now faced new threats - above all from terrorism . for the first time , the bundeswehr started taking part in un-mandated peace missions , although germany 's constitution only envisages its deployment for defensive purposes - that is , in the case of an attack on the country .
the german constitutional court cleared the legal fog in 1994 when bundeswehr soldiers participated in the un peacekeeping mission in somalia .
in 1999 , german soldiers were deployed for combat for the first time when nato bombed serbia during the kosovo war - a crucial test for the green party , the junior partner in the governing coalition with the social democrats .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers now take part in un and nato peacekeeping missions as a result , foreign deployments - every one of which must be approved by the bundestag - finally were accepted as a political reality .
the bundestag gave its blessing to the initially controversial afghanistan deployment after sept .
11 attacks as well . up to 10,000 german soldiers , including special forces , have been temporarily stationed abroad . half a century after the bundeswehr 's foundation , outgoing defense minister peter struck , who was instrumental in advancing reform , summed up the development of germany 's armed forces : " i will surely go down in history with the sentence : germany is also defended on the hindu kush .

it was originally formed to facilitate war-torn germany 's integration into the west .
today , the bundeswehr maintains the peace in hot spots around the world . germany 's armed forces will formally conclude the ongoing celebrations to mark 50 years of its existence on saturday .
nov 12 is a special day for the army because on that day 50 years ago , the first voluntary recruits of the bundeswehr received their certificates in barracks in bonn . only 10 years after the end of world war ii , in 1955 west germany 's army , the bundeswehr took shape . chancellor konrad adenauer wanted the country 's own armed forces to contribute to the federal republic 's integration into western structures . during the cold war , the western allied attitude towards re-establishment of german armed forces changed quickly since germany was located directly on the dividing line between the two blocs . west germany was expected to be able to make its own contribution to defending its territory .
but a return of the " wehrmacht , " the name the german army was known by under hitler , was out of the question .
west germany 's new constitution ensured that there would never be a return to the times when the army was a state within the state . even so , parliament was made responsible for keeping the bundeswehr on a short leash and the army was closely integrated into nato .
still , the social democratic opposition as well as a large part of the population objected to rearmament .
the fact that the bundeswehr could n't possibly get by without experienced wehrmacht officers only increased people 's mistrust . away from slavish obedience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on nov .
12 , 1955 , west germany swore in its army 's first recruits , in bonn the military leadership focused on the new concept of " internal leadership " in developing the bundeswehr .
the idea was that soldiers should be " citizens in uniform " and that slavish obedience and brutal regiments would be a thing of the past . but in the beginning that was easier said than done : in 1957 , the same year that conscription was introduced , 15 recruits died after being ordered to cross the iller river without proper safety measures being taken .
elsewhere too , excessively tough training methods were part of the daily grind . sociologist martin kutz said that it took long before the idea of " internal leadership " found acceptance among the soldiers . " ' internal leadership was brought into the bundeswehr by the younger generation in the mid-60s , " kutz said .
" it has to do with the fact that the bundeswehr had an enormous shortage of young people and took whoever they could get .
thus , young people of the simplest means joined the army and caused a break in tradition that the old -lrb- military -rrb- families had -lrb- previously -rrb- prevented . " in addition to the special circumstances within the bundeswehr , which had 270,000 soldiers in 1960 , its arms cache was a central issue right from the start .
the west responded to nuclear armament in the east by developing its own nuclear arsenal .
however , chancellor adenauer 's government had committed itself to neither produce nor acquire its own nuclear weapons .
the solution was for the bundeswehr to get carriers , while the americans administered the nuclear warheads that went on them . " fight nuclear death " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz-josef strauß " we do n't want the bundeswehr equipped as a german army with tactical nuclear weapons , " then-defense minister franz-josef strauß explained .
" we want nothing more and nothing less than nato 's entire defense planning requires , which envisions for every nation from canada to turkey particular duties so that it 's acceptable for the individual -lrb- state -rrb- , so that it 's affordable for the individual -lrb- state -rrb- and so that collective security keeps the aggressor at bay . " large parts of the population and of the officers ' corps rejected strauß 's plans .
over a million germans took to the streets with the slogan " fight nuclear death . "
but in the end , the government prevailed .
in march 1958 , the bundestag , west germany 's lower house of parliament , decided after four days of debate to equip the bundeswehr with carriers for nuclear weapons .
german pilots from then on were trained to drop nuclear bombs over germany and destroy their homes in case of emergency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans mobilized in masses to protest nuclear weapons being stationed in west germany but that did n't put an end to the conflict over the german armed forces ' nuclear armament .
in the 1980s , the government allowed nuclear missiles to be stationed in the country in accordance with the nato " double-track " decision despite great resistance from the people . " there were massive differences in the army over the nuclear issue , " kutz said .
" then , more than half of the staff officers disagreed with it -lrb- stationing nuclear weapons in germany -rrb- .
of course , in the end they were fended off , but is very clear that in those days the bundeswehr was more pluralistic than today . " when the berlin wall fell , around half a million men in west germany were in the armed forces .
after german unification in 1990 , the east german armed forces , the nva , was dissolved and a portion of its soldiers integrated into the bundeswehr .
shortly thereafter , the restructuring of the armed forces began and which still continues to this day . the bundeswehr was not only too big and cumbersome , but it also needed a new orientation after the collapse of the " enemy from the east . "
defending germany on foreign soil the bundeswehr 's classic duties of national defense now faced new threats - above all from terrorism . for the first time , the bundeswehr started taking part in un-mandated peace missions , although germany 's constitution only envisages its deployment for defensive purposes - that is , in the case of an attack on the country .
the german constitutional court cleared the legal fog in 1994 when bundeswehr soldiers participated in the un peacekeeping mission in somalia .
in 1999 , german soldiers were deployed for combat for the first time when nato bombed serbia during the kosovo war - a crucial test for the green party , the junior partner in the governing coalition with the social democrats .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers now take part in un and nato peacekeeping missions as a result , foreign deployments - every one of which must be approved by the bundestag - finally were accepted as a political reality .
the bundestag gave its blessing to the initially controversial afghanistan deployment after sept .
11 attacks as well . up to 10,000 german soldiers , including special forces , have been temporarily stationed abroad . half a century after the bundeswehr 's foundation , outgoing defense minister peter struck , who was instrumental in advancing reform , summed up the development of germany 's armed forces : " i will surely go down in history with the sentence : germany is also defended on the hindu kush .

the fact that the bundeswehr could n't possibly get by without experienced wehrmacht officers only increased people 's mistrust . away from slavish obedience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on nov .
12 , 1955 , west germany swore in its army 's first recruits , in bonn the military leadership focused on the new concept of " internal leadership " in developing the bundeswehr .
the idea was that soldiers should be " citizens in uniform " and that slavish obedience and brutal regiments would be a thing of the past . but in the beginning that was easier said than done : in 1957 , the same year that conscription was introduced , 15 recruits died after being ordered to cross the iller river without proper safety measures being taken .
elsewhere too , excessively tough training methods were part of the daily grind . sociologist martin kutz said that it took long before the idea of " internal leadership " found acceptance among the soldiers . " ' internal leadership was brought into the bundeswehr by the younger generation in the mid-60s , " kutz said .
" it has to do with the fact that the bundeswehr had an enormous shortage of young people and took whoever they could get .
thus , young people of the simplest means joined the army and caused a break in tradition that the old -lrb- military -rrb- families had -lrb- previously -rrb- prevented . " in addition to the special circumstances within the bundeswehr , which had 270,000 soldiers in 1960 , its arms cache was a central issue right from the start .
the west responded to nuclear armament in the east by developing its own nuclear arsenal .
however , chancellor adenauer 's government had committed itself to neither produce nor acquire its own nuclear weapons .
the solution was for the bundeswehr to get carriers , while the americans administered the nuclear warheads that went on them . " fight nuclear death " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz-josef strauß " we do n't want the bundeswehr equipped as a german army with tactical nuclear weapons , " then-defense minister franz-josef strauß explained .
" we want nothing more and nothing less than nato 's entire defense planning requires , which envisions for every nation from canada to turkey particular duties so that it 's acceptable for the individual -lrb- state -rrb- , so that it 's affordable for the individual -lrb- state -rrb- and so that collective security keeps the aggressor at bay . " large parts of the population and of the officers ' corps rejected strauß 's plans .
over a million germans took to the streets with the slogan " fight nuclear death . "
but in the end , the government prevailed .
in march 1958 , the bundestag , west germany 's lower house of parliament , decided after four days of debate to equip the bundeswehr with carriers for nuclear weapons .
german pilots from then on were trained to drop nuclear bombs over germany and destroy their homes in case of emergency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans mobilized in masses to protest nuclear weapons being stationed in west germany but that did n't put an end to the conflict over the german armed forces ' nuclear armament .
in the 1980s , the government allowed nuclear missiles to be stationed in the country in accordance with the nato " double-track " decision despite great resistance from the people . " there were massive differences in the army over the nuclear issue , " kutz said .
" then , more than half of the staff officers disagreed with it -lrb- stationing nuclear weapons in germany -rrb- .
of course , in the end they were fended off , but is very clear that in those days the bundeswehr was more pluralistic than today . " when the berlin wall fell , around half a million men in west germany were in the armed forces .
after german unification in 1990 , the east german armed forces , the nva , was dissolved and a portion of its soldiers integrated into the bundeswehr .
shortly thereafter , the restructuring of the armed forces began and which still continues to this day . the bundeswehr was not only too big and cumbersome , but it also needed a new orientation after the collapse of the " enemy from the east . "
defending germany on foreign soil the bundeswehr 's classic duties of national defense now faced new threats - above all from terrorism . for the first time , the bundeswehr started taking part in un-mandated peace missions , although germany 's constitution only envisages its deployment for defensive purposes - that is , in the case of an attack on the country .
the german constitutional court cleared the legal fog in 1994 when bundeswehr soldiers participated in the un peacekeeping mission in somalia .
in 1999 , german soldiers were deployed for combat for the first time when nato bombed serbia during the kosovo war - a crucial test for the green party , the junior partner in the governing coalition with the social democrats .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers now take part in un and nato peacekeeping missions as a result , foreign deployments - every one of which must be approved by the bundestag - finally were accepted as a political reality .
the bundestag gave its blessing to the initially controversial afghanistan deployment after sept .
11 attacks as well . up to 10,000 german soldiers , including special forces , have been temporarily stationed abroad . half a century after the bundeswehr 's foundation , outgoing defense minister peter struck , who was instrumental in advancing reform , summed up the development of germany 's armed forces : " i will surely go down in history with the sentence : germany is also defended on the hindu kush .
and with the other sentence : the bundeswehr 's operational area is the whole world .

not only adults are affected ; in germany , 36 percent of seven-year-old boys are significantly overweight as are 30 percent of seven-year-old girls . the medical effects are alarming : high blood pressure and type-two diabetes are phenomena that people under 40 generally do n't have to be concerned about .

while kids do n't necessarily eat more than they did in the past , what has changed is that nowadays people in the west hardly walk anywhere . today 's sedentary lifestyles start at a young age .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the road to the chancellery opinion : germany 's new opposition the crunch issues schröder confirms exit ; slams bush the chancellor vote explained germany -pipe- 12.11.2005 experts say merkel will bring change in style , not policy for us großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's always favored close relations with the us germany finally has a coalition deal , paving the way for angela merkel to become chancellor .
experts say foreign policy under her will lead to warmer ties with the us , but it wo n't translate into major policy changes . germany 's conservatives led by angela merkel and the social democrats agreed on the second so-called " grand coalition " in germany 's postwar history on friday . the move paves the way for 51-year-old angela merkel , a former scientist who grew up in the communist former east germany , to become germany 's first female chancellor .
she is expected to be sworn in later this month provided separate party conferences on monday endorse the coalition deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's rival politicians have forged a power-sharing deal on friday , merkel was optimistic that the new grand coalition would work for germany .
" i think that this can be a coalition of new possibilities , " merkel said , adding it offered germany " a real chance " to pull itself out of its ongoing economic crisis . the new government 's power-sharing agreement broadly outlines reform measures aimed at reviving the stagnant german economy , slashing mounting public deficit and tackling the chronically high unemployment rate . " change in style and rhetoric " analysts however are n't expecting significant change on the foreign policy front .
they do however admit that german relations with the us will be become warmer given that merkel 's conservatives are overwhelmingly in favor of closer transatlantic ties and repairing the damage inflicted upon it by chancellor schröder 's government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush , left , and merkel in mainz in germany " i think the big change you 're going see is one in style and rhetoric , " karen donfried , senior director of the german marshall fund in washington . " it will be very different under angela merkel , " she said .
" the role of the central east europeans will be more prominent and central east europeans are very close us allies . " reform drive crucial for better ties with us jackson james , executive director of the american institute for contemporary german studies , said transatlantic relations under the new government hinge on whether merkel can make headway on the domestic front with critical economic reforms . " the success of germany 's reforms will have important implications for europe and the united states , " james told a congressional hearing this week on the german elections and their implications for us-german ties . " the ability of germany to meet its foreign policy responsibilities in terms of defense allocations , its presence in regional hot spots like the balkans and the middle east , and its role in the international financial institutions will depend on achieving a sustainable level of economic growth . " thomas kleine brockhoff , washington bureau chief of the german newsweekly die zeit , summed up merkel 's foreign policy agenda saying it would include " less france and more united states , less russia and more poland , no eu-membership for turkey . " analysts , however , noted that though merkel is opposed to turkey joining the european union , there was no indication that she would stand in the way of the 10 to 15 year negotiating process , by which time she is not expected to still be chancellor . german public opinion a hurdle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans demonstrate against the us-led iraq war in 2003 in berlin they added that however much merkel may wish to improve ties with washington , one inescapable constraint will be german public opinion , which is fiercely opposed to the bush administration and its international policies . " given the unambiguous , negative view among the german public of us foreign policy and the merkel government 's need to have domestic backing for its economic and social reforms , it is difficult to see the new chancellor blazing new foreign policy paths together with washington , " donfried , who also testified this week before the committee on international relations in the us house of representatives , said . " if merkel closes the gap between the rhetoric and the policy , i think it would restore some of the trust between berlin and washington and that then probably might lead over into public opinion , " she added . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new government program comes under attack incoming chancellor angela merkel called saturday for germans to make sacrifices to help put their struggling economy back on track , but her future government 's policies are already under fire .

they sound like the plot elements of a thriller , but the allegations that have been flying around volkswagen headquarters in wolfsburg in recent months are very real . volkswagen hired auditing firm kpmg to scrutinize company procedures on the first of july , three days after it asked german prosecutors to investigate two former human resources executives for fraud . it was alleged helmuth schuster and klaus-joachim gebauer had set up shell companies in a number of countries , including india and the czech republic , to win business from the carmaker . sleaze and bribery members of the company ’ s works council were allegedly ‘ bought ’ , while personnel managers , on the other hand , made deals that weren ’ t in the interest of the company , incurring losses worth millions of euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vw logo which has stood for sturdy quality is now tarnished but , the most sensational element of the volkswagen scandal story is the allegation that the company ’ s board sent members of the works council on expensive sex holidays .

they sound like the plot elements of a thriller , but the allegations that have been flying around volkswagen headquarters in wolfsburg in recent months are very real . volkswagen hired auditing firm kpmg to scrutinize company procedures on the first of july , three days after it asked german prosecutors to investigate two former human resources executives for fraud . it was alleged helmuth schuster and klaus-joachim gebauer had set up shell companies in a number of countries , including india and the czech republic , to win business from the carmaker . sleaze and bribery members of the company ’ s works council were allegedly ‘ bought ’ , while personnel managers , on the other hand , made deals that weren ’ t in the interest of the company , incurring losses worth millions of euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vw logo which has stood for sturdy quality is now tarnished but , the most sensational element of the volkswagen scandal story is the allegation that the company ’ s board sent members of the works council on expensive sex holidays .
in return , works council members rubber-stamped board resolutions .
the procedure saw unconfirmed expense claims of up to 30,000 euros approved . the volkswagen scandal became public after a network of letter-box companies was uncovered .
it ’ s alleged helmuth schuster , the former personnel chief of vw-subsidiary skoda , used the companies as a front to channel funds into his own pockets . an indian state government also accuses schuster of demanding two million euros in kickbacks in exchange for his promise that volkswagen would build a plant in their region . wrongdoing right up to top rungs it wasn ’ t long before investigations into the network of front companies turned up another name : klaus-joachim gebauer , volkswagen ’ s former personnel manager .
it ’ s alleged he organized several sex parties that later came to haunt several members of the works council . " some of the things that have been said are true , " gebauer said .
" the one thing i regret is that , through other people , i got into a situation i don ’ t want to be in . " but the scandal doesn ’ t end there .
even the long-serving and influential head of the works council , klaus volkert , has caught the eye of prosecutors . but volkert maintains fraud allegations are unfounded . " the short version is : i ’ m not aware of any wrongdoing .
i have no idea why i have the ‘ honor ’ of being subject to this media witch-hunt , " volkert said . hartz resignation trade union officials say the scandal is partly a conspiracy to weaken employee representation at volkswagen .
they argue that a strong works council and union have long been a thorn in the side of volkswagen ’ s top management . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beleagured vw manager peter hartz stepped down recently fraud allegations also led to recent resignation of human resources executive peter hartz .
for years hartz stood as one of the supporting pillars of the so-called “ vw-system ” of close cooperation between top management and employee representatives . he “ invented ” of the four-day-week - cutting working hours without compensatory wage increases - and even had national labor market reforms named after him , before he had to admit he ’ d made mistakes at volkswagen by not keeping tight enough control of his employees . vw moves to stem damage all in all , the kpmg report estimates the scandal has cost volkswagen a total of five million euros , although further investigations could see that figure rise . as the initial fallout of the scandal settles , chief executive bernd pischetsrieder says he ’ s taking steps to make volkswagen a ‘ more transparent company internally and externally ’ . under a new ombudsman system , volkswagen will assign two lawyers to deal with allegations throughout the corporation .
company employees will then be able to give them anonymous tips on corrupt activities . top management at wolfsburg say they want investigators to get to the bottom of the scandal . it ’ s a call echoed by the premier of the of lower saxony christian wulff .
his federal state is volkswagen ’ s largest shareholder . " those guilty of wrongdoing will have to clear their desks and accept responsibility for what they did , ” wulff said . “ then we ’ ll put systems in place to ensure this can never be repeated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst neumann faces a challenging time at vw volkswagen announced on friday that horst neumann has been named to replace hartz . neumann , who currently oversees human resources as a board member at volkswagen ’ s subsidiary audi , will start his new job on december 1 . monika lohmüller -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany rocked by damning report on un scandal news of the involvement of leading german companies in kickbacks to saddam hussein 's regime during the un oil-for-food program has stunned germany and prompted calls for speedy legal action .

germany won the game 4-0 and improved their chances at going to the 2007 world cup in china . five months after claiming the european championship the german national team 's clear win over switzerland saturday evening put germany on top of their qualification group ahead of russia . germany head coach silvia neid 's team dominated the game in front of 15 , 637 fans in ulm , and put the defensive-minded swiss under pressure quickly , starting their shower of goals after just 10 minutes . quick , aggressive german style " i wanted us to score a goal in the first minutes , and we did , " neid said after the match .
" in the first half we played well and created a lot of chances .

it was originally formed to facilitate war-torn germany 's integration into the west .
today , the bundeswehr maintains the peace in hot spots around the world . germany 's armed forces will formally conclude the ongoing celebrations to mark 50 years of its existence on saturday .
nov 12 is a special day for the army because on that day 50 years ago , the first voluntary recruits of the bundeswehr received their certificates in barracks in bonn . only 10 years after the end of world war ii , in 1955 west germany 's army , the bundeswehr took shape . chancellor konrad adenauer wanted the country 's own armed forces to contribute to the federal republic 's integration into western structures . during the cold war , the western allied attitude towards re-establishment of german armed forces changed quickly since germany was located directly on the dividing line between the two blocs . west germany was expected to be able to make its own contribution to defending its territory .
but a return of the " wehrmacht , " the name the german army was known by under hitler , was out of the question .
west germany 's new constitution ensured that there would never be a return to the times when the army was a state within the state . even so , parliament was made responsible for keeping the bundeswehr on a short leash and the army was closely integrated into nato .
still , the social democratic opposition as well as a large part of the population objected to rearmament .
the fact that the bundeswehr could n't possibly get by without experienced wehrmacht officers only increased people 's mistrust . away from slavish obedience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on nov .
12 , 1955 , west germany swore in its army 's first recruits , in bonn the military leadership focused on the new concept of " internal leadership " in developing the bundeswehr .
the idea was that soldiers should be " citizens in uniform " and that slavish obedience and brutal regiments would be a thing of the past . but in the beginning that was easier said than done : in 1957 , the same year that conscription was introduced , 15 recruits died after being ordered to cross the iller river without proper safety measures being taken .
elsewhere too , excessively tough training methods were part of the daily grind . sociologist martin kutz said that it took long before the idea of " internal leadership " found acceptance among the soldiers . " ' internal leadership was brought into the bundeswehr by the younger generation in the mid-60s , " kutz said .
" it has to do with the fact that the bundeswehr had an enormous shortage of young people and took whoever they could get .
thus , young people of the simplest means joined the army and caused a break in tradition that the old -lrb- military -rrb- families had -lrb- previously -rrb- prevented . " in addition to the special circumstances within the bundeswehr , which had 270,000 soldiers in 1960 , its arms cache was a central issue right from the start .
the west responded to nuclear armament in the east by developing its own nuclear arsenal .
however , chancellor adenauer 's government had committed itself to neither produce nor acquire its own nuclear weapons .
the solution was for the bundeswehr to get carriers , while the americans administered the nuclear warheads that went on them . " fight nuclear death " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz-josef strauß " we do n't want the bundeswehr equipped as a german army with tactical nuclear weapons , " then-defense minister franz-josef strauß explained .
" we want nothing more and nothing less than nato 's entire defense planning requires , which envisions for every nation from canada to turkey particular duties so that it 's acceptable for the individual -lrb- state -rrb- , so that it 's affordable for the individual -lrb- state -rrb- and so that collective security keeps the aggressor at bay . " large parts of the population and of the officers ' corps rejected strauß 's plans .
over a million germans took to the streets with the slogan " fight nuclear death . "
but in the end , the government prevailed .
in march 1958 , the bundestag , west germany 's lower house of parliament , decided after four days of debate to equip the bundeswehr with carriers for nuclear weapons .
german pilots from then on were trained to drop nuclear bombs over germany and destroy their homes in case of emergency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans mobilized in masses to protest nuclear weapons being stationed in west germany but that did n't put an end to the conflict over the german armed forces ' nuclear armament .
in the 1980s , the government allowed nuclear missiles to be stationed in the country in accordance with the nato " double-track " decision despite great resistance from the people . " there were massive differences in the army over the nuclear issue , " kutz said .
" then , more than half of the staff officers disagreed with it -lrb- stationing nuclear weapons in germany -rrb- .
of course , in the end they were fended off , but is very clear that in those days the bundeswehr was more pluralistic than today . " when the berlin wall fell , around half a million men in west germany were in the armed forces .
after german unification in 1990 , the east german armed forces , the nva , was dissolved and a portion of its soldiers integrated into the bundeswehr .
shortly thereafter , the restructuring of the armed forces began and which still continues to this day . the bundeswehr was not only too big and cumbersome , but it also needed a new orientation after the collapse of the " enemy from the east . "
defending germany on foreign soil the bundeswehr 's classic duties of national defense now faced new threats - above all from terrorism . for the first time , the bundeswehr started taking part in un-mandated peace missions , although germany 's constitution only envisages its deployment for defensive purposes - that is , in the case of an attack on the country .
the german constitutional court cleared the legal fog in 1994 when bundeswehr soldiers participated in the un peacekeeping mission in somalia .
in 1999 , german soldiers were deployed for combat for the first time when nato bombed serbia during the kosovo war - a crucial test for the green party , the junior partner in the governing coalition with the social democrats .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers now take part in un and nato peacekeeping missions as a result , foreign deployments - every one of which must be approved by the bundestag - finally were accepted as a political reality .
the bundestag gave its blessing to the initially controversial afghanistan deployment after sept .
11 attacks as well . up to 10,000 german soldiers , including special forces , have been temporarily stationed abroad . half a century after the bundeswehr 's foundation , outgoing defense minister peter struck , who was instrumental in advancing reform , summed up the development of germany 's armed forces : " i will surely go down in history with the sentence : germany is also defended on the hindu kush .

nov 12 is a special day for the army because on that day 50 years ago , the first voluntary recruits of the bundeswehr received their certificates in barracks in bonn . only 10 years after the end of world war ii , in 1955 west germany 's army , the bundeswehr took shape . chancellor konrad adenauer wanted the country 's own armed forces to contribute to the federal republic 's integration into western structures . during the cold war , the western allied attitude towards re-establishment of german armed forces changed quickly since germany was located directly on the dividing line between the two blocs . west germany was expected to be able to make its own contribution to defending its territory .
but a return of the " wehrmacht , " the name the german army was known by under hitler , was out of the question .
west germany 's new constitution ensured that there would never be a return to the times when the army was a state within the state . even so , parliament was made responsible for keeping the bundeswehr on a short leash and the army was closely integrated into nato .
still , the social democratic opposition as well as a large part of the population objected to rearmament .
the fact that the bundeswehr could n't possibly get by without experienced wehrmacht officers only increased people 's mistrust . away from slavish obedience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on nov .
12 , 1955 , west germany swore in its army 's first recruits , in bonn the military leadership focused on the new concept of " internal leadership " in developing the bundeswehr .
the idea was that soldiers should be " citizens in uniform " and that slavish obedience and brutal regiments would be a thing of the past . but in the beginning that was easier said than done : in 1957 , the same year that conscription was introduced , 15 recruits died after being ordered to cross the iller river without proper safety measures being taken .
elsewhere too , excessively tough training methods were part of the daily grind . sociologist martin kutz said that it took long before the idea of " internal leadership " found acceptance among the soldiers . " ' internal leadership was brought into the bundeswehr by the younger generation in the mid-60s , " kutz said .
" it has to do with the fact that the bundeswehr had an enormous shortage of young people and took whoever they could get .
thus , young people of the simplest means joined the army and caused a break in tradition that the old -lrb- military -rrb- families had -lrb- previously -rrb- prevented . " in addition to the special circumstances within the bundeswehr , which had 270,000 soldiers in 1960 , its arms cache was a central issue right from the start .
the west responded to nuclear armament in the east by developing its own nuclear arsenal .
however , chancellor adenauer 's government had committed itself to neither produce nor acquire its own nuclear weapons .
the solution was for the bundeswehr to get carriers , while the americans administered the nuclear warheads that went on them . " fight nuclear death " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz-josef strauß " we do n't want the bundeswehr equipped as a german army with tactical nuclear weapons , " then-defense minister franz-josef strauß explained .
" we want nothing more and nothing less than nato 's entire defense planning requires , which envisions for every nation from canada to turkey particular duties so that it 's acceptable for the individual -lrb- state -rrb- , so that it 's affordable for the individual -lrb- state -rrb- and so that collective security keeps the aggressor at bay . " large parts of the population and of the officers ' corps rejected strauß 's plans .
over a million germans took to the streets with the slogan " fight nuclear death . "
but in the end , the government prevailed .
in march 1958 , the bundestag , west germany 's lower house of parliament , decided after four days of debate to equip the bundeswehr with carriers for nuclear weapons .
german pilots from then on were trained to drop nuclear bombs over germany and destroy their homes in case of emergency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans mobilized in masses to protest nuclear weapons being stationed in west germany but that did n't put an end to the conflict over the german armed forces ' nuclear armament .
in the 1980s , the government allowed nuclear missiles to be stationed in the country in accordance with the nato " double-track " decision despite great resistance from the people . " there were massive differences in the army over the nuclear issue , " kutz said .
" then , more than half of the staff officers disagreed with it -lrb- stationing nuclear weapons in germany -rrb- .
of course , in the end they were fended off , but is very clear that in those days the bundeswehr was more pluralistic than today . " when the berlin wall fell , around half a million men in west germany were in the armed forces .
after german unification in 1990 , the east german armed forces , the nva , was dissolved and a portion of its soldiers integrated into the bundeswehr .
shortly thereafter , the restructuring of the armed forces began and which still continues to this day . the bundeswehr was not only too big and cumbersome , but it also needed a new orientation after the collapse of the " enemy from the east . "
defending germany on foreign soil the bundeswehr 's classic duties of national defense now faced new threats - above all from terrorism . for the first time , the bundeswehr started taking part in un-mandated peace missions , although germany 's constitution only envisages its deployment for defensive purposes - that is , in the case of an attack on the country .
the german constitutional court cleared the legal fog in 1994 when bundeswehr soldiers participated in the un peacekeeping mission in somalia .
in 1999 , german soldiers were deployed for combat for the first time when nato bombed serbia during the kosovo war - a crucial test for the green party , the junior partner in the governing coalition with the social democrats .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers now take part in un and nato peacekeeping missions as a result , foreign deployments - every one of which must be approved by the bundestag - finally were accepted as a political reality .
the bundestag gave its blessing to the initially controversial afghanistan deployment after sept .

experts say foreign policy under her will lead to warmer ties with the us , but it wo n't translate into major policy changes . germany 's conservatives led by angela merkel and the social democrats agreed on the second so-called " grand coalition " in germany 's postwar history on friday . the move paves the way for 51-year-old angela merkel , a former scientist who grew up in the communist former east germany , to become germany 's first female chancellor .
she is expected to be sworn in later this month provided separate party conferences on monday endorse the coalition deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's rival politicians have forged a power-sharing deal on friday , merkel was optimistic that the new grand coalition would work for germany .
" i think that this can be a coalition of new possibilities , " merkel said , adding it offered germany " a real chance " to pull itself out of its ongoing economic crisis . the new government 's power-sharing agreement broadly outlines reform measures aimed at reviving the stagnant german economy , slashing mounting public deficit and tackling the chronically high unemployment rate . " change in style and rhetoric " analysts however are n't expecting significant change on the foreign policy front .
they do however admit that german relations with the us will be become warmer given that merkel 's conservatives are overwhelmingly in favor of closer transatlantic ties and repairing the damage inflicted upon it by chancellor schröder 's government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush , left , and merkel in mainz in germany " i think the big change you 're going see is one in style and rhetoric , " karen donfried , senior director of the german marshall fund in washington . " it will be very different under angela merkel , " she said .
" the role of the central east europeans will be more prominent and central east europeans are very close us allies . " reform drive crucial for better ties with us jackson james , executive director of the american institute for contemporary german studies , said transatlantic relations under the new government hinge on whether merkel can make headway on the domestic front with critical economic reforms . " the success of germany 's reforms will have important implications for europe and the united states , " james told a congressional hearing this week on the german elections and their implications for us-german ties . " the ability of germany to meet its foreign policy responsibilities in terms of defense allocations , its presence in regional hot spots like the balkans and the middle east , and its role in the international financial institutions will depend on achieving a sustainable level of economic growth . " thomas kleine brockhoff , washington bureau chief of the german newsweekly die zeit , summed up merkel 's foreign policy agenda saying it would include " less france and more united states , less russia and more poland , no eu-membership for turkey . " analysts , however , noted that though merkel is opposed to turkey joining the european union , there was no indication that she would stand in the way of the 10 to 15 year negotiating process , by which time she is not expected to still be chancellor . german public opinion a hurdle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans demonstrate against the us-led iraq war in 2003 in berlin they added that however much merkel may wish to improve ties with washington , one inescapable constraint will be german public opinion , which is fiercely opposed to the bush administration and its international policies . " given the unambiguous , negative view among the german public of us foreign policy and the merkel government 's need to have domestic backing for its economic and social reforms , it is difficult to see the new chancellor blazing new foreign policy paths together with washington , " donfried , who also testified this week before the committee on international relations in the us house of representatives , said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.11.2005 walking bus gets kids moving - and thinking großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walking to school is good for kids ' minds and bodies concerned at the growing ranks of obese children , a sports professor has come up with an unusual solution to prevent tubbiness .
in the german town of paderborn , primary school kids take the " walking bus " to class . obesity has reached the dimensions of a global epidemic , according to the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- .
not only adults are affected ; in germany , 36 percent of seven-year-old boys are significantly overweight as are 30 percent of seven-year-old girls . the medical effects are alarming : high blood pressure and type-two diabetes are phenomena that people under 40 generally do n't have to be concerned about .
but ever more children are being diagnosed with these maladies .
while kids do n't necessarily eat more than they did in the past , what has changed is that nowadays people in the west hardly walk anywhere . today 's sedentary lifestyles start at a young age .
traffic jams develop in front of primary schools on a regular basis , says wolf-dietrich brettschneider , who lives near one .
but there at least , the morning congestion has come to an end .
brettschneider and co-worker christoph malek have established the first german " walking bus " at the margarethenschule in paderborn . bus without wheels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reflective vests ensure that car drivers see the walking bus each morning , two kilometers -lrb- one mile -rrb- away from the school , the bus starts up .
students are collected at three bus stops and again dropped off after class .
the difference is that this bus is not an actual bus , not a vehicle .
the " bus " is a group of walkers .
adult volunteers accompany the children and make sure they make it safely to school .
that reassures parents who are used to driving their kids to class - whether for safety 's sake or to save time . aside from encouraging mobility , local police traffic safety advisor norbert meier is convinced that the walking bus has other benefits . " children come into contact with the reality of traffic earlier than if they 're always put in a car , " he said , adding that it helps kids learn independence and traffic safety rules faster . " our aim is for children to see movement as a something routine , " said head teacher helga berling .
her charges are keen on the walking bus , too , including many who have to go out of their way to get to one of the bus stops .
the route takes them through quiet neighborhood streets where they 're exposed to fewer exhaust fumes than on the more main road leading to the school . " it 's that much nicer , " said 8-year-old mara .
" then you can talk longer with your girlfriends . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids taking the walking bus are more alert when they get to class that too is one of the benefits of the walking bus .
" when kids walk to school they are more relaxed when they arrive in class , " explained brettschneider .
" they 've talked among themselves and also gotten lots of fresh air .
their ability to concentrate and learn is better . " beyond school so far , that seems to be the case .
" the children are more awake in any case , " said berlin after having observed the project for several months . ideally , the walking bus should motivate kids to be more physically active in their free time too .
in order to check whether that is the case , christoph malek plans to start a study in late november to observe the behavior and concentration levels of walking bus participants over a period of months . sixty german schools have already contacted brettschneider 's team about the walking bus .
three have gotten the idea going so far and five more aim to have it up and running by the end of the year .
the idea has also attracted interest from abroad , which is why brettschneider and malek will present the walking bus project at an international conference on the role of education and sports in lisbon in mid-november . johanna tüntsch -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us and germany fight battle of the bulge as the number of german children getting fatter increases , german officials are looking for ways to combat this trend and turning to americans for assistance .

in the german town of paderborn , primary school kids take the " walking bus " to class . obesity has reached the dimensions of a global epidemic , according to the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- .
not only adults are affected ; in germany , 36 percent of seven-year-old boys are significantly overweight as are 30 percent of seven-year-old girls . the medical effects are alarming : high blood pressure and type-two diabetes are phenomena that people under 40 generally do n't have to be concerned about .
but ever more children are being diagnosed with these maladies .
while kids do n't necessarily eat more than they did in the past , what has changed is that nowadays people in the west hardly walk anywhere . today 's sedentary lifestyles start at a young age .
traffic jams develop in front of primary schools on a regular basis , says wolf-dietrich brettschneider , who lives near one .
but there at least , the morning congestion has come to an end .
brettschneider and co-worker christoph malek have established the first german " walking bus " at the margarethenschule in paderborn . bus without wheels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reflective vests ensure that car drivers see the walking bus each morning , two kilometers -lrb- one mile -rrb- away from the school , the bus starts up .
students are collected at three bus stops and again dropped off after class .
the difference is that this bus is not an actual bus , not a vehicle .
the " bus " is a group of walkers .
adult volunteers accompany the children and make sure they make it safely to school .
that reassures parents who are used to driving their kids to class - whether for safety 's sake or to save time . aside from encouraging mobility , local police traffic safety advisor norbert meier is convinced that the walking bus has other benefits . " children come into contact with the reality of traffic earlier than if they 're always put in a car , " he said , adding that it helps kids learn independence and traffic safety rules faster . " our aim is for children to see movement as a something routine , " said head teacher helga berling .
her charges are keen on the walking bus , too , including many who have to go out of their way to get to one of the bus stops .
the route takes them through quiet neighborhood streets where they 're exposed to fewer exhaust fumes than on the more main road leading to the school . " it 's that much nicer , " said 8-year-old mara .
" then you can talk longer with your girlfriends . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids taking the walking bus are more alert when they get to class that too is one of the benefits of the walking bus .
" when kids walk to school they are more relaxed when they arrive in class , " explained brettschneider .
" they 've talked among themselves and also gotten lots of fresh air .
their ability to concentrate and learn is better . " beyond school so far , that seems to be the case .
" the children are more awake in any case , " said berlin after having observed the project for several months . ideally , the walking bus should motivate kids to be more physically active in their free time too .
in order to check whether that is the case , christoph malek plans to start a study in late november to observe the behavior and concentration levels of walking bus participants over a period of months . sixty german schools have already contacted brettschneider 's team about the walking bus .
three have gotten the idea going so far and five more aim to have it up and running by the end of the year .
the idea has also attracted interest from abroad , which is why brettschneider and malek will present the walking bus project at an international conference on the role of education and sports in lisbon in mid-november . johanna tüntsch -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us and germany fight battle of the bulge as the number of german children getting fatter increases , german officials are looking for ways to combat this trend and turning to americans for assistance .

the route takes them through quiet neighborhood streets where they 're exposed to fewer exhaust fumes than on the more main road leading to the school . " it 's that much nicer , " said 8-year-old mara .
" then you can talk longer with your girlfriends . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids taking the walking bus are more alert when they get to class that too is one of the benefits of the walking bus .
" when kids walk to school they are more relaxed when they arrive in class , " explained brettschneider .
" they 've talked among themselves and also gotten lots of fresh air .
their ability to concentrate and learn is better . " beyond school so far , that seems to be the case .
" the children are more awake in any case , " said berlin after having observed the project for several months . ideally , the walking bus should motivate kids to be more physically active in their free time too .
in order to check whether that is the case , christoph malek plans to start a study in late november to observe the behavior and concentration levels of walking bus participants over a period of months . sixty german schools have already contacted brettschneider 's team about the walking bus .
three have gotten the idea going so far and five more aim to have it up and running by the end of the year .
the idea has also attracted interest from abroad , which is why brettschneider and malek will present the walking bus project at an international conference on the role of education and sports in lisbon in mid-november . johanna tüntsch -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us and germany fight battle of the bulge as the number of german children getting fatter increases , german officials are looking for ways to combat this trend and turning to americans for assistance .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.11.2005 walking bus gets kids moving - and thinking großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walking to school is good for kids ' minds and bodies concerned at the growing ranks of obese children , a sports professor has come up with an unusual solution to prevent tubbiness .
in the german town of paderborn , primary school kids take the " walking bus " to class . obesity has reached the dimensions of a global epidemic , according to the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- .
not only adults are affected ; in germany , 36 percent of seven-year-old boys are significantly overweight as are 30 percent of seven-year-old girls . the medical effects are alarming : high blood pressure and type-two diabetes are phenomena that people under 40 generally do n't have to be concerned about .
but ever more children are being diagnosed with these maladies .
while kids do n't necessarily eat more than they did in the past , what has changed is that nowadays people in the west hardly walk anywhere . today 's sedentary lifestyles start at a young age .
traffic jams develop in front of primary schools on a regular basis , says wolf-dietrich brettschneider , who lives near one .
but there at least , the morning congestion has come to an end .
brettschneider and co-worker christoph malek have established the first german " walking bus " at the margarethenschule in paderborn . bus without wheels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reflective vests ensure that car drivers see the walking bus each morning , two kilometers -lrb- one mile -rrb- away from the school , the bus starts up .
students are collected at three bus stops and again dropped off after class .
the difference is that this bus is not an actual bus , not a vehicle .
the " bus " is a group of walkers .
adult volunteers accompany the children and make sure they make it safely to school .
that reassures parents who are used to driving their kids to class - whether for safety 's sake or to save time . aside from encouraging mobility , local police traffic safety advisor norbert meier is convinced that the walking bus has other benefits . " children come into contact with the reality of traffic earlier than if they 're always put in a car , " he said , adding that it helps kids learn independence and traffic safety rules faster . " our aim is for children to see movement as a something routine , " said head teacher helga berling .
her charges are keen on the walking bus , too , including many who have to go out of their way to get to one of the bus stops .
the route takes them through quiet neighborhood streets where they 're exposed to fewer exhaust fumes than on the more main road leading to the school . " it 's that much nicer , " said 8-year-old mara .
" then you can talk longer with your girlfriends . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids taking the walking bus are more alert when they get to class that too is one of the benefits of the walking bus .
" when kids walk to school they are more relaxed when they arrive in class , " explained brettschneider .
" they 've talked among themselves and also gotten lots of fresh air .
their ability to concentrate and learn is better . " beyond school so far , that seems to be the case .
" the children are more awake in any case , " said berlin after having observed the project for several months . ideally , the walking bus should motivate kids to be more physically active in their free time too .
in order to check whether that is the case , christoph malek plans to start a study in late november to observe the behavior and concentration levels of walking bus participants over a period of months . sixty german schools have already contacted brettschneider 's team about the walking bus .
three have gotten the idea going so far and five more aim to have it up and running by the end of the year .
the idea has also attracted interest from abroad , which is why brettschneider and malek will present the walking bus project at an international conference on the role of education and sports in lisbon in mid-november . johanna tüntsch -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us and germany fight battle of the bulge as the number of german children getting fatter increases , german officials are looking for ways to combat this trend and turning to americans for assistance .

it was originally formed to facilitate war-torn germany 's integration into the west .
today , the bundeswehr maintains the peace in hot spots around the world . germany 's armed forces will formally conclude the ongoing celebrations to mark 50 years of its existence on saturday .
nov 12 is a special day for the army because on that day 50 years ago , the first voluntary recruits of the bundeswehr received their certificates in barracks in bonn . only 10 years after the end of world war ii , in 1955 west germany 's army , the bundeswehr took shape . chancellor konrad adenauer wanted the country 's own armed forces to contribute to the federal republic 's integration into western structures . during the cold war , the western allied attitude towards re-establishment of german armed forces changed quickly since germany was located directly on the dividing line between the two blocs . west germany was expected to be able to make its own contribution to defending its territory .
but a return of the " wehrmacht , " the name the german army was known by under hitler , was out of the question .
west germany 's new constitution ensured that there would never be a return to the times when the army was a state within the state . even so , parliament was made responsible for keeping the bundeswehr on a short leash and the army was closely integrated into nato .
still , the social democratic opposition as well as a large part of the population objected to rearmament .
the fact that the bundeswehr could n't possibly get by without experienced wehrmacht officers only increased people 's mistrust . away from slavish obedience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on nov .
12 , 1955 , west germany swore in its army 's first recruits , in bonn the military leadership focused on the new concept of " internal leadership " in developing the bundeswehr .
the idea was that soldiers should be " citizens in uniform " and that slavish obedience and brutal regiments would be a thing of the past . but in the beginning that was easier said than done : in 1957 , the same year that conscription was introduced , 15 recruits died after being ordered to cross the iller river without proper safety measures being taken .
elsewhere too , excessively tough training methods were part of the daily grind . sociologist martin kutz said that it took long before the idea of " internal leadership " found acceptance among the soldiers . " ' internal leadership was brought into the bundeswehr by the younger generation in the mid-60s , " kutz said .
" it has to do with the fact that the bundeswehr had an enormous shortage of young people and took whoever they could get .

it was originally formed to facilitate war-torn germany 's integration into the west .
today , the bundeswehr maintains the peace in hot spots around the world . germany 's armed forces will formally conclude the ongoing celebrations to mark 50 years of its existence on saturday .
nov 12 is a special day for the army because on that day 50 years ago , the first voluntary recruits of the bundeswehr received their certificates in barracks in bonn . only 10 years after the end of world war ii , in 1955 west germany 's army , the bundeswehr took shape . chancellor konrad adenauer wanted the country 's own armed forces to contribute to the federal republic 's integration into western structures . during the cold war , the western allied attitude towards re-establishment of german armed forces changed quickly since germany was located directly on the dividing line between the two blocs . west germany was expected to be able to make its own contribution to defending its territory .
but a return of the " wehrmacht , " the name the german army was known by under hitler , was out of the question .
west germany 's new constitution ensured that there would never be a return to the times when the army was a state within the state . even so , parliament was made responsible for keeping the bundeswehr on a short leash and the army was closely integrated into nato .
still , the social democratic opposition as well as a large part of the population objected to rearmament .
the fact that the bundeswehr could n't possibly get by without experienced wehrmacht officers only increased people 's mistrust . away from slavish obedience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on nov .
12 , 1955 , west germany swore in its army 's first recruits , in bonn the military leadership focused on the new concept of " internal leadership " in developing the bundeswehr .
the idea was that soldiers should be " citizens in uniform " and that slavish obedience and brutal regiments would be a thing of the past . but in the beginning that was easier said than done : in 1957 , the same year that conscription was introduced , 15 recruits died after being ordered to cross the iller river without proper safety measures being taken .
elsewhere too , excessively tough training methods were part of the daily grind . sociologist martin kutz said that it took long before the idea of " internal leadership " found acceptance among the soldiers . " ' internal leadership was brought into the bundeswehr by the younger generation in the mid-60s , " kutz said .
" it has to do with the fact that the bundeswehr had an enormous shortage of young people and took whoever they could get .
thus , young people of the simplest means joined the army and caused a break in tradition that the old -lrb- military -rrb- families had -lrb- previously -rrb- prevented .

it was originally formed to facilitate war-torn germany 's integration into the west .
today , the bundeswehr maintains the peace in hot spots around the world . germany 's armed forces will formally conclude the ongoing celebrations to mark 50 years of its existence on saturday .
nov 12 is a special day for the army because on that day 50 years ago , the first voluntary recruits of the bundeswehr received their certificates in barracks in bonn . only 10 years after the end of world war ii , in 1955 west germany 's army , the bundeswehr took shape . chancellor konrad adenauer wanted the country 's own armed forces to contribute to the federal republic 's integration into western structures . during the cold war , the western allied attitude towards re-establishment of german armed forces changed quickly since germany was located directly on the dividing line between the two blocs . west germany was expected to be able to make its own contribution to defending its territory .
but a return of the " wehrmacht , " the name the german army was known by under hitler , was out of the question .
west germany 's new constitution ensured that there would never be a return to the times when the army was a state within the state . even so , parliament was made responsible for keeping the bundeswehr on a short leash and the army was closely integrated into nato .
still , the social democratic opposition as well as a large part of the population objected to rearmament .
the fact that the bundeswehr could n't possibly get by without experienced wehrmacht officers only increased people 's mistrust . away from slavish obedience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on nov .
12 , 1955 , west germany swore in its army 's first recruits , in bonn the military leadership focused on the new concept of " internal leadership " in developing the bundeswehr .
the idea was that soldiers should be " citizens in uniform " and that slavish obedience and brutal regiments would be a thing of the past . but in the beginning that was easier said than done : in 1957 , the same year that conscription was introduced , 15 recruits died after being ordered to cross the iller river without proper safety measures being taken .
elsewhere too , excessively tough training methods were part of the daily grind . sociologist martin kutz said that it took long before the idea of " internal leadership " found acceptance among the soldiers . " ' internal leadership was brought into the bundeswehr by the younger generation in the mid-60s , " kutz said .
" it has to do with the fact that the bundeswehr had an enormous shortage of young people and took whoever they could get .
thus , young people of the simplest means joined the army and caused a break in tradition that the old -lrb- military -rrb- families had -lrb- previously -rrb- prevented . " in addition to the special circumstances within the bundeswehr , which had 270,000 soldiers in 1960 , its arms cache was a central issue right from the start .
the west responded to nuclear armament in the east by developing its own nuclear arsenal .
however , chancellor adenauer 's government had committed itself to neither produce nor acquire its own nuclear weapons .
the solution was for the bundeswehr to get carriers , while the americans administered the nuclear warheads that went on them . " fight nuclear death " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz-josef strauß " we do n't want the bundeswehr equipped as a german army with tactical nuclear weapons , " then-defense minister franz-josef strauß explained .
" we want nothing more and nothing less than nato 's entire defense planning requires , which envisions for every nation from canada to turkey particular duties so that it 's acceptable for the individual -lrb- state -rrb- , so that it 's affordable for the individual -lrb- state -rrb- and so that collective security keeps the aggressor at bay . " large parts of the population and of the officers ' corps rejected strauß 's plans .
over a million germans took to the streets with the slogan " fight nuclear death . "
but in the end , the government prevailed .
in march 1958 , the bundestag , west germany 's lower house of parliament , decided after four days of debate to equip the bundeswehr with carriers for nuclear weapons .
german pilots from then on were trained to drop nuclear bombs over germany and destroy their homes in case of emergency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans mobilized in masses to protest nuclear weapons being stationed in west germany but that did n't put an end to the conflict over the german armed forces ' nuclear armament .
in the 1980s , the government allowed nuclear missiles to be stationed in the country in accordance with the nato " double-track " decision despite great resistance from the people . " there were massive differences in the army over the nuclear issue , " kutz said .
" then , more than half of the staff officers disagreed with it -lrb- stationing nuclear weapons in germany -rrb- .
of course , in the end they were fended off , but is very clear that in those days the bundeswehr was more pluralistic than today . " when the berlin wall fell , around half a million men in west germany were in the armed forces .

they all have to win two-legged playoffs if they do n't want to face their fans ' scorn .
the first games are saturday , with the final decision coming on wednesday . the stress that comes with having to win a playoff was best summed up by slovakian coach dusan galis , who wants to lead his team to the world cup finals for the first time since the nation gained its independence 12 years ago . " i 'm not interested in anything else .
having a good feeling from a good performance and losing with honor - i will not be satisfied with anything like that , " galis told reporters .
" we have gone this far , so we are able to make the last step . " slovakia looks to fate to beat spain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain will start the playoffs in front of a home crowd but arsenal striker jose antonio reyes is confident he and the rest of the heavily favored spanish team have enough class to beat the slovakians and make it to their eighth consecutive world cup finals . " we are the better team and we are going to prove it , " reyes said .
" i am convinced we are going to score goals , and a 2-0 score line would be ideal to take to slovakia . " slovakia hope to fate on their side , spain has qualified for every finals since 1974 , when they were held , ironically , in west germany .
morale in the slovakian camp is also at a high after they eliminated russia from the finals .
if galis ' team can keep spain from running rampant saturday in madrid , they may still have a chance wednesday in bratislava , where they have n't lost since june 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norway surprised brazil , now they 'll try to beat the czechs for a trip to the world cup norway always good for a surprise norway will be rated underdogs against the czechs who are rated the fourth best team in the world in fifa 's rankings and come into the playoff as firm favorites .
but norway will hope to rekindle the spirit of ' 98 when they stunned brazil 2-1 in the first round of the world cup in france . norway midfielder morten gamst pedersen said he smells an upset in the oslo air and is confident his team will make it to their first finals since 1998 . " it 's two big games against the czech republic but we have beaten big teams before and we will do it again , " the 24-year-old blackburn rovers player told uefa.com. the czechs have already complained about oslo 's wet , muddy pitch that could hamper their passing game , and even though norway finished second in their group , they will have a lot of improving to do before they make it germany . closest match between turkey and switzerland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey beat germany 2-1 in october whichever of the evenly matched teams wins saturday will have an even bigger psychological advantage than usual going into wednesday 's final in turkey . turkish coach fatih terim is already resigned to fielding a team in berne without hertha berlin midfielder yildiray basturk and besiktas midfielder ibrahim akin with knee problems , and now major fitness doubts hanging over striker hasan sas and defender tolga seyhan as well . in what may amount to matches between the walking wounded , switzerland coach köbi kuhn has injury concerns of his own , with striker johan vonlanthen tearing a ligament in his foot in training on thursday and there are also doubts over captain johann vogel and defender boris smiljanic 's fitness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uruguay striker diego forlan will attack the socceroos two intercontinental playoffs remain two-time world cup winners uruguay are hoping to take a huge step towards the 2006 tournament by sending out an attack-minded line-up for playoff against australia . the maturing socceroos ' chances of making it to their first world cup since 1974 appear more positive under the guidance of dutchman guus hiddink .
the aussies ' main problem will be up front in the offense .
harry kewell , who has played for liverpool just twice since returning from groin surgery , could however come off the bench late in the match in an attempt to steal a vital away goal in uruguay . " i think it will be a very closely contested game , and it will also be physical , " said uruguay defender dario rodriguez , who plays club soccer for schalke 04 .
" for us the objective is simple .
we have to go out and get three points so that we can travel to australia with no pressure . " gifts promised to bahrain 's goal scorers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bahrain 's mohammed hubail , left , tied with uzbekistan to qualify for the playoffs trinidad and tobago are approaching the last of the world cup playoffs against bahrain with the same setup they used in qualifying . " why should i change anything ? "
trinidad and tobago coach leo beenhakker said .
" little by little the team has been growing and playing better and better . " the two matches will be a clash of styles as beenhakker 's side is known for its attacking flair while bahrain are known for layering their rearguard and patiently biding time for the perfect counterattack . according to media reports bahrain players , however , will have an added incentive to score in the playoffs .
while bahrain team manager abdul razzaq mohammed denied players would receive the rumored $ 1 million for scoring -lrb- 1.17 million euros -rrb- , he admitted that gifts had been promised to goal scorers . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de can germany pass its french test ?

in the german town of paderborn , primary school kids take the " walking bus " to class . obesity has reached the dimensions of a global epidemic , according to the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- .
not only adults are affected ; in germany , 36 percent of seven-year-old boys are significantly overweight as are 30 percent of seven-year-old girls . the medical effects are alarming : high blood pressure and type-two diabetes are phenomena that people under 40 generally do n't have to be concerned about .
but ever more children are being diagnosed with these maladies .
while kids do n't necessarily eat more than they did in the past , what has changed is that nowadays people in the west hardly walk anywhere . today 's sedentary lifestyles start at a young age .
traffic jams develop in front of primary schools on a regular basis , says wolf-dietrich brettschneider , who lives near one .
but there at least , the morning congestion has come to an end .
brettschneider and co-worker christoph malek have established the first german " walking bus " at the margarethenschule in paderborn . bus without wheels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reflective vests ensure that car drivers see the walking bus each morning , two kilometers -lrb- one mile -rrb- away from the school , the bus starts up .
students are collected at three bus stops and again dropped off after class .
the difference is that this bus is not an actual bus , not a vehicle .
the " bus " is a group of walkers .
adult volunteers accompany the children and make sure they make it safely to school .
that reassures parents who are used to driving their kids to class - whether for safety 's sake or to save time . aside from encouraging mobility , local police traffic safety advisor norbert meier is convinced that the walking bus has other benefits . " children come into contact with the reality of traffic earlier than if they 're always put in a car , " he said , adding that it helps kids learn independence and traffic safety rules faster . " our aim is for children to see movement as a something routine , " said head teacher helga berling .
her charges are keen on the walking bus , too , including many who have to go out of their way to get to one of the bus stops .
the route takes them through quiet neighborhood streets where they 're exposed to fewer exhaust fumes than on the more main road leading to the school . " it 's that much nicer , " said 8-year-old mara .
" then you can talk longer with your girlfriends . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids taking the walking bus are more alert when they get to class that too is one of the benefits of the walking bus .
" when kids walk to school they are more relaxed when they arrive in class , " explained brettschneider .
" they 've talked among themselves and also gotten lots of fresh air .
their ability to concentrate and learn is better . " beyond school so far , that seems to be the case .
" the children are more awake in any case , " said berlin after having observed the project for several months . ideally , the walking bus should motivate kids to be more physically active in their free time too .
in order to check whether that is the case , christoph malek plans to start a study in late november to observe the behavior and concentration levels of walking bus participants over a period of months . sixty german schools have already contacted brettschneider 's team about the walking bus .
three have gotten the idea going so far and five more aim to have it up and running by the end of the year .
the idea has also attracted interest from abroad , which is why brettschneider and malek will present the walking bus project at an international conference on the role of education and sports in lisbon in mid-november . johanna tüntsch -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us and germany fight battle of the bulge as the number of german children getting fatter increases , german officials are looking for ways to combat this trend and turning to americans for assistance .

in the german town of paderborn , primary school kids take the " walking bus " to class . obesity has reached the dimensions of a global epidemic , according to the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- .
not only adults are affected ; in germany , 36 percent of seven-year-old boys are significantly overweight as are 30 percent of seven-year-old girls . the medical effects are alarming : high blood pressure and type-two diabetes are phenomena that people under 40 generally do n't have to be concerned about .
but ever more children are being diagnosed with these maladies .
while kids do n't necessarily eat more than they did in the past , what has changed is that nowadays people in the west hardly walk anywhere . today 's sedentary lifestyles start at a young age .
traffic jams develop in front of primary schools on a regular basis , says wolf-dietrich brettschneider , who lives near one .
but there at least , the morning congestion has come to an end .
brettschneider and co-worker christoph malek have established the first german " walking bus " at the margarethenschule in paderborn . bus without wheels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reflective vests ensure that car drivers see the walking bus each morning , two kilometers -lrb- one mile -rrb- away from the school , the bus starts up .
students are collected at three bus stops and again dropped off after class .
the difference is that this bus is not an actual bus , not a vehicle .
the " bus " is a group of walkers .
adult volunteers accompany the children and make sure they make it safely to school .
that reassures parents who are used to driving their kids to class - whether for safety 's sake or to save time . aside from encouraging mobility , local police traffic safety advisor norbert meier is convinced that the walking bus has other benefits . " children come into contact with the reality of traffic earlier than if they 're always put in a car , " he said , adding that it helps kids learn independence and traffic safety rules faster . " our aim is for children to see movement as a something routine , " said head teacher helga berling .
her charges are keen on the walking bus , too , including many who have to go out of their way to get to one of the bus stops .
the route takes them through quiet neighborhood streets where they 're exposed to fewer exhaust fumes than on the more main road leading to the school . " it 's that much nicer , " said 8-year-old mara .
" then you can talk longer with your girlfriends . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids taking the walking bus are more alert when they get to class that too is one of the benefits of the walking bus .
" when kids walk to school they are more relaxed when they arrive in class , " explained brettschneider .
" they 've talked among themselves and also gotten lots of fresh air .
their ability to concentrate and learn is better . " beyond school so far , that seems to be the case .
" the children are more awake in any case , " said berlin after having observed the project for several months . ideally , the walking bus should motivate kids to be more physically active in their free time too .
in order to check whether that is the case , christoph malek plans to start a study in late november to observe the behavior and concentration levels of walking bus participants over a period of months . sixty german schools have already contacted brettschneider 's team about the walking bus .
three have gotten the idea going so far and five more aim to have it up and running by the end of the year .
the idea has also attracted interest from abroad , which is why brettschneider and malek will present the walking bus project at an international conference on the role of education and sports in lisbon in mid-november . johanna tüntsch -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us and germany fight battle of the bulge as the number of german children getting fatter increases , german officials are looking for ways to combat this trend and turning to americans for assistance .

they all have to win two-legged playoffs if they do n't want to face their fans ' scorn .
the first games are saturday , with the final decision coming on wednesday . the stress that comes with having to win a playoff was best summed up by slovakian coach dusan galis , who wants to lead his team to the world cup finals for the first time since the nation gained its independence 12 years ago . " i 'm not interested in anything else .
having a good feeling from a good performance and losing with honor - i will not be satisfied with anything like that , " galis told reporters .
" we have gone this far , so we are able to make the last step . " slovakia looks to fate to beat spain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain will start the playoffs in front of a home crowd but arsenal striker jose antonio reyes is confident he and the rest of the heavily favored spanish team have enough class to beat the slovakians and make it to their eighth consecutive world cup finals . " we are the better team and we are going to prove it , " reyes said .
" i am convinced we are going to score goals , and a 2-0 score line would be ideal to take to slovakia . " slovakia hope to fate on their side , spain has qualified for every finals since 1974 , when they were held , ironically , in west germany .
morale in the slovakian camp is also at a high after they eliminated russia from the finals .
if galis ' team can keep spain from running rampant saturday in madrid , they may still have a chance wednesday in bratislava , where they have n't lost since june 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norway surprised brazil , now they 'll try to beat the czechs for a trip to the world cup norway always good for a surprise norway will be rated underdogs against the czechs who are rated the fourth best team in the world in fifa 's rankings and come into the playoff as firm favorites .
but norway will hope to rekindle the spirit of ' 98 when they stunned brazil 2-1 in the first round of the world cup in france . norway midfielder morten gamst pedersen said he smells an upset in the oslo air and is confident his team will make it to their first finals since 1998 . " it 's two big games against the czech republic but we have beaten big teams before and we will do it again , " the 24-year-old blackburn rovers player told uefa.com. the czechs have already complained about oslo 's wet , muddy pitch that could hamper their passing game , and even though norway finished second in their group , they will have a lot of improving to do before they make it germany . closest match between turkey and switzerland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey beat germany 2-1 in october whichever of the evenly matched teams wins saturday will have an even bigger psychological advantage than usual going into wednesday 's final in turkey . turkish coach fatih terim is already resigned to fielding a team in berne without hertha berlin midfielder yildiray basturk and besiktas midfielder ibrahim akin with knee problems , and now major fitness doubts hanging over striker hasan sas and defender tolga seyhan as well . in what may amount to matches between the walking wounded , switzerland coach köbi kuhn has injury concerns of his own , with striker johan vonlanthen tearing a ligament in his foot in training on thursday and there are also doubts over captain johann vogel and defender boris smiljanic 's fitness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uruguay striker diego forlan will attack the socceroos two intercontinental playoffs remain two-time world cup winners uruguay are hoping to take a huge step towards the 2006 tournament by sending out an attack-minded line-up for playoff against australia . the maturing socceroos ' chances of making it to their first world cup since 1974 appear more positive under the guidance of dutchman guus hiddink .
the aussies ' main problem will be up front in the offense .
harry kewell , who has played for liverpool just twice since returning from groin surgery , could however come off the bench late in the match in an attempt to steal a vital away goal in uruguay . " i think it will be a very closely contested game , and it will also be physical , " said uruguay defender dario rodriguez , who plays club soccer for schalke 04 .
" for us the objective is simple .
we have to go out and get three points so that we can travel to australia with no pressure . " gifts promised to bahrain 's goal scorers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bahrain 's mohammed hubail , left , tied with uzbekistan to qualify for the playoffs trinidad and tobago are approaching the last of the world cup playoffs against bahrain with the same setup they used in qualifying . " why should i change anything ? "
trinidad and tobago coach leo beenhakker said .
" little by little the team has been growing and playing better and better . " the two matches will be a clash of styles as beenhakker 's side is known for its attacking flair while bahrain are known for layering their rearguard and patiently biding time for the perfect counterattack . according to media reports bahrain players , however , will have an added incentive to score in the playoffs .

it reveals a sordid saga and estimates wrongdoing among senior management cost vw millions . fraud and betrayal , lavish parties and visits to the red light district at the company ’ s cost ...
they sound like the plot elements of a thriller , but the allegations that have been flying around volkswagen headquarters in wolfsburg in recent months are very real . volkswagen hired auditing firm kpmg to scrutinize company procedures on the first of july , three days after it asked german prosecutors to investigate two former human resources executives for fraud . it was alleged helmuth schuster and klaus-joachim gebauer had set up shell companies in a number of countries , including india and the czech republic , to win business from the carmaker . sleaze and bribery members of the company ’ s works council were allegedly ‘ bought ’ , while personnel managers , on the other hand , made deals that weren ’ t in the interest of the company , incurring losses worth millions of euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vw logo which has stood for sturdy quality is now tarnished but , the most sensational element of the volkswagen scandal story is the allegation that the company ’ s board sent members of the works council on expensive sex holidays .
in return , works council members rubber-stamped board resolutions .
the procedure saw unconfirmed expense claims of up to 30,000 euros approved . the volkswagen scandal became public after a network of letter-box companies was uncovered .
it ’ s alleged helmuth schuster , the former personnel chief of vw-subsidiary skoda , used the companies as a front to channel funds into his own pockets . an indian state government also accuses schuster of demanding two million euros in kickbacks in exchange for his promise that volkswagen would build a plant in their region . wrongdoing right up to top rungs it wasn ’ t long before investigations into the network of front companies turned up another name : klaus-joachim gebauer , volkswagen ’ s former personnel manager .
it ’ s alleged he organized several sex parties that later came to haunt several members of the works council . " some of the things that have been said are true , " gebauer said .
" the one thing i regret is that , through other people , i got into a situation i don ’ t want to be in . " but the scandal doesn ’ t end there .
even the long-serving and influential head of the works council , klaus volkert , has caught the eye of prosecutors . but volkert maintains fraud allegations are unfounded . " the short version is : i ’ m not aware of any wrongdoing .
i have no idea why i have the ‘ honor ’ of being subject to this media witch-hunt , " volkert said . hartz resignation trade union officials say the scandal is partly a conspiracy to weaken employee representation at volkswagen .
they argue that a strong works council and union have long been a thorn in the side of volkswagen ’ s top management . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beleagured vw manager peter hartz stepped down recently fraud allegations also led to recent resignation of human resources executive peter hartz .
for years hartz stood as one of the supporting pillars of the so-called “ vw-system ” of close cooperation between top management and employee representatives . he “ invented ” of the four-day-week - cutting working hours without compensatory wage increases - and even had national labor market reforms named after him , before he had to admit he ’ d made mistakes at volkswagen by not keeping tight enough control of his employees . vw moves to stem damage all in all , the kpmg report estimates the scandal has cost volkswagen a total of five million euros , although further investigations could see that figure rise . as the initial fallout of the scandal settles , chief executive bernd pischetsrieder says he ’ s taking steps to make volkswagen a ‘ more transparent company internally and externally ’ . under a new ombudsman system , volkswagen will assign two lawyers to deal with allegations throughout the corporation .
company employees will then be able to give them anonymous tips on corrupt activities . top management at wolfsburg say they want investigators to get to the bottom of the scandal . it ’ s a call echoed by the premier of the of lower saxony christian wulff .
his federal state is volkswagen ’ s largest shareholder . " those guilty of wrongdoing will have to clear their desks and accept responsibility for what they did , ” wulff said . “ then we ’ ll put systems in place to ensure this can never be repeated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst neumann faces a challenging time at vw volkswagen announced on friday that horst neumann has been named to replace hartz . neumann , who currently oversees human resources as a board member at volkswagen ’ s subsidiary audi , will start his new job on december 1 . monika lohmüller -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany rocked by damning report on un scandal news of the involvement of leading german companies in kickbacks to saddam hussein 's regime during the un oil-for-food program has stunned germany and prompted calls for speedy legal action .

they all have to win two-legged playoffs if they do n't want to face their fans ' scorn .
the first games are saturday , with the final decision coming on wednesday . the stress that comes with having to win a playoff was best summed up by slovakian coach dusan galis , who wants to lead his team to the world cup finals for the first time since the nation gained its independence 12 years ago . " i 'm not interested in anything else .
having a good feeling from a good performance and losing with honor - i will not be satisfied with anything like that , " galis told reporters .
" we have gone this far , so we are able to make the last step . " slovakia looks to fate to beat spain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain will start the playoffs in front of a home crowd but arsenal striker jose antonio reyes is confident he and the rest of the heavily favored spanish team have enough class to beat the slovakians and make it to their eighth consecutive world cup finals . " we are the better team and we are going to prove it , " reyes said .
" i am convinced we are going to score goals , and a 2-0 score line would be ideal to take to slovakia . " slovakia hope to fate on their side , spain has qualified for every finals since 1974 , when they were held , ironically , in west germany .
morale in the slovakian camp is also at a high after they eliminated russia from the finals .
if galis ' team can keep spain from running rampant saturday in madrid , they may still have a chance wednesday in bratislava , where they have n't lost since june 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norway surprised brazil , now they 'll try to beat the czechs for a trip to the world cup norway always good for a surprise norway will be rated underdogs against the czechs who are rated the fourth best team in the world in fifa 's rankings and come into the playoff as firm favorites .
but norway will hope to rekindle the spirit of ' 98 when they stunned brazil 2-1 in the first round of the world cup in france . norway midfielder morten gamst pedersen said he smells an upset in the oslo air and is confident his team will make it to their first finals since 1998 . " it 's two big games against the czech republic but we have beaten big teams before and we will do it again , " the 24-year-old blackburn rovers player told uefa.com. the czechs have already complained about oslo 's wet , muddy pitch that could hamper their passing game , and even though norway finished second in their group , they will have a lot of improving to do before they make it germany . closest match between turkey and switzerland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey beat germany 2-1 in october whichever of the evenly matched teams wins saturday will have an even bigger psychological advantage than usual going into wednesday 's final in turkey . turkish coach fatih terim is already resigned to fielding a team in berne without hertha berlin midfielder yildiray basturk and besiktas midfielder ibrahim akin with knee problems , and now major fitness doubts hanging over striker hasan sas and defender tolga seyhan as well . in what may amount to matches between the walking wounded , switzerland coach köbi kuhn has injury concerns of his own , with striker johan vonlanthen tearing a ligament in his foot in training on thursday and there are also doubts over captain johann vogel and defender boris smiljanic 's fitness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uruguay striker diego forlan will attack the socceroos two intercontinental playoffs remain two-time world cup winners uruguay are hoping to take a huge step towards the 2006 tournament by sending out an attack-minded line-up for playoff against australia . the maturing socceroos ' chances of making it to their first world cup since 1974 appear more positive under the guidance of dutchman guus hiddink .
the aussies ' main problem will be up front in the offense .
harry kewell , who has played for liverpool just twice since returning from groin surgery , could however come off the bench late in the match in an attempt to steal a vital away goal in uruguay . " i think it will be a very closely contested game , and it will also be physical , " said uruguay defender dario rodriguez , who plays club soccer for schalke 04 .
" for us the objective is simple .
we have to go out and get three points so that we can travel to australia with no pressure . " gifts promised to bahrain 's goal scorers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bahrain 's mohammed hubail , left , tied with uzbekistan to qualify for the playoffs trinidad and tobago are approaching the last of the world cup playoffs against bahrain with the same setup they used in qualifying . " why should i change anything ? "
trinidad and tobago coach leo beenhakker said .
" little by little the team has been growing and playing better and better . " the two matches will be a clash of styles as beenhakker 's side is known for its attacking flair while bahrain are known for layering their rearguard and patiently biding time for the perfect counterattack . according to media reports bahrain players , however , will have an added incentive to score in the playoffs .

they all have to win two-legged playoffs if they do n't want to face their fans ' scorn .
the first games are saturday , with the final decision coming on wednesday . the stress that comes with having to win a playoff was best summed up by slovakian coach dusan galis , who wants to lead his team to the world cup finals for the first time since the nation gained its independence 12 years ago . " i 'm not interested in anything else .
having a good feeling from a good performance and losing with honor - i will not be satisfied with anything like that , " galis told reporters .
" we have gone this far , so we are able to make the last step . " slovakia looks to fate to beat spain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain will start the playoffs in front of a home crowd but arsenal striker jose antonio reyes is confident he and the rest of the heavily favored spanish team have enough class to beat the slovakians and make it to their eighth consecutive world cup finals . " we are the better team and we are going to prove it , " reyes said .
" i am convinced we are going to score goals , and a 2-0 score line would be ideal to take to slovakia . " slovakia hope to fate on their side , spain has qualified for every finals since 1974 , when they were held , ironically , in west germany .
morale in the slovakian camp is also at a high after they eliminated russia from the finals .

they all have to win two-legged playoffs if they do n't want to face their fans ' scorn .
the first games are saturday , with the final decision coming on wednesday . the stress that comes with having to win a playoff was best summed up by slovakian coach dusan galis , who wants to lead his team to the world cup finals for the first time since the nation gained its independence 12 years ago . " i 'm not interested in anything else .
having a good feeling from a good performance and losing with honor - i will not be satisfied with anything like that , " galis told reporters .

it was originally formed to facilitate war-torn germany 's integration into the west .
today , the bundeswehr maintains the peace in hot spots around the world . germany 's armed forces will formally conclude the ongoing celebrations to mark 50 years of its existence on saturday .
nov 12 is a special day for the army because on that day 50 years ago , the first voluntary recruits of the bundeswehr received their certificates in barracks in bonn . only 10 years after the end of world war ii , in 1955 west germany 's army , the bundeswehr took shape . chancellor konrad adenauer wanted the country 's own armed forces to contribute to the federal republic 's integration into western structures . during the cold war , the western allied attitude towards re-establishment of german armed forces changed quickly since germany was located directly on the dividing line between the two blocs . west germany was expected to be able to make its own contribution to defending its territory .
but a return of the " wehrmacht , " the name the german army was known by under hitler , was out of the question .
west germany 's new constitution ensured that there would never be a return to the times when the army was a state within the state . even so , parliament was made responsible for keeping the bundeswehr on a short leash and the army was closely integrated into nato .
still , the social democratic opposition as well as a large part of the population objected to rearmament .
the fact that the bundeswehr could n't possibly get by without experienced wehrmacht officers only increased people 's mistrust . away from slavish obedience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on nov .
12 , 1955 , west germany swore in its army 's first recruits , in bonn the military leadership focused on the new concept of " internal leadership " in developing the bundeswehr .
the idea was that soldiers should be " citizens in uniform " and that slavish obedience and brutal regiments would be a thing of the past . but in the beginning that was easier said than done : in 1957 , the same year that conscription was introduced , 15 recruits died after being ordered to cross the iller river without proper safety measures being taken .
elsewhere too , excessively tough training methods were part of the daily grind . sociologist martin kutz said that it took long before the idea of " internal leadership " found acceptance among the soldiers . " ' internal leadership was brought into the bundeswehr by the younger generation in the mid-60s , " kutz said .
" it has to do with the fact that the bundeswehr had an enormous shortage of young people and took whoever they could get .
thus , young people of the simplest means joined the army and caused a break in tradition that the old -lrb- military -rrb- families had -lrb- previously -rrb- prevented . " in addition to the special circumstances within the bundeswehr , which had 270,000 soldiers in 1960 , its arms cache was a central issue right from the start .
the west responded to nuclear armament in the east by developing its own nuclear arsenal .
however , chancellor adenauer 's government had committed itself to neither produce nor acquire its own nuclear weapons .
the solution was for the bundeswehr to get carriers , while the americans administered the nuclear warheads that went on them . " fight nuclear death " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz-josef strauß " we do n't want the bundeswehr equipped as a german army with tactical nuclear weapons , " then-defense minister franz-josef strauß explained .
" we want nothing more and nothing less than nato 's entire defense planning requires , which envisions for every nation from canada to turkey particular duties so that it 's acceptable for the individual -lrb- state -rrb- , so that it 's affordable for the individual -lrb- state -rrb- and so that collective security keeps the aggressor at bay . " large parts of the population and of the officers ' corps rejected strauß 's plans .
over a million germans took to the streets with the slogan " fight nuclear death . "
but in the end , the government prevailed .
in march 1958 , the bundestag , west germany 's lower house of parliament , decided after four days of debate to equip the bundeswehr with carriers for nuclear weapons .
german pilots from then on were trained to drop nuclear bombs over germany and destroy their homes in case of emergency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans mobilized in masses to protest nuclear weapons being stationed in west germany but that did n't put an end to the conflict over the german armed forces ' nuclear armament .
in the 1980s , the government allowed nuclear missiles to be stationed in the country in accordance with the nato " double-track " decision despite great resistance from the people . " there were massive differences in the army over the nuclear issue , " kutz said .
" then , more than half of the staff officers disagreed with it -lrb- stationing nuclear weapons in germany -rrb- .
of course , in the end they were fended off , but is very clear that in those days the bundeswehr was more pluralistic than today . " when the berlin wall fell , around half a million men in west germany were in the armed forces .
after german unification in 1990 , the east german armed forces , the nva , was dissolved and a portion of its soldiers integrated into the bundeswehr .
shortly thereafter , the restructuring of the armed forces began and which still continues to this day . the bundeswehr was not only too big and cumbersome , but it also needed a new orientation after the collapse of the " enemy from the east . "
defending germany on foreign soil the bundeswehr 's classic duties of national defense now faced new threats - above all from terrorism . for the first time , the bundeswehr started taking part in un-mandated peace missions , although germany 's constitution only envisages its deployment for defensive purposes - that is , in the case of an attack on the country .
the german constitutional court cleared the legal fog in 1994 when bundeswehr soldiers participated in the un peacekeeping mission in somalia .
in 1999 , german soldiers were deployed for combat for the first time when nato bombed serbia during the kosovo war - a crucial test for the green party , the junior partner in the governing coalition with the social democrats .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers now take part in un and nato peacekeeping missions as a result , foreign deployments - every one of which must be approved by the bundestag - finally were accepted as a political reality .
the bundestag gave its blessing to the initially controversial afghanistan deployment after sept .
11 attacks as well . up to 10,000 german soldiers , including special forces , have been temporarily stationed abroad . half a century after the bundeswehr 's foundation , outgoing defense minister peter struck , who was instrumental in advancing reform , summed up the development of germany 's armed forces : " i will surely go down in history with the sentence : germany is also defended on the hindu kush .
and with the other sentence : the bundeswehr 's operational area is the whole world .

today , the bundeswehr maintains the peace in hot spots around the world . germany 's armed forces will formally conclude the ongoing celebrations to mark 50 years of its existence on saturday .
nov 12 is a special day for the army because on that day 50 years ago , the first voluntary recruits of the bundeswehr received their certificates in barracks in bonn . only 10 years after the end of world war ii , in 1955 west germany 's army , the bundeswehr took shape . chancellor konrad adenauer wanted the country 's own armed forces to contribute to the federal republic 's integration into western structures . during the cold war , the western allied attitude towards re-establishment of german armed forces changed quickly since germany was located directly on the dividing line between the two blocs . west germany was expected to be able to make its own contribution to defending its territory .
but a return of the " wehrmacht , " the name the german army was known by under hitler , was out of the question .
west germany 's new constitution ensured that there would never be a return to the times when the army was a state within the state . even so , parliament was made responsible for keeping the bundeswehr on a short leash and the army was closely integrated into nato .
still , the social democratic opposition as well as a large part of the population objected to rearmament .
the fact that the bundeswehr could n't possibly get by without experienced wehrmacht officers only increased people 's mistrust . away from slavish obedience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on nov .
12 , 1955 , west germany swore in its army 's first recruits , in bonn the military leadership focused on the new concept of " internal leadership " in developing the bundeswehr .
the idea was that soldiers should be " citizens in uniform " and that slavish obedience and brutal regiments would be a thing of the past . but in the beginning that was easier said than done : in 1957 , the same year that conscription was introduced , 15 recruits died after being ordered to cross the iller river without proper safety measures being taken .
elsewhere too , excessively tough training methods were part of the daily grind . sociologist martin kutz said that it took long before the idea of " internal leadership " found acceptance among the soldiers . " ' internal leadership was brought into the bundeswehr by the younger generation in the mid-60s , " kutz said .
" it has to do with the fact that the bundeswehr had an enormous shortage of young people and took whoever they could get .
thus , young people of the simplest means joined the army and caused a break in tradition that the old -lrb- military -rrb- families had -lrb- previously -rrb- prevented . " in addition to the special circumstances within the bundeswehr , which had 270,000 soldiers in 1960 , its arms cache was a central issue right from the start .
the west responded to nuclear armament in the east by developing its own nuclear arsenal .
however , chancellor adenauer 's government had committed itself to neither produce nor acquire its own nuclear weapons .
the solution was for the bundeswehr to get carriers , while the americans administered the nuclear warheads that went on them . " fight nuclear death " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz-josef strauß " we do n't want the bundeswehr equipped as a german army with tactical nuclear weapons , " then-defense minister franz-josef strauß explained .
" we want nothing more and nothing less than nato 's entire defense planning requires , which envisions for every nation from canada to turkey particular duties so that it 's acceptable for the individual -lrb- state -rrb- , so that it 's affordable for the individual -lrb- state -rrb- and so that collective security keeps the aggressor at bay . " large parts of the population and of the officers ' corps rejected strauß 's plans .
over a million germans took to the streets with the slogan " fight nuclear death . "
but in the end , the government prevailed .
in march 1958 , the bundestag , west germany 's lower house of parliament , decided after four days of debate to equip the bundeswehr with carriers for nuclear weapons .
german pilots from then on were trained to drop nuclear bombs over germany and destroy their homes in case of emergency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans mobilized in masses to protest nuclear weapons being stationed in west germany but that did n't put an end to the conflict over the german armed forces ' nuclear armament .
in the 1980s , the government allowed nuclear missiles to be stationed in the country in accordance with the nato " double-track " decision despite great resistance from the people . " there were massive differences in the army over the nuclear issue , " kutz said .
" then , more than half of the staff officers disagreed with it -lrb- stationing nuclear weapons in germany -rrb- .
of course , in the end they were fended off , but is very clear that in those days the bundeswehr was more pluralistic than today . " when the berlin wall fell , around half a million men in west germany were in the armed forces .
after german unification in 1990 , the east german armed forces , the nva , was dissolved and a portion of its soldiers integrated into the bundeswehr .
shortly thereafter , the restructuring of the armed forces began and which still continues to this day . the bundeswehr was not only too big and cumbersome , but it also needed a new orientation after the collapse of the " enemy from the east . "
defending germany on foreign soil the bundeswehr 's classic duties of national defense now faced new threats - above all from terrorism . for the first time , the bundeswehr started taking part in un-mandated peace missions , although germany 's constitution only envisages its deployment for defensive purposes - that is , in the case of an attack on the country .
the german constitutional court cleared the legal fog in 1994 when bundeswehr soldiers participated in the un peacekeeping mission in somalia .
in 1999 , german soldiers were deployed for combat for the first time when nato bombed serbia during the kosovo war - a crucial test for the green party , the junior partner in the governing coalition with the social democrats .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers now take part in un and nato peacekeeping missions as a result , foreign deployments - every one of which must be approved by the bundestag - finally were accepted as a political reality .
the bundestag gave its blessing to the initially controversial afghanistan deployment after sept .
11 attacks as well . up to 10,000 german soldiers , including special forces , have been temporarily stationed abroad . half a century after the bundeswehr 's foundation , outgoing defense minister peter struck , who was instrumental in advancing reform , summed up the development of germany 's armed forces : " i will surely go down in history with the sentence : germany is also defended on the hindu kush .
and with the other sentence : the bundeswehr 's operational area is the whole world .

experts say foreign policy under her will lead to warmer ties with the us , but it wo n't translate into major policy changes . germany 's conservatives led by angela merkel and the social democrats agreed on the second so-called " grand coalition " in germany 's postwar history on friday . the move paves the way for 51-year-old angela merkel , a former scientist who grew up in the communist former east germany , to become germany 's first female chancellor .
she is expected to be sworn in later this month provided separate party conferences on monday endorse the coalition deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's rival politicians have forged a power-sharing deal on friday , merkel was optimistic that the new grand coalition would work for germany .
" i think that this can be a coalition of new possibilities , " merkel said , adding it offered germany " a real chance " to pull itself out of its ongoing economic crisis . the new government 's power-sharing agreement broadly outlines reform measures aimed at reviving the stagnant german economy , slashing mounting public deficit and tackling the chronically high unemployment rate . " change in style and rhetoric " analysts however are n't expecting significant change on the foreign policy front .
they do however admit that german relations with the us will be become warmer given that merkel 's conservatives are overwhelmingly in favor of closer transatlantic ties and repairing the damage inflicted upon it by chancellor schröder 's government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush , left , and merkel in mainz in germany " i think the big change you 're going see is one in style and rhetoric , " karen donfried , senior director of the german marshall fund in washington . " it will be very different under angela merkel , " she said .
" the role of the central east europeans will be more prominent and central east europeans are very close us allies . " reform drive crucial for better ties with us jackson james , executive director of the american institute for contemporary german studies , said transatlantic relations under the new government hinge on whether merkel can make headway on the domestic front with critical economic reforms . " the success of germany 's reforms will have important implications for europe and the united states , " james told a congressional hearing this week on the german elections and their implications for us-german ties . " the ability of germany to meet its foreign policy responsibilities in terms of defense allocations , its presence in regional hot spots like the balkans and the middle east , and its role in the international financial institutions will depend on achieving a sustainable level of economic growth . " thomas kleine brockhoff , washington bureau chief of the german newsweekly die zeit , summed up merkel 's foreign policy agenda saying it would include " less france and more united states , less russia and more poland , no eu-membership for turkey . " analysts , however , noted that though merkel is opposed to turkey joining the european union , there was no indication that she would stand in the way of the 10 to 15 year negotiating process , by which time she is not expected to still be chancellor . german public opinion a hurdle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans demonstrate against the us-led iraq war in 2003 in berlin they added that however much merkel may wish to improve ties with washington , one inescapable constraint will be german public opinion , which is fiercely opposed to the bush administration and its international policies . " given the unambiguous , negative view among the german public of us foreign policy and the merkel government 's need to have domestic backing for its economic and social reforms , it is difficult to see the new chancellor blazing new foreign policy paths together with washington , " donfried , who also testified this week before the committee on international relations in the us house of representatives , said . " if merkel closes the gap between the rhetoric and the policy , i think it would restore some of the trust between berlin and washington and that then probably might lead over into public opinion , " she added . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new government program comes under attack incoming chancellor angela merkel called saturday for germans to make sacrifices to help put their struggling economy back on track , but her future government 's policies are already under fire .

but , no one has considered canceling the match . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a major highway sets the stade de france from major rioting " the way things look at the moment there is no direct danger , neither for the players nor for the game , " alfred sengle , head of dfb security , told sport1.de. still , sengle and french stadium security officials remember how zinedine zidane , thierry henry , robert pires and the rest of the french and algerian teams rushed to the locker rooms when spectators were able to storm the field during a 2001 exhibition match - a situation no one wants to see repeated . over 4,000 extra police on patrol partly in response to what french security officials called an " unusually high number " of subversive e-mails and text messages , there will be an additional 2,000 police officers patrolling the stadium and surrounding areas and 2,200 more in central paris . the dfb said two bodyguards will be traveling with the german team , mainly to help guarantee the team 's security at the hotel , le meredien etoile .
visiting international teams normally leave all security measures to local authorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : players are concentrating on soccer , not security " naturally we hope that everything goes well and that we can concentrate on sports , but we do n't want to leave anything to chance , " german team manager oliver bierhoff said this week . though the players have not commented on playing in a city that has produced nightly images of burning cars , german coach jürgen klinsmann said he 'd take some extra time to give his players a run-down on the political situation . " we 'll brief them on the situation and give them the necessary information , just like we have done at other international matches , " he said . 2,000 germans expected to make trip to paris trouble is also possible from germany 's fans , who are not known for their openness and tolerance during soccer matches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all german fans are out for a good time during the 1998 world cup in france , hundreds of german hooligans battled with riot police in lens and brutally beat gendarme daniel nivel into a coma .
the dfb said in a statement that it had personally invited nivel , his wife and two sons to a game of the 2006 world cup in germany , as a gesture of reconciliation . the attack on nivel left him in a coma for six weeks and permanently brain damaged .
he still has difficulties moving and speaking and can not remember what happened . more recently , 40 german fans were arrested in slovenia for rioting that involved over 200 fans during a march international . but german soccer and security officials have spent much more time with keeping german fans safe , rather than focusing on possible confrontations between german hooligans and rioters . the german foreign ministry has warned the some 2,000 fans expected to travel to paris to be especially aware of their surroundings .
and , german insurers are also cautioning fans who plan to drive their cars to the match that their policies likely wo n't cover any damage should things get out of hand . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de can germany pass its french test ?

it was originally formed to facilitate war-torn germany 's integration into the west .
today , the bundeswehr maintains the peace in hot spots around the world . germany 's armed forces will formally conclude the ongoing celebrations to mark 50 years of its existence on saturday .
nov 12 is a special day for the army because on that day 50 years ago , the first voluntary recruits of the bundeswehr received their certificates in barracks in bonn . only 10 years after the end of world war ii , in 1955 west germany 's army , the bundeswehr took shape . chancellor konrad adenauer wanted the country 's own armed forces to contribute to the federal republic 's integration into western structures . during the cold war , the western allied attitude towards re-establishment of german armed forces changed quickly since germany was located directly on the dividing line between the two blocs . west germany was expected to be able to make its own contribution to defending its territory .
but a return of the " wehrmacht , " the name the german army was known by under hitler , was out of the question .
west germany 's new constitution ensured that there would never be a return to the times when the army was a state within the state . even so , parliament was made responsible for keeping the bundeswehr on a short leash and the army was closely integrated into nato .

it reveals a sordid saga and estimates wrongdoing among senior management cost vw millions . fraud and betrayal , lavish parties and visits to the red light district at the company ’ s cost ...
they sound like the plot elements of a thriller , but the allegations that have been flying around volkswagen headquarters in wolfsburg in recent months are very real . volkswagen hired auditing firm kpmg to scrutinize company procedures on the first of july , three days after it asked german prosecutors to investigate two former human resources executives for fraud . it was alleged helmuth schuster and klaus-joachim gebauer had set up shell companies in a number of countries , including india and the czech republic , to win business from the carmaker . sleaze and bribery members of the company ’ s works council were allegedly ‘ bought ’ , while personnel managers , on the other hand , made deals that weren ’ t in the interest of the company , incurring losses worth millions of euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vw logo which has stood for sturdy quality is now tarnished but , the most sensational element of the volkswagen scandal story is the allegation that the company ’ s board sent members of the works council on expensive sex holidays .
in return , works council members rubber-stamped board resolutions .
the procedure saw unconfirmed expense claims of up to 30,000 euros approved . the volkswagen scandal became public after a network of letter-box companies was uncovered .
it ’ s alleged helmuth schuster , the former personnel chief of vw-subsidiary skoda , used the companies as a front to channel funds into his own pockets . an indian state government also accuses schuster of demanding two million euros in kickbacks in exchange for his promise that volkswagen would build a plant in their region . wrongdoing right up to top rungs it wasn ’ t long before investigations into the network of front companies turned up another name : klaus-joachim gebauer , volkswagen ’ s former personnel manager .
it ’ s alleged he organized several sex parties that later came to haunt several members of the works council . " some of the things that have been said are true , " gebauer said .
" the one thing i regret is that , through other people , i got into a situation i don ’ t want to be in . " but the scandal doesn ’ t end there .
even the long-serving and influential head of the works council , klaus volkert , has caught the eye of prosecutors . but volkert maintains fraud allegations are unfounded . " the short version is : i ’ m not aware of any wrongdoing .
i have no idea why i have the ‘ honor ’ of being subject to this media witch-hunt , " volkert said . hartz resignation trade union officials say the scandal is partly a conspiracy to weaken employee representation at volkswagen .
they argue that a strong works council and union have long been a thorn in the side of volkswagen ’ s top management . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beleagured vw manager peter hartz stepped down recently fraud allegations also led to recent resignation of human resources executive peter hartz .
for years hartz stood as one of the supporting pillars of the so-called “ vw-system ” of close cooperation between top management and employee representatives . he “ invented ” of the four-day-week - cutting working hours without compensatory wage increases - and even had national labor market reforms named after him , before he had to admit he ’ d made mistakes at volkswagen by not keeping tight enough control of his employees . vw moves to stem damage all in all , the kpmg report estimates the scandal has cost volkswagen a total of five million euros , although further investigations could see that figure rise . as the initial fallout of the scandal settles , chief executive bernd pischetsrieder says he ’ s taking steps to make volkswagen a ‘ more transparent company internally and externally ’ . under a new ombudsman system , volkswagen will assign two lawyers to deal with allegations throughout the corporation .
company employees will then be able to give them anonymous tips on corrupt activities . top management at wolfsburg say they want investigators to get to the bottom of the scandal . it ’ s a call echoed by the premier of the of lower saxony christian wulff .
his federal state is volkswagen ’ s largest shareholder . " those guilty of wrongdoing will have to clear their desks and accept responsibility for what they did , ” wulff said . “ then we ’ ll put systems in place to ensure this can never be repeated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst neumann faces a challenging time at vw volkswagen announced on friday that horst neumann has been named to replace hartz . neumann , who currently oversees human resources as a board member at volkswagen ’ s subsidiary audi , will start his new job on december 1 . monika lohmüller -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany rocked by damning report on un scandal news of the involvement of leading german companies in kickbacks to saddam hussein 's regime during the un oil-for-food program has stunned germany and prompted calls for speedy legal action .

it was originally formed to facilitate war-torn germany 's integration into the west .
today , the bundeswehr maintains the peace in hot spots around the world . germany 's armed forces will formally conclude the ongoing celebrations to mark 50 years of its existence on saturday .
nov 12 is a special day for the army because on that day 50 years ago , the first voluntary recruits of the bundeswehr received their certificates in barracks in bonn . only 10 years after the end of world war ii , in 1955 west germany 's army , the bundeswehr took shape . chancellor konrad adenauer wanted the country 's own armed forces to contribute to the federal republic 's integration into western structures . during the cold war , the western allied attitude towards re-establishment of german armed forces changed quickly since germany was located directly on the dividing line between the two blocs . west germany was expected to be able to make its own contribution to defending its territory .
but a return of the " wehrmacht , " the name the german army was known by under hitler , was out of the question .
west germany 's new constitution ensured that there would never be a return to the times when the army was a state within the state . even so , parliament was made responsible for keeping the bundeswehr on a short leash and the army was closely integrated into nato .
still , the social democratic opposition as well as a large part of the population objected to rearmament .
the fact that the bundeswehr could n't possibly get by without experienced wehrmacht officers only increased people 's mistrust . away from slavish obedience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on nov .
12 , 1955 , west germany swore in its army 's first recruits , in bonn the military leadership focused on the new concept of " internal leadership " in developing the bundeswehr .
the idea was that soldiers should be " citizens in uniform " and that slavish obedience and brutal regiments would be a thing of the past . but in the beginning that was easier said than done : in 1957 , the same year that conscription was introduced , 15 recruits died after being ordered to cross the iller river without proper safety measures being taken .
elsewhere too , excessively tough training methods were part of the daily grind . sociologist martin kutz said that it took long before the idea of " internal leadership " found acceptance among the soldiers . " ' internal leadership was brought into the bundeswehr by the younger generation in the mid-60s , " kutz said .
" it has to do with the fact that the bundeswehr had an enormous shortage of young people and took whoever they could get .
thus , young people of the simplest means joined the army and caused a break in tradition that the old -lrb- military -rrb- families had -lrb- previously -rrb- prevented . " in addition to the special circumstances within the bundeswehr , which had 270,000 soldiers in 1960 , its arms cache was a central issue right from the start .
the west responded to nuclear armament in the east by developing its own nuclear arsenal .
however , chancellor adenauer 's government had committed itself to neither produce nor acquire its own nuclear weapons .
the solution was for the bundeswehr to get carriers , while the americans administered the nuclear warheads that went on them . " fight nuclear death " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz-josef strauß " we do n't want the bundeswehr equipped as a german army with tactical nuclear weapons , " then-defense minister franz-josef strauß explained .
" we want nothing more and nothing less than nato 's entire defense planning requires , which envisions for every nation from canada to turkey particular duties so that it 's acceptable for the individual -lrb- state -rrb- , so that it 's affordable for the individual -lrb- state -rrb- and so that collective security keeps the aggressor at bay . " large parts of the population and of the officers ' corps rejected strauß 's plans .
over a million germans took to the streets with the slogan " fight nuclear death . "
but in the end , the government prevailed .
in march 1958 , the bundestag , west germany 's lower house of parliament , decided after four days of debate to equip the bundeswehr with carriers for nuclear weapons .
german pilots from then on were trained to drop nuclear bombs over germany and destroy their homes in case of emergency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans mobilized in masses to protest nuclear weapons being stationed in west germany but that did n't put an end to the conflict over the german armed forces ' nuclear armament .
in the 1980s , the government allowed nuclear missiles to be stationed in the country in accordance with the nato " double-track " decision despite great resistance from the people . " there were massive differences in the army over the nuclear issue , " kutz said .
" then , more than half of the staff officers disagreed with it -lrb- stationing nuclear weapons in germany -rrb- .
of course , in the end they were fended off , but is very clear that in those days the bundeswehr was more pluralistic than today . " when the berlin wall fell , around half a million men in west germany were in the armed forces .
after german unification in 1990 , the east german armed forces , the nva , was dissolved and a portion of its soldiers integrated into the bundeswehr .
shortly thereafter , the restructuring of the armed forces began and which still continues to this day . the bundeswehr was not only too big and cumbersome , but it also needed a new orientation after the collapse of the " enemy from the east . "
defending germany on foreign soil the bundeswehr 's classic duties of national defense now faced new threats - above all from terrorism . for the first time , the bundeswehr started taking part in un-mandated peace missions , although germany 's constitution only envisages its deployment for defensive purposes - that is , in the case of an attack on the country .
the german constitutional court cleared the legal fog in 1994 when bundeswehr soldiers participated in the un peacekeeping mission in somalia .
in 1999 , german soldiers were deployed for combat for the first time when nato bombed serbia during the kosovo war - a crucial test for the green party , the junior partner in the governing coalition with the social democrats .

11 attacks as well . up to 10,000 german soldiers , including special forces , have been temporarily stationed abroad . half a century after the bundeswehr 's foundation , outgoing defense minister peter struck , who was instrumental in advancing reform , summed up the development of germany 's armed forces : " i will surely go down in history with the sentence : germany is also defended on the hindu kush .

but , problems are n't expected during the international friendly . curfews may have taken the edge off much of the rioting in the suburbs outside of paris .
but , france on saturday enforced a ban on gatherings that could cause trouble in paris and thousands of police patrolled the capital to prevent urban violence reaching the heart of the city . german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- officials are keeping their eye on the security situation at saturday night 's exhibition friendly in the stade de france , located in paris ' st. denis suburb - one of the centers of the last two weeks ' nightly riots .
but , no one has considered canceling the match . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a major highway sets the stade de france from major rioting " the way things look at the moment there is no direct danger , neither for the players nor for the game , " alfred sengle , head of dfb security , told sport1.de. still , sengle and french stadium security officials remember how zinedine zidane , thierry henry , robert pires and the rest of the french and algerian teams rushed to the locker rooms when spectators were able to storm the field during a 2001 exhibition match - a situation no one wants to see repeated . over 4,000 extra police on patrol partly in response to what french security officials called an " unusually high number " of subversive e-mails and text messages , there will be an additional 2,000 police officers patrolling the stadium and surrounding areas and 2,200 more in central paris . the dfb said two bodyguards will be traveling with the german team , mainly to help guarantee the team 's security at the hotel , le meredien etoile .

" we 'll brief them on the situation and give them the necessary information , just like we have done at other international matches , " he said . 2,000 germans expected to make trip to paris trouble is also possible from germany 's fans , who are not known for their openness and tolerance during soccer matches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all german fans are out for a good time during the 1998 world cup in france , hundreds of german hooligans battled with riot police in lens and brutally beat gendarme daniel nivel into a coma .
the dfb said in a statement that it had personally invited nivel , his wife and two sons to a game of the 2006 world cup in germany , as a gesture of reconciliation . the attack on nivel left him in a coma for six weeks and permanently brain damaged .
he still has difficulties moving and speaking and can not remember what happened . more recently , 40 german fans were arrested in slovenia for rioting that involved over 200 fans during a march international . but german soccer and security officials have spent much more time with keeping german fans safe , rather than focusing on possible confrontations between german hooligans and rioters . the german foreign ministry has warned the some 2,000 fans expected to travel to paris to be especially aware of their surroundings .
and , german insurers are also cautioning fans who plan to drive their cars to the match that their policies likely wo n't cover any damage should things get out of hand . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de can germany pass its french test ?

experts say foreign policy under her will lead to warmer ties with the us , but it wo n't translate into major policy changes . germany 's conservatives led by angela merkel and the social democrats agreed on the second so-called " grand coalition " in germany 's postwar history on friday . the move paves the way for 51-year-old angela merkel , a former scientist who grew up in the communist former east germany , to become germany 's first female chancellor .
she is expected to be sworn in later this month provided separate party conferences on monday endorse the coalition deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's rival politicians have forged a power-sharing deal on friday , merkel was optimistic that the new grand coalition would work for germany .
" i think that this can be a coalition of new possibilities , " merkel said , adding it offered germany " a real chance " to pull itself out of its ongoing economic crisis . the new government 's power-sharing agreement broadly outlines reform measures aimed at reviving the stagnant german economy , slashing mounting public deficit and tackling the chronically high unemployment rate . " change in style and rhetoric " analysts however are n't expecting significant change on the foreign policy front .
they do however admit that german relations with the us will be become warmer given that merkel 's conservatives are overwhelmingly in favor of closer transatlantic ties and repairing the damage inflicted upon it by chancellor schröder 's government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush , left , and merkel in mainz in germany " i think the big change you 're going see is one in style and rhetoric , " karen donfried , senior director of the german marshall fund in washington . " it will be very different under angela merkel , " she said .
" the role of the central east europeans will be more prominent and central east europeans are very close us allies . " reform drive crucial for better ties with us jackson james , executive director of the american institute for contemporary german studies , said transatlantic relations under the new government hinge on whether merkel can make headway on the domestic front with critical economic reforms . " the success of germany 's reforms will have important implications for europe and the united states , " james told a congressional hearing this week on the german elections and their implications for us-german ties . " the ability of germany to meet its foreign policy responsibilities in terms of defense allocations , its presence in regional hot spots like the balkans and the middle east , and its role in the international financial institutions will depend on achieving a sustainable level of economic growth . " thomas kleine brockhoff , washington bureau chief of the german newsweekly die zeit , summed up merkel 's foreign policy agenda saying it would include " less france and more united states , less russia and more poland , no eu-membership for turkey . " analysts , however , noted that though merkel is opposed to turkey joining the european union , there was no indication that she would stand in the way of the 10 to 15 year negotiating process , by which time she is not expected to still be chancellor . german public opinion a hurdle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans demonstrate against the us-led iraq war in 2003 in berlin they added that however much merkel may wish to improve ties with washington , one inescapable constraint will be german public opinion , which is fiercely opposed to the bush administration and its international policies . " given the unambiguous , negative view among the german public of us foreign policy and the merkel government 's need to have domestic backing for its economic and social reforms , it is difficult to see the new chancellor blazing new foreign policy paths together with washington , " donfried , who also testified this week before the committee on international relations in the us house of representatives , said . " if merkel closes the gap between the rhetoric and the policy , i think it would restore some of the trust between berlin and washington and that then probably might lead over into public opinion , " she added . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new government program comes under attack incoming chancellor angela merkel called saturday for germans to make sacrifices to help put their struggling economy back on track , but her future government 's policies are already under fire .

experts say foreign policy under her will lead to warmer ties with the us , but it wo n't translate into major policy changes . germany 's conservatives led by angela merkel and the social democrats agreed on the second so-called " grand coalition " in germany 's postwar history on friday . the move paves the way for 51-year-old angela merkel , a former scientist who grew up in the communist former east germany , to become germany 's first female chancellor .
she is expected to be sworn in later this month provided separate party conferences on monday endorse the coalition deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's rival politicians have forged a power-sharing deal on friday , merkel was optimistic that the new grand coalition would work for germany .
" i think that this can be a coalition of new possibilities , " merkel said , adding it offered germany " a real chance " to pull itself out of its ongoing economic crisis . the new government 's power-sharing agreement broadly outlines reform measures aimed at reviving the stagnant german economy , slashing mounting public deficit and tackling the chronically high unemployment rate . " change in style and rhetoric " analysts however are n't expecting significant change on the foreign policy front .
they do however admit that german relations with the us will be become warmer given that merkel 's conservatives are overwhelmingly in favor of closer transatlantic ties and repairing the damage inflicted upon it by chancellor schröder 's government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush , left , and merkel in mainz in germany " i think the big change you 're going see is one in style and rhetoric , " karen donfried , senior director of the german marshall fund in washington . " it will be very different under angela merkel , " she said .
" the role of the central east europeans will be more prominent and central east europeans are very close us allies . " reform drive crucial for better ties with us jackson james , executive director of the american institute for contemporary german studies , said transatlantic relations under the new government hinge on whether merkel can make headway on the domestic front with critical economic reforms . " the success of germany 's reforms will have important implications for europe and the united states , " james told a congressional hearing this week on the german elections and their implications for us-german ties . " the ability of germany to meet its foreign policy responsibilities in terms of defense allocations , its presence in regional hot spots like the balkans and the middle east , and its role in the international financial institutions will depend on achieving a sustainable level of economic growth . " thomas kleine brockhoff , washington bureau chief of the german newsweekly die zeit , summed up merkel 's foreign policy agenda saying it would include " less france and more united states , less russia and more poland , no eu-membership for turkey . " analysts , however , noted that though merkel is opposed to turkey joining the european union , there was no indication that she would stand in the way of the 10 to 15 year negotiating process , by which time she is not expected to still be chancellor . german public opinion a hurdle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans demonstrate against the us-led iraq war in 2003 in berlin they added that however much merkel may wish to improve ties with washington , one inescapable constraint will be german public opinion , which is fiercely opposed to the bush administration and its international policies . " given the unambiguous , negative view among the german public of us foreign policy and the merkel government 's need to have domestic backing for its economic and social reforms , it is difficult to see the new chancellor blazing new foreign policy paths together with washington , " donfried , who also testified this week before the committee on international relations in the us house of representatives , said . " if merkel closes the gap between the rhetoric and the policy , i think it would restore some of the trust between berlin and washington and that then probably might lead over into public opinion , " she added . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new government program comes under attack incoming chancellor angela merkel called saturday for germans to make sacrifices to help put their struggling economy back on track , but her future government 's policies are already under fire .

but , problems are n't expected during the international friendly . curfews may have taken the edge off much of the rioting in the suburbs outside of paris .
but , france on saturday enforced a ban on gatherings that could cause trouble in paris and thousands of police patrolled the capital to prevent urban violence reaching the heart of the city . german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- officials are keeping their eye on the security situation at saturday night 's exhibition friendly in the stade de france , located in paris ' st. denis suburb - one of the centers of the last two weeks ' nightly riots .
but , no one has considered canceling the match . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a major highway sets the stade de france from major rioting " the way things look at the moment there is no direct danger , neither for the players nor for the game , " alfred sengle , head of dfb security , told sport1.de. still , sengle and french stadium security officials remember how zinedine zidane , thierry henry , robert pires and the rest of the french and algerian teams rushed to the locker rooms when spectators were able to storm the field during a 2001 exhibition match - a situation no one wants to see repeated . over 4,000 extra police on patrol partly in response to what french security officials called an " unusually high number " of subversive e-mails and text messages , there will be an additional 2,000 police officers patrolling the stadium and surrounding areas and 2,200 more in central paris . the dfb said two bodyguards will be traveling with the german team , mainly to help guarantee the team 's security at the hotel , le meredien etoile .

" we 'll brief them on the situation and give them the necessary information , just like we have done at other international matches , " he said . 2,000 germans expected to make trip to paris trouble is also possible from germany 's fans , who are not known for their openness and tolerance during soccer matches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all german fans are out for a good time during the 1998 world cup in france , hundreds of german hooligans battled with riot police in lens and brutally beat gendarme daniel nivel into a coma .
the dfb said in a statement that it had personally invited nivel , his wife and two sons to a game of the 2006 world cup in germany , as a gesture of reconciliation . the attack on nivel left him in a coma for six weeks and permanently brain damaged .
he still has difficulties moving and speaking and can not remember what happened . more recently , 40 german fans were arrested in slovenia for rioting that involved over 200 fans during a march international . but german soccer and security officials have spent much more time with keeping german fans safe , rather than focusing on possible confrontations between german hooligans and rioters . the german foreign ministry has warned the some 2,000 fans expected to travel to paris to be especially aware of their surroundings .

experts say foreign policy under her will lead to warmer ties with the us , but it wo n't translate into major policy changes . germany 's conservatives led by angela merkel and the social democrats agreed on the second so-called " grand coalition " in germany 's postwar history on friday . the move paves the way for 51-year-old angela merkel , a former scientist who grew up in the communist former east germany , to become germany 's first female chancellor .
she is expected to be sworn in later this month provided separate party conferences on monday endorse the coalition deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's rival politicians have forged a power-sharing deal on friday , merkel was optimistic that the new grand coalition would work for germany .
" i think that this can be a coalition of new possibilities , " merkel said , adding it offered germany " a real chance " to pull itself out of its ongoing economic crisis . the new government 's power-sharing agreement broadly outlines reform measures aimed at reviving the stagnant german economy , slashing mounting public deficit and tackling the chronically high unemployment rate . " change in style and rhetoric " analysts however are n't expecting significant change on the foreign policy front .
they do however admit that german relations with the us will be become warmer given that merkel 's conservatives are overwhelmingly in favor of closer transatlantic ties and repairing the damage inflicted upon it by chancellor schröder 's government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush , left , and merkel in mainz in germany " i think the big change you 're going see is one in style and rhetoric , " karen donfried , senior director of the german marshall fund in washington . " it will be very different under angela merkel , " she said .
" the role of the central east europeans will be more prominent and central east europeans are very close us allies . " reform drive crucial for better ties with us jackson james , executive director of the american institute for contemporary german studies , said transatlantic relations under the new government hinge on whether merkel can make headway on the domestic front with critical economic reforms . " the success of germany 's reforms will have important implications for europe and the united states , " james told a congressional hearing this week on the german elections and their implications for us-german ties . " the ability of germany to meet its foreign policy responsibilities in terms of defense allocations , its presence in regional hot spots like the balkans and the middle east , and its role in the international financial institutions will depend on achieving a sustainable level of economic growth . " thomas kleine brockhoff , washington bureau chief of the german newsweekly die zeit , summed up merkel 's foreign policy agenda saying it would include " less france and more united states , less russia and more poland , no eu-membership for turkey . " analysts , however , noted that though merkel is opposed to turkey joining the european union , there was no indication that she would stand in the way of the 10 to 15 year negotiating process , by which time she is not expected to still be chancellor . german public opinion a hurdle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans demonstrate against the us-led iraq war in 2003 in berlin they added that however much merkel may wish to improve ties with washington , one inescapable constraint will be german public opinion , which is fiercely opposed to the bush administration and its international policies . " given the unambiguous , negative view among the german public of us foreign policy and the merkel government 's need to have domestic backing for its economic and social reforms , it is difficult to see the new chancellor blazing new foreign policy paths together with washington , " donfried , who also testified this week before the committee on international relations in the us house of representatives , said . " if merkel closes the gap between the rhetoric and the policy , i think it would restore some of the trust between berlin and washington and that then probably might lead over into public opinion , " she added . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new government program comes under attack incoming chancellor angela merkel called saturday for germans to make sacrifices to help put their struggling economy back on track , but her future government 's policies are already under fire .

experts say foreign policy under her will lead to warmer ties with the us , but it wo n't translate into major policy changes . germany 's conservatives led by angela merkel and the social democrats agreed on the second so-called " grand coalition " in germany 's postwar history on friday . the move paves the way for 51-year-old angela merkel , a former scientist who grew up in the communist former east germany , to become germany 's first female chancellor .
she is expected to be sworn in later this month provided separate party conferences on monday endorse the coalition deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's rival politicians have forged a power-sharing deal on friday , merkel was optimistic that the new grand coalition would work for germany .
" i think that this can be a coalition of new possibilities , " merkel said , adding it offered germany " a real chance " to pull itself out of its ongoing economic crisis . the new government 's power-sharing agreement broadly outlines reform measures aimed at reviving the stagnant german economy , slashing mounting public deficit and tackling the chronically high unemployment rate . " change in style and rhetoric " analysts however are n't expecting significant change on the foreign policy front .
they do however admit that german relations with the us will be become warmer given that merkel 's conservatives are overwhelmingly in favor of closer transatlantic ties and repairing the damage inflicted upon it by chancellor schröder 's government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush , left , and merkel in mainz in germany " i think the big change you 're going see is one in style and rhetoric , " karen donfried , senior director of the german marshall fund in washington . " it will be very different under angela merkel , " she said .
" the role of the central east europeans will be more prominent and central east europeans are very close us allies . " reform drive crucial for better ties with us jackson james , executive director of the american institute for contemporary german studies , said transatlantic relations under the new government hinge on whether merkel can make headway on the domestic front with critical economic reforms . " the success of germany 's reforms will have important implications for europe and the united states , " james told a congressional hearing this week on the german elections and their implications for us-german ties . " the ability of germany to meet its foreign policy responsibilities in terms of defense allocations , its presence in regional hot spots like the balkans and the middle east , and its role in the international financial institutions will depend on achieving a sustainable level of economic growth . " thomas kleine brockhoff , washington bureau chief of the german newsweekly die zeit , summed up merkel 's foreign policy agenda saying it would include " less france and more united states , less russia and more poland , no eu-membership for turkey . " analysts , however , noted that though merkel is opposed to turkey joining the european union , there was no indication that she would stand in the way of the 10 to 15 year negotiating process , by which time she is not expected to still be chancellor . german public opinion a hurdle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans demonstrate against the us-led iraq war in 2003 in berlin they added that however much merkel may wish to improve ties with washington , one inescapable constraint will be german public opinion , which is fiercely opposed to the bush administration and its international policies . " given the unambiguous , negative view among the german public of us foreign policy and the merkel government 's need to have domestic backing for its economic and social reforms , it is difficult to see the new chancellor blazing new foreign policy paths together with washington , " donfried , who also testified this week before the committee on international relations in the us house of representatives , said . " if merkel closes the gap between the rhetoric and the policy , i think it would restore some of the trust between berlin and washington and that then probably might lead over into public opinion , " she added . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new government program comes under attack incoming chancellor angela merkel called saturday for germans to make sacrifices to help put their struggling economy back on track , but her future government 's policies are already under fire .

are they good enough to beat a slowed , but still strong les bleus ? the last time germany beat france , holocaust author eli wiesel won the nobel peace prize , scientology founder l. ron hubbard died and tom cruise was riding the skies of soviet fighters in " top gun . " west germany beat france 2-0 in the semifinal of the 1986 world cup , going on to lose to argentina 3-2 in the final , with diego maradona providing some unforgettable on-field magic . germany and france meet again in an exhibition friendly at paris ' stade de france on saturday evening .
while the meeting is not nearly as important as a world cup semi-final , it is the last litmus test for jürgen klinsmann 's team of yearlings against a squad still considered one of the world 's best . " we 'll see where we stand against a team like that , it 'll be a real test of where we are , " said germany captain michael ballack . paris shoot-out ballack and striker miroslav klose , both injured and unable to take part in germany 's 2-1 embarrassment against turkey a few weeks ago , are ready to roll .
their talents on the attack will be desperately needed in what could shape up to be a shoot-out with les bleus , who , even without playmaker zinadine zidane , boast some of the world 's best strikers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thierry henry is one of the best strikers in the world arsenal 's thierry henry capped a second-half comeback against costa rica in a friendly match on wednesday by knocking in the go-ahead goal with his heel .
david trezeguet , who plays for juventus turin , beat bayern munich in a champion 's league match last week with a second-half goal .
if they 're coming up blank , france still has liverpool 's djibril cisse as well as the enigmatic and controversial nicolas anelka ready for a go from the bench after having marked his national team comeback with a goal on wednesday . german defense put to true test absorbing this attack will be the young german defense that has yet to find its rhythm .
germany 's backline is by far klinsmann 's biggest problem area at the moment .
youth and inexperience are the main culprits in a defense that has shown itself to be more sieve than wall and has become the pundits ' punching bag in the months leading up to june 's world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann will spend more time worrying about his defense than taking in the paris sights hopes that the dortmund back christoph metzelder , still on the comeback trail from a devastating injury sustained after his break-out performance in the 2002 world cup , would be able to help anchor germany 's defense were dashed on wednesday when he pulled up lame in training .
it will be offensive-minded arne friedrich , chelsea substitute robert huth and 20-year-old lukas sinkewiecz who will be there to pick up the slack . france also is not exactly shining at the moment .
despite only losing once in the past 38 games , les bleus struggled mightily in their qualification group , finishing first -and avoiding a play-off - only after switzerland failed to score a goal against ireland in the last match .
switzerland will play turkey saturday in the first of two play-off matches . oldies still goodies many experts credit the team 's last minute surge to the return of midfield superstar zidane , who decided to rethink his retirement from the national team .
midfielder claude makalele and defensive bedrock liliam thuram followed his lead and rejoined the team as well , rebuilding the core that led france to glory in the 1998 world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the soccer god is back - will it make a difference in the world cup ? german soccer " kaiser " franz beckenbauer said the hope for the german team might be that the match is more important for klinsmann 's youngsters than it is to france 's established superstars . " a win , or an exciting 90 minutes will provide jürgen klinsmann and his team the right atmosphere to go into the world cup year , " he wrote in his weekly column in the tabloid bild newspaper on friday . klinsmann himself emphasized this week the importance of going into the three-month international break with fond memories . going out with a bang , and extra protection " it 's the last match of a moving year , and the impressions will stay , " he said .

it reveals a sordid saga and estimates wrongdoing among senior management cost vw millions . fraud and betrayal , lavish parties and visits to the red light district at the company ’ s cost ...
they sound like the plot elements of a thriller , but the allegations that have been flying around volkswagen headquarters in wolfsburg in recent months are very real . volkswagen hired auditing firm kpmg to scrutinize company procedures on the first of july , three days after it asked german prosecutors to investigate two former human resources executives for fraud . it was alleged helmuth schuster and klaus-joachim gebauer had set up shell companies in a number of countries , including india and the czech republic , to win business from the carmaker . sleaze and bribery members of the company ’ s works council were allegedly ‘ bought ’ , while personnel managers , on the other hand , made deals that weren ’ t in the interest of the company , incurring losses worth millions of euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vw logo which has stood for sturdy quality is now tarnished but , the most sensational element of the volkswagen scandal story is the allegation that the company ’ s board sent members of the works council on expensive sex holidays .
in return , works council members rubber-stamped board resolutions .
the procedure saw unconfirmed expense claims of up to 30,000 euros approved . the volkswagen scandal became public after a network of letter-box companies was uncovered .
it ’ s alleged helmuth schuster , the former personnel chief of vw-subsidiary skoda , used the companies as a front to channel funds into his own pockets . an indian state government also accuses schuster of demanding two million euros in kickbacks in exchange for his promise that volkswagen would build a plant in their region . wrongdoing right up to top rungs it wasn ’ t long before investigations into the network of front companies turned up another name : klaus-joachim gebauer , volkswagen ’ s former personnel manager .
it ’ s alleged he organized several sex parties that later came to haunt several members of the works council . " some of the things that have been said are true , " gebauer said .
" the one thing i regret is that , through other people , i got into a situation i don ’ t want to be in . " but the scandal doesn ’ t end there .
even the long-serving and influential head of the works council , klaus volkert , has caught the eye of prosecutors . but volkert maintains fraud allegations are unfounded . " the short version is : i ’ m not aware of any wrongdoing .
i have no idea why i have the ‘ honor ’ of being subject to this media witch-hunt , " volkert said . hartz resignation trade union officials say the scandal is partly a conspiracy to weaken employee representation at volkswagen .
they argue that a strong works council and union have long been a thorn in the side of volkswagen ’ s top management . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beleagured vw manager peter hartz stepped down recently fraud allegations also led to recent resignation of human resources executive peter hartz .
for years hartz stood as one of the supporting pillars of the so-called “ vw-system ” of close cooperation between top management and employee representatives . he “ invented ” of the four-day-week - cutting working hours without compensatory wage increases - and even had national labor market reforms named after him , before he had to admit he ’ d made mistakes at volkswagen by not keeping tight enough control of his employees . vw moves to stem damage all in all , the kpmg report estimates the scandal has cost volkswagen a total of five million euros , although further investigations could see that figure rise . as the initial fallout of the scandal settles , chief executive bernd pischetsrieder says he ’ s taking steps to make volkswagen a ‘ more transparent company internally and externally ’ . under a new ombudsman system , volkswagen will assign two lawyers to deal with allegations throughout the corporation .
company employees will then be able to give them anonymous tips on corrupt activities . top management at wolfsburg say they want investigators to get to the bottom of the scandal . it ’ s a call echoed by the premier of the of lower saxony christian wulff .
his federal state is volkswagen ’ s largest shareholder . " those guilty of wrongdoing will have to clear their desks and accept responsibility for what they did , ” wulff said . “ then we ’ ll put systems in place to ensure this can never be repeated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst neumann faces a challenging time at vw volkswagen announced on friday that horst neumann has been named to replace hartz . neumann , who currently oversees human resources as a board member at volkswagen ’ s subsidiary audi , will start his new job on december 1 . monika lohmüller -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany rocked by damning report on un scandal news of the involvement of leading german companies in kickbacks to saddam hussein 's regime during the un oil-for-food program has stunned germany and prompted calls for speedy legal action .

are they good enough to beat a slowed , but still strong les bleus ? the last time germany beat france , holocaust author eli wiesel won the nobel peace prize , scientology founder l. ron hubbard died and tom cruise was riding the skies of soviet fighters in " top gun . " west germany beat france 2-0 in the semifinal of the 1986 world cup , going on to lose to argentina 3-2 in the final , with diego maradona providing some unforgettable on-field magic . germany and france meet again in an exhibition friendly at paris ' stade de france on saturday evening .
while the meeting is not nearly as important as a world cup semi-final , it is the last litmus test for jürgen klinsmann 's team of yearlings against a squad still considered one of the world 's best . " we 'll see where we stand against a team like that , it 'll be a real test of where we are , " said germany captain michael ballack . paris shoot-out ballack and striker miroslav klose , both injured and unable to take part in germany 's 2-1 embarrassment against turkey a few weeks ago , are ready to roll .
their talents on the attack will be desperately needed in what could shape up to be a shoot-out with les bleus , who , even without playmaker zinadine zidane , boast some of the world 's best strikers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thierry henry is one of the best strikers in the world arsenal 's thierry henry capped a second-half comeback against costa rica in a friendly match on wednesday by knocking in the go-ahead goal with his heel .

if they 're coming up blank , france still has liverpool 's djibril cisse as well as the enigmatic and controversial nicolas anelka ready for a go from the bench after having marked his national team comeback with a goal on wednesday . german defense put to true test absorbing this attack will be the young german defense that has yet to find its rhythm .
germany 's backline is by far klinsmann 's biggest problem area at the moment .
youth and inexperience are the main culprits in a defense that has shown itself to be more sieve than wall and has become the pundits ' punching bag in the months leading up to june 's world cup .

it will be offensive-minded arne friedrich , chelsea substitute robert huth and 20-year-old lukas sinkewiecz who will be there to pick up the slack . france also is not exactly shining at the moment .
despite only losing once in the past 38 games , les bleus struggled mightily in their qualification group , finishing first -and avoiding a play-off - only after switzerland failed to score a goal against ireland in the last match .
switzerland will play turkey saturday in the first of two play-off matches . oldies still goodies many experts credit the team 's last minute surge to the return of midfield superstar zidane , who decided to rethink his retirement from the national team .
midfielder claude makalele and defensive bedrock liliam thuram followed his lead and rejoined the team as well , rebuilding the core that led france to glory in the 1998 world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the soccer god is back - will it make a difference in the world cup ? german soccer " kaiser " franz beckenbauer said the hope for the german team might be that the match is more important for klinsmann 's youngsters than it is to france 's established superstars . " a win , or an exciting 90 minutes will provide jürgen klinsmann and his team the right atmosphere to go into the world cup year , " he wrote in his weekly column in the tabloid bild newspaper on friday . klinsmann himself emphasized this week the importance of going into the three-month international break with fond memories . going out with a bang , and extra protection " it 's the last match of a moving year , and the impressions will stay , " he said .

they all have to win two-legged playoffs if they do n't want to face their fans ' scorn .
the first games are saturday , with the final decision coming on wednesday . the stress that comes with having to win a playoff was best summed up by slovakian coach dusan galis , who wants to lead his team to the world cup finals for the first time since the nation gained its independence 12 years ago . " i 'm not interested in anything else .
having a good feeling from a good performance and losing with honor - i will not be satisfied with anything like that , " galis told reporters .
" we have gone this far , so we are able to make the last step . " slovakia looks to fate to beat spain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain will start the playoffs in front of a home crowd but arsenal striker jose antonio reyes is confident he and the rest of the heavily favored spanish team have enough class to beat the slovakians and make it to their eighth consecutive world cup finals . " we are the better team and we are going to prove it , " reyes said .
" i am convinced we are going to score goals , and a 2-0 score line would be ideal to take to slovakia . " slovakia hope to fate on their side , spain has qualified for every finals since 1974 , when they were held , ironically , in west germany .
morale in the slovakian camp is also at a high after they eliminated russia from the finals .
if galis ' team can keep spain from running rampant saturday in madrid , they may still have a chance wednesday in bratislava , where they have n't lost since june 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norway surprised brazil , now they 'll try to beat the czechs for a trip to the world cup norway always good for a surprise norway will be rated underdogs against the czechs who are rated the fourth best team in the world in fifa 's rankings and come into the playoff as firm favorites .
but norway will hope to rekindle the spirit of ' 98 when they stunned brazil 2-1 in the first round of the world cup in france . norway midfielder morten gamst pedersen said he smells an upset in the oslo air and is confident his team will make it to their first finals since 1998 . " it 's two big games against the czech republic but we have beaten big teams before and we will do it again , " the 24-year-old blackburn rovers player told uefa.com. the czechs have already complained about oslo 's wet , muddy pitch that could hamper their passing game , and even though norway finished second in their group , they will have a lot of improving to do before they make it germany . closest match between turkey and switzerland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey beat germany 2-1 in october whichever of the evenly matched teams wins saturday will have an even bigger psychological advantage than usual going into wednesday 's final in turkey . turkish coach fatih terim is already resigned to fielding a team in berne without hertha berlin midfielder yildiray basturk and besiktas midfielder ibrahim akin with knee problems , and now major fitness doubts hanging over striker hasan sas and defender tolga seyhan as well . in what may amount to matches between the walking wounded , switzerland coach köbi kuhn has injury concerns of his own , with striker johan vonlanthen tearing a ligament in his foot in training on thursday and there are also doubts over captain johann vogel and defender boris smiljanic 's fitness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uruguay striker diego forlan will attack the socceroos two intercontinental playoffs remain two-time world cup winners uruguay are hoping to take a huge step towards the 2006 tournament by sending out an attack-minded line-up for playoff against australia . the maturing socceroos ' chances of making it to their first world cup since 1974 appear more positive under the guidance of dutchman guus hiddink .
the aussies ' main problem will be up front in the offense .
harry kewell , who has played for liverpool just twice since returning from groin surgery , could however come off the bench late in the match in an attempt to steal a vital away goal in uruguay . " i think it will be a very closely contested game , and it will also be physical , " said uruguay defender dario rodriguez , who plays club soccer for schalke 04 .
" for us the objective is simple .
we have to go out and get three points so that we can travel to australia with no pressure . " gifts promised to bahrain 's goal scorers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bahrain 's mohammed hubail , left , tied with uzbekistan to qualify for the playoffs trinidad and tobago are approaching the last of the world cup playoffs against bahrain with the same setup they used in qualifying . " why should i change anything ? "
trinidad and tobago coach leo beenhakker said .
" little by little the team has been growing and playing better and better . " the two matches will be a clash of styles as beenhakker 's side is known for its attacking flair while bahrain are known for layering their rearguard and patiently biding time for the perfect counterattack . according to media reports bahrain players , however , will have an added incentive to score in the playoffs .

but , problems are n't expected during the international friendly . curfews may have taken the edge off much of the rioting in the suburbs outside of paris .
but , france on saturday enforced a ban on gatherings that could cause trouble in paris and thousands of police patrolled the capital to prevent urban violence reaching the heart of the city . german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- officials are keeping their eye on the security situation at saturday night 's exhibition friendly in the stade de france , located in paris ' st. denis suburb - one of the centers of the last two weeks ' nightly riots .
but , no one has considered canceling the match . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a major highway sets the stade de france from major rioting " the way things look at the moment there is no direct danger , neither for the players nor for the game , " alfred sengle , head of dfb security , told sport1.de. still , sengle and french stadium security officials remember how zinedine zidane , thierry henry , robert pires and the rest of the french and algerian teams rushed to the locker rooms when spectators were able to storm the field during a 2001 exhibition match - a situation no one wants to see repeated . over 4,000 extra police on patrol partly in response to what french security officials called an " unusually high number " of subversive e-mails and text messages , there will be an additional 2,000 police officers patrolling the stadium and surrounding areas and 2,200 more in central paris . the dfb said two bodyguards will be traveling with the german team , mainly to help guarantee the team 's security at the hotel , le meredien etoile .
visiting international teams normally leave all security measures to local authorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : players are concentrating on soccer , not security " naturally we hope that everything goes well and that we can concentrate on sports , but we do n't want to leave anything to chance , " german team manager oliver bierhoff said this week . though the players have not commented on playing in a city that has produced nightly images of burning cars , german coach jürgen klinsmann said he 'd take some extra time to give his players a run-down on the political situation . " we 'll brief them on the situation and give them the necessary information , just like we have done at other international matches , " he said . 2,000 germans expected to make trip to paris trouble is also possible from germany 's fans , who are not known for their openness and tolerance during soccer matches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all german fans are out for a good time during the 1998 world cup in france , hundreds of german hooligans battled with riot police in lens and brutally beat gendarme daniel nivel into a coma .
the dfb said in a statement that it had personally invited nivel , his wife and two sons to a game of the 2006 world cup in germany , as a gesture of reconciliation . the attack on nivel left him in a coma for six weeks and permanently brain damaged .
he still has difficulties moving and speaking and can not remember what happened . more recently , 40 german fans were arrested in slovenia for rioting that involved over 200 fans during a march international . but german soccer and security officials have spent much more time with keeping german fans safe , rather than focusing on possible confrontations between german hooligans and rioters . the german foreign ministry has warned the some 2,000 fans expected to travel to paris to be especially aware of their surroundings .
and , german insurers are also cautioning fans who plan to drive their cars to the match that their policies likely wo n't cover any damage should things get out of hand . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de can germany pass its french test ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the road to the chancellery opinion : germany 's new opposition the crunch issues schröder confirms exit ; slams bush the chancellor vote explained germany -pipe- 12.11.2005 experts say merkel will bring change in style , not policy for us großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's always favored close relations with the us germany finally has a coalition deal , paving the way for angela merkel to become chancellor .
experts say foreign policy under her will lead to warmer ties with the us , but it wo n't translate into major policy changes . germany 's conservatives led by angela merkel and the social democrats agreed on the second so-called " grand coalition " in germany 's postwar history on friday . the move paves the way for 51-year-old angela merkel , a former scientist who grew up in the communist former east germany , to become germany 's first female chancellor .
she is expected to be sworn in later this month provided separate party conferences on monday endorse the coalition deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's rival politicians have forged a power-sharing deal on friday , merkel was optimistic that the new grand coalition would work for germany .
" i think that this can be a coalition of new possibilities , " merkel said , adding it offered germany " a real chance " to pull itself out of its ongoing economic crisis . the new government 's power-sharing agreement broadly outlines reform measures aimed at reviving the stagnant german economy , slashing mounting public deficit and tackling the chronically high unemployment rate . " change in style and rhetoric " analysts however are n't expecting significant change on the foreign policy front .
they do however admit that german relations with the us will be become warmer given that merkel 's conservatives are overwhelmingly in favor of closer transatlantic ties and repairing the damage inflicted upon it by chancellor schröder 's government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush , left , and merkel in mainz in germany " i think the big change you 're going see is one in style and rhetoric , " karen donfried , senior director of the german marshall fund in washington . " it will be very different under angela merkel , " she said .
" the role of the central east europeans will be more prominent and central east europeans are very close us allies . " reform drive crucial for better ties with us jackson james , executive director of the american institute for contemporary german studies , said transatlantic relations under the new government hinge on whether merkel can make headway on the domestic front with critical economic reforms . " the success of germany 's reforms will have important implications for europe and the united states , " james told a congressional hearing this week on the german elections and their implications for us-german ties . " the ability of germany to meet its foreign policy responsibilities in terms of defense allocations , its presence in regional hot spots like the balkans and the middle east , and its role in the international financial institutions will depend on achieving a sustainable level of economic growth . " thomas kleine brockhoff , washington bureau chief of the german newsweekly die zeit , summed up merkel 's foreign policy agenda saying it would include " less france and more united states , less russia and more poland , no eu-membership for turkey . " analysts , however , noted that though merkel is opposed to turkey joining the european union , there was no indication that she would stand in the way of the 10 to 15 year negotiating process , by which time she is not expected to still be chancellor . german public opinion a hurdle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans demonstrate against the us-led iraq war in 2003 in berlin they added that however much merkel may wish to improve ties with washington , one inescapable constraint will be german public opinion , which is fiercely opposed to the bush administration and its international policies . " given the unambiguous , negative view among the german public of us foreign policy and the merkel government 's need to have domestic backing for its economic and social reforms , it is difficult to see the new chancellor blazing new foreign policy paths together with washington , " donfried , who also testified this week before the committee on international relations in the us house of representatives , said . " if merkel closes the gap between the rhetoric and the policy , i think it would restore some of the trust between berlin and washington and that then probably might lead over into public opinion , " she added . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new government program comes under attack incoming chancellor angela merkel called saturday for germans to make sacrifices to help put their struggling economy back on track , but her future government 's policies are already under fire .

experts say foreign policy under her will lead to warmer ties with the us , but it wo n't translate into major policy changes . germany 's conservatives led by angela merkel and the social democrats agreed on the second so-called " grand coalition " in germany 's postwar history on friday . the move paves the way for 51-year-old angela merkel , a former scientist who grew up in the communist former east germany , to become germany 's first female chancellor .
she is expected to be sworn in later this month provided separate party conferences on monday endorse the coalition deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's rival politicians have forged a power-sharing deal on friday , merkel was optimistic that the new grand coalition would work for germany .
" i think that this can be a coalition of new possibilities , " merkel said , adding it offered germany " a real chance " to pull itself out of its ongoing economic crisis . the new government 's power-sharing agreement broadly outlines reform measures aimed at reviving the stagnant german economy , slashing mounting public deficit and tackling the chronically high unemployment rate . " change in style and rhetoric " analysts however are n't expecting significant change on the foreign policy front .
they do however admit that german relations with the us will be become warmer given that merkel 's conservatives are overwhelmingly in favor of closer transatlantic ties and repairing the damage inflicted upon it by chancellor schröder 's government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush , left , and merkel in mainz in germany " i think the big change you 're going see is one in style and rhetoric , " karen donfried , senior director of the german marshall fund in washington .

" the role of the central east europeans will be more prominent and central east europeans are very close us allies . " reform drive crucial for better ties with us jackson james , executive director of the american institute for contemporary german studies , said transatlantic relations under the new government hinge on whether merkel can make headway on the domestic front with critical economic reforms . " the success of germany 's reforms will have important implications for europe and the united states , " james told a congressional hearing this week on the german elections and their implications for us-german ties . " the ability of germany to meet its foreign policy responsibilities in terms of defense allocations , its presence in regional hot spots like the balkans and the middle east , and its role in the international financial institutions will depend on achieving a sustainable level of economic growth .

it reveals a sordid saga and estimates wrongdoing among senior management cost vw millions . fraud and betrayal , lavish parties and visits to the red light district at the company ’ s cost ...
they sound like the plot elements of a thriller , but the allegations that have been flying around volkswagen headquarters in wolfsburg in recent months are very real . volkswagen hired auditing firm kpmg to scrutinize company procedures on the first of july , three days after it asked german prosecutors to investigate two former human resources executives for fraud . it was alleged helmuth schuster and klaus-joachim gebauer had set up shell companies in a number of countries , including india and the czech republic , to win business from the carmaker . sleaze and bribery members of the company ’ s works council were allegedly ‘ bought ’ , while personnel managers , on the other hand , made deals that weren ’ t in the interest of the company , incurring losses worth millions of euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vw logo which has stood for sturdy quality is now tarnished but , the most sensational element of the volkswagen scandal story is the allegation that the company ’ s board sent members of the works council on expensive sex holidays .
in return , works council members rubber-stamped board resolutions .
the procedure saw unconfirmed expense claims of up to 30,000 euros approved . the volkswagen scandal became public after a network of letter-box companies was uncovered .
it ’ s alleged helmuth schuster , the former personnel chief of vw-subsidiary skoda , used the companies as a front to channel funds into his own pockets . an indian state government also accuses schuster of demanding two million euros in kickbacks in exchange for his promise that volkswagen would build a plant in their region . wrongdoing right up to top rungs it wasn ’ t long before investigations into the network of front companies turned up another name : klaus-joachim gebauer , volkswagen ’ s former personnel manager .
it ’ s alleged he organized several sex parties that later came to haunt several members of the works council . " some of the things that have been said are true , " gebauer said .
" the one thing i regret is that , through other people , i got into a situation i don ’ t want to be in . " but the scandal doesn ’ t end there .
even the long-serving and influential head of the works council , klaus volkert , has caught the eye of prosecutors . but volkert maintains fraud allegations are unfounded . " the short version is : i ’ m not aware of any wrongdoing .
i have no idea why i have the ‘ honor ’ of being subject to this media witch-hunt , " volkert said . hartz resignation trade union officials say the scandal is partly a conspiracy to weaken employee representation at volkswagen .
they argue that a strong works council and union have long been a thorn in the side of volkswagen ’ s top management . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beleagured vw manager peter hartz stepped down recently fraud allegations also led to recent resignation of human resources executive peter hartz .
for years hartz stood as one of the supporting pillars of the so-called “ vw-system ” of close cooperation between top management and employee representatives . he “ invented ” of the four-day-week - cutting working hours without compensatory wage increases - and even had national labor market reforms named after him , before he had to admit he ’ d made mistakes at volkswagen by not keeping tight enough control of his employees . vw moves to stem damage all in all , the kpmg report estimates the scandal has cost volkswagen a total of five million euros , although further investigations could see that figure rise . as the initial fallout of the scandal settles , chief executive bernd pischetsrieder says he ’ s taking steps to make volkswagen a ‘ more transparent company internally and externally ’ . under a new ombudsman system , volkswagen will assign two lawyers to deal with allegations throughout the corporation .
company employees will then be able to give them anonymous tips on corrupt activities . top management at wolfsburg say they want investigators to get to the bottom of the scandal . it ’ s a call echoed by the premier of the of lower saxony christian wulff .
his federal state is volkswagen ’ s largest shareholder . " those guilty of wrongdoing will have to clear their desks and accept responsibility for what they did , ” wulff said . “ then we ’ ll put systems in place to ensure this can never be repeated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst neumann faces a challenging time at vw volkswagen announced on friday that horst neumann has been named to replace hartz . neumann , who currently oversees human resources as a board member at volkswagen ’ s subsidiary audi , will start his new job on december 1 . monika lohmüller -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany rocked by damning report on un scandal news of the involvement of leading german companies in kickbacks to saddam hussein 's regime during the un oil-for-food program has stunned germany and prompted calls for speedy legal action .

they sound like the plot elements of a thriller , but the allegations that have been flying around volkswagen headquarters in wolfsburg in recent months are very real . volkswagen hired auditing firm kpmg to scrutinize company procedures on the first of july , three days after it asked german prosecutors to investigate two former human resources executives for fraud . it was alleged helmuth schuster and klaus-joachim gebauer had set up shell companies in a number of countries , including india and the czech republic , to win business from the carmaker . sleaze and bribery members of the company ’ s works council were allegedly ‘ bought ’ , while personnel managers , on the other hand , made deals that weren ’ t in the interest of the company , incurring losses worth millions of euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vw logo which has stood for sturdy quality is now tarnished but , the most sensational element of the volkswagen scandal story is the allegation that the company ’ s board sent members of the works council on expensive sex holidays .
in return , works council members rubber-stamped board resolutions .
the procedure saw unconfirmed expense claims of up to 30,000 euros approved . the volkswagen scandal became public after a network of letter-box companies was uncovered .
it ’ s alleged helmuth schuster , the former personnel chief of vw-subsidiary skoda , used the companies as a front to channel funds into his own pockets . an indian state government also accuses schuster of demanding two million euros in kickbacks in exchange for his promise that volkswagen would build a plant in their region . wrongdoing right up to top rungs it wasn ’ t long before investigations into the network of front companies turned up another name : klaus-joachim gebauer , volkswagen ’ s former personnel manager .
it ’ s alleged he organized several sex parties that later came to haunt several members of the works council . " some of the things that have been said are true , " gebauer said .
" the one thing i regret is that , through other people , i got into a situation i don ’ t want to be in . " but the scandal doesn ’ t end there .
even the long-serving and influential head of the works council , klaus volkert , has caught the eye of prosecutors . but volkert maintains fraud allegations are unfounded . " the short version is : i ’ m not aware of any wrongdoing .
i have no idea why i have the ‘ honor ’ of being subject to this media witch-hunt , " volkert said . hartz resignation trade union officials say the scandal is partly a conspiracy to weaken employee representation at volkswagen .
they argue that a strong works council and union have long been a thorn in the side of volkswagen ’ s top management . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beleagured vw manager peter hartz stepped down recently fraud allegations also led to recent resignation of human resources executive peter hartz .
for years hartz stood as one of the supporting pillars of the so-called “ vw-system ” of close cooperation between top management and employee representatives . he “ invented ” of the four-day-week - cutting working hours without compensatory wage increases - and even had national labor market reforms named after him , before he had to admit he ’ d made mistakes at volkswagen by not keeping tight enough control of his employees . vw moves to stem damage all in all , the kpmg report estimates the scandal has cost volkswagen a total of five million euros , although further investigations could see that figure rise . as the initial fallout of the scandal settles , chief executive bernd pischetsrieder says he ’ s taking steps to make volkswagen a ‘ more transparent company internally and externally ’ . under a new ombudsman system , volkswagen will assign two lawyers to deal with allegations throughout the corporation .
company employees will then be able to give them anonymous tips on corrupt activities . top management at wolfsburg say they want investigators to get to the bottom of the scandal . it ’ s a call echoed by the premier of the of lower saxony christian wulff .
his federal state is volkswagen ’ s largest shareholder . " those guilty of wrongdoing will have to clear their desks and accept responsibility for what they did , ” wulff said . “ then we ’ ll put systems in place to ensure this can never be repeated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst neumann faces a challenging time at vw volkswagen announced on friday that horst neumann has been named to replace hartz . neumann , who currently oversees human resources as a board member at volkswagen ’ s subsidiary audi , will start his new job on december 1 . monika lohmüller -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany rocked by damning report on un scandal news of the involvement of leading german companies in kickbacks to saddam hussein 's regime during the un oil-for-food program has stunned germany and prompted calls for speedy legal action .

lord armstrong said the details broke personal confidences , while lord butler said the relationship between ministers and civil servants could be threatened .
critics including lord heseltine say sir christopher should quit as press complaints commission chairman .
he has not commented on the furore over his memoirs of the six years to 2003 .
i think that christopher meyer should leave his position as chairman of the pcc lord heseltine analysis : memoirs turn to pm extracts of the book , dc confidential have been published in two newspapers .
in the extracts , sir christopher calls some ministers " pygmies " .
he also criticises prime minister tony blair for failing to use his leverage in washington to delay the iraq war to allow for better planning for the post-saddam hussein era .
' maintain confidences ' but lord butler told bbc radio 4 's the week in westminster books like sir christopher 's " inhibited frank conversation " between ministers and officials .
" the position of a civil servant and the position of an ambassador is that you have to be the link between the politician and the government , " he said .

the scientists say that rising temperatures caused by greenhouse gases are increasing humidity , which in turn amplifies the temperature rise .
this is potentially a positive feedback mechanism which could increase the impact of greenhouse gases such as co2 .
the research is published in the journal geophysical research letters .
the scientists involved have used research networks and weather stations across europe to measure temperature , humidity and longwave radiation , which plays a key role in the greenhouse effect .
not from the sun " we observed that between 1995 and 2002 , the amount of longwave radiation coming downwards to the earth in europe increased significantly , whereas solar radiation did not , " said study leader rolf philipona , from the world radiation center in davos , switzerland .
longwave radiation comes from molecules of gases such as carbon dioxide , methane , and water vapour which have absorbed solar radiation after it has hit the earth 's surface and been reflected back up through the atmosphere .
" we wondered if this effect was simply because of a temperature increase at the surface - you would just get more radiation going up , and so more coming back down , " dr philipona told the bbc news website .
" but we allowed for this , and for the impact of extra clouds , but still we found an increase . "
the researchers calculated that this increase is partly down to higher concentrations of the gases such as carbon dioxide which are often described as causing the " man-made greenhouse effect " ; but increased water vapour appears to have a larger effect , accounting for about 70 % of the observed temperature rise .
not all regions of europe are affected equally .
between 1995 and 2002 , eastern states appear to have warmed by a rate equivalent to about 2c per decade - considerably faster than their western counterparts .
according to the new study , that may well be down to humidity differences ; broadly speaking , humidity has risen fast in the east but not in the west , where evaporation may be limited by the dryness of the iberian peninsula .
undervalued water although rising concentrations of carbon dioxide , methane , nitrous oxides and other gases are almost certainly driving the global rise in temperature observed in recent decades , the natural greenhouse effect - without which the world would be considerably colder - is largely down to atmospheric water vapour .
because human activities change its concentrations very little , it is generally not mentioned in discussions of modern-day greenhouse warming .
but climate scientists have been aware for decades that mechanisms involving water vapour could amplify temperature increases , and have attempted to model these effects in computer simulations .
researchers sceptical about projections of human-induced climate change base their criticism partly on what they see as flawed simulations of water vapour and clouds .
so will this discovery force a re-evaluation of climate models ?
william ingram , from the uk 's meteorological office and oxford university , believes not .
" this careful study confirms that this aspect of the climate system is behaving broadly as expected , " he told the bbc news website .
" it is therefore consistent with projections by the scientific consensus . "
local hotspots arctic ice disappearing fast heat makes plants warm planet but rolf philipona believes there might be regional implications which had not been appreciated before .
" there will be some parts of the world affected by strong feedback and others not - perhaps even a drying in some places , " he said .
" we would see that water vapour would go up where there is enough water on the ground . "
an increased concentration of water vapour is just one of the feedback mechanisms which could change or amplify the progress of human-induced global warming .
others include : melting of ice , leading to a greater absorption of sunlight the conversion of forests from net absorbers of carbon dioxide to net producers the release of trapped methane from permafrost .
recent studies indicate that the first two of these mechanisms may already be in train .

the scientists say that rising temperatures caused by greenhouse gases are increasing humidity , which in turn amplifies the temperature rise .
this is potentially a positive feedback mechanism which could increase the impact of greenhouse gases such as co2 .
the research is published in the journal geophysical research letters .
the scientists involved have used research networks and weather stations across europe to measure temperature , humidity and longwave radiation , which plays a key role in the greenhouse effect .
not from the sun " we observed that between 1995 and 2002 , the amount of longwave radiation coming downwards to the earth in europe increased significantly , whereas solar radiation did not , " said study leader rolf philipona , from the world radiation center in davos , switzerland .
animated guide : climate change longwave radiation comes from molecules of gases such as carbon dioxide , methane , and water vapour which have absorbed solar radiation after it has hit the earth 's surface and been reflected back up through the atmosphere .
" we wondered if this effect was simply because of a temperature increase at the surface - you would just get more radiation going up , and so more coming back down , " dr philipona told the bbc news website .
" but we allowed for this , and for the impact of extra clouds , but still we found an increase . "
the researchers calculated that this increase is partly down to higher concentrations of the gases such as carbon dioxide which are often described as causing the " man-made greenhouse effect " ; but increased water vapour appears to have a larger effect , accounting for about 70 % of the observed temperature rise .
not all regions of europe are affected equally .
between 1995 and 2002 , eastern states appear to have warmed by a rate equivalent to about 2c per decade - considerably faster than their western counterparts .
according to the new study , that may well be down to humidity differences ; broadly speaking , humidity has risen fast in the east but not in the west , where evaporation may be limited by the dryness of the iberian peninsula .
undervalued water the asrb unit at gornergrat in the alps measures longwave radiation although rising concentrations of carbon dioxide , methane , nitrous oxides and other gases are almost certainly driving the global rise in temperature observed in recent decades , the natural greenhouse effect - without which the world would be considerably colder - is largely down to atmospheric water vapour .
because human activities change its concentrations very little , it is generally not mentioned in discussions of modern-day greenhouse warming .

the new lord mayor david brewer has strong family ties with cornwall and he and his family spend much time in their north cornwall home .

' cornwall day ' mr brewer say he plans to promote cornish produce during his year as lord mayor and has already made a start by persuading celebrity chef rick stein to cook a special fish course for the lord mayor 's banquet , on 14 november .
the inspiration for the cornish float at the parade has come from local gardens .
mr brewer said : " we have been coming to cornwall for years and years and i have noticed in shops and restaurants that the range of cornwall quality produce has grown and we want to extend that to our friends in london .
" throughout the year we are going to try to have cornish produce as much as possible , with cornish food and flowers at the mansion house banquets .
" there will be a major city presence at the royal cornwall show in june , and a cornwall day in the city of london at about the same time . "
mr brewer took over officially from alderman michael savory on friday .
malcolm bell , chief executive of south west tourism , said : " this will encourage more to visit the county and to purchase more of our wonderful food and drink products when they are with us and equally importantly when they go back to their homes and tell their friends . "
