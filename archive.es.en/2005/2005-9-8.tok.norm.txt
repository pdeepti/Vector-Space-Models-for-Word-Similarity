" we are operating in a very safe environment , but of course the tragic accidents we 've had have to give us a push to improve safety standards even further , " said commission spokesman stefaan de rynck . de rynck said the talks between member states were " important " in helping decide what criteria should be used in drawing up the blacklist , as well as what the consequences of being on a banned list should be . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trying to prevent more disasters like this one in greece " the european union needs common criteria to identify unsafe airlines .
such airlines would be put on a european black list and be subject to an eu-wide ban to fly , " said a commission statement . the european parliament will take up the issue in november , and a meeting of european transportation ministers will be organized after that . " the commission hopes for a political agreement on the common criteria , the eu black list , and the eu-wide ban by the end of the year , " it added . incoherent rules the eu commission said the " incoherence " of current air safety regulations was highlighted in may when a turkish airline , suspended by four european countries , simply redirected its flights to belgium which had not imposed a similar ban . " this is astonishing , and a little bit absurd , " said the spokesman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu officials want all member states to follow the same rules the european union blacklist idea is similar to a mechanism already operational in the united states , where would-be passengers can consult a website publishing the names of airlines with relatively poor safety records .
similar backlists exist in france , britain and sweden . experts from 35 european countries called last month for the definition of common criteria to establish lists of airline companies to be blacklisted on safety grounds . " it is essential to define common criteria , " said michel wachenheim , head of the french civil aviation authority -lrb- dgac -rrb- , at a meeting of the european civil aviation conference -lrb- ecac -rrb- . cypriot airlines deny pilot language problems the eu talks in brussels came as the low-cost airline involved in a mysterious crash in greece last month denied a report that below-par language skills and the inexperience of a pilot contributed to the accident . cyprus ' helios airways said it was confident that the pilots of the doomed flight , which crashed on august 14 killing all 121 on board , were able to understand each other in english on the flight to prague via athens . " i 've spoken to both pilots and their english was of a good standard ...
we employ pilots of the highest standards , " said helios spokesman nicos anastassiades . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu airlines blacklist easier said than done a series of airplane crashes has spurred european countries to ban airlines deemed unsafe , although drawing up an eu-wide list of trouble-plagued carriers - as the eu 's executive commission wants - is proving elusive .

conceived as a rival to the british turner prize , the nationalgalerie prize for young art might pack the same kind of sensational punch we 've come to expect from the turner , but that ’ s where the similarities end . at the recent opening of the exhibition showcasing the artworks nominated for the nationalgalerie prize for young art at the hamburger bahnhof museum in berlin , curator joachim jäger compared monica bonvicini ’ s installation to an abu ghraib cell , while her fellow contestant john bock gave a performance that included getting pushed through a window by an angry " spectator " before leading the incredulous audience out of the gallery and jumping off a nearby bridge onto a waiting boat -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the four finalists for the prize set to be announced in late september are certainly not your standard museum fare .
bildunterschrift : john bock the emperor 's new clothes ?
in this respect , the nationalgalerie prize has taken an obvious cue from the 20-year-old turner - which , the critics have often argued , has a habit of favoring controversy over content .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : damian hirst 's shark floating in a tank of formaldehyde with a list of celebrity candidates ranging from damien hirst and his cows cut in half , tracey emin and her unmade bed to the cross-dressing grayson perry , the turner shortlist has more often than not boasted a generous dose of scandal that never failed to get the nation talking .
what tends to ruffle public feathers is less a matter of shocking content than a perceived lack of content .
it can be counted on to generate an annual media row , usually focused on that old chestnut : is it art ?
edgy but educational bildunterschrift : angela bulloch 's the disenchanted forest already dubbed " the german turner " and worth almost as much , the 50,000 euro -lrb- $ 62,000 -rrb- nationalgalerie prize for young art might be trying a similar tack in its stated aim of bringing art to a wider public , but with a short-list that includes bonvicini , bock , anri sala and angela bulloch -lrb- photo -rrb- , it 's giving a platform to four artists with established international reputations - even if they hardly deliver feel-good family fun .
" contemporary art attracts far less attention from the general public than 20th century modern art , for example , " said joachim jäger .
" it 's often edgy , provocative , and therefore not always instantly popular .
the competitive nature of the prize , as well as the ensuing publicity , is one way of raising awareness of contemporary art and arousing public curiosity . "
it 's also educational .
" it might be incomprehensible until you make an effort to get into it , " said peter raue from the friends of the nationalgalerie .
" but then it ’ s all very illuminating .
and ultimately , it should be a people ’ s prize . "
art as an event in any case , according to ursula prinz , deputy director at the german capital 's esteemed berlinische galerie , just about all contemporary art could be described as shocking .
" provocation is an integral part of today 's art , " she said .
" we live in an event culture , everything has to create a stir . "
many feel it 's a trend that raises the stakes for the average museum , and perhaps leaves the public bored by anything less than outrage .
" it does mean a lot of less spectacular work falls through the net , which is a little regrettable , " said prinz .
" less high-profile projects don ’ t get a look in .
art as an event is the order of the day , to the detriment of less flashy art . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but attention-grabbing art is n't all bad .
" events like this prize are one way of getting people into museums in the first place , " she admitted .
" in that sense , they definitely don ’ t hurt . "
conceptual rather than figurative old-school craft certainly is n't what the prize is about .
featuring performance , video and installation , the money is clearly on experimentation - another unmistakable nod to the turner , which has always been conceptual rather than figurative .
and if the prize attracts similar media frenzy , the entire german art world gets to benefit from the hype .
" everyone always wants to know who 's won the turner , " pointed out ursula prinz .
" so if one can achieve the same effect in germany , it would be a boon for everyone . "
individual , international but even though the turner has always triggered fierce opinions , much of the attention it attracts is unfavorable .
weird art is great in theory , but does n't it ultimately alienate the public ?
according to the german turner ’ s organizers , they have all their bases covered .
" shock tactics have the advantage of mass appeal , but also the disadvantage of reflecting a very one-sided facet to contemporary art , " said jäger .
" the nationalgalerie prize is aiming to be a crowd-puller , but it also takes a serious look at present-day art .
the jury 's selection represents four very different positions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anri sala it also represents different nationalities .
unlike the turner , which focuses on artists living and working in britain but often only shortlists british artists , the nationalgalerie prize has a very international slew of nominations .
in fact , german artists are conspicuously absent , as is traditional painting - so anyone expecting a sample of the fashionable new leipzig school , for example , will be sorely disappointed .
but it all goes to show just how open-minded the german art scene is .
" the prize turns the spotlight on international art developments in germany , rather than just german art , " pointed out jäger .

" i believe sincerely that india will be a winner from greater openness , " european union trade commissioner peter mandelson told a gathering of business leaders at an india-eu summit . india 's minister for commerce and industry , kamal nath , however , told the business leaders that the european union is using non-tariff barriers to block imports from india such as shrimps and herbal remedies . " peter is badgering us that we are not giving them market access , " he said . india wants farm subsidies cut at an india-eu business summit attended by british prime minister tony blair , who holds the six-month eu presidency , and indian prime minister manmohan singh , the issue of farm subsidies was raised again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more access for european wine , please onkar kanwar , president of the federation of indian chambers of commerce and industry , said the 320 billion dollars the eu spends a year on farm subsidies should be cut so indian farmers can sell into the market . " you need exactly what we produce , " kanwar said . singh also raised the farm subsidy issue and that of non-tariff barriers preventing the sale of farm products from india , which he said was crucial to lifting millions out of poverty here . " i believe there is a perception in indian trade and industry circles that the european market is becoming increasingly difficult to penetrate .
as tariff barriers disintegrate , non-tariff barrier suddenly come up , " singh said . " india is one of the largest producers of agricultural commodities ... the famous basmati rice and the equally famous darjeeling tea ... but many of these are also products which find some form of discrimination and trade protection " in the eu . " blair did not discuss the issue .
in june , he angered some european leaders with calls for cuts in farm export subsidies , warning that failure to make progress would harm world trade talks in december . both want increased trade the eu is india 's largest trading partner and the destination for a quarter of indian exports .
however , mandelson noted that efforts by both sides should be to increase trade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite dispute , meetings are going very well , officials say " india is the eu 's 12th trading partner , a volume that stands at an impressive sounding 33 billion euros -lrb- $ 41.3 billion -rrb- , " mandelson said .
" impressive , that is , until you realize that the figure for korea is 48 billion -lrb- euros -rrb- , for russia 126 billion and for china 175 billion .
these frankly are sobering comparisons . " the eu-india summit is an annual event , but never before in its history has the european union sent such a high-ranking delegation to new delhi .
this time , blair , who holds the rotating presidency of the eu , was accompanied by european commission president jose barroso , as well as a host of commissioners and business leaders - a delegation befitting a nation that is widely regarded as one of the world 's up-and-coming economic powers . india rises in trading status the summit , which saw the signing of a so-called " action plan " setting out the way forward in political , trade and investment , economic , and cultural and academic relations , effectively put india on a par with other eu partners such as us , china and russia . " it is in my opinion long overdue , " said blair , referring to the joint action plan .
" it sets a framework for more action on a whole range of issues … such as science and technology . " indian prime minister manmohan singh was equally upbeat about the talks with european leaders . " we had extremely good and productive discussions , " the indian premier said .
" the most important outcome has been the adoption of a joint action plan … which provides the framework , a road map for identifying pathways for future cooperation . " airbus deal announced one key business deal has already been inked with india 's purchase of 43 planes from european aircraft maker airbus for 1.76 billion euros .
the aircraft would boost the fleet of state-run indian airlines , which mainly flies domestic routes but also heads to some regional , middle eastern and southeast asian destinations . the indian airlines board had agreed on the acquisition of 20 airbus a-319s , 19 a-321s and four a-320s more than two years ago but a final decision had been delayed by required clearances from several layers of the government because of the order 's size . a ministerial panel led by finance minister p. chidambaram held final price negotiations on tuesday with airbus for the purchase of the 43 planes .

conceived as a rival to the british turner prize , the nationalgalerie prize for young art might pack the same kind of sensational punch we 've come to expect from the turner , but that ’ s where the similarities end . at the recent opening of the exhibition showcasing the artworks nominated for the nationalgalerie prize for young art at the hamburger bahnhof museum in berlin , curator joachim jäger compared monica bonvicini ’ s installation to an abu ghraib cell , while her fellow contestant john bock gave a performance that included getting pushed through a window by an angry " spectator " before leading the incredulous audience out of the gallery and jumping off a nearby bridge onto a waiting boat -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the four finalists for the prize set to be announced in late september are certainly not your standard museum fare .
bildunterschrift : john bock the emperor 's new clothes ?

what tends to ruffle public feathers is less a matter of shocking content than a perceived lack of content .
it can be counted on to generate an annual media row , usually focused on that old chestnut : is it art ?

" contemporary art attracts far less attention from the general public than 20th century modern art , for example , " said joachim jäger .
" it 's often edgy , provocative , and therefore not always instantly popular .
the competitive nature of the prize , as well as the ensuing publicity , is one way of raising awareness of contemporary art and arousing public curiosity . "
it 's also educational .
" it might be incomprehensible until you make an effort to get into it , " said peter raue from the friends of the nationalgalerie .
" but then it ’ s all very illuminating .
and ultimately , it should be a people ’ s prize . "
art as an event in any case , according to ursula prinz , deputy director at the german capital 's esteemed berlinische galerie , just about all contemporary art could be described as shocking .
" provocation is an integral part of today 's art , " she said .
" we live in an event culture , everything has to create a stir . "
many feel it 's a trend that raises the stakes for the average museum , and perhaps leaves the public bored by anything less than outrage .
" it does mean a lot of less spectacular work falls through the net , which is a little regrettable , " said prinz .

the agreement for the north european gas pipeline was due to be signed in october .
but with an election called 12 months early and schröder 's social democrats trailing the opposition christian democrats in the polls , the meeting was brought forward .
vladislav belov , a specialist on germany at the russian academy of science , said putin realized this could well be the last time he would see schröder in office .
show of support " putin is supporting his friend gerhard even if he understands objectively that he will no longer be either chancellor or vice-chancellor . ...
all the signs are that the schröder era is at an end , " belov said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german-russian gas deal has circumvented the ukraine the pipeline will be built by state-owned russian energy giant gazprom , together with several german companies .

" we even partly exceeded the high expectations preceding the fair .
we are very satisfied , " said roland stehle of the society for entertainment and communications electronics -lrb- gfu -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's electronics industry , which has been plagued by profit concerns and price falls in recent years , had pinned high hopes on the ifa which has improved continually every year in terms of attracting heavyweight exhibitors .
this year over 1,200 of them from 40 countries were vying for attention with their latest products .
more professionals , more orders according to stehle , even the specialized trade center at the fair was teeming with visitors this year , demand was high and buyers placed record number of orders .
" there were more industry professionals this year at the ifa than say two years ago , " said stehle who added that even the levels of know-how and expertise among them were significantly higher .
" the volume of orders was correspondingly higher - estimated at more than 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.1 billion -rrb- as compared to about 2.4 billion euros in 2003 , " said stehle .
though the estimates have not yet been officially confirmed and put down on paper , stehle said the industry was confident that the final figures on orders and visitors would make this year 's ifa stand out in the fair 's 81-year history .
innovation the key word one of the obvious trends at this year 's ifa was the presence of overwhelming plasma and lcd flat screens with the logo " hd-ready " in a reference to high-definition televisions -lrb- hdtv -rrb- , which are all the rage in the industry .
bildunterschrift : several german television stations announced at the ifa that they would broadcast their programs in the new standard starting this autumn .

" twenty-one percent of all households in germany want to buy a flat-screen television in the next 24 months , " said hans-joachim kamp , chairman of the consumer electronics trade association .
" i think this underpins the positive trend and the positive mood in the consumer electronics area . "
stehle confirmed that the continued digitalization of electronic gadgets right from radios to mobile phones and home entertainment was a promising development and that it would also raise demand for other digital products such as dvds and video players , cameras and mp3 players .
" the consumer electronics segment is overwhelmingly innovative .
we have around 10,000 new products each year and right now we seem to have the finger on the pulse of the consumers , " said stehle .
" our products are fun , they look good , they offer value and finally , that 's what 's honored by customers .

germany defeated south africa 4-2 in wednesday 's friendly at the weserstadion in bremen and minus 35-year-old goalkeeper jens lehmann , the team had an average age of just under 23 .
" as otto rehhagel used to say there is no such thing as old and young players but good and bad ones , " explained klinsmann .
" if the young players are better they are going to play . "
klinsmann handed full debuts to 19-year-old duo patrick sinkiewitz and marcell jansen despite limited experience in the bundesliga .
the 1990 world cup victor felt the gamble was a success .
" marcell was calm and impressed with his surges forward , " declared klinsmann .
" patrick was also cool and is another alternative in central defense . "
inexperience not a concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borussia mönchengladbach defender jansen and fc cologne starlet sinkiewitz have played less than 30 bundesliga games between them but inexperience does not concern klinsmann .
" a young team is growing and it will get better and better , " he said .
" if we look back to august last year then almost all of our players have made progress .
it is great fun watching this team out there . "
with the 21-year-old bastian schweinsteiger , lukas podolski and per mertesacker , both 20 , also in the starting line-up it could almost have been an under-21 fixture .
although the youth stars have added vim to germany 's attack , the defense has been rather shaky .
mertesacker has caused a penalty in both of his last two matches with the national team .
but klinsmann has left seasoned internationals such as liverpool midfielder dietmar hamann and borussia dortmund defender christian worns on the sidelines and it is unclear what role , if any , they will play at the 2006 world cup .

germany has benefited greatly , however , from the new youth players up front .
fc cologne striker podolski woke up on thursday to find his picture plastered across the newspapers after scoring a hat-trick in germany 's 4-2 friendly win over south africa .
the 20-year-old podolski opened the scoring with a delightful chip on 12 minutes and then showed his killer instinct to score twice inside seven minutes to record a first international hat-trick .
" podolski phenomenom , " headlined kicker magazine .
" the cologne star scores three to compensate for shaky defense . "
klinsmann chose to start ' prince poldi ' on the substitutes ' bench for the recent 2-0 defeat by slovakia and the media claimed it would be folly to do that again .
" super poldi , " declared bild daily .
" klinsmann , never leave him out again . "
podolski , born in the polish city of gliwice , has now scored an impressive 10 goals in 17 internationals .
" it does not matter whether i am in the starting line-up or on the substitutes ' bench - i just want to score my goals , " explained podolski .
" the coach told me to go out there and get my goals and it worked .
the slovakia defeat was a setback but we are now back on track . "
too much pressure ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sebastian deisler podolski made his bundesliga debut at the age of 18 in november 2003 and in the subsequent two years , he has gone from a talented teenager to the next golden boy of german football .
it seems the polish-born striker can do no wrong at the moment but bayern munich midfielder sebastian deisler - once heralded as the savior of german football - insists people must not put too much pressure on podolski .
" it is irresponsible to hype up young players such as lukas podolski , " deisler said .
" they get built up and then knocked down later on . "
klinsmann hailed podolski 's perfomance but admitted the younger players all needed the arm-around-the-shoulder treatment .
" some of the younger players do need protecting as they are new at this level , " said klinsmann .

germany defeated south africa 4-2 in wednesday 's friendly at the weserstadion in bremen and minus 35-year-old goalkeeper jens lehmann , the team had an average age of just under 23 .
" as otto rehhagel used to say there is no such thing as old and young players but good and bad ones , " explained klinsmann .
" if the young players are better they are going to play . "
klinsmann handed full debuts to 19-year-old duo patrick sinkiewitz and marcell jansen despite limited experience in the bundesliga .

germany has benefited greatly , however , from the new youth players up front .
fc cologne striker podolski woke up on thursday to find his picture plastered across the newspapers after scoring a hat-trick in germany 's 4-2 friendly win over south africa .
the 20-year-old podolski opened the scoring with a delightful chip on 12 minutes and then showed his killer instinct to score twice inside seven minutes to record a first international hat-trick .

" the cologne star scores three to compensate for shaky defense . "
klinsmann chose to start ' prince poldi ' on the substitutes ' bench for the recent 2-0 defeat by slovakia and the media claimed it would be folly to do that again .

podolski , born in the polish city of gliwice , has now scored an impressive 10 goals in 17 internationals .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.09.2005 critics slam russo-german deal on pipeline großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chummy german-russian relationship is ruffling feathers opposition is growing in eastern europe to a deal to build a gas pipeline under the baltic sea , which germany and russia are poised to sign thursday .
critics say it 's an attempt to change the political map of europe . russian president vladimir putin 's one-day visit to berlin thursday to meet with german chancellor gerhard schröder and hammer out a deal to build a pipeline linking russia with western europe has raised hackles in the continent 's east .
" the new russian-german alliance , which is today called an ' energy alliance , ' is a plan to change the political map of europe , " former lithuanian head of state and current eu parliamentarian vytautas landsbergis said in a statement .
by building the pipeline under the sea , by-passing the baltic states and poland , russia would be able to use " monopolistic gas prices " to " influence the policies of neighboring countries , " said landsbergis , who led lithuania when the baltic country became independent from the soviet union in 1990 .
baltic states wary the baltic states are particularly wary of pacts between germany and russia , because they were annexed by the soviet union after the signing of the molotov-ribbentrop pact between germany and the ussr in august 1939 .
they regained their independence only in the early 1990s , and joined the eu and nato last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin and germany 's gerhard schröder were present when the companies behind the project put their signatures to the controversial deal on thursday , paving the way for a gas pipeline to be built by russian state-owned energy giant gazprom and german companies e.on and basf .
the pipeline will stretch 1,200 kilometers -lrb- 750 miles -rrb- under the baltic sea , to link the russian city of vyborg , near st petersburg , to greifswald on the northeastern coast of germany . its underwater path means it will skirt the baltic states , as well as ukraine and poland , which currently receive transit fees from gazprom for allowing its pipelines to cross their territory on the way to the lucrative western european market .
the baltic states and poland wanted the pipeline to pass across their territory to ensure that russia will not apply an energy blockade against them or try to manipulate prices .
lithuanian economy minister kestutis dauksys said thursday the deal undermined the baltic state 's energy security .
" this agreement decreases our energy security , but lithuania could not influence this decision , " dauksys said in an interview to lithuanian public radio thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's kwasniewski on wednesday , polish president aleksander kwasniewski -lrb- photo -rrb- too slammed the pipeline deal , saying it was being struck " over the heads of poland and the eu . "
in july , russian parliamentary deputies urged the government to increase the price of gas exports to countries that have moved outside moscow 's orbit .
the duma , russia 's lower chamber of the parliament , approved a non-binding document calling on prime minister mikhail fradkov to increase tariffs for new eu members estonia , latvia and lithuania , as well as georgia , molodova and ukraine , which are ruled by pro-western governments .
russia has the world 's largest natural gas reserves .
russo-german ties face change putin 's visit to berlin on thursday to meet with his friend schröder is also being watched closely in germany , given that the country is heading to the polls in a general election in a week .
vladislav belov , a specialist on germany at the russian academy of science , said putin realized this could well be the last time he would see schröder in office . " putin is supporting his friend gerhard even if he understands objectively that he will no longer be either chancellor or vice-chancellor . ...
all the signs are that the schröder era is at an end , " belov said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while thursday 's visit could see the close of the chapter of warm schröder-putin relations , opinion is divided on the future of russian-german ties should conservative leader angela merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- take the mantle of german leadership . merkel grew up in the former east germany and speaks russian , while putin speaks fluent german after serving with the kgb in leipzig during the cold war .
" economic links between russia and germany will not change under merkel because the two countries will be trying to fulfill their economic potential , " belov predicted . martin koopmann , an expert with the german society for foreign policy -lrb- dgap -rrb- , fears troubled times could be ahead .
merkel 's christian democrats will " keep a certain distance from a russia which places all its emphasis on power and less on western-style transparency , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin and schröder to seal gas deal vladimir putin will announce a major agreement to build a pipeline linking russia with western europe when he visits germany thursday , just ahead of the german general election .

but the move still has n't allayed deeper worries on both sides . delegations from the 25 eu governments reached agreement here two days after eu trade commissioner peter mandelson had struck a trade deal to resolve an embarrassing standoff which has seriously strained ties with beijing .
" we would hope that if everything goes smoothly .. that by the middle of next week the goods that are currently blocked in customs can be unblocked , " said a spokesman for the european commission .
millions of chinese textiles , including pullovers , trousers , blouses , t-shirts , bras and tons of flax yarn , have been impounded at european ports because they exceed import quotas agreed by both sides in june .
bildunterschrift : boxes of blockaded goods from china are stacked in a warehouse at the port of antwerp in antwerp , belgium the political agreement , reached by ambassadors from eu member states on wednesday , opened the way for experts to work on a legal document that will allow the blocked clothes to be released by customs .
mandelson praised the move .
" i am very pleased that member states have approved the agreement with china and the commission 's proposal for unblocking textile imports from china , " he said in a statement from india , where he was taking part in an eu-india summit . " this solidarity now allows the commission to put in place the legal instrument which should allow the member states to begin unblocking goods next week , " he added .
dispute strains ties between eu , china as well as straining relations between the eu and china , the dispute had led to warnings that a shortage of the goods could cause prices to rise and hit european importers and retailers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the question of how to deal with the logjam divided eu members , roughly between southern european countries whose manufacturers fear the flood of cheap imports and northern countries where retailers want fresh stocks .
about five eu states , including italy , spain and portugal , have balked at allowing the products into the bloc .
under the deal negotiated in beijing between mandelson and chinese commerce minister bo xilai , the eu and china will share the quota burden caused by the stockpiles . about half of the estimated 80 million textile products being held up will enter the eu outside the fixed quotas , while the other half will be added to china 's 2006 textile limit .
lasting solutions needed industry officials have welcomed the eu-china deal - but at least one key official warned that the chaotic scenes of the last month or two could happen again unless the eu commission gets a grip on the problem .
" we are happy with the short term solution , " said foreign trade association -lrb- fta -rrb- head ferry den hoed . but he added : " in the end it still can be chaos next year ...
we have large quantities blocked in warehouses in china , and the chinese are not issuing export licenses any more , " he said .
chinese officials have also warned that the deal remains a short-term fix to a long-term problem and that more lasting solutions were needed .

" the export quotas for the second half of the year have almost been used up and if we start using next year 's quotas , we will face greater pressure next year , " said zhu hongjun , a senior manager with peiluocheng group in zhejiang .
in spain , finance minister pedro solbes said he believed that the compromise deal did not deal with the crux of the problem . he said that it " does not take into account in a balanced way the whole of the problem " .

but the move still has n't allayed deeper worries on both sides . delegations from the 25 eu governments reached agreement here two days after eu trade commissioner peter mandelson had struck a trade deal to resolve an embarrassing standoff which has seriously strained ties with beijing .
" we would hope that if everything goes smoothly .. that by the middle of next week the goods that are currently blocked in customs can be unblocked , " said a spokesman for the european commission .
millions of chinese textiles , including pullovers , trousers , blouses , t-shirts , bras and tons of flax yarn , have been impounded at european ports because they exceed import quotas agreed by both sides in june .
bildunterschrift : boxes of blockaded goods from china are stacked in a warehouse at the port of antwerp in antwerp , belgium the political agreement , reached by ambassadors from eu member states on wednesday , opened the way for experts to work on a legal document that will allow the blocked clothes to be released by customs .
mandelson praised the move .
" i am very pleased that member states have approved the agreement with china and the commission 's proposal for unblocking textile imports from china , " he said in a statement from india , where he was taking part in an eu-india summit . " this solidarity now allows the commission to put in place the legal instrument which should allow the member states to begin unblocking goods next week , " he added .
dispute strains ties between eu , china as well as straining relations between the eu and china , the dispute had led to warnings that a shortage of the goods could cause prices to rise and hit european importers and retailers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the question of how to deal with the logjam divided eu members , roughly between southern european countries whose manufacturers fear the flood of cheap imports and northern countries where retailers want fresh stocks .
about five eu states , including italy , spain and portugal , have balked at allowing the products into the bloc .
under the deal negotiated in beijing between mandelson and chinese commerce minister bo xilai , the eu and china will share the quota burden caused by the stockpiles . about half of the estimated 80 million textile products being held up will enter the eu outside the fixed quotas , while the other half will be added to china 's 2006 textile limit .
lasting solutions needed industry officials have welcomed the eu-china deal - but at least one key official warned that the chaotic scenes of the last month or two could happen again unless the eu commission gets a grip on the problem .
" we are happy with the short term solution , " said foreign trade association -lrb- fta -rrb- head ferry den hoed . but he added : " in the end it still can be chaos next year ...
we have large quantities blocked in warehouses in china , and the chinese are not issuing export licenses any more , " he said .
chinese officials have also warned that the deal remains a short-term fix to a long-term problem and that more lasting solutions were needed .

critics say it 's an attempt to change the political map of europe . russian president vladimir putin 's one-day visit to berlin thursday to meet with german chancellor gerhard schröder and hammer out a deal to build a pipeline linking russia with western europe has raised hackles in the continent 's east .
" the new russian-german alliance , which is today called an ' energy alliance , ' is a plan to change the political map of europe , " former lithuanian head of state and current eu parliamentarian vytautas landsbergis said in a statement .
by building the pipeline under the sea , by-passing the baltic states and poland , russia would be able to use " monopolistic gas prices " to " influence the policies of neighboring countries , " said landsbergis , who led lithuania when the baltic country became independent from the soviet union in 1990 .
baltic states wary the baltic states are particularly wary of pacts between germany and russia , because they were annexed by the soviet union after the signing of the molotov-ribbentrop pact between germany and the ussr in august 1939 .
they regained their independence only in the early 1990s , and joined the eu and nato last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin and germany 's gerhard schröder were present when the companies behind the project put their signatures to the controversial deal on thursday , paving the way for a gas pipeline to be built by russian state-owned energy giant gazprom and german companies e.on and basf .
the pipeline will stretch 1,200 kilometers -lrb- 750 miles -rrb- under the baltic sea , to link the russian city of vyborg , near st petersburg , to greifswald on the northeastern coast of germany . its underwater path means it will skirt the baltic states , as well as ukraine and poland , which currently receive transit fees from gazprom for allowing its pipelines to cross their territory on the way to the lucrative western european market .
the baltic states and poland wanted the pipeline to pass across their territory to ensure that russia will not apply an energy blockade against them or try to manipulate prices .
lithuanian economy minister kestutis dauksys said thursday the deal undermined the baltic state 's energy security .
" this agreement decreases our energy security , but lithuania could not influence this decision , " dauksys said in an interview to lithuanian public radio thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's kwasniewski on wednesday , polish president aleksander kwasniewski -lrb- photo -rrb- too slammed the pipeline deal , saying it was being struck " over the heads of poland and the eu . "
in july , russian parliamentary deputies urged the government to increase the price of gas exports to countries that have moved outside moscow 's orbit .
the duma , russia 's lower chamber of the parliament , approved a non-binding document calling on prime minister mikhail fradkov to increase tariffs for new eu members estonia , latvia and lithuania , as well as georgia , molodova and ukraine , which are ruled by pro-western governments .
russia has the world 's largest natural gas reserves .
russo-german ties face change putin 's visit to berlin on thursday to meet with his friend schröder is also being watched closely in germany , given that the country is heading to the polls in a general election in a week .
vladislav belov , a specialist on germany at the russian academy of science , said putin realized this could well be the last time he would see schröder in office . " putin is supporting his friend gerhard even if he understands objectively that he will no longer be either chancellor or vice-chancellor . ...
all the signs are that the schröder era is at an end , " belov said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while thursday 's visit could see the close of the chapter of warm schröder-putin relations , opinion is divided on the future of russian-german ties should conservative leader angela merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- take the mantle of german leadership . merkel grew up in the former east germany and speaks russian , while putin speaks fluent german after serving with the kgb in leipzig during the cold war .
" economic links between russia and germany will not change under merkel because the two countries will be trying to fulfill their economic potential , " belov predicted . martin koopmann , an expert with the german society for foreign policy -lrb- dgap -rrb- , fears troubled times could be ahead .

critics say it 's an attempt to change the political map of europe . russian president vladimir putin 's one-day visit to berlin thursday to meet with german chancellor gerhard schröder and hammer out a deal to build a pipeline linking russia with western europe has raised hackles in the continent 's east .
" the new russian-german alliance , which is today called an ' energy alliance , ' is a plan to change the political map of europe , " former lithuanian head of state and current eu parliamentarian vytautas landsbergis said in a statement .
by building the pipeline under the sea , by-passing the baltic states and poland , russia would be able to use " monopolistic gas prices " to " influence the policies of neighboring countries , " said landsbergis , who led lithuania when the baltic country became independent from the soviet union in 1990 .
baltic states wary the baltic states are particularly wary of pacts between germany and russia , because they were annexed by the soviet union after the signing of the molotov-ribbentrop pact between germany and the ussr in august 1939 .
they regained their independence only in the early 1990s , and joined the eu and nato last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin and germany 's gerhard schröder were present when the companies behind the project put their signatures to the controversial deal on thursday , paving the way for a gas pipeline to be built by russian state-owned energy giant gazprom and german companies e.on and basf .
the pipeline will stretch 1,200 kilometers -lrb- 750 miles -rrb- under the baltic sea , to link the russian city of vyborg , near st petersburg , to greifswald on the northeastern coast of germany . its underwater path means it will skirt the baltic states , as well as ukraine and poland , which currently receive transit fees from gazprom for allowing its pipelines to cross their territory on the way to the lucrative western european market .
the baltic states and poland wanted the pipeline to pass across their territory to ensure that russia will not apply an energy blockade against them or try to manipulate prices .
lithuanian economy minister kestutis dauksys said thursday the deal undermined the baltic state 's energy security .
" this agreement decreases our energy security , but lithuania could not influence this decision , " dauksys said in an interview to lithuanian public radio thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's kwasniewski on wednesday , polish president aleksander kwasniewski -lrb- photo -rrb- too slammed the pipeline deal , saying it was being struck " over the heads of poland and the eu . "
in july , russian parliamentary deputies urged the government to increase the price of gas exports to countries that have moved outside moscow 's orbit .
the duma , russia 's lower chamber of the parliament , approved a non-binding document calling on prime minister mikhail fradkov to increase tariffs for new eu members estonia , latvia and lithuania , as well as georgia , molodova and ukraine , which are ruled by pro-western governments .
russia has the world 's largest natural gas reserves .
russo-german ties face change putin 's visit to berlin on thursday to meet with his friend schröder is also being watched closely in germany , given that the country is heading to the polls in a general election in a week .
vladislav belov , a specialist on germany at the russian academy of science , said putin realized this could well be the last time he would see schröder in office . " putin is supporting his friend gerhard even if he understands objectively that he will no longer be either chancellor or vice-chancellor . ...
all the signs are that the schröder era is at an end , " belov said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while thursday 's visit could see the close of the chapter of warm schröder-putin relations , opinion is divided on the future of russian-german ties should conservative leader angela merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- take the mantle of german leadership . merkel grew up in the former east germany and speaks russian , while putin speaks fluent german after serving with the kgb in leipzig during the cold war .
" economic links between russia and germany will not change under merkel because the two countries will be trying to fulfill their economic potential , " belov predicted . martin koopmann , an expert with the german society for foreign policy -lrb- dgap -rrb- , fears troubled times could be ahead .
merkel 's christian democrats will " keep a certain distance from a russia which places all its emphasis on power and less on western-style transparency , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin and schröder to seal gas deal vladimir putin will announce a major agreement to build a pipeline linking russia with western europe when he visits germany thursday , just ahead of the german general election .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 08.09.2005 -pipe- 13:00 utc daimler faces lawsuit over schrempp the first lawsuit has been filed against daimlerchrysler by an investor who claims he was short-changed over the automaker 's announcement that its chairman is stepping down at the end of the year , the plaintiff 's lawyers said on thursday .
munich-based lawyers rotter rechtsanwälte said in a statement that they had filed a suit with a court in stuttgart alleging that the german-us auto giant failed to inform their client promptly about the decision by chief executive juergen schrempp to step down early .
after schrempp announced he was quitting , daimlerchrysler shares soared by more than 10 percent on the stock exchange , boosting the company 's market value by more than three billion euros -lrb- $ 3.7 billion -rrb- .
" according to our information , schrempp 's resignation was a done-deal at least five weeks before it was made public , " the lawyers argued .
" but this insider information was not published until july 28 .
those shareholders who sold their shares before then could have got a much higher price for their shares if daimlerchrysler had made the information public as soon as it was known , " they said .
in this concrete case , the lawyers ' client had sold his shares in daimlerchrysler just 90 minutes before schrempp 's decision to resign was made public , meaning he pocketed just 36.50 euros from the transaction , rotter rechtsanwälte said . dw-world.de daimler investigated for insider trading german regulators are launching an investigation regarding possible insider dealings of daimlerchrysler 's shares .
the german-us company is already being probed on bribery charges in the us .

" i believe sincerely that india will be a winner from greater openness , " european union trade commissioner peter mandelson told a gathering of business leaders at an india-eu summit . india 's minister for commerce and industry , kamal nath , however , told the business leaders that the european union is using non-tariff barriers to block imports from india such as shrimps and herbal remedies . " peter is badgering us that we are not giving them market access , " he said . india wants farm subsidies cut at an india-eu business summit attended by british prime minister tony blair , who holds the six-month eu presidency , and indian prime minister manmohan singh , the issue of farm subsidies was raised again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more access for european wine , please onkar kanwar , president of the federation of indian chambers of commerce and industry , said the 320 billion dollars the eu spends a year on farm subsidies should be cut so indian farmers can sell into the market . " you need exactly what we produce , " kanwar said . singh also raised the farm subsidy issue and that of non-tariff barriers preventing the sale of farm products from india , which he said was crucial to lifting millions out of poverty here . " i believe there is a perception in indian trade and industry circles that the european market is becoming increasingly difficult to penetrate .
as tariff barriers disintegrate , non-tariff barrier suddenly come up , " singh said . " india is one of the largest producers of agricultural commodities ... the famous basmati rice and the equally famous darjeeling tea ... but many of these are also products which find some form of discrimination and trade protection " in the eu . " blair did not discuss the issue .
in june , he angered some european leaders with calls for cuts in farm export subsidies , warning that failure to make progress would harm world trade talks in december . both want increased trade the eu is india 's largest trading partner and the destination for a quarter of indian exports .
however , mandelson noted that efforts by both sides should be to increase trade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite dispute , meetings are going very well , officials say " india is the eu 's 12th trading partner , a volume that stands at an impressive sounding 33 billion euros -lrb- $ 41.3 billion -rrb- , " mandelson said .
" impressive , that is , until you realize that the figure for korea is 48 billion -lrb- euros -rrb- , for russia 126 billion and for china 175 billion .
these frankly are sobering comparisons . " the eu-india summit is an annual event , but never before in its history has the european union sent such a high-ranking delegation to new delhi .
this time , blair , who holds the rotating presidency of the eu , was accompanied by european commission president jose barroso , as well as a host of commissioners and business leaders - a delegation befitting a nation that is widely regarded as one of the world 's up-and-coming economic powers . india rises in trading status the summit , which saw the signing of a so-called " action plan " setting out the way forward in political , trade and investment , economic , and cultural and academic relations , effectively put india on a par with other eu partners such as us , china and russia . " it is in my opinion long overdue , " said blair , referring to the joint action plan .
" it sets a framework for more action on a whole range of issues … such as science and technology . " indian prime minister manmohan singh was equally upbeat about the talks with european leaders . " we had extremely good and productive discussions , " the indian premier said .
" the most important outcome has been the adoption of a joint action plan … which provides the framework , a road map for identifying pathways for future cooperation . " airbus deal announced one key business deal has already been inked with india 's purchase of 43 planes from european aircraft maker airbus for 1.76 billion euros .
the aircraft would boost the fleet of state-run indian airlines , which mainly flies domestic routes but also heads to some regional , middle eastern and southeast asian destinations . the indian airlines board had agreed on the acquisition of 20 airbus a-319s , 19 a-321s and four a-320s more than two years ago but a final decision had been delayed by required clearances from several layers of the government because of the order 's size . a ministerial panel led by finance minister p. chidambaram held final price negotiations on tuesday with airbus for the purchase of the 43 planes . " we all know that the airbus has been highly successful aircraft around the world , " blair said , adding the purchase was a welcome sign of growing trade relations between the european union and india . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu and india get down to business a delegation of eu heavyweights led by british prime minister tony blair met with indian leaders in new delhi on wednesday for talks aimed at strengthening trade and political ties with the emerging economic power . -lrb- sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 08.09.2005 art provocateurs steal the show großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bonvicini 's sado-maso darkroom : shocking ?
conceived as a rival to the british turner prize , the nationalgalerie prize for young art might pack the same kind of sensational punch we 've come to expect from the turner , but that ’ s where the similarities end . at the recent opening of the exhibition showcasing the artworks nominated for the nationalgalerie prize for young art at the hamburger bahnhof museum in berlin , curator joachim jäger compared monica bonvicini ’ s installation to an abu ghraib cell , while her fellow contestant john bock gave a performance that included getting pushed through a window by an angry " spectator " before leading the incredulous audience out of the gallery and jumping off a nearby bridge onto a waiting boat -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the four finalists for the prize set to be announced in late september are certainly not your standard museum fare .
bildunterschrift : john bock the emperor 's new clothes ?
in this respect , the nationalgalerie prize has taken an obvious cue from the 20-year-old turner - which , the critics have often argued , has a habit of favoring controversy over content .

" contemporary art attracts far less attention from the general public than 20th century modern art , for example , " said joachim jäger .
" it 's often edgy , provocative , and therefore not always instantly popular .
the competitive nature of the prize , as well as the ensuing publicity , is one way of raising awareness of contemporary art and arousing public curiosity . "
it 's also educational .

art as an event in any case , according to ursula prinz , deputy director at the german capital 's esteemed berlinische galerie , just about all contemporary art could be described as shocking .
" provocation is an integral part of today 's art , " she said .
" we live in an event culture , everything has to create a stir . "
many feel it 's a trend that raises the stakes for the average museum , and perhaps leaves the public bored by anything less than outrage .
" it does mean a lot of less spectacular work falls through the net , which is a little regrettable , " said prinz .

individual , international but even though the turner has always triggered fierce opinions , much of the attention it attracts is unfavorable .
weird art is great in theory , but does n't it ultimately alienate the public ?
according to the german turner ’ s organizers , they have all their bases covered .
" shock tactics have the advantage of mass appeal , but also the disadvantage of reflecting a very one-sided facet to contemporary art , " said jäger .
" the nationalgalerie prize is aiming to be a crowd-puller , but it also takes a serious look at present-day art .

conceived as a rival to the british turner prize , the nationalgalerie prize for young art might pack the same kind of sensational punch we 've come to expect from the turner , but that ’ s where the similarities end . at the recent opening of the exhibition showcasing the artworks nominated for the nationalgalerie prize for young art at the hamburger bahnhof museum in berlin , curator joachim jäger compared monica bonvicini ’ s installation to an abu ghraib cell , while her fellow contestant john bock gave a performance that included getting pushed through a window by an angry " spectator " before leading the incredulous audience out of the gallery and jumping off a nearby bridge onto a waiting boat -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the four finalists for the prize set to be announced in late september are certainly not your standard museum fare .
bildunterschrift : john bock the emperor 's new clothes ?
in this respect , the nationalgalerie prize has taken an obvious cue from the 20-year-old turner - which , the critics have often argued , has a habit of favoring controversy over content .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : damian hirst 's shark floating in a tank of formaldehyde with a list of celebrity candidates ranging from damien hirst and his cows cut in half , tracey emin and her unmade bed to the cross-dressing grayson perry , the turner shortlist has more often than not boasted a generous dose of scandal that never failed to get the nation talking .
what tends to ruffle public feathers is less a matter of shocking content than a perceived lack of content .
it can be counted on to generate an annual media row , usually focused on that old chestnut : is it art ?
edgy but educational bildunterschrift : angela bulloch 's the disenchanted forest already dubbed " the german turner " and worth almost as much , the 50,000 euro -lrb- $ 62,000 -rrb- nationalgalerie prize for young art might be trying a similar tack in its stated aim of bringing art to a wider public , but with a short-list that includes bonvicini , bock , anri sala and angela bulloch -lrb- photo -rrb- , it 's giving a platform to four artists with established international reputations - even if they hardly deliver feel-good family fun .
" contemporary art attracts far less attention from the general public than 20th century modern art , for example , " said joachim jäger .
" it 's often edgy , provocative , and therefore not always instantly popular .
the competitive nature of the prize , as well as the ensuing publicity , is one way of raising awareness of contemporary art and arousing public curiosity . "
it 's also educational .
" it might be incomprehensible until you make an effort to get into it , " said peter raue from the friends of the nationalgalerie .
" but then it ’ s all very illuminating .
and ultimately , it should be a people ’ s prize . "
art as an event in any case , according to ursula prinz , deputy director at the german capital 's esteemed berlinische galerie , just about all contemporary art could be described as shocking .
" provocation is an integral part of today 's art , " she said .
" we live in an event culture , everything has to create a stir . "
many feel it 's a trend that raises the stakes for the average museum , and perhaps leaves the public bored by anything less than outrage .
" it does mean a lot of less spectacular work falls through the net , which is a little regrettable , " said prinz .
" less high-profile projects don ’ t get a look in .
art as an event is the order of the day , to the detriment of less flashy art . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but attention-grabbing art is n't all bad .
" events like this prize are one way of getting people into museums in the first place , " she admitted .
" in that sense , they definitely don ’ t hurt . "
conceptual rather than figurative old-school craft certainly is n't what the prize is about .
featuring performance , video and installation , the money is clearly on experimentation - another unmistakable nod to the turner , which has always been conceptual rather than figurative .
and if the prize attracts similar media frenzy , the entire german art world gets to benefit from the hype .
" everyone always wants to know who 's won the turner , " pointed out ursula prinz .
" so if one can achieve the same effect in germany , it would be a boon for everyone . "
individual , international but even though the turner has always triggered fierce opinions , much of the attention it attracts is unfavorable .
weird art is great in theory , but does n't it ultimately alienate the public ?
according to the german turner ’ s organizers , they have all their bases covered .
" shock tactics have the advantage of mass appeal , but also the disadvantage of reflecting a very one-sided facet to contemporary art , " said jäger .
" the nationalgalerie prize is aiming to be a crowd-puller , but it also takes a serious look at present-day art .
the jury 's selection represents four very different positions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anri sala it also represents different nationalities .
unlike the turner , which focuses on artists living and working in britain but often only shortlists british artists , the nationalgalerie prize has a very international slew of nominations .
in fact , german artists are conspicuously absent , as is traditional painting - so anyone expecting a sample of the fashionable new leipzig school , for example , will be sorely disappointed .
but it all goes to show just how open-minded the german art scene is .

the oktoberfest catwalk can be all yours . what a summer it 's been in bavaria !
first , the sun-shy eu bureaucrats wanted to ban plunging necklines from beer gardens and deprive bavarian waitresses of their natural joie de vivre .
luckily , the european parliament voted against the sun-protection bill , and just as the bavarians wanted to breathe a sigh of relief , another calamity struck the proud state . two fashion designers decided to challenge the role of the lederhosen - traditional german leather pants - as the male fashion accessory a la mode at the munich oktoberfest .
they invented a skirt for beer-drinking guys . what is this world coming to ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old school frocks for guys munich designers doreen anders and robert landinger , both in their mid-thirties , are promoting skirts for male drinkers as a more comfortable alternative to the tight leather pants . " with all that beer flowing at the fest you need to make sure your belly is free to take it in , " landinger said . the duo has been designing skirts for men for four years .
in 2003 , their creations were featured in the exhibition " bravehearts - men in skirts " at the new york metropolitan museum of art .
and even though taking over the munich oktoberfest may prove to be more difficult than wiggling your way on the new york scene , the designers seem confident enough .
" i think they 're going to go down well , " landinger said .

" i believe sincerely that india will be a winner from greater openness , " european union trade commissioner peter mandelson told a gathering of business leaders at an india-eu summit . india 's minister for commerce and industry , kamal nath , however , told the business leaders that the european union is using non-tariff barriers to block imports from india such as shrimps and herbal remedies . " peter is badgering us that we are not giving them market access , " he said . india wants farm subsidies cut at an india-eu business summit attended by british prime minister tony blair , who holds the six-month eu presidency , and indian prime minister manmohan singh , the issue of farm subsidies was raised again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more access for european wine , please onkar kanwar , president of the federation of indian chambers of commerce and industry , said the 320 billion dollars the eu spends a year on farm subsidies should be cut so indian farmers can sell into the market . " you need exactly what we produce , " kanwar said . singh also raised the farm subsidy issue and that of non-tariff barriers preventing the sale of farm products from india , which he said was crucial to lifting millions out of poverty here . " i believe there is a perception in indian trade and industry circles that the european market is becoming increasingly difficult to penetrate .

" india is one of the largest producers of agricultural commodities ... the famous basmati rice and the equally famous darjeeling tea ... but many of these are also products which find some form of discrimination and trade protection " in the eu .

in june , he angered some european leaders with calls for cuts in farm export subsidies , warning that failure to make progress would harm world trade talks in december . both want increased trade the eu is india 's largest trading partner and the destination for a quarter of indian exports .

" impressive , that is , until you realize that the figure for korea is 48 billion -lrb- euros -rrb- , for russia 126 billion and for china 175 billion .
these frankly are sobering comparisons . " the eu-india summit is an annual event , but never before in its history has the european union sent such a high-ranking delegation to new delhi .
this time , blair , who holds the rotating presidency of the eu , was accompanied by european commission president jose barroso , as well as a host of commissioners and business leaders - a delegation befitting a nation that is widely regarded as one of the world 's up-and-coming economic powers . india rises in trading status the summit , which saw the signing of a so-called " action plan " setting out the way forward in political , trade and investment , economic , and cultural and academic relations , effectively put india on a par with other eu partners such as us , china and russia . " it is in my opinion long overdue , " said blair , referring to the joint action plan .
" it sets a framework for more action on a whole range of issues … such as science and technology . " indian prime minister manmohan singh was equally upbeat about the talks with european leaders . " we had extremely good and productive discussions , " the indian premier said .
" the most important outcome has been the adoption of a joint action plan … which provides the framework , a road map for identifying pathways for future cooperation .

the aircraft would boost the fleet of state-run indian airlines , which mainly flies domestic routes but also heads to some regional , middle eastern and southeast asian destinations . the indian airlines board had agreed on the acquisition of 20 airbus a-319s , 19 a-321s and four a-320s more than two years ago but a final decision had been delayed by required clearances from several layers of the government because of the order 's size . a ministerial panel led by finance minister p. chidambaram held final price negotiations on tuesday with airbus for the purchase of the 43 planes . " we all know that the airbus has been highly successful aircraft around the world , " blair said , adding the purchase was a welcome sign of growing trade relations between the european union and india . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu and india get down to business a delegation of eu heavyweights led by british prime minister tony blair met with indian leaders in new delhi on wednesday for talks aimed at strengthening trade and political ties with the emerging economic power . -lrb- sept .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's electronics industry , which has been plagued by profit concerns and price falls in recent years , had pinned high hopes on the ifa which has improved continually every year in terms of attracting heavyweight exhibitors .
this year over 1,200 of them from 40 countries were vying for attention with their latest products .
more professionals , more orders according to stehle , even the specialized trade center at the fair was teeming with visitors this year , demand was high and buyers placed record number of orders .
" there were more industry professionals this year at the ifa than say two years ago , " said stehle who added that even the levels of know-how and expertise among them were significantly higher .
" the volume of orders was correspondingly higher - estimated at more than 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.1 billion -rrb- as compared to about 2.4 billion euros in 2003 , " said stehle .

stehle confirmed that the continued digitalization of electronic gadgets right from radios to mobile phones and home entertainment was a promising development and that it would also raise demand for other digital products such as dvds and video players , cameras and mp3 players .
" the consumer electronics segment is overwhelmingly innovative .
we have around 10,000 new products each year and right now we seem to have the finger on the pulse of the consumers , " said stehle .

" i believe sincerely that india will be a winner from greater openness , " european union trade commissioner peter mandelson told a gathering of business leaders at an india-eu summit . india 's minister for commerce and industry , kamal nath , however , told the business leaders that the european union is using non-tariff barriers to block imports from india such as shrimps and herbal remedies . " peter is badgering us that we are not giving them market access , " he said . india wants farm subsidies cut at an india-eu business summit attended by british prime minister tony blair , who holds the six-month eu presidency , and indian prime minister manmohan singh , the issue of farm subsidies was raised again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more access for european wine , please onkar kanwar , president of the federation of indian chambers of commerce and industry , said the 320 billion dollars the eu spends a year on farm subsidies should be cut so indian farmers can sell into the market . " you need exactly what we produce , " kanwar said . singh also raised the farm subsidy issue and that of non-tariff barriers preventing the sale of farm products from india , which he said was crucial to lifting millions out of poverty here . " i believe there is a perception in indian trade and industry circles that the european market is becoming increasingly difficult to penetrate .
as tariff barriers disintegrate , non-tariff barrier suddenly come up , " singh said . " india is one of the largest producers of agricultural commodities ... the famous basmati rice and the equally famous darjeeling tea ... but many of these are also products which find some form of discrimination and trade protection " in the eu . " blair did not discuss the issue .
in june , he angered some european leaders with calls for cuts in farm export subsidies , warning that failure to make progress would harm world trade talks in december . both want increased trade the eu is india 's largest trading partner and the destination for a quarter of indian exports .
however , mandelson noted that efforts by both sides should be to increase trade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite dispute , meetings are going very well , officials say " india is the eu 's 12th trading partner , a volume that stands at an impressive sounding 33 billion euros -lrb- $ 41.3 billion -rrb- , " mandelson said .
" impressive , that is , until you realize that the figure for korea is 48 billion -lrb- euros -rrb- , for russia 126 billion and for china 175 billion .
these frankly are sobering comparisons . " the eu-india summit is an annual event , but never before in its history has the european union sent such a high-ranking delegation to new delhi .
this time , blair , who holds the rotating presidency of the eu , was accompanied by european commission president jose barroso , as well as a host of commissioners and business leaders - a delegation befitting a nation that is widely regarded as one of the world 's up-and-coming economic powers . india rises in trading status the summit , which saw the signing of a so-called " action plan " setting out the way forward in political , trade and investment , economic , and cultural and academic relations , effectively put india on a par with other eu partners such as us , china and russia . " it is in my opinion long overdue , " said blair , referring to the joint action plan .
" it sets a framework for more action on a whole range of issues … such as science and technology . " indian prime minister manmohan singh was equally upbeat about the talks with european leaders . " we had extremely good and productive discussions , " the indian premier said .
" the most important outcome has been the adoption of a joint action plan … which provides the framework , a road map for identifying pathways for future cooperation . " airbus deal announced one key business deal has already been inked with india 's purchase of 43 planes from european aircraft maker airbus for 1.76 billion euros .
the aircraft would boost the fleet of state-run indian airlines , which mainly flies domestic routes but also heads to some regional , middle eastern and southeast asian destinations . the indian airlines board had agreed on the acquisition of 20 airbus a-319s , 19 a-321s and four a-320s more than two years ago but a final decision had been delayed by required clearances from several layers of the government because of the order 's size . a ministerial panel led by finance minister p. chidambaram held final price negotiations on tuesday with airbus for the purchase of the 43 planes .

after a 2-0 defeat to slovakia in their last warm-up match germany were keen to get back to winning ways and 20-year-old podolski plotted the downfall of south africa almost single-handedly .
podolski opened the scoring in the 12th minute with a deft chip and scored twice inside seven second half minutes after werder bremen midfielder tim borowski scored his first international goal on his home ground .
but the night belonged to podolski who recorded his first hat-trick to take his goals tally to 10 in 17 internationals .

" i believe sincerely that india will be a winner from greater openness , " european union trade commissioner peter mandelson told a gathering of business leaders at an india-eu summit . india 's minister for commerce and industry , kamal nath , however , told the business leaders that the european union is using non-tariff barriers to block imports from india such as shrimps and herbal remedies . " peter is badgering us that we are not giving them market access , " he said . india wants farm subsidies cut at an india-eu business summit attended by british prime minister tony blair , who holds the six-month eu presidency , and indian prime minister manmohan singh , the issue of farm subsidies was raised again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more access for european wine , please onkar kanwar , president of the federation of indian chambers of commerce and industry , said the 320 billion dollars the eu spends a year on farm subsidies should be cut so indian farmers can sell into the market . " you need exactly what we produce , " kanwar said . singh also raised the farm subsidy issue and that of non-tariff barriers preventing the sale of farm products from india , which he said was crucial to lifting millions out of poverty here . " i believe there is a perception in indian trade and industry circles that the european market is becoming increasingly difficult to penetrate .
as tariff barriers disintegrate , non-tariff barrier suddenly come up , " singh said . " india is one of the largest producers of agricultural commodities ... the famous basmati rice and the equally famous darjeeling tea ... but many of these are also products which find some form of discrimination and trade protection " in the eu . " blair did not discuss the issue .
in june , he angered some european leaders with calls for cuts in farm export subsidies , warning that failure to make progress would harm world trade talks in december . both want increased trade the eu is india 's largest trading partner and the destination for a quarter of indian exports .
however , mandelson noted that efforts by both sides should be to increase trade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite dispute , meetings are going very well , officials say " india is the eu 's 12th trading partner , a volume that stands at an impressive sounding 33 billion euros -lrb- $ 41.3 billion -rrb- , " mandelson said .
" impressive , that is , until you realize that the figure for korea is 48 billion -lrb- euros -rrb- , for russia 126 billion and for china 175 billion .
these frankly are sobering comparisons . " the eu-india summit is an annual event , but never before in its history has the european union sent such a high-ranking delegation to new delhi .
this time , blair , who holds the rotating presidency of the eu , was accompanied by european commission president jose barroso , as well as a host of commissioners and business leaders - a delegation befitting a nation that is widely regarded as one of the world 's up-and-coming economic powers . india rises in trading status the summit , which saw the signing of a so-called " action plan " setting out the way forward in political , trade and investment , economic , and cultural and academic relations , effectively put india on a par with other eu partners such as us , china and russia . " it is in my opinion long overdue , " said blair , referring to the joint action plan .
" it sets a framework for more action on a whole range of issues … such as science and technology . " indian prime minister manmohan singh was equally upbeat about the talks with european leaders . " we had extremely good and productive discussions , " the indian premier said .
" the most important outcome has been the adoption of a joint action plan … which provides the framework , a road map for identifying pathways for future cooperation . " airbus deal announced one key business deal has already been inked with india 's purchase of 43 planes from european aircraft maker airbus for 1.76 billion euros .
the aircraft would boost the fleet of state-run indian airlines , which mainly flies domestic routes but also heads to some regional , middle eastern and southeast asian destinations . the indian airlines board had agreed on the acquisition of 20 airbus a-319s , 19 a-321s and four a-320s more than two years ago but a final decision had been delayed by required clearances from several layers of the government because of the order 's size . a ministerial panel led by finance minister p. chidambaram held final price negotiations on tuesday with airbus for the purchase of the 43 planes . " we all know that the airbus has been highly successful aircraft around the world , " blair said , adding the purchase was a welcome sign of growing trade relations between the european union and india . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu and india get down to business a delegation of eu heavyweights led by british prime minister tony blair met with indian leaders in new delhi on wednesday for talks aimed at strengthening trade and political ties with the emerging economic power . -lrb- sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 08.09.2005 klinsmann to stick to youth policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's young defense struggled against south africa german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann has vowed to continue with his youth policy into the 2006 world cup despite worries about the squad 's still shaky defense , which conceded two goals to south africa wednesday . sticking to the old adage of " if you 're good enough you 're old enough " , klinsmann deflected criticism that his policy of using younger players was creating problems for the national team .
germany defeated south africa 4-2 in wednesday 's friendly at the weserstadion in bremen and minus 35-year-old goalkeeper jens lehmann , the team had an average age of just under 23 .
" as otto rehhagel used to say there is no such thing as old and young players but good and bad ones , " explained klinsmann .
" if the young players are better they are going to play . "
klinsmann handed full debuts to 19-year-old duo patrick sinkiewitz and marcell jansen despite limited experience in the bundesliga .
the 1990 world cup victor felt the gamble was a success .
" marcell was calm and impressed with his surges forward , " declared klinsmann .
" patrick was also cool and is another alternative in central defense . "
inexperience not a concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borussia mönchengladbach defender jansen and fc cologne starlet sinkiewitz have played less than 30 bundesliga games between them but inexperience does not concern klinsmann .
" a young team is growing and it will get better and better , " he said .
" if we look back to august last year then almost all of our players have made progress .
it is great fun watching this team out there . "
with the 21-year-old bastian schweinsteiger , lukas podolski and per mertesacker , both 20 , also in the starting line-up it could almost have been an under-21 fixture .
although the youth stars have added vim to germany 's attack , the defense has been rather shaky .
mertesacker has caused a penalty in both of his last two matches with the national team .
but klinsmann has left seasoned internationals such as liverpool midfielder dietmar hamann and borussia dortmund defender christian worns on the sidelines and it is unclear what role , if any , they will play at the 2006 world cup .
poldi power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's lukas podolski celebrates after scoring the opening goal during the friendly soccer match between germany and south africa on wednesday , sept .
7 , 2005 .
germany has benefited greatly , however , from the new youth players up front .
fc cologne striker podolski woke up on thursday to find his picture plastered across the newspapers after scoring a hat-trick in germany 's 4-2 friendly win over south africa .
the 20-year-old podolski opened the scoring with a delightful chip on 12 minutes and then showed his killer instinct to score twice inside seven minutes to record a first international hat-trick .
" podolski phenomenom , " headlined kicker magazine .
" the cologne star scores three to compensate for shaky defense . "
klinsmann chose to start ' prince poldi ' on the substitutes ' bench for the recent 2-0 defeat by slovakia and the media claimed it would be folly to do that again .
" super poldi , " declared bild daily .
" klinsmann , never leave him out again . "
podolski , born in the polish city of gliwice , has now scored an impressive 10 goals in 17 internationals .
" it does not matter whether i am in the starting line-up or on the substitutes ' bench - i just want to score my goals , " explained podolski .
" the coach told me to go out there and get my goals and it worked .

germany defeated south africa 4-2 in wednesday 's friendly at the weserstadion in bremen and minus 35-year-old goalkeeper jens lehmann , the team had an average age of just under 23 .
" as otto rehhagel used to say there is no such thing as old and young players but good and bad ones , " explained klinsmann .
" if the young players are better they are going to play . "
klinsmann handed full debuts to 19-year-old duo patrick sinkiewitz and marcell jansen despite limited experience in the bundesliga .
the 1990 world cup victor felt the gamble was a success .
" marcell was calm and impressed with his surges forward , " declared klinsmann .
" patrick was also cool and is another alternative in central defense . "
inexperience not a concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borussia mönchengladbach defender jansen and fc cologne starlet sinkiewitz have played less than 30 bundesliga games between them but inexperience does not concern klinsmann .
" a young team is growing and it will get better and better , " he said .
" if we look back to august last year then almost all of our players have made progress .
it is great fun watching this team out there . "
with the 21-year-old bastian schweinsteiger , lukas podolski and per mertesacker , both 20 , also in the starting line-up it could almost have been an under-21 fixture .
although the youth stars have added vim to germany 's attack , the defense has been rather shaky .
mertesacker has caused a penalty in both of his last two matches with the national team .
but klinsmann has left seasoned internationals such as liverpool midfielder dietmar hamann and borussia dortmund defender christian worns on the sidelines and it is unclear what role , if any , they will play at the 2006 world cup .

germany has benefited greatly , however , from the new youth players up front .
fc cologne striker podolski woke up on thursday to find his picture plastered across the newspapers after scoring a hat-trick in germany 's 4-2 friendly win over south africa .
the 20-year-old podolski opened the scoring with a delightful chip on 12 minutes and then showed his killer instinct to score twice inside seven minutes to record a first international hat-trick .
" podolski phenomenom , " headlined kicker magazine .
" the cologne star scores three to compensate for shaky defense . "
klinsmann chose to start ' prince poldi ' on the substitutes ' bench for the recent 2-0 defeat by slovakia and the media claimed it would be folly to do that again .
" super poldi , " declared bild daily .
" klinsmann , never leave him out again . "
podolski , born in the polish city of gliwice , has now scored an impressive 10 goals in 17 internationals .
" it does not matter whether i am in the starting line-up or on the substitutes ' bench - i just want to score my goals , " explained podolski .
" the coach told me to go out there and get my goals and it worked .

germany defeated south africa 4-2 in wednesday 's friendly at the weserstadion in bremen and minus 35-year-old goalkeeper jens lehmann , the team had an average age of just under 23 .
" as otto rehhagel used to say there is no such thing as old and young players but good and bad ones , " explained klinsmann .
" if the young players are better they are going to play . "
klinsmann handed full debuts to 19-year-old duo patrick sinkiewitz and marcell jansen despite limited experience in the bundesliga .
the 1990 world cup victor felt the gamble was a success .
" marcell was calm and impressed with his surges forward , " declared klinsmann .
" patrick was also cool and is another alternative in central defense . "
inexperience not a concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borussia mönchengladbach defender jansen and fc cologne starlet sinkiewitz have played less than 30 bundesliga games between them but inexperience does not concern klinsmann .
" a young team is growing and it will get better and better , " he said .
" if we look back to august last year then almost all of our players have made progress .
it is great fun watching this team out there . "
with the 21-year-old bastian schweinsteiger , lukas podolski and per mertesacker , both 20 , also in the starting line-up it could almost have been an under-21 fixture .
although the youth stars have added vim to germany 's attack , the defense has been rather shaky .
mertesacker has caused a penalty in both of his last two matches with the national team .
but klinsmann has left seasoned internationals such as liverpool midfielder dietmar hamann and borussia dortmund defender christian worns on the sidelines and it is unclear what role , if any , they will play at the 2006 world cup .

germany has benefited greatly , however , from the new youth players up front .
fc cologne striker podolski woke up on thursday to find his picture plastered across the newspapers after scoring a hat-trick in germany 's 4-2 friendly win over south africa .
the 20-year-old podolski opened the scoring with a delightful chip on 12 minutes and then showed his killer instinct to score twice inside seven minutes to record a first international hat-trick .
" podolski phenomenom , " headlined kicker magazine .
" the cologne star scores three to compensate for shaky defense . "
klinsmann chose to start ' prince poldi ' on the substitutes ' bench for the recent 2-0 defeat by slovakia and the media claimed it would be folly to do that again .
" super poldi , " declared bild daily .
" klinsmann , never leave him out again . "
podolski , born in the polish city of gliwice , has now scored an impressive 10 goals in 17 internationals .
" it does not matter whether i am in the starting line-up or on the substitutes ' bench - i just want to score my goals , " explained podolski .
" the coach told me to go out there and get my goals and it worked .
the slovakia defeat was a setback but we are now back on track . "
too much pressure ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sebastian deisler podolski made his bundesliga debut at the age of 18 in november 2003 and in the subsequent two years , he has gone from a talented teenager to the next golden boy of german football .

" it is irresponsible to hype up young players such as lukas podolski , " deisler said .
" they get built up and then knocked down later on . "
klinsmann hailed podolski 's perfomance but admitted the younger players all needed the arm-around-the-shoulder treatment .

critics say it 's an attempt to change the political map of europe . russian president vladimir putin 's one-day visit to berlin thursday to meet with german chancellor gerhard schröder and hammer out a deal to build a pipeline linking russia with western europe has raised hackles in the continent 's east .
" the new russian-german alliance , which is today called an ' energy alliance , ' is a plan to change the political map of europe , " former lithuanian head of state and current eu parliamentarian vytautas landsbergis said in a statement .
by building the pipeline under the sea , by-passing the baltic states and poland , russia would be able to use " monopolistic gas prices " to " influence the policies of neighboring countries , " said landsbergis , who led lithuania when the baltic country became independent from the soviet union in 1990 .
baltic states wary the baltic states are particularly wary of pacts between germany and russia , because they were annexed by the soviet union after the signing of the molotov-ribbentrop pact between germany and the ussr in august 1939 .
they regained their independence only in the early 1990s , and joined the eu and nato last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin and germany 's gerhard schröder were present when the companies behind the project put their signatures to the controversial deal on thursday , paving the way for a gas pipeline to be built by russian state-owned energy giant gazprom and german companies e.on and basf .
the pipeline will stretch 1,200 kilometers -lrb- 750 miles -rrb- under the baltic sea , to link the russian city of vyborg , near st petersburg , to greifswald on the northeastern coast of germany . its underwater path means it will skirt the baltic states , as well as ukraine and poland , which currently receive transit fees from gazprom for allowing its pipelines to cross their territory on the way to the lucrative western european market .
the baltic states and poland wanted the pipeline to pass across their territory to ensure that russia will not apply an energy blockade against them or try to manipulate prices .
lithuanian economy minister kestutis dauksys said thursday the deal undermined the baltic state 's energy security .
" this agreement decreases our energy security , but lithuania could not influence this decision , " dauksys said in an interview to lithuanian public radio thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's kwasniewski on wednesday , polish president aleksander kwasniewski -lrb- photo -rrb- too slammed the pipeline deal , saying it was being struck " over the heads of poland and the eu . "
in july , russian parliamentary deputies urged the government to increase the price of gas exports to countries that have moved outside moscow 's orbit .
the duma , russia 's lower chamber of the parliament , approved a non-binding document calling on prime minister mikhail fradkov to increase tariffs for new eu members estonia , latvia and lithuania , as well as georgia , molodova and ukraine , which are ruled by pro-western governments .
russia has the world 's largest natural gas reserves .
russo-german ties face change putin 's visit to berlin on thursday to meet with his friend schröder is also being watched closely in germany , given that the country is heading to the polls in a general election in a week .
vladislav belov , a specialist on germany at the russian academy of science , said putin realized this could well be the last time he would see schröder in office . " putin is supporting his friend gerhard even if he understands objectively that he will no longer be either chancellor or vice-chancellor . ...
all the signs are that the schröder era is at an end , " belov said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while thursday 's visit could see the close of the chapter of warm schröder-putin relations , opinion is divided on the future of russian-german ties should conservative leader angela merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- take the mantle of german leadership . merkel grew up in the former east germany and speaks russian , while putin speaks fluent german after serving with the kgb in leipzig during the cold war .
" economic links between russia and germany will not change under merkel because the two countries will be trying to fulfill their economic potential , " belov predicted . martin koopmann , an expert with the german society for foreign policy -lrb- dgap -rrb- , fears troubled times could be ahead .

critics say it 's an attempt to change the political map of europe . russian president vladimir putin 's one-day visit to berlin thursday to meet with german chancellor gerhard schröder and hammer out a deal to build a pipeline linking russia with western europe has raised hackles in the continent 's east .
" the new russian-german alliance , which is today called an ' energy alliance , ' is a plan to change the political map of europe , " former lithuanian head of state and current eu parliamentarian vytautas landsbergis said in a statement .
by building the pipeline under the sea , by-passing the baltic states and poland , russia would be able to use " monopolistic gas prices " to " influence the policies of neighboring countries , " said landsbergis , who led lithuania when the baltic country became independent from the soviet union in 1990 .
baltic states wary the baltic states are particularly wary of pacts between germany and russia , because they were annexed by the soviet union after the signing of the molotov-ribbentrop pact between germany and the ussr in august 1939 .
they regained their independence only in the early 1990s , and joined the eu and nato last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin and germany 's gerhard schröder were present when the companies behind the project put their signatures to the controversial deal on thursday , paving the way for a gas pipeline to be built by russian state-owned energy giant gazprom and german companies e.on and basf .
the pipeline will stretch 1,200 kilometers -lrb- 750 miles -rrb- under the baltic sea , to link the russian city of vyborg , near st petersburg , to greifswald on the northeastern coast of germany . its underwater path means it will skirt the baltic states , as well as ukraine and poland , which currently receive transit fees from gazprom for allowing its pipelines to cross their territory on the way to the lucrative western european market .
the baltic states and poland wanted the pipeline to pass across their territory to ensure that russia will not apply an energy blockade against them or try to manipulate prices .
lithuanian economy minister kestutis dauksys said thursday the deal undermined the baltic state 's energy security .
" this agreement decreases our energy security , but lithuania could not influence this decision , " dauksys said in an interview to lithuanian public radio thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's kwasniewski on wednesday , polish president aleksander kwasniewski -lrb- photo -rrb- too slammed the pipeline deal , saying it was being struck " over the heads of poland and the eu . "
in july , russian parliamentary deputies urged the government to increase the price of gas exports to countries that have moved outside moscow 's orbit .
the duma , russia 's lower chamber of the parliament , approved a non-binding document calling on prime minister mikhail fradkov to increase tariffs for new eu members estonia , latvia and lithuania , as well as georgia , molodova and ukraine , which are ruled by pro-western governments .
russia has the world 's largest natural gas reserves .
russo-german ties face change putin 's visit to berlin on thursday to meet with his friend schröder is also being watched closely in germany , given that the country is heading to the polls in a general election in a week .
vladislav belov , a specialist on germany at the russian academy of science , said putin realized this could well be the last time he would see schröder in office . " putin is supporting his friend gerhard even if he understands objectively that he will no longer be either chancellor or vice-chancellor . ...
all the signs are that the schröder era is at an end , " belov said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while thursday 's visit could see the close of the chapter of warm schröder-putin relations , opinion is divided on the future of russian-german ties should conservative leader angela merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- take the mantle of german leadership . merkel grew up in the former east germany and speaks russian , while putin speaks fluent german after serving with the kgb in leipzig during the cold war .
" economic links between russia and germany will not change under merkel because the two countries will be trying to fulfill their economic potential , " belov predicted . martin koopmann , an expert with the german society for foreign policy -lrb- dgap -rrb- , fears troubled times could be ahead .

critics say it 's an attempt to change the political map of europe . russian president vladimir putin 's one-day visit to berlin thursday to meet with german chancellor gerhard schröder and hammer out a deal to build a pipeline linking russia with western europe has raised hackles in the continent 's east .
" the new russian-german alliance , which is today called an ' energy alliance , ' is a plan to change the political map of europe , " former lithuanian head of state and current eu parliamentarian vytautas landsbergis said in a statement .
by building the pipeline under the sea , by-passing the baltic states and poland , russia would be able to use " monopolistic gas prices " to " influence the policies of neighboring countries , " said landsbergis , who led lithuania when the baltic country became independent from the soviet union in 1990 .
baltic states wary the baltic states are particularly wary of pacts between germany and russia , because they were annexed by the soviet union after the signing of the molotov-ribbentrop pact between germany and the ussr in august 1939 .
they regained their independence only in the early 1990s , and joined the eu and nato last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin and germany 's gerhard schröder were present when the companies behind the project put their signatures to the controversial deal on thursday , paving the way for a gas pipeline to be built by russian state-owned energy giant gazprom and german companies e.on and basf .
the pipeline will stretch 1,200 kilometers -lrb- 750 miles -rrb- under the baltic sea , to link the russian city of vyborg , near st petersburg , to greifswald on the northeastern coast of germany . its underwater path means it will skirt the baltic states , as well as ukraine and poland , which currently receive transit fees from gazprom for allowing its pipelines to cross their territory on the way to the lucrative western european market .
the baltic states and poland wanted the pipeline to pass across their territory to ensure that russia will not apply an energy blockade against them or try to manipulate prices .
lithuanian economy minister kestutis dauksys said thursday the deal undermined the baltic state 's energy security .
" this agreement decreases our energy security , but lithuania could not influence this decision , " dauksys said in an interview to lithuanian public radio thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's kwasniewski on wednesday , polish president aleksander kwasniewski -lrb- photo -rrb- too slammed the pipeline deal , saying it was being struck " over the heads of poland and the eu . "
in july , russian parliamentary deputies urged the government to increase the price of gas exports to countries that have moved outside moscow 's orbit .
the duma , russia 's lower chamber of the parliament , approved a non-binding document calling on prime minister mikhail fradkov to increase tariffs for new eu members estonia , latvia and lithuania , as well as georgia , molodova and ukraine , which are ruled by pro-western governments .
russia has the world 's largest natural gas reserves .
russo-german ties face change putin 's visit to berlin on thursday to meet with his friend schröder is also being watched closely in germany , given that the country is heading to the polls in a general election in a week .
vladislav belov , a specialist on germany at the russian academy of science , said putin realized this could well be the last time he would see schröder in office . " putin is supporting his friend gerhard even if he understands objectively that he will no longer be either chancellor or vice-chancellor . ...
all the signs are that the schröder era is at an end , " belov said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while thursday 's visit could see the close of the chapter of warm schröder-putin relations , opinion is divided on the future of russian-german ties should conservative leader angela merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- take the mantle of german leadership . merkel grew up in the former east germany and speaks russian , while putin speaks fluent german after serving with the kgb in leipzig during the cold war .
" economic links between russia and germany will not change under merkel because the two countries will be trying to fulfill their economic potential , " belov predicted . martin koopmann , an expert with the german society for foreign policy -lrb- dgap -rrb- , fears troubled times could be ahead .
merkel 's christian democrats will " keep a certain distance from a russia which places all its emphasis on power and less on western-style transparency , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin and schröder to seal gas deal vladimir putin will announce a major agreement to build a pipeline linking russia with western europe when he visits germany thursday , just ahead of the german general election .

" according to our information , schrempp 's resignation was a done-deal at least five weeks before it was made public , " the lawyers argued .
" but this insider information was not published until july 28 .
those shareholders who sold their shares before then could have got a much higher price for their shares if daimlerchrysler had made the information public as soon as it was known , " they said .
in this concrete case , the lawyers ' client had sold his shares in daimlerchrysler just 90 minutes before schrempp 's decision to resign was made public , meaning he pocketed just 36.50 euros from the transaction , rotter rechtsanwälte said . dw-world.de daimler investigated for insider trading german regulators are launching an investigation regarding possible insider dealings of daimlerchrysler 's shares .

the agreement for the north european gas pipeline was due to be signed in october .
but with an election called 12 months early and schröder 's social democrats trailing the opposition christian democrats in the polls , the meeting was brought forward .
vladislav belov , a specialist on germany at the russian academy of science , said putin realized this could well be the last time he would see schröder in office .
show of support " putin is supporting his friend gerhard even if he understands objectively that he will no longer be either chancellor or vice-chancellor . ...
all the signs are that the schröder era is at an end , " belov said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german-russian gas deal has circumvented the ukraine the pipeline will be built by state-owned russian energy giant gazprom , together with several german companies .
around 900 kilometers -lrb- 550 miles -rrb- long , it will stretch from near st. petersburg to the northeastern coast of germany .
significantly , it does not pass over ukraine , upsetting that country and poland , which receive considerable transit fees from gazprom for allowing its current pipelines to pass over their territory on their way to the lucrative western european market .
schröder has pushed for germany to lessen its dependence on oil and gas from the gulf and the united states , and 32 percent of germany 's natural gas is currently supplied by russia .
belov said the pipeline project would " increase the interdependence of the german and russian economies . "
speaking the same language while thursday 's visit could see the close of the chapter of warm schröder-putin relations , opinion is divided on the future of russian-german ties should conservative leader angela merkel take the mantle of german leadership .
merkel grew up in the former east germany and speaks russian , while putin speaks fluent german after serving with the kgb in leipzig during the cold war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel may strike a different tone with russia " economic links between russia and germany will not change under merkel because the two countries will be trying to fulfil their economic potential , " belov predicted .
martin koopmann , an expert with the german society for foreign policy -lrb- dgap -rrb- , fears troubled times could be ahead .
merkel 's christian democrats will " keep a certain distance from a russia which places all its emphasis on power and less on western-style transparency , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin and chirac back germany 's un bid russian president vladimir putin and french president jacques chirac have voiced support for germany 's faltering bid for a permanent seat on the united nations security council .

the agreement for the north european gas pipeline was due to be signed in october .
but with an election called 12 months early and schröder 's social democrats trailing the opposition christian democrats in the polls , the meeting was brought forward .
vladislav belov , a specialist on germany at the russian academy of science , said putin realized this could well be the last time he would see schröder in office .
show of support " putin is supporting his friend gerhard even if he understands objectively that he will no longer be either chancellor or vice-chancellor . ...
all the signs are that the schröder era is at an end , " belov said .

around 900 kilometers -lrb- 550 miles -rrb- long , it will stretch from near st. petersburg to the northeastern coast of germany .
significantly , it does not pass over ukraine , upsetting that country and poland , which receive considerable transit fees from gazprom for allowing its current pipelines to pass over their territory on their way to the lucrative western european market .
schröder has pushed for germany to lessen its dependence on oil and gas from the gulf and the united states , and 32 percent of germany 's natural gas is currently supplied by russia .
belov said the pipeline project would " increase the interdependence of the german and russian economies . "
speaking the same language while thursday 's visit could see the close of the chapter of warm schröder-putin relations , opinion is divided on the future of russian-german ties should conservative leader angela merkel take the mantle of german leadership .
merkel grew up in the former east germany and speaks russian , while putin speaks fluent german after serving with the kgb in leipzig during the cold war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel may strike a different tone with russia " economic links between russia and germany will not change under merkel because the two countries will be trying to fulfil their economic potential , " belov predicted .
martin koopmann , an expert with the german society for foreign policy -lrb- dgap -rrb- , fears troubled times could be ahead .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.09.2005 putin and schröder to seal gas deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for this couple , shared moments as heads of state may soon be over vladimir putin will announce a major agreement to build a pipeline linking russia with western europe when he visits germany thursday , just ahead of the german general election . the timing of the russian president 's brief visit to berlin is seen by observers as putin 's attempt to boost the flagging re-election campaign of his good friend , german chancellor gerhard schröder .
the agreement for the north european gas pipeline was due to be signed in october .
but with an election called 12 months early and schröder 's social democrats trailing the opposition christian democrats in the polls , the meeting was brought forward .
vladislav belov , a specialist on germany at the russian academy of science , said putin realized this could well be the last time he would see schröder in office .
show of support " putin is supporting his friend gerhard even if he understands objectively that he will no longer be either chancellor or vice-chancellor . ...
all the signs are that the schröder era is at an end , " belov said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german-russian gas deal has circumvented the ukraine the pipeline will be built by state-owned russian energy giant gazprom , together with several german companies .
around 900 kilometers -lrb- 550 miles -rrb- long , it will stretch from near st. petersburg to the northeastern coast of germany .
significantly , it does not pass over ukraine , upsetting that country and poland , which receive considerable transit fees from gazprom for allowing its current pipelines to pass over their territory on their way to the lucrative western european market .
schröder has pushed for germany to lessen its dependence on oil and gas from the gulf and the united states , and 32 percent of germany 's natural gas is currently supplied by russia .
belov said the pipeline project would " increase the interdependence of the german and russian economies . "
speaking the same language while thursday 's visit could see the close of the chapter of warm schröder-putin relations , opinion is divided on the future of russian-german ties should conservative leader angela merkel take the mantle of german leadership .
merkel grew up in the former east germany and speaks russian , while putin speaks fluent german after serving with the kgb in leipzig during the cold war .

but the move still has n't allayed deeper worries on both sides . delegations from the 25 eu governments reached agreement here two days after eu trade commissioner peter mandelson had struck a trade deal to resolve an embarrassing standoff which has seriously strained ties with beijing .
" we would hope that if everything goes smoothly .. that by the middle of next week the goods that are currently blocked in customs can be unblocked , " said a spokesman for the european commission .
millions of chinese textiles , including pullovers , trousers , blouses , t-shirts , bras and tons of flax yarn , have been impounded at european ports because they exceed import quotas agreed by both sides in june .
bildunterschrift : boxes of blockaded goods from china are stacked in a warehouse at the port of antwerp in antwerp , belgium the political agreement , reached by ambassadors from eu member states on wednesday , opened the way for experts to work on a legal document that will allow the blocked clothes to be released by customs .
mandelson praised the move .
" i am very pleased that member states have approved the agreement with china and the commission 's proposal for unblocking textile imports from china , " he said in a statement from india , where he was taking part in an eu-india summit . " this solidarity now allows the commission to put in place the legal instrument which should allow the member states to begin unblocking goods next week , " he added .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the question of how to deal with the logjam divided eu members , roughly between southern european countries whose manufacturers fear the flood of cheap imports and northern countries where retailers want fresh stocks .
about five eu states , including italy , spain and portugal , have balked at allowing the products into the bloc .
under the deal negotiated in beijing between mandelson and chinese commerce minister bo xilai , the eu and china will share the quota burden caused by the stockpiles . about half of the estimated 80 million textile products being held up will enter the eu outside the fixed quotas , while the other half will be added to china 's 2006 textile limit .
lasting solutions needed industry officials have welcomed the eu-china deal - but at least one key official warned that the chaotic scenes of the last month or two could happen again unless the eu commission gets a grip on the problem .
" we are happy with the short term solution , " said foreign trade association -lrb- fta -rrb- head ferry den hoed . but he added : " in the end it still can be chaos next year ...
we have large quantities blocked in warehouses in china , and the chinese are not issuing export licenses any more , " he said .
chinese officials have also warned that the deal remains a short-term fix to a long-term problem and that more lasting solutions were needed .

but the move still has n't allayed deeper worries on both sides . delegations from the 25 eu governments reached agreement here two days after eu trade commissioner peter mandelson had struck a trade deal to resolve an embarrassing standoff which has seriously strained ties with beijing .
" we would hope that if everything goes smoothly .. that by the middle of next week the goods that are currently blocked in customs can be unblocked , " said a spokesman for the european commission .
millions of chinese textiles , including pullovers , trousers , blouses , t-shirts , bras and tons of flax yarn , have been impounded at european ports because they exceed import quotas agreed by both sides in june .
bildunterschrift : boxes of blockaded goods from china are stacked in a warehouse at the port of antwerp in antwerp , belgium the political agreement , reached by ambassadors from eu member states on wednesday , opened the way for experts to work on a legal document that will allow the blocked clothes to be released by customs .
mandelson praised the move .
" i am very pleased that member states have approved the agreement with china and the commission 's proposal for unblocking textile imports from china , " he said in a statement from india , where he was taking part in an eu-india summit . " this solidarity now allows the commission to put in place the legal instrument which should allow the member states to begin unblocking goods next week , " he added .
dispute strains ties between eu , china as well as straining relations between the eu and china , the dispute had led to warnings that a shortage of the goods could cause prices to rise and hit european importers and retailers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the question of how to deal with the logjam divided eu members , roughly between southern european countries whose manufacturers fear the flood of cheap imports and northern countries where retailers want fresh stocks .
about five eu states , including italy , spain and portugal , have balked at allowing the products into the bloc .
under the deal negotiated in beijing between mandelson and chinese commerce minister bo xilai , the eu and china will share the quota burden caused by the stockpiles . about half of the estimated 80 million textile products being held up will enter the eu outside the fixed quotas , while the other half will be added to china 's 2006 textile limit .
lasting solutions needed industry officials have welcomed the eu-china deal - but at least one key official warned that the chaotic scenes of the last month or two could happen again unless the eu commission gets a grip on the problem .
" we are happy with the short term solution , " said foreign trade association -lrb- fta -rrb- head ferry den hoed . but he added : " in the end it still can be chaos next year ...
we have large quantities blocked in warehouses in china , and the chinese are not issuing export licenses any more , " he said .
chinese officials have also warned that the deal remains a short-term fix to a long-term problem and that more lasting solutions were needed .

but the move still has n't allayed deeper worries on both sides . delegations from the 25 eu governments reached agreement here two days after eu trade commissioner peter mandelson had struck a trade deal to resolve an embarrassing standoff which has seriously strained ties with beijing .
" we would hope that if everything goes smoothly .. that by the middle of next week the goods that are currently blocked in customs can be unblocked , " said a spokesman for the european commission .

" i am very pleased that member states have approved the agreement with china and the commission 's proposal for unblocking textile imports from china , " he said in a statement from india , where he was taking part in an eu-india summit .

under the deal negotiated in beijing between mandelson and chinese commerce minister bo xilai , the eu and china will share the quota burden caused by the stockpiles . about half of the estimated 80 million textile products being held up will enter the eu outside the fixed quotas , while the other half will be added to china 's 2006 textile limit .

germany defeated south africa 4-2 in wednesday 's friendly at the weserstadion in bremen and minus 35-year-old goalkeeper jens lehmann , the team had an average age of just under 23 .
" as otto rehhagel used to say there is no such thing as old and young players but good and bad ones , " explained klinsmann .
" if the young players are better they are going to play . "
klinsmann handed full debuts to 19-year-old duo patrick sinkiewitz and marcell jansen despite limited experience in the bundesliga .
the 1990 world cup victor felt the gamble was a success .
" marcell was calm and impressed with his surges forward , " declared klinsmann .
" patrick was also cool and is another alternative in central defense . "
inexperience not a concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borussia mönchengladbach defender jansen and fc cologne starlet sinkiewitz have played less than 30 bundesliga games between them but inexperience does not concern klinsmann .
" a young team is growing and it will get better and better , " he said .
" if we look back to august last year then almost all of our players have made progress .
it is great fun watching this team out there . "
with the 21-year-old bastian schweinsteiger , lukas podolski and per mertesacker , both 20 , also in the starting line-up it could almost have been an under-21 fixture .
although the youth stars have added vim to germany 's attack , the defense has been rather shaky .
mertesacker has caused a penalty in both of his last two matches with the national team .
but klinsmann has left seasoned internationals such as liverpool midfielder dietmar hamann and borussia dortmund defender christian worns on the sidelines and it is unclear what role , if any , they will play at the 2006 world cup .
poldi power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's lukas podolski celebrates after scoring the opening goal during the friendly soccer match between germany and south africa on wednesday , sept .
7 , 2005 .
germany has benefited greatly , however , from the new youth players up front .
fc cologne striker podolski woke up on thursday to find his picture plastered across the newspapers after scoring a hat-trick in germany 's 4-2 friendly win over south africa .
the 20-year-old podolski opened the scoring with a delightful chip on 12 minutes and then showed his killer instinct to score twice inside seven minutes to record a first international hat-trick .
" podolski phenomenom , " headlined kicker magazine .
" the cologne star scores three to compensate for shaky defense . "
klinsmann chose to start ' prince poldi ' on the substitutes ' bench for the recent 2-0 defeat by slovakia and the media claimed it would be folly to do that again .
" super poldi , " declared bild daily .
" klinsmann , never leave him out again . "
podolski , born in the polish city of gliwice , has now scored an impressive 10 goals in 17 internationals .
" it does not matter whether i am in the starting line-up or on the substitutes ' bench - i just want to score my goals , " explained podolski .
" the coach told me to go out there and get my goals and it worked .
the slovakia defeat was a setback but we are now back on track . "
too much pressure ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sebastian deisler podolski made his bundesliga debut at the age of 18 in november 2003 and in the subsequent two years , he has gone from a talented teenager to the next golden boy of german football .
it seems the polish-born striker can do no wrong at the moment but bayern munich midfielder sebastian deisler - once heralded as the savior of german football - insists people must not put too much pressure on podolski .
" it is irresponsible to hype up young players such as lukas podolski , " deisler said .
" they get built up and then knocked down later on . "
klinsmann hailed podolski 's perfomance but admitted the younger players all needed the arm-around-the-shoulder treatment .
" some of the younger players do need protecting as they are new at this level , " said klinsmann .
" that is why i do not play them all the time as they need to be bedded in slowly .

us president bush accepted berlin 's offer of help on sunday . the german technical relief team is expected to spend the next few weeks in the ravaged region helping with clean-up efforts in the wake of hurricane katrina .
the 89 experts , who are accompanied by a five-person medical team , are equipped with 15 high performance pumps , capable of pumping 175,000 liters of water per minute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dead bodies float down the flooded streets berlin , which is funding the technisches hilfswerk mission , is also planning to send between 20 and 30 specialists from the bundeskriminalamt , the federal criminal bureau , to help with the difficult task of identifying the bodies of katrina 's victims .
government spokesman bela anda said germany would be sending some 40 tons of food to the us . the situation in new orleans remains critical . following an evacuation order issued by the city mayor , ray nagin , national guard troops in the southern city are looking for thousands of people still thought to be trapped in the ruins of their homes of the city once famed for its party atmosphere . hide and seek as many as 10,000 stragglers , who are surrounded by a toxic soup of garbage , human excrement and corpses , have been without water or electricity for more than a week .
and although many of them are waiting desperately for their turn to be rescued , others have resigned themselves to the ruling to clear the city . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " those who do n't want us to find them , they hide , " gregg brown , a south carolina game warden who is involved in the search , told the reuters news agency . one new orleans resident told reporters that he had no money , nowhere to go and that if he was going to be miserable , he 'd sooner be miserable where he is . criticism continues although washington has accepted help from abroad , pressure over the president 's handling of the catastrophe continues to mount .
while the senate homeland security committee has already launched one inquiry , the democrats are demanding an independent probe into the government response to the gulf coast storm . harry reid , the democratic leader in the senate , has said any inquiry should look into whether the president 's long summer holiday at his texas ranch influenced the government response . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush is under fire for his handling of the disaster bush 's majority republicans only agreed on wednesday to a joint senate-house of representatives investigation to look into the actions of " all levels of government . "
bush , who has also promised to lead his own inquiry , would not say whether any aides would be fired over the slow response that he has admitted was unacceptable . he admitted that any inquiry will have to look at the links between federal and local authorities in handling such disasters - hinting that the federal authorities should take a stronger hand . politics at play both ray nagin , and the governor of louisiana , kathleen blanco , have accused washington of holding up the rescue . a survey conducted by the newspaper usa today said 25 percent of americans criticized local authorities and 18 percent the state of louisiana for the chaos .
but the president does n't escape .
forty-two percent of those asked said he had handled katrina " badly " or " very badly " .
thirty-five percent backed bush 's effort . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tiny patch of wreckage republicans have accused democrats of playing politics with their attacks and diverting attention from the rescue effort . democrats , meanwhile , also seized upon what they say are clumsy remarks by the republican speaker in the house , dennis hastert , who was forced to retract comments questioning whether rebuilding new orleans was worth the cost and by barbara bush , the president 's mother , that the " underprivileged " of louisiana were better off in their emergency shelter in the houston astrodome stadium , and that it was " working very well for them .

" we are operating in a very safe environment , but of course the tragic accidents we 've had have to give us a push to improve safety standards even further , " said commission spokesman stefaan de rynck . de rynck said the talks between member states were " important " in helping decide what criteria should be used in drawing up the blacklist , as well as what the consequences of being on a banned list should be . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trying to prevent more disasters like this one in greece " the european union needs common criteria to identify unsafe airlines .
such airlines would be put on a european black list and be subject to an eu-wide ban to fly , " said a commission statement . the european parliament will take up the issue in november , and a meeting of european transportation ministers will be organized after that . " the commission hopes for a political agreement on the common criteria , the eu black list , and the eu-wide ban by the end of the year , " it added . incoherent rules the eu commission said the " incoherence " of current air safety regulations was highlighted in may when a turkish airline , suspended by four european countries , simply redirected its flights to belgium which had not imposed a similar ban . " this is astonishing , and a little bit absurd , " said the spokesman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu officials want all member states to follow the same rules the european union blacklist idea is similar to a mechanism already operational in the united states , where would-be passengers can consult a website publishing the names of airlines with relatively poor safety records .
similar backlists exist in france , britain and sweden . experts from 35 european countries called last month for the definition of common criteria to establish lists of airline companies to be blacklisted on safety grounds . " it is essential to define common criteria , " said michel wachenheim , head of the french civil aviation authority -lrb- dgac -rrb- , at a meeting of the european civil aviation conference -lrb- ecac -rrb- . cypriot airlines deny pilot language problems the eu talks in brussels came as the low-cost airline involved in a mysterious crash in greece last month denied a report that below-par language skills and the inexperience of a pilot contributed to the accident . cyprus ' helios airways said it was confident that the pilots of the doomed flight , which crashed on august 14 killing all 121 on board , were able to understand each other in english on the flight to prague via athens . " i 've spoken to both pilots and their english was of a good standard ...

but the move still has n't allayed deeper worries on both sides . delegations from the 25 eu governments reached agreement here two days after eu trade commissioner peter mandelson had struck a trade deal to resolve an embarrassing standoff which has seriously strained ties with beijing .
" we would hope that if everything goes smoothly .. that by the middle of next week the goods that are currently blocked in customs can be unblocked , " said a spokesman for the european commission .
millions of chinese textiles , including pullovers , trousers , blouses , t-shirts , bras and tons of flax yarn , have been impounded at european ports because they exceed import quotas agreed by both sides in june .
bildunterschrift : boxes of blockaded goods from china are stacked in a warehouse at the port of antwerp in antwerp , belgium the political agreement , reached by ambassadors from eu member states on wednesday , opened the way for experts to work on a legal document that will allow the blocked clothes to be released by customs .
mandelson praised the move .
" i am very pleased that member states have approved the agreement with china and the commission 's proposal for unblocking textile imports from china , " he said in a statement from india , where he was taking part in an eu-india summit . " this solidarity now allows the commission to put in place the legal instrument which should allow the member states to begin unblocking goods next week , " he added .
dispute strains ties between eu , china as well as straining relations between the eu and china , the dispute had led to warnings that a shortage of the goods could cause prices to rise and hit european importers and retailers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the question of how to deal with the logjam divided eu members , roughly between southern european countries whose manufacturers fear the flood of cheap imports and northern countries where retailers want fresh stocks .
about five eu states , including italy , spain and portugal , have balked at allowing the products into the bloc .
under the deal negotiated in beijing between mandelson and chinese commerce minister bo xilai , the eu and china will share the quota burden caused by the stockpiles . about half of the estimated 80 million textile products being held up will enter the eu outside the fixed quotas , while the other half will be added to china 's 2006 textile limit .
lasting solutions needed industry officials have welcomed the eu-china deal - but at least one key official warned that the chaotic scenes of the last month or two could happen again unless the eu commission gets a grip on the problem .
" we are happy with the short term solution , " said foreign trade association -lrb- fta -rrb- head ferry den hoed . but he added : " in the end it still can be chaos next year ...
we have large quantities blocked in warehouses in china , and the chinese are not issuing export licenses any more , " he said .
chinese officials have also warned that the deal remains a short-term fix to a long-term problem and that more lasting solutions were needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese models parade in outfits which use themes from the forbidden city , on a stage in front of the former imperial palace in beijing some chinese textile manufacturers have already started worrying about their future exports , according to the state-run xinhua news agency . " the export quotas for the second half of the year have almost been used up and if we start using next year 's quotas , we will face greater pressure next year , " said zhu hongjun , a senior manager with peiluocheng group in zhejiang .
in spain , finance minister pedro solbes said he believed that the compromise deal did not deal with the crux of the problem . he said that it " does not take into account in a balanced way the whole of the problem " .

munich-based lawyers rotter rechtsanwälte said in a statement that they had filed a suit with a court in stuttgart alleging that the german-us auto giant failed to inform their client promptly about the decision by chief executive juergen schrempp to step down early .
after schrempp announced he was quitting , daimlerchrysler shares soared by more than 10 percent on the stock exchange , boosting the company 's market value by more than three billion euros -lrb- $ 3.7 billion -rrb- .
" according to our information , schrempp 's resignation was a done-deal at least five weeks before it was made public , " the lawyers argued .
" but this insider information was not published until july 28 .
those shareholders who sold their shares before then could have got a much higher price for their shares if daimlerchrysler had made the information public as soon as it was known , " they said .
in this concrete case , the lawyers ' client had sold his shares in daimlerchrysler just 90 minutes before schrempp 's decision to resign was made public , meaning he pocketed just 36.50 euros from the transaction , rotter rechtsanwälte said . dw-world.de daimler investigated for insider trading german regulators are launching an investigation regarding possible insider dealings of daimlerchrysler 's shares .
the german-us company is already being probed on bribery charges in the us .

us president bush accepted berlin 's offer of help on sunday . the german technical relief team is expected to spend the next few weeks in the ravaged region helping with clean-up efforts in the wake of hurricane katrina .
the 89 experts , who are accompanied by a five-person medical team , are equipped with 15 high performance pumps , capable of pumping 175,000 liters of water per minute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dead bodies float down the flooded streets berlin , which is funding the technisches hilfswerk mission , is also planning to send between 20 and 30 specialists from the bundeskriminalamt , the federal criminal bureau , to help with the difficult task of identifying the bodies of katrina 's victims .
government spokesman bela anda said germany would be sending some 40 tons of food to the us . the situation in new orleans remains critical . following an evacuation order issued by the city mayor , ray nagin , national guard troops in the southern city are looking for thousands of people still thought to be trapped in the ruins of their homes of the city once famed for its party atmosphere . hide and seek as many as 10,000 stragglers , who are surrounded by a toxic soup of garbage , human excrement and corpses , have been without water or electricity for more than a week .
and although many of them are waiting desperately for their turn to be rescued , others have resigned themselves to the ruling to clear the city . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " those who do n't want us to find them , they hide , " gregg brown , a south carolina game warden who is involved in the search , told the reuters news agency . one new orleans resident told reporters that he had no money , nowhere to go and that if he was going to be miserable , he 'd sooner be miserable where he is . criticism continues although washington has accepted help from abroad , pressure over the president 's handling of the catastrophe continues to mount .
while the senate homeland security committee has already launched one inquiry , the democrats are demanding an independent probe into the government response to the gulf coast storm . harry reid , the democratic leader in the senate , has said any inquiry should look into whether the president 's long summer holiday at his texas ranch influenced the government response . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush is under fire for his handling of the disaster bush 's majority republicans only agreed on wednesday to a joint senate-house of representatives investigation to look into the actions of " all levels of government . "
bush , who has also promised to lead his own inquiry , would not say whether any aides would be fired over the slow response that he has admitted was unacceptable . he admitted that any inquiry will have to look at the links between federal and local authorities in handling such disasters - hinting that the federal authorities should take a stronger hand . politics at play both ray nagin , and the governor of louisiana , kathleen blanco , have accused washington of holding up the rescue . a survey conducted by the newspaper usa today said 25 percent of americans criticized local authorities and 18 percent the state of louisiana for the chaos .
but the president does n't escape .
forty-two percent of those asked said he had handled katrina " badly " or " very badly " .
thirty-five percent backed bush 's effort . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tiny patch of wreckage republicans have accused democrats of playing politics with their attacks and diverting attention from the rescue effort . democrats , meanwhile , also seized upon what they say are clumsy remarks by the republican speaker in the house , dennis hastert , who was forced to retract comments questioning whether rebuilding new orleans was worth the cost and by barbara bush , the president 's mother , that the " underprivileged " of louisiana were better off in their emergency shelter in the houston astrodome stadium , and that it was " working very well for them .

but the move still has n't allayed deeper worries on both sides . delegations from the 25 eu governments reached agreement here two days after eu trade commissioner peter mandelson had struck a trade deal to resolve an embarrassing standoff which has seriously strained ties with beijing .
" we would hope that if everything goes smoothly .. that by the middle of next week the goods that are currently blocked in customs can be unblocked , " said a spokesman for the european commission .
millions of chinese textiles , including pullovers , trousers , blouses , t-shirts , bras and tons of flax yarn , have been impounded at european ports because they exceed import quotas agreed by both sides in june .
bildunterschrift : boxes of blockaded goods from china are stacked in a warehouse at the port of antwerp in antwerp , belgium the political agreement , reached by ambassadors from eu member states on wednesday , opened the way for experts to work on a legal document that will allow the blocked clothes to be released by customs .
mandelson praised the move .
" i am very pleased that member states have approved the agreement with china and the commission 's proposal for unblocking textile imports from china , " he said in a statement from india , where he was taking part in an eu-india summit . " this solidarity now allows the commission to put in place the legal instrument which should allow the member states to begin unblocking goods next week , " he added .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the question of how to deal with the logjam divided eu members , roughly between southern european countries whose manufacturers fear the flood of cheap imports and northern countries where retailers want fresh stocks .
about five eu states , including italy , spain and portugal , have balked at allowing the products into the bloc .
under the deal negotiated in beijing between mandelson and chinese commerce minister bo xilai , the eu and china will share the quota burden caused by the stockpiles . about half of the estimated 80 million textile products being held up will enter the eu outside the fixed quotas , while the other half will be added to china 's 2006 textile limit .
lasting solutions needed industry officials have welcomed the eu-china deal - but at least one key official warned that the chaotic scenes of the last month or two could happen again unless the eu commission gets a grip on the problem .
" we are happy with the short term solution , " said foreign trade association -lrb- fta -rrb- head ferry den hoed . but he added : " in the end it still can be chaos next year ...
we have large quantities blocked in warehouses in china , and the chinese are not issuing export licenses any more , " he said .
chinese officials have also warned that the deal remains a short-term fix to a long-term problem and that more lasting solutions were needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese models parade in outfits which use themes from the forbidden city , on a stage in front of the former imperial palace in beijing some chinese textile manufacturers have already started worrying about their future exports , according to the state-run xinhua news agency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 08.09.2005 klinsmann to stick to youth policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's young defense struggled against south africa german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann has vowed to continue with his youth policy into the 2006 world cup despite worries about the squad 's still shaky defense , which conceded two goals to south africa wednesday . sticking to the old adage of " if you 're good enough you 're old enough " , klinsmann deflected criticism that his policy of using younger players was creating problems for the national team .
germany defeated south africa 4-2 in wednesday 's friendly at the weserstadion in bremen and minus 35-year-old goalkeeper jens lehmann , the team had an average age of just under 23 .
" as otto rehhagel used to say there is no such thing as old and young players but good and bad ones , " explained klinsmann .
" if the young players are better they are going to play . "
klinsmann handed full debuts to 19-year-old duo patrick sinkiewitz and marcell jansen despite limited experience in the bundesliga .
the 1990 world cup victor felt the gamble was a success .
" marcell was calm and impressed with his surges forward , " declared klinsmann .
" patrick was also cool and is another alternative in central defense . "
inexperience not a concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borussia mönchengladbach defender jansen and fc cologne starlet sinkiewitz have played less than 30 bundesliga games between them but inexperience does not concern klinsmann .
" a young team is growing and it will get better and better , " he said .
" if we look back to august last year then almost all of our players have made progress .
it is great fun watching this team out there . "
with the 21-year-old bastian schweinsteiger , lukas podolski and per mertesacker , both 20 , also in the starting line-up it could almost have been an under-21 fixture .
although the youth stars have added vim to germany 's attack , the defense has been rather shaky .
mertesacker has caused a penalty in both of his last two matches with the national team .
but klinsmann has left seasoned internationals such as liverpool midfielder dietmar hamann and borussia dortmund defender christian worns on the sidelines and it is unclear what role , if any , they will play at the 2006 world cup .
poldi power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's lukas podolski celebrates after scoring the opening goal during the friendly soccer match between germany and south africa on wednesday , sept .
7 , 2005 .
germany has benefited greatly , however , from the new youth players up front .
fc cologne striker podolski woke up on thursday to find his picture plastered across the newspapers after scoring a hat-trick in germany 's 4-2 friendly win over south africa .
the 20-year-old podolski opened the scoring with a delightful chip on 12 minutes and then showed his killer instinct to score twice inside seven minutes to record a first international hat-trick .
" podolski phenomenom , " headlined kicker magazine .
" the cologne star scores three to compensate for shaky defense . "
klinsmann chose to start ' prince poldi ' on the substitutes ' bench for the recent 2-0 defeat by slovakia and the media claimed it would be folly to do that again .
" super poldi , " declared bild daily .
" klinsmann , never leave him out again . "
podolski , born in the polish city of gliwice , has now scored an impressive 10 goals in 17 internationals .
" it does not matter whether i am in the starting line-up or on the substitutes ' bench - i just want to score my goals , " explained podolski .
" the coach told me to go out there and get my goals and it worked .
the slovakia defeat was a setback but we are now back on track . "
too much pressure ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sebastian deisler podolski made his bundesliga debut at the age of 18 in november 2003 and in the subsequent two years , he has gone from a talented teenager to the next golden boy of german football .
it seems the polish-born striker can do no wrong at the moment but bayern munich midfielder sebastian deisler - once heralded as the savior of german football - insists people must not put too much pressure on podolski .
" it is irresponsible to hype up young players such as lukas podolski , " deisler said .
" they get built up and then knocked down later on . "
klinsmann hailed podolski 's perfomance but admitted the younger players all needed the arm-around-the-shoulder treatment .
" some of the younger players do need protecting as they are new at this level , " said klinsmann .
" that is why i do not play them all the time as they need to be bedded in slowly .

germany defeated south africa 4-2 in wednesday 's friendly at the weserstadion in bremen and minus 35-year-old goalkeeper jens lehmann , the team had an average age of just under 23 .
" as otto rehhagel used to say there is no such thing as old and young players but good and bad ones , " explained klinsmann .
" if the young players are better they are going to play . "
klinsmann handed full debuts to 19-year-old duo patrick sinkiewitz and marcell jansen despite limited experience in the bundesliga .
the 1990 world cup victor felt the gamble was a success .
" marcell was calm and impressed with his surges forward , " declared klinsmann .
" patrick was also cool and is another alternative in central defense . "
inexperience not a concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borussia mönchengladbach defender jansen and fc cologne starlet sinkiewitz have played less than 30 bundesliga games between them but inexperience does not concern klinsmann .
" a young team is growing and it will get better and better , " he said .
" if we look back to august last year then almost all of our players have made progress .
it is great fun watching this team out there . "
with the 21-year-old bastian schweinsteiger , lukas podolski and per mertesacker , both 20 , also in the starting line-up it could almost have been an under-21 fixture .
although the youth stars have added vim to germany 's attack , the defense has been rather shaky .
mertesacker has caused a penalty in both of his last two matches with the national team .
but klinsmann has left seasoned internationals such as liverpool midfielder dietmar hamann and borussia dortmund defender christian worns on the sidelines and it is unclear what role , if any , they will play at the 2006 world cup .

7 , 2005 .
germany has benefited greatly , however , from the new youth players up front .
fc cologne striker podolski woke up on thursday to find his picture plastered across the newspapers after scoring a hat-trick in germany 's 4-2 friendly win over south africa .
the 20-year-old podolski opened the scoring with a delightful chip on 12 minutes and then showed his killer instinct to score twice inside seven minutes to record a first international hat-trick .
" podolski phenomenom , " headlined kicker magazine .
" the cologne star scores three to compensate for shaky defense . "
klinsmann chose to start ' prince poldi ' on the substitutes ' bench for the recent 2-0 defeat by slovakia and the media claimed it would be folly to do that again .
" super poldi , " declared bild daily .
" klinsmann , never leave him out again . "
podolski , born in the polish city of gliwice , has now scored an impressive 10 goals in 17 internationals .
" it does not matter whether i am in the starting line-up or on the substitutes ' bench - i just want to score my goals , " explained podolski .
" the coach told me to go out there and get my goals and it worked .
the slovakia defeat was a setback but we are now back on track . "
too much pressure ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sebastian deisler podolski made his bundesliga debut at the age of 18 in november 2003 and in the subsequent two years , he has gone from a talented teenager to the next golden boy of german football .
it seems the polish-born striker can do no wrong at the moment but bayern munich midfielder sebastian deisler - once heralded as the savior of german football - insists people must not put too much pressure on podolski .
" it is irresponsible to hype up young players such as lukas podolski , " deisler said .
" they get built up and then knocked down later on . "
klinsmann hailed podolski 's perfomance but admitted the younger players all needed the arm-around-the-shoulder treatment .

critics say it 's an attempt to change the political map of europe . russian president vladimir putin 's one-day visit to berlin thursday to meet with german chancellor gerhard schröder and hammer out a deal to build a pipeline linking russia with western europe has raised hackles in the continent 's east .
" the new russian-german alliance , which is today called an ' energy alliance , ' is a plan to change the political map of europe , " former lithuanian head of state and current eu parliamentarian vytautas landsbergis said in a statement .
by building the pipeline under the sea , by-passing the baltic states and poland , russia would be able to use " monopolistic gas prices " to " influence the policies of neighboring countries , " said landsbergis , who led lithuania when the baltic country became independent from the soviet union in 1990 .
baltic states wary the baltic states are particularly wary of pacts between germany and russia , because they were annexed by the soviet union after the signing of the molotov-ribbentrop pact between germany and the ussr in august 1939 .
they regained their independence only in the early 1990s , and joined the eu and nato last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin and germany 's gerhard schröder were present when the companies behind the project put their signatures to the controversial deal on thursday , paving the way for a gas pipeline to be built by russian state-owned energy giant gazprom and german companies e.on and basf .
the pipeline will stretch 1,200 kilometers -lrb- 750 miles -rrb- under the baltic sea , to link the russian city of vyborg , near st petersburg , to greifswald on the northeastern coast of germany . its underwater path means it will skirt the baltic states , as well as ukraine and poland , which currently receive transit fees from gazprom for allowing its pipelines to cross their territory on the way to the lucrative western european market .
the baltic states and poland wanted the pipeline to pass across their territory to ensure that russia will not apply an energy blockade against them or try to manipulate prices .
lithuanian economy minister kestutis dauksys said thursday the deal undermined the baltic state 's energy security .
" this agreement decreases our energy security , but lithuania could not influence this decision , " dauksys said in an interview to lithuanian public radio thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's kwasniewski on wednesday , polish president aleksander kwasniewski -lrb- photo -rrb- too slammed the pipeline deal , saying it was being struck " over the heads of poland and the eu . "
in july , russian parliamentary deputies urged the government to increase the price of gas exports to countries that have moved outside moscow 's orbit .
the duma , russia 's lower chamber of the parliament , approved a non-binding document calling on prime minister mikhail fradkov to increase tariffs for new eu members estonia , latvia and lithuania , as well as georgia , molodova and ukraine , which are ruled by pro-western governments .
russia has the world 's largest natural gas reserves .
russo-german ties face change putin 's visit to berlin on thursday to meet with his friend schröder is also being watched closely in germany , given that the country is heading to the polls in a general election in a week .
vladislav belov , a specialist on germany at the russian academy of science , said putin realized this could well be the last time he would see schröder in office . " putin is supporting his friend gerhard even if he understands objectively that he will no longer be either chancellor or vice-chancellor . ...
all the signs are that the schröder era is at an end , " belov said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while thursday 's visit could see the close of the chapter of warm schröder-putin relations , opinion is divided on the future of russian-german ties should conservative leader angela merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- take the mantle of german leadership . merkel grew up in the former east germany and speaks russian , while putin speaks fluent german after serving with the kgb in leipzig during the cold war .
" economic links between russia and germany will not change under merkel because the two countries will be trying to fulfill their economic potential , " belov predicted . martin koopmann , an expert with the german society for foreign policy -lrb- dgap -rrb- , fears troubled times could be ahead .

but the move still has n't allayed deeper worries on both sides . delegations from the 25 eu governments reached agreement here two days after eu trade commissioner peter mandelson had struck a trade deal to resolve an embarrassing standoff which has seriously strained ties with beijing .
" we would hope that if everything goes smoothly .. that by the middle of next week the goods that are currently blocked in customs can be unblocked , " said a spokesman for the european commission .
millions of chinese textiles , including pullovers , trousers , blouses , t-shirts , bras and tons of flax yarn , have been impounded at european ports because they exceed import quotas agreed by both sides in june .
bildunterschrift : boxes of blockaded goods from china are stacked in a warehouse at the port of antwerp in antwerp , belgium the political agreement , reached by ambassadors from eu member states on wednesday , opened the way for experts to work on a legal document that will allow the blocked clothes to be released by customs .
mandelson praised the move .
" i am very pleased that member states have approved the agreement with china and the commission 's proposal for unblocking textile imports from china , " he said in a statement from india , where he was taking part in an eu-india summit . " this solidarity now allows the commission to put in place the legal instrument which should allow the member states to begin unblocking goods next week , " he added .
dispute strains ties between eu , china as well as straining relations between the eu and china , the dispute had led to warnings that a shortage of the goods could cause prices to rise and hit european importers and retailers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the question of how to deal with the logjam divided eu members , roughly between southern european countries whose manufacturers fear the flood of cheap imports and northern countries where retailers want fresh stocks .
about five eu states , including italy , spain and portugal , have balked at allowing the products into the bloc .
under the deal negotiated in beijing between mandelson and chinese commerce minister bo xilai , the eu and china will share the quota burden caused by the stockpiles . about half of the estimated 80 million textile products being held up will enter the eu outside the fixed quotas , while the other half will be added to china 's 2006 textile limit .
lasting solutions needed industry officials have welcomed the eu-china deal - but at least one key official warned that the chaotic scenes of the last month or two could happen again unless the eu commission gets a grip on the problem .
" we are happy with the short term solution , " said foreign trade association -lrb- fta -rrb- head ferry den hoed . but he added : " in the end it still can be chaos next year ...
we have large quantities blocked in warehouses in china , and the chinese are not issuing export licenses any more , " he said .
chinese officials have also warned that the deal remains a short-term fix to a long-term problem and that more lasting solutions were needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese models parade in outfits which use themes from the forbidden city , on a stage in front of the former imperial palace in beijing some chinese textile manufacturers have already started worrying about their future exports , according to the state-run xinhua news agency . " the export quotas for the second half of the year have almost been used up and if we start using next year 's quotas , we will face greater pressure next year , " said zhu hongjun , a senior manager with peiluocheng group in zhejiang .
in spain , finance minister pedro solbes said he believed that the compromise deal did not deal with the crux of the problem . he said that it " does not take into account in a balanced way the whole of the problem " .

critics say it 's an attempt to change the political map of europe . russian president vladimir putin 's one-day visit to berlin thursday to meet with german chancellor gerhard schröder and hammer out a deal to build a pipeline linking russia with western europe has raised hackles in the continent 's east .
" the new russian-german alliance , which is today called an ' energy alliance , ' is a plan to change the political map of europe , " former lithuanian head of state and current eu parliamentarian vytautas landsbergis said in a statement .
by building the pipeline under the sea , by-passing the baltic states and poland , russia would be able to use " monopolistic gas prices " to " influence the policies of neighboring countries , " said landsbergis , who led lithuania when the baltic country became independent from the soviet union in 1990 .
baltic states wary the baltic states are particularly wary of pacts between germany and russia , because they were annexed by the soviet union after the signing of the molotov-ribbentrop pact between germany and the ussr in august 1939 .
they regained their independence only in the early 1990s , and joined the eu and nato last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin and germany 's gerhard schröder were present when the companies behind the project put their signatures to the controversial deal on thursday , paving the way for a gas pipeline to be built by russian state-owned energy giant gazprom and german companies e.on and basf .
the pipeline will stretch 1,200 kilometers -lrb- 750 miles -rrb- under the baltic sea , to link the russian city of vyborg , near st petersburg , to greifswald on the northeastern coast of germany . its underwater path means it will skirt the baltic states , as well as ukraine and poland , which currently receive transit fees from gazprom for allowing its pipelines to cross their territory on the way to the lucrative western european market .
the baltic states and poland wanted the pipeline to pass across their territory to ensure that russia will not apply an energy blockade against them or try to manipulate prices .
lithuanian economy minister kestutis dauksys said thursday the deal undermined the baltic state 's energy security .
" this agreement decreases our energy security , but lithuania could not influence this decision , " dauksys said in an interview to lithuanian public radio thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's kwasniewski on wednesday , polish president aleksander kwasniewski -lrb- photo -rrb- too slammed the pipeline deal , saying it was being struck " over the heads of poland and the eu . "
in july , russian parliamentary deputies urged the government to increase the price of gas exports to countries that have moved outside moscow 's orbit .
the duma , russia 's lower chamber of the parliament , approved a non-binding document calling on prime minister mikhail fradkov to increase tariffs for new eu members estonia , latvia and lithuania , as well as georgia , molodova and ukraine , which are ruled by pro-western governments .
russia has the world 's largest natural gas reserves .
russo-german ties face change putin 's visit to berlin on thursday to meet with his friend schröder is also being watched closely in germany , given that the country is heading to the polls in a general election in a week .
vladislav belov , a specialist on germany at the russian academy of science , said putin realized this could well be the last time he would see schröder in office . " putin is supporting his friend gerhard even if he understands objectively that he will no longer be either chancellor or vice-chancellor . ...
all the signs are that the schröder era is at an end , " belov said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while thursday 's visit could see the close of the chapter of warm schröder-putin relations , opinion is divided on the future of russian-german ties should conservative leader angela merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- take the mantle of german leadership . merkel grew up in the former east germany and speaks russian , while putin speaks fluent german after serving with the kgb in leipzig during the cold war .
" economic links between russia and germany will not change under merkel because the two countries will be trying to fulfill their economic potential , " belov predicted . martin koopmann , an expert with the german society for foreign policy -lrb- dgap -rrb- , fears troubled times could be ahead .
merkel 's christian democrats will " keep a certain distance from a russia which places all its emphasis on power and less on western-style transparency , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin and schröder to seal gas deal vladimir putin will announce a major agreement to build a pipeline linking russia with western europe when he visits germany thursday , just ahead of the german general election .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's electronics industry , which has been plagued by profit concerns and price falls in recent years , had pinned high hopes on the ifa which has improved continually every year in terms of attracting heavyweight exhibitors .
this year over 1,200 of them from 40 countries were vying for attention with their latest products .
more professionals , more orders according to stehle , even the specialized trade center at the fair was teeming with visitors this year , demand was high and buyers placed record number of orders .
" there were more industry professionals this year at the ifa than say two years ago , " said stehle who added that even the levels of know-how and expertise among them were significantly higher .
" the volume of orders was correspondingly higher - estimated at more than 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.1 billion -rrb- as compared to about 2.4 billion euros in 2003 , " said stehle .
though the estimates have not yet been officially confirmed and put down on paper , stehle said the industry was confident that the final figures on orders and visitors would make this year 's ifa stand out in the fair 's 81-year history .

stehle confirmed that the continued digitalization of electronic gadgets right from radios to mobile phones and home entertainment was a promising development and that it would also raise demand for other digital products such as dvds and video players , cameras and mp3 players .

critics say it 's an attempt to change the political map of europe . russian president vladimir putin 's one-day visit to berlin thursday to meet with german chancellor gerhard schröder and hammer out a deal to build a pipeline linking russia with western europe has raised hackles in the continent 's east .
" the new russian-german alliance , which is today called an ' energy alliance , ' is a plan to change the political map of europe , " former lithuanian head of state and current eu parliamentarian vytautas landsbergis said in a statement .
by building the pipeline under the sea , by-passing the baltic states and poland , russia would be able to use " monopolistic gas prices " to " influence the policies of neighboring countries , " said landsbergis , who led lithuania when the baltic country became independent from the soviet union in 1990 .
baltic states wary the baltic states are particularly wary of pacts between germany and russia , because they were annexed by the soviet union after the signing of the molotov-ribbentrop pact between germany and the ussr in august 1939 .
they regained their independence only in the early 1990s , and joined the eu and nato last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin and germany 's gerhard schröder were present when the companies behind the project put their signatures to the controversial deal on thursday , paving the way for a gas pipeline to be built by russian state-owned energy giant gazprom and german companies e.on and basf .
the pipeline will stretch 1,200 kilometers -lrb- 750 miles -rrb- under the baltic sea , to link the russian city of vyborg , near st petersburg , to greifswald on the northeastern coast of germany . its underwater path means it will skirt the baltic states , as well as ukraine and poland , which currently receive transit fees from gazprom for allowing its pipelines to cross their territory on the way to the lucrative western european market .
the baltic states and poland wanted the pipeline to pass across their territory to ensure that russia will not apply an energy blockade against them or try to manipulate prices .
lithuanian economy minister kestutis dauksys said thursday the deal undermined the baltic state 's energy security .
" this agreement decreases our energy security , but lithuania could not influence this decision , " dauksys said in an interview to lithuanian public radio thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's kwasniewski on wednesday , polish president aleksander kwasniewski -lrb- photo -rrb- too slammed the pipeline deal , saying it was being struck " over the heads of poland and the eu . "
in july , russian parliamentary deputies urged the government to increase the price of gas exports to countries that have moved outside moscow 's orbit .
the duma , russia 's lower chamber of the parliament , approved a non-binding document calling on prime minister mikhail fradkov to increase tariffs for new eu members estonia , latvia and lithuania , as well as georgia , molodova and ukraine , which are ruled by pro-western governments .
russia has the world 's largest natural gas reserves .
russo-german ties face change putin 's visit to berlin on thursday to meet with his friend schröder is also being watched closely in germany , given that the country is heading to the polls in a general election in a week .
vladislav belov , a specialist on germany at the russian academy of science , said putin realized this could well be the last time he would see schröder in office . " putin is supporting his friend gerhard even if he understands objectively that he will no longer be either chancellor or vice-chancellor . ...
all the signs are that the schröder era is at an end , " belov said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while thursday 's visit could see the close of the chapter of warm schröder-putin relations , opinion is divided on the future of russian-german ties should conservative leader angela merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- take the mantle of german leadership . merkel grew up in the former east germany and speaks russian , while putin speaks fluent german after serving with the kgb in leipzig during the cold war .
" economic links between russia and germany will not change under merkel because the two countries will be trying to fulfill their economic potential , " belov predicted . martin koopmann , an expert with the german society for foreign policy -lrb- dgap -rrb- , fears troubled times could be ahead .
merkel 's christian democrats will " keep a certain distance from a russia which places all its emphasis on power and less on western-style transparency , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin and schröder to seal gas deal vladimir putin will announce a major agreement to build a pipeline linking russia with western europe when he visits germany thursday , just ahead of the german general election .

the agreement for the north european gas pipeline was due to be signed in october .
but with an election called 12 months early and schröder 's social democrats trailing the opposition christian democrats in the polls , the meeting was brought forward .
vladislav belov , a specialist on germany at the russian academy of science , said putin realized this could well be the last time he would see schröder in office .
show of support " putin is supporting his friend gerhard even if he understands objectively that he will no longer be either chancellor or vice-chancellor . ...
all the signs are that the schröder era is at an end , " belov said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german-russian gas deal has circumvented the ukraine the pipeline will be built by state-owned russian energy giant gazprom , together with several german companies .
around 900 kilometers -lrb- 550 miles -rrb- long , it will stretch from near st. petersburg to the northeastern coast of germany .
significantly , it does not pass over ukraine , upsetting that country and poland , which receive considerable transit fees from gazprom for allowing its current pipelines to pass over their territory on their way to the lucrative western european market .
schröder has pushed for germany to lessen its dependence on oil and gas from the gulf and the united states , and 32 percent of germany 's natural gas is currently supplied by russia .
belov said the pipeline project would " increase the interdependence of the german and russian economies . "
speaking the same language while thursday 's visit could see the close of the chapter of warm schröder-putin relations , opinion is divided on the future of russian-german ties should conservative leader angela merkel take the mantle of german leadership .
merkel grew up in the former east germany and speaks russian , while putin speaks fluent german after serving with the kgb in leipzig during the cold war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel may strike a different tone with russia " economic links between russia and germany will not change under merkel because the two countries will be trying to fulfil their economic potential , " belov predicted .
martin koopmann , an expert with the german society for foreign policy -lrb- dgap -rrb- , fears troubled times could be ahead .
merkel 's christian democrats will " keep a certain distance from a russia which places all its emphasis on power and less on western-style transparency , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin and chirac back germany 's un bid russian president vladimir putin and french president jacques chirac have voiced support for germany 's faltering bid for a permanent seat on the united nations security council .

while the senate homeland security committee has already launched one inquiry , the democrats are demanding an independent probe into the government response to the gulf coast storm . harry reid , the democratic leader in the senate , has said any inquiry should look into whether the president 's long summer holiday at his texas ranch influenced the government response . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush is under fire for his handling of the disaster bush 's majority republicans only agreed on wednesday to a joint senate-house of representatives investigation to look into the actions of " all levels of government . "
bush , who has also promised to lead his own inquiry , would not say whether any aides would be fired over the slow response that he has admitted was unacceptable . he admitted that any inquiry will have to look at the links between federal and local authorities in handling such disasters - hinting that the federal authorities should take a stronger hand . politics at play both ray nagin , and the governor of louisiana , kathleen blanco , have accused washington of holding up the rescue . a survey conducted by the newspaper usa today said 25 percent of americans criticized local authorities and 18 percent the state of louisiana for the chaos .
but the president does n't escape .
forty-two percent of those asked said he had handled katrina " badly " or " very badly " .
thirty-five percent backed bush 's effort . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tiny patch of wreckage republicans have accused democrats of playing politics with their attacks and diverting attention from the rescue effort . democrats , meanwhile , also seized upon what they say are clumsy remarks by the republican speaker in the house , dennis hastert , who was forced to retract comments questioning whether rebuilding new orleans was worth the cost and by barbara bush , the president 's mother , that the " underprivileged " of louisiana were better off in their emergency shelter in the houston astrodome stadium , and that it was " working very well for them .

conceived as a rival to the british turner prize , the nationalgalerie prize for young art might pack the same kind of sensational punch we 've come to expect from the turner , but that ’ s where the similarities end . at the recent opening of the exhibition showcasing the artworks nominated for the nationalgalerie prize for young art at the hamburger bahnhof museum in berlin , curator joachim jäger compared monica bonvicini ’ s installation to an abu ghraib cell , while her fellow contestant john bock gave a performance that included getting pushed through a window by an angry " spectator " before leading the incredulous audience out of the gallery and jumping off a nearby bridge onto a waiting boat -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the four finalists for the prize set to be announced in late september are certainly not your standard museum fare .
bildunterschrift : john bock the emperor 's new clothes ?
in this respect , the nationalgalerie prize has taken an obvious cue from the 20-year-old turner - which , the critics have often argued , has a habit of favoring controversy over content .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : damian hirst 's shark floating in a tank of formaldehyde with a list of celebrity candidates ranging from damien hirst and his cows cut in half , tracey emin and her unmade bed to the cross-dressing grayson perry , the turner shortlist has more often than not boasted a generous dose of scandal that never failed to get the nation talking .
what tends to ruffle public feathers is less a matter of shocking content than a perceived lack of content .
it can be counted on to generate an annual media row , usually focused on that old chestnut : is it art ?
edgy but educational bildunterschrift : angela bulloch 's the disenchanted forest already dubbed " the german turner " and worth almost as much , the 50,000 euro -lrb- $ 62,000 -rrb- nationalgalerie prize for young art might be trying a similar tack in its stated aim of bringing art to a wider public , but with a short-list that includes bonvicini , bock , anri sala and angela bulloch -lrb- photo -rrb- , it 's giving a platform to four artists with established international reputations - even if they hardly deliver feel-good family fun .
" contemporary art attracts far less attention from the general public than 20th century modern art , for example , " said joachim jäger .
" it 's often edgy , provocative , and therefore not always instantly popular .
the competitive nature of the prize , as well as the ensuing publicity , is one way of raising awareness of contemporary art and arousing public curiosity . "
it 's also educational .
" it might be incomprehensible until you make an effort to get into it , " said peter raue from the friends of the nationalgalerie .
" but then it ’ s all very illuminating .
and ultimately , it should be a people ’ s prize . "
art as an event in any case , according to ursula prinz , deputy director at the german capital 's esteemed berlinische galerie , just about all contemporary art could be described as shocking .
" provocation is an integral part of today 's art , " she said .
" we live in an event culture , everything has to create a stir . "
many feel it 's a trend that raises the stakes for the average museum , and perhaps leaves the public bored by anything less than outrage .
" it does mean a lot of less spectacular work falls through the net , which is a little regrettable , " said prinz .
" less high-profile projects don ’ t get a look in .
art as an event is the order of the day , to the detriment of less flashy art . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but attention-grabbing art is n't all bad .
" events like this prize are one way of getting people into museums in the first place , " she admitted .
" in that sense , they definitely don ’ t hurt . "
conceptual rather than figurative old-school craft certainly is n't what the prize is about .
featuring performance , video and installation , the money is clearly on experimentation - another unmistakable nod to the turner , which has always been conceptual rather than figurative .
and if the prize attracts similar media frenzy , the entire german art world gets to benefit from the hype .
" everyone always wants to know who 's won the turner , " pointed out ursula prinz .
" so if one can achieve the same effect in germany , it would be a boon for everyone . "
individual , international but even though the turner has always triggered fierce opinions , much of the attention it attracts is unfavorable .
weird art is great in theory , but does n't it ultimately alienate the public ?
according to the german turner ’ s organizers , they have all their bases covered .
" shock tactics have the advantage of mass appeal , but also the disadvantage of reflecting a very one-sided facet to contemporary art , " said jäger .
" the nationalgalerie prize is aiming to be a crowd-puller , but it also takes a serious look at present-day art .
the jury 's selection represents four very different positions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anri sala it also represents different nationalities .
unlike the turner , which focuses on artists living and working in britain but often only shortlists british artists , the nationalgalerie prize has a very international slew of nominations .
in fact , german artists are conspicuously absent , as is traditional painting - so anyone expecting a sample of the fashionable new leipzig school , for example , will be sorely disappointed .
but it all goes to show just how open-minded the german art scene is .
" the prize turns the spotlight on international art developments in germany , rather than just german art , " pointed out jäger .

" we are operating in a very safe environment , but of course the tragic accidents we 've had have to give us a push to improve safety standards even further , " said commission spokesman stefaan de rynck . de rynck said the talks between member states were " important " in helping decide what criteria should be used in drawing up the blacklist , as well as what the consequences of being on a banned list should be . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trying to prevent more disasters like this one in greece " the european union needs common criteria to identify unsafe airlines .

" i believe sincerely that india will be a winner from greater openness , " european union trade commissioner peter mandelson told a gathering of business leaders at an india-eu summit . india 's minister for commerce and industry , kamal nath , however , told the business leaders that the european union is using non-tariff barriers to block imports from india such as shrimps and herbal remedies . " peter is badgering us that we are not giving them market access , " he said . india wants farm subsidies cut at an india-eu business summit attended by british prime minister tony blair , who holds the six-month eu presidency , and indian prime minister manmohan singh , the issue of farm subsidies was raised again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more access for european wine , please onkar kanwar , president of the federation of indian chambers of commerce and industry , said the 320 billion dollars the eu spends a year on farm subsidies should be cut so indian farmers can sell into the market . " you need exactly what we produce , " kanwar said . singh also raised the farm subsidy issue and that of non-tariff barriers preventing the sale of farm products from india , which he said was crucial to lifting millions out of poverty here . " i believe there is a perception in indian trade and industry circles that the european market is becoming increasingly difficult to penetrate .
as tariff barriers disintegrate , non-tariff barrier suddenly come up , " singh said . " india is one of the largest producers of agricultural commodities ... the famous basmati rice and the equally famous darjeeling tea ... but many of these are also products which find some form of discrimination and trade protection " in the eu . " blair did not discuss the issue .
in june , he angered some european leaders with calls for cuts in farm export subsidies , warning that failure to make progress would harm world trade talks in december . both want increased trade the eu is india 's largest trading partner and the destination for a quarter of indian exports .
however , mandelson noted that efforts by both sides should be to increase trade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite dispute , meetings are going very well , officials say " india is the eu 's 12th trading partner , a volume that stands at an impressive sounding 33 billion euros -lrb- $ 41.3 billion -rrb- , " mandelson said .
" impressive , that is , until you realize that the figure for korea is 48 billion -lrb- euros -rrb- , for russia 126 billion and for china 175 billion .
these frankly are sobering comparisons . " the eu-india summit is an annual event , but never before in its history has the european union sent such a high-ranking delegation to new delhi .
this time , blair , who holds the rotating presidency of the eu , was accompanied by european commission president jose barroso , as well as a host of commissioners and business leaders - a delegation befitting a nation that is widely regarded as one of the world 's up-and-coming economic powers . india rises in trading status the summit , which saw the signing of a so-called " action plan " setting out the way forward in political , trade and investment , economic , and cultural and academic relations , effectively put india on a par with other eu partners such as us , china and russia . " it is in my opinion long overdue , " said blair , referring to the joint action plan .
" it sets a framework for more action on a whole range of issues … such as science and technology . " indian prime minister manmohan singh was equally upbeat about the talks with european leaders . " we had extremely good and productive discussions , " the indian premier said .
" the most important outcome has been the adoption of a joint action plan … which provides the framework , a road map for identifying pathways for future cooperation . " airbus deal announced one key business deal has already been inked with india 's purchase of 43 planes from european aircraft maker airbus for 1.76 billion euros .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 08.09.2005 art provocateurs steal the show großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bonvicini 's sado-maso darkroom : shocking ?
conceived as a rival to the british turner prize , the nationalgalerie prize for young art might pack the same kind of sensational punch we 've come to expect from the turner , but that ’ s where the similarities end . at the recent opening of the exhibition showcasing the artworks nominated for the nationalgalerie prize for young art at the hamburger bahnhof museum in berlin , curator joachim jäger compared monica bonvicini ’ s installation to an abu ghraib cell , while her fellow contestant john bock gave a performance that included getting pushed through a window by an angry " spectator " before leading the incredulous audience out of the gallery and jumping off a nearby bridge onto a waiting boat -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the four finalists for the prize set to be announced in late september are certainly not your standard museum fare .
bildunterschrift : john bock the emperor 's new clothes ?
in this respect , the nationalgalerie prize has taken an obvious cue from the 20-year-old turner - which , the critics have often argued , has a habit of favoring controversy over content .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : damian hirst 's shark floating in a tank of formaldehyde with a list of celebrity candidates ranging from damien hirst and his cows cut in half , tracey emin and her unmade bed to the cross-dressing grayson perry , the turner shortlist has more often than not boasted a generous dose of scandal that never failed to get the nation talking .
what tends to ruffle public feathers is less a matter of shocking content than a perceived lack of content .
it can be counted on to generate an annual media row , usually focused on that old chestnut : is it art ?
edgy but educational bildunterschrift : angela bulloch 's the disenchanted forest already dubbed " the german turner " and worth almost as much , the 50,000 euro -lrb- $ 62,000 -rrb- nationalgalerie prize for young art might be trying a similar tack in its stated aim of bringing art to a wider public , but with a short-list that includes bonvicini , bock , anri sala and angela bulloch -lrb- photo -rrb- , it 's giving a platform to four artists with established international reputations - even if they hardly deliver feel-good family fun .
" contemporary art attracts far less attention from the general public than 20th century modern art , for example , " said joachim jäger .
" it 's often edgy , provocative , and therefore not always instantly popular .
the competitive nature of the prize , as well as the ensuing publicity , is one way of raising awareness of contemporary art and arousing public curiosity . "
it 's also educational .
" it might be incomprehensible until you make an effort to get into it , " said peter raue from the friends of the nationalgalerie .
" but then it ’ s all very illuminating .
and ultimately , it should be a people ’ s prize . "
art as an event in any case , according to ursula prinz , deputy director at the german capital 's esteemed berlinische galerie , just about all contemporary art could be described as shocking .
" provocation is an integral part of today 's art , " she said .
" we live in an event culture , everything has to create a stir . "
many feel it 's a trend that raises the stakes for the average museum , and perhaps leaves the public bored by anything less than outrage .
" it does mean a lot of less spectacular work falls through the net , which is a little regrettable , " said prinz .
" less high-profile projects don ’ t get a look in .
art as an event is the order of the day , to the detriment of less flashy art . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but attention-grabbing art is n't all bad .
" events like this prize are one way of getting people into museums in the first place , " she admitted .
" in that sense , they definitely don ’ t hurt . "
conceptual rather than figurative old-school craft certainly is n't what the prize is about .
featuring performance , video and installation , the money is clearly on experimentation - another unmistakable nod to the turner , which has always been conceptual rather than figurative .
and if the prize attracts similar media frenzy , the entire german art world gets to benefit from the hype .
" everyone always wants to know who 's won the turner , " pointed out ursula prinz .
" so if one can achieve the same effect in germany , it would be a boon for everyone . "
individual , international but even though the turner has always triggered fierce opinions , much of the attention it attracts is unfavorable .
weird art is great in theory , but does n't it ultimately alienate the public ?
according to the german turner ’ s organizers , they have all their bases covered .
" shock tactics have the advantage of mass appeal , but also the disadvantage of reflecting a very one-sided facet to contemporary art , " said jäger .
" the nationalgalerie prize is aiming to be a crowd-puller , but it also takes a serious look at present-day art .
the jury 's selection represents four very different positions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anri sala it also represents different nationalities .
unlike the turner , which focuses on artists living and working in britain but often only shortlists british artists , the nationalgalerie prize has a very international slew of nominations .
in fact , german artists are conspicuously absent , as is traditional painting - so anyone expecting a sample of the fashionable new leipzig school , for example , will be sorely disappointed .
but it all goes to show just how open-minded the german art scene is .
" the prize turns the spotlight on international art developments in germany , rather than just german art , " pointed out jäger .

germany defeated south africa 4-2 in wednesday 's friendly at the weserstadion in bremen and minus 35-year-old goalkeeper jens lehmann , the team had an average age of just under 23 .
" as otto rehhagel used to say there is no such thing as old and young players but good and bad ones , " explained klinsmann .
" if the young players are better they are going to play . "
klinsmann handed full debuts to 19-year-old duo patrick sinkiewitz and marcell jansen despite limited experience in the bundesliga .
the 1990 world cup victor felt the gamble was a success .
" marcell was calm and impressed with his surges forward , " declared klinsmann .
" patrick was also cool and is another alternative in central defense . "
inexperience not a concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borussia mönchengladbach defender jansen and fc cologne starlet sinkiewitz have played less than 30 bundesliga games between them but inexperience does not concern klinsmann .
" a young team is growing and it will get better and better , " he said .
" if we look back to august last year then almost all of our players have made progress .
it is great fun watching this team out there . "
with the 21-year-old bastian schweinsteiger , lukas podolski and per mertesacker , both 20 , also in the starting line-up it could almost have been an under-21 fixture .
although the youth stars have added vim to germany 's attack , the defense has been rather shaky .
mertesacker has caused a penalty in both of his last two matches with the national team .
but klinsmann has left seasoned internationals such as liverpool midfielder dietmar hamann and borussia dortmund defender christian worns on the sidelines and it is unclear what role , if any , they will play at the 2006 world cup .
poldi power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's lukas podolski celebrates after scoring the opening goal during the friendly soccer match between germany and south africa on wednesday , sept .
7 , 2005 .
germany has benefited greatly , however , from the new youth players up front .
fc cologne striker podolski woke up on thursday to find his picture plastered across the newspapers after scoring a hat-trick in germany 's 4-2 friendly win over south africa .
the 20-year-old podolski opened the scoring with a delightful chip on 12 minutes and then showed his killer instinct to score twice inside seven minutes to record a first international hat-trick .
" podolski phenomenom , " headlined kicker magazine .
" the cologne star scores three to compensate for shaky defense . "
klinsmann chose to start ' prince poldi ' on the substitutes ' bench for the recent 2-0 defeat by slovakia and the media claimed it would be folly to do that again .
" super poldi , " declared bild daily .
" klinsmann , never leave him out again . "
podolski , born in the polish city of gliwice , has now scored an impressive 10 goals in 17 internationals .
" it does not matter whether i am in the starting line-up or on the substitutes ' bench - i just want to score my goals , " explained podolski .
" the coach told me to go out there and get my goals and it worked .
the slovakia defeat was a setback but we are now back on track . "

germany defeated south africa 4-2 in wednesday 's friendly at the weserstadion in bremen and minus 35-year-old goalkeeper jens lehmann , the team had an average age of just under 23 .
" as otto rehhagel used to say there is no such thing as old and young players but good and bad ones , " explained klinsmann .
" if the young players are better they are going to play . "
klinsmann handed full debuts to 19-year-old duo patrick sinkiewitz and marcell jansen despite limited experience in the bundesliga .
the 1990 world cup victor felt the gamble was a success .
" marcell was calm and impressed with his surges forward , " declared klinsmann .
" patrick was also cool and is another alternative in central defense . "
inexperience not a concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borussia mönchengladbach defender jansen and fc cologne starlet sinkiewitz have played less than 30 bundesliga games between them but inexperience does not concern klinsmann .
" a young team is growing and it will get better and better , " he said .
" if we look back to august last year then almost all of our players have made progress .
it is great fun watching this team out there . "
with the 21-year-old bastian schweinsteiger , lukas podolski and per mertesacker , both 20 , also in the starting line-up it could almost have been an under-21 fixture .
although the youth stars have added vim to germany 's attack , the defense has been rather shaky .
mertesacker has caused a penalty in both of his last two matches with the national team .
but klinsmann has left seasoned internationals such as liverpool midfielder dietmar hamann and borussia dortmund defender christian worns on the sidelines and it is unclear what role , if any , they will play at the 2006 world cup .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.09.2005 critics slam russo-german deal on pipeline großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chummy german-russian relationship is ruffling feathers opposition is growing in eastern europe to a deal to build a gas pipeline under the baltic sea , which germany and russia are poised to sign thursday .
critics say it 's an attempt to change the political map of europe . russian president vladimir putin 's one-day visit to berlin thursday to meet with german chancellor gerhard schröder and hammer out a deal to build a pipeline linking russia with western europe has raised hackles in the continent 's east .
" the new russian-german alliance , which is today called an ' energy alliance , ' is a plan to change the political map of europe , " former lithuanian head of state and current eu parliamentarian vytautas landsbergis said in a statement .
by building the pipeline under the sea , by-passing the baltic states and poland , russia would be able to use " monopolistic gas prices " to " influence the policies of neighboring countries , " said landsbergis , who led lithuania when the baltic country became independent from the soviet union in 1990 .
baltic states wary the baltic states are particularly wary of pacts between germany and russia , because they were annexed by the soviet union after the signing of the molotov-ribbentrop pact between germany and the ussr in august 1939 .
they regained their independence only in the early 1990s , and joined the eu and nato last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin and germany 's gerhard schröder were present when the companies behind the project put their signatures to the controversial deal on thursday , paving the way for a gas pipeline to be built by russian state-owned energy giant gazprom and german companies e.on and basf .
the pipeline will stretch 1,200 kilometers -lrb- 750 miles -rrb- under the baltic sea , to link the russian city of vyborg , near st petersburg , to greifswald on the northeastern coast of germany . its underwater path means it will skirt the baltic states , as well as ukraine and poland , which currently receive transit fees from gazprom for allowing its pipelines to cross their territory on the way to the lucrative western european market .
the baltic states and poland wanted the pipeline to pass across their territory to ensure that russia will not apply an energy blockade against them or try to manipulate prices .
lithuanian economy minister kestutis dauksys said thursday the deal undermined the baltic state 's energy security .
" this agreement decreases our energy security , but lithuania could not influence this decision , " dauksys said in an interview to lithuanian public radio thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's kwasniewski on wednesday , polish president aleksander kwasniewski -lrb- photo -rrb- too slammed the pipeline deal , saying it was being struck " over the heads of poland and the eu . "
in july , russian parliamentary deputies urged the government to increase the price of gas exports to countries that have moved outside moscow 's orbit .
the duma , russia 's lower chamber of the parliament , approved a non-binding document calling on prime minister mikhail fradkov to increase tariffs for new eu members estonia , latvia and lithuania , as well as georgia , molodova and ukraine , which are ruled by pro-western governments .
russia has the world 's largest natural gas reserves .
russo-german ties face change putin 's visit to berlin on thursday to meet with his friend schröder is also being watched closely in germany , given that the country is heading to the polls in a general election in a week .
vladislav belov , a specialist on germany at the russian academy of science , said putin realized this could well be the last time he would see schröder in office . " putin is supporting his friend gerhard even if he understands objectively that he will no longer be either chancellor or vice-chancellor . ...
all the signs are that the schröder era is at an end , " belov said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while thursday 's visit could see the close of the chapter of warm schröder-putin relations , opinion is divided on the future of russian-german ties should conservative leader angela merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- take the mantle of german leadership . merkel grew up in the former east germany and speaks russian , while putin speaks fluent german after serving with the kgb in leipzig during the cold war .
" economic links between russia and germany will not change under merkel because the two countries will be trying to fulfill their economic potential , " belov predicted . martin koopmann , an expert with the german society for foreign policy -lrb- dgap -rrb- , fears troubled times could be ahead .
merkel 's christian democrats will " keep a certain distance from a russia which places all its emphasis on power and less on western-style transparency , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin and schröder to seal gas deal vladimir putin will announce a major agreement to build a pipeline linking russia with western europe when he visits germany thursday , just ahead of the german general election .

conceived as a rival to the british turner prize , the nationalgalerie prize for young art might pack the same kind of sensational punch we 've come to expect from the turner , but that ’ s where the similarities end . at the recent opening of the exhibition showcasing the artworks nominated for the nationalgalerie prize for young art at the hamburger bahnhof museum in berlin , curator joachim jäger compared monica bonvicini ’ s installation to an abu ghraib cell , while her fellow contestant john bock gave a performance that included getting pushed through a window by an angry " spectator " before leading the incredulous audience out of the gallery and jumping off a nearby bridge onto a waiting boat -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the four finalists for the prize set to be announced in late september are certainly not your standard museum fare .
bildunterschrift : john bock the emperor 's new clothes ?
in this respect , the nationalgalerie prize has taken an obvious cue from the 20-year-old turner - which , the critics have often argued , has a habit of favoring controversy over content .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : damian hirst 's shark floating in a tank of formaldehyde with a list of celebrity candidates ranging from damien hirst and his cows cut in half , tracey emin and her unmade bed to the cross-dressing grayson perry , the turner shortlist has more often than not boasted a generous dose of scandal that never failed to get the nation talking .
what tends to ruffle public feathers is less a matter of shocking content than a perceived lack of content .
it can be counted on to generate an annual media row , usually focused on that old chestnut : is it art ?
edgy but educational bildunterschrift : angela bulloch 's the disenchanted forest already dubbed " the german turner " and worth almost as much , the 50,000 euro -lrb- $ 62,000 -rrb- nationalgalerie prize for young art might be trying a similar tack in its stated aim of bringing art to a wider public , but with a short-list that includes bonvicini , bock , anri sala and angela bulloch -lrb- photo -rrb- , it 's giving a platform to four artists with established international reputations - even if they hardly deliver feel-good family fun .
" contemporary art attracts far less attention from the general public than 20th century modern art , for example , " said joachim jäger .
" it 's often edgy , provocative , and therefore not always instantly popular .
the competitive nature of the prize , as well as the ensuing publicity , is one way of raising awareness of contemporary art and arousing public curiosity . "
it 's also educational .
" it might be incomprehensible until you make an effort to get into it , " said peter raue from the friends of the nationalgalerie .
" but then it ’ s all very illuminating .
and ultimately , it should be a people ’ s prize . "
art as an event in any case , according to ursula prinz , deputy director at the german capital 's esteemed berlinische galerie , just about all contemporary art could be described as shocking .
" provocation is an integral part of today 's art , " she said .
" we live in an event culture , everything has to create a stir . "
many feel it 's a trend that raises the stakes for the average museum , and perhaps leaves the public bored by anything less than outrage .
" it does mean a lot of less spectacular work falls through the net , which is a little regrettable , " said prinz .
" less high-profile projects don ’ t get a look in .
art as an event is the order of the day , to the detriment of less flashy art . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but attention-grabbing art is n't all bad .
" events like this prize are one way of getting people into museums in the first place , " she admitted .
" in that sense , they definitely don ’ t hurt . "
conceptual rather than figurative old-school craft certainly is n't what the prize is about .
featuring performance , video and installation , the money is clearly on experimentation - another unmistakable nod to the turner , which has always been conceptual rather than figurative .
and if the prize attracts similar media frenzy , the entire german art world gets to benefit from the hype .
" everyone always wants to know who 's won the turner , " pointed out ursula prinz .
" so if one can achieve the same effect in germany , it would be a boon for everyone . "
individual , international but even though the turner has always triggered fierce opinions , much of the attention it attracts is unfavorable .
weird art is great in theory , but does n't it ultimately alienate the public ?
according to the german turner ’ s organizers , they have all their bases covered .
" shock tactics have the advantage of mass appeal , but also the disadvantage of reflecting a very one-sided facet to contemporary art , " said jäger .
" the nationalgalerie prize is aiming to be a crowd-puller , but it also takes a serious look at present-day art .
the jury 's selection represents four very different positions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anri sala it also represents different nationalities .
unlike the turner , which focuses on artists living and working in britain but often only shortlists british artists , the nationalgalerie prize has a very international slew of nominations .
in fact , german artists are conspicuously absent , as is traditional painting - so anyone expecting a sample of the fashionable new leipzig school , for example , will be sorely disappointed .
but it all goes to show just how open-minded the german art scene is .
" the prize turns the spotlight on international art developments in germany , rather than just german art , " pointed out jäger .

the oktoberfest catwalk can be all yours . what a summer it 's been in bavaria !
first , the sun-shy eu bureaucrats wanted to ban plunging necklines from beer gardens and deprive bavarian waitresses of their natural joie de vivre .
luckily , the european parliament voted against the sun-protection bill , and just as the bavarians wanted to breathe a sigh of relief , another calamity struck the proud state . two fashion designers decided to challenge the role of the lederhosen - traditional german leather pants - as the male fashion accessory a la mode at the munich oktoberfest .
they invented a skirt for beer-drinking guys . what is this world coming to ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old school frocks for guys munich designers doreen anders and robert landinger , both in their mid-thirties , are promoting skirts for male drinkers as a more comfortable alternative to the tight leather pants . " with all that beer flowing at the fest you need to make sure your belly is free to take it in , " landinger said . the duo has been designing skirts for men for four years .
in 2003 , their creations were featured in the exhibition " bravehearts - men in skirts " at the new york metropolitan museum of art .
and even though taking over the munich oktoberfest may prove to be more difficult than wiggling your way on the new york scene , the designers seem confident enough .
" i think they 're going to go down well , " landinger said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.09.2005 eu states break chinese clothes deadlock großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu gates are now open to chinese textiles eu member states have given the green light to a deal to release millions of cheap chinese clothes blocked at european ports as early as next week .
but the move still has n't allayed deeper worries on both sides . delegations from the 25 eu governments reached agreement here two days after eu trade commissioner peter mandelson had struck a trade deal to resolve an embarrassing standoff which has seriously strained ties with beijing .
" we would hope that if everything goes smoothly .. that by the middle of next week the goods that are currently blocked in customs can be unblocked , " said a spokesman for the european commission .
millions of chinese textiles , including pullovers , trousers , blouses , t-shirts , bras and tons of flax yarn , have been impounded at european ports because they exceed import quotas agreed by both sides in june .
bildunterschrift : boxes of blockaded goods from china are stacked in a warehouse at the port of antwerp in antwerp , belgium the political agreement , reached by ambassadors from eu member states on wednesday , opened the way for experts to work on a legal document that will allow the blocked clothes to be released by customs .
mandelson praised the move .
" i am very pleased that member states have approved the agreement with china and the commission 's proposal for unblocking textile imports from china , " he said in a statement from india , where he was taking part in an eu-india summit . " this solidarity now allows the commission to put in place the legal instrument which should allow the member states to begin unblocking goods next week , " he added .
dispute strains ties between eu , china as well as straining relations between the eu and china , the dispute had led to warnings that a shortage of the goods could cause prices to rise and hit european importers and retailers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the question of how to deal with the logjam divided eu members , roughly between southern european countries whose manufacturers fear the flood of cheap imports and northern countries where retailers want fresh stocks .
about five eu states , including italy , spain and portugal , have balked at allowing the products into the bloc .
under the deal negotiated in beijing between mandelson and chinese commerce minister bo xilai , the eu and china will share the quota burden caused by the stockpiles . about half of the estimated 80 million textile products being held up will enter the eu outside the fixed quotas , while the other half will be added to china 's 2006 textile limit .
lasting solutions needed industry officials have welcomed the eu-china deal - but at least one key official warned that the chaotic scenes of the last month or two could happen again unless the eu commission gets a grip on the problem .
" we are happy with the short term solution , " said foreign trade association -lrb- fta -rrb- head ferry den hoed . but he added : " in the end it still can be chaos next year ...
we have large quantities blocked in warehouses in china , and the chinese are not issuing export licenses any more , " he said .
chinese officials have also warned that the deal remains a short-term fix to a long-term problem and that more lasting solutions were needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese models parade in outfits which use themes from the forbidden city , on a stage in front of the former imperial palace in beijing some chinese textile manufacturers have already started worrying about their future exports , according to the state-run xinhua news agency . " the export quotas for the second half of the year have almost been used up and if we start using next year 's quotas , we will face greater pressure next year , " said zhu hongjun , a senior manager with peiluocheng group in zhejiang .
in spain , finance minister pedro solbes said he believed that the compromise deal did not deal with the crux of the problem . he said that it " does not take into account in a balanced way the whole of the problem " .

but the move still has n't allayed deeper worries on both sides . delegations from the 25 eu governments reached agreement here two days after eu trade commissioner peter mandelson had struck a trade deal to resolve an embarrassing standoff which has seriously strained ties with beijing .
" we would hope that if everything goes smoothly .. that by the middle of next week the goods that are currently blocked in customs can be unblocked , " said a spokesman for the european commission .
millions of chinese textiles , including pullovers , trousers , blouses , t-shirts , bras and tons of flax yarn , have been impounded at european ports because they exceed import quotas agreed by both sides in june .
bildunterschrift : boxes of blockaded goods from china are stacked in a warehouse at the port of antwerp in antwerp , belgium the political agreement , reached by ambassadors from eu member states on wednesday , opened the way for experts to work on a legal document that will allow the blocked clothes to be released by customs .
mandelson praised the move .
" i am very pleased that member states have approved the agreement with china and the commission 's proposal for unblocking textile imports from china , " he said in a statement from india , where he was taking part in an eu-india summit . " this solidarity now allows the commission to put in place the legal instrument which should allow the member states to begin unblocking goods next week , " he added .
dispute strains ties between eu , china as well as straining relations between the eu and china , the dispute had led to warnings that a shortage of the goods could cause prices to rise and hit european importers and retailers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the question of how to deal with the logjam divided eu members , roughly between southern european countries whose manufacturers fear the flood of cheap imports and northern countries where retailers want fresh stocks .
about five eu states , including italy , spain and portugal , have balked at allowing the products into the bloc .
under the deal negotiated in beijing between mandelson and chinese commerce minister bo xilai , the eu and china will share the quota burden caused by the stockpiles . about half of the estimated 80 million textile products being held up will enter the eu outside the fixed quotas , while the other half will be added to china 's 2006 textile limit .
lasting solutions needed industry officials have welcomed the eu-china deal - but at least one key official warned that the chaotic scenes of the last month or two could happen again unless the eu commission gets a grip on the problem .
" we are happy with the short term solution , " said foreign trade association -lrb- fta -rrb- head ferry den hoed . but he added : " in the end it still can be chaos next year ...
we have large quantities blocked in warehouses in china , and the chinese are not issuing export licenses any more , " he said .
chinese officials have also warned that the deal remains a short-term fix to a long-term problem and that more lasting solutions were needed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 08.09.2005 electronics fair ends on a high großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flat-screens were all the rage at the ifa the 45th international consumer electronics fair -lrb- ifa -rrb- in berlin has drawn to a close with experts predicting that the well-attended event would provide a much-needed boost to germany 's struggling electronics industry . even before the curtain fell on the six-day ifa spread out over the massive exhibition hall in western berlin on wednesday , organizers and industry representatives were in little doubt that in terms of figures and sales , the show had been a success .
" we even partly exceeded the high expectations preceding the fair .
we are very satisfied , " said roland stehle of the society for entertainment and communications electronics -lrb- gfu -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's electronics industry , which has been plagued by profit concerns and price falls in recent years , had pinned high hopes on the ifa which has improved continually every year in terms of attracting heavyweight exhibitors .
this year over 1,200 of them from 40 countries were vying for attention with their latest products .
more professionals , more orders according to stehle , even the specialized trade center at the fair was teeming with visitors this year , demand was high and buyers placed record number of orders .
" there were more industry professionals this year at the ifa than say two years ago , " said stehle who added that even the levels of know-how and expertise among them were significantly higher .
" the volume of orders was correspondingly higher - estimated at more than 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.1 billion -rrb- as compared to about 2.4 billion euros in 2003 , " said stehle .
though the estimates have not yet been officially confirmed and put down on paper , stehle said the industry was confident that the final figures on orders and visitors would make this year 's ifa stand out in the fair 's 81-year history .
innovation the key word one of the obvious trends at this year 's ifa was the presence of overwhelming plasma and lcd flat screens with the logo " hd-ready " in a reference to high-definition televisions -lrb- hdtv -rrb- , which are all the rage in the industry .
bildunterschrift : several german television stations announced at the ifa that they would broadcast their programs in the new standard starting this autumn .
the electronics industry is hoping that the new trend will provide a much-needed boost to the upcoming christmas retail sales and help sluggish consumer spending in the country .
" twenty-one percent of all households in germany want to buy a flat-screen television in the next 24 months , " said hans-joachim kamp , chairman of the consumer electronics trade association .
" i think this underpins the positive trend and the positive mood in the consumer electronics area . "

germany defeated south africa 4-2 in wednesday 's friendly at the weserstadion in bremen and minus 35-year-old goalkeeper jens lehmann , the team had an average age of just under 23 .
" as otto rehhagel used to say there is no such thing as old and young players but good and bad ones , " explained klinsmann .
" if the young players are better they are going to play . "
klinsmann handed full debuts to 19-year-old duo patrick sinkiewitz and marcell jansen despite limited experience in the bundesliga .
the 1990 world cup victor felt the gamble was a success .
" marcell was calm and impressed with his surges forward , " declared klinsmann .
" patrick was also cool and is another alternative in central defense . "
inexperience not a concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borussia mönchengladbach defender jansen and fc cologne starlet sinkiewitz have played less than 30 bundesliga games between them but inexperience does not concern klinsmann .
" a young team is growing and it will get better and better , " he said .
" if we look back to august last year then almost all of our players have made progress .
it is great fun watching this team out there . "
with the 21-year-old bastian schweinsteiger , lukas podolski and per mertesacker , both 20 , also in the starting line-up it could almost have been an under-21 fixture .
although the youth stars have added vim to germany 's attack , the defense has been rather shaky .
mertesacker has caused a penalty in both of his last two matches with the national team .
but klinsmann has left seasoned internationals such as liverpool midfielder dietmar hamann and borussia dortmund defender christian worns on the sidelines and it is unclear what role , if any , they will play at the 2006 world cup .
poldi power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's lukas podolski celebrates after scoring the opening goal during the friendly soccer match between germany and south africa on wednesday , sept .
7 , 2005 .
germany has benefited greatly , however , from the new youth players up front .
fc cologne striker podolski woke up on thursday to find his picture plastered across the newspapers after scoring a hat-trick in germany 's 4-2 friendly win over south africa .
the 20-year-old podolski opened the scoring with a delightful chip on 12 minutes and then showed his killer instinct to score twice inside seven minutes to record a first international hat-trick .
" podolski phenomenom , " headlined kicker magazine .
" the cologne star scores three to compensate for shaky defense . "
klinsmann chose to start ' prince poldi ' on the substitutes ' bench for the recent 2-0 defeat by slovakia and the media claimed it would be folly to do that again .
" super poldi , " declared bild daily .
" klinsmann , never leave him out again . "
podolski , born in the polish city of gliwice , has now scored an impressive 10 goals in 17 internationals .
" it does not matter whether i am in the starting line-up or on the substitutes ' bench - i just want to score my goals , " explained podolski .
" the coach told me to go out there and get my goals and it worked .
the slovakia defeat was a setback but we are now back on track . "
too much pressure ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sebastian deisler podolski made his bundesliga debut at the age of 18 in november 2003 and in the subsequent two years , he has gone from a talented teenager to the next golden boy of german football .
it seems the polish-born striker can do no wrong at the moment but bayern munich midfielder sebastian deisler - once heralded as the savior of german football - insists people must not put too much pressure on podolski .
" it is irresponsible to hype up young players such as lukas podolski , " deisler said .
" they get built up and then knocked down later on . "
klinsmann hailed podolski 's perfomance but admitted the younger players all needed the arm-around-the-shoulder treatment .
" some of the younger players do need protecting as they are new at this level , " said klinsmann .
" that is why i do not play them all the time as they need to be bedded in slowly .

schröder has pushed for germany to lessen its dependence on oil and gas from the gulf and the united states , and 32 percent of germany 's natural gas is currently supplied by russia .

the agreement for the north european gas pipeline was due to be signed in october .
but with an election called 12 months early and schröder 's social democrats trailing the opposition christian democrats in the polls , the meeting was brought forward .
vladislav belov , a specialist on germany at the russian academy of science , said putin realized this could well be the last time he would see schröder in office .
show of support " putin is supporting his friend gerhard even if he understands objectively that he will no longer be either chancellor or vice-chancellor . ...
all the signs are that the schröder era is at an end , " belov said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german-russian gas deal has circumvented the ukraine the pipeline will be built by state-owned russian energy giant gazprom , together with several german companies .
around 900 kilometers -lrb- 550 miles -rrb- long , it will stretch from near st. petersburg to the northeastern coast of germany .
significantly , it does not pass over ukraine , upsetting that country and poland , which receive considerable transit fees from gazprom for allowing its current pipelines to pass over their territory on their way to the lucrative western european market .
schröder has pushed for germany to lessen its dependence on oil and gas from the gulf and the united states , and 32 percent of germany 's natural gas is currently supplied by russia .
belov said the pipeline project would " increase the interdependence of the german and russian economies . "
speaking the same language while thursday 's visit could see the close of the chapter of warm schröder-putin relations , opinion is divided on the future of russian-german ties should conservative leader angela merkel take the mantle of german leadership .
merkel grew up in the former east germany and speaks russian , while putin speaks fluent german after serving with the kgb in leipzig during the cold war .

germany defeated south africa 4-2 in wednesday 's friendly at the weserstadion in bremen and minus 35-year-old goalkeeper jens lehmann , the team had an average age of just under 23 .
" as otto rehhagel used to say there is no such thing as old and young players but good and bad ones , " explained klinsmann .
" if the young players are better they are going to play . "
klinsmann handed full debuts to 19-year-old duo patrick sinkiewitz and marcell jansen despite limited experience in the bundesliga .
the 1990 world cup victor felt the gamble was a success .
" marcell was calm and impressed with his surges forward , " declared klinsmann .
" patrick was also cool and is another alternative in central defense . "
inexperience not a concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borussia mönchengladbach defender jansen and fc cologne starlet sinkiewitz have played less than 30 bundesliga games between them but inexperience does not concern klinsmann .

" if we look back to august last year then almost all of our players have made progress .
it is great fun watching this team out there . "
with the 21-year-old bastian schweinsteiger , lukas podolski and per mertesacker , both 20 , also in the starting line-up it could almost have been an under-21 fixture .
although the youth stars have added vim to germany 's attack , the defense has been rather shaky .
mertesacker has caused a penalty in both of his last two matches with the national team .
but klinsmann has left seasoned internationals such as liverpool midfielder dietmar hamann and borussia dortmund defender christian worns on the sidelines and it is unclear what role , if any , they will play at the 2006 world cup .

germany has benefited greatly , however , from the new youth players up front .
fc cologne striker podolski woke up on thursday to find his picture plastered across the newspapers after scoring a hat-trick in germany 's 4-2 friendly win over south africa .
the 20-year-old podolski opened the scoring with a delightful chip on 12 minutes and then showed his killer instinct to score twice inside seven minutes to record a first international hat-trick .
" podolski phenomenom , " headlined kicker magazine .
" the cologne star scores three to compensate for shaky defense . "
klinsmann chose to start ' prince poldi ' on the substitutes ' bench for the recent 2-0 defeat by slovakia and the media claimed it would be folly to do that again .
" super poldi , " declared bild daily .
" klinsmann , never leave him out again . "
podolski , born in the polish city of gliwice , has now scored an impressive 10 goals in 17 internationals .
" it does not matter whether i am in the starting line-up or on the substitutes ' bench - i just want to score my goals , " explained podolski .
" the coach told me to go out there and get my goals and it worked .
the slovakia defeat was a setback but we are now back on track . "

" it is irresponsible to hype up young players such as lukas podolski , " deisler said .
" they get built up and then knocked down later on . "
klinsmann hailed podolski 's perfomance but admitted the younger players all needed the arm-around-the-shoulder treatment .

germany defeated south africa 4-2 in wednesday 's friendly at the weserstadion in bremen and minus 35-year-old goalkeeper jens lehmann , the team had an average age of just under 23 .
" as otto rehhagel used to say there is no such thing as old and young players but good and bad ones , " explained klinsmann .
" if the young players are better they are going to play . "
klinsmann handed full debuts to 19-year-old duo patrick sinkiewitz and marcell jansen despite limited experience in the bundesliga .
the 1990 world cup victor felt the gamble was a success .
" marcell was calm and impressed with his surges forward , " declared klinsmann .
" patrick was also cool and is another alternative in central defense . "
inexperience not a concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borussia mönchengladbach defender jansen and fc cologne starlet sinkiewitz have played less than 30 bundesliga games between them but inexperience does not concern klinsmann .
" a young team is growing and it will get better and better , " he said .
" if we look back to august last year then almost all of our players have made progress .
it is great fun watching this team out there . "
with the 21-year-old bastian schweinsteiger , lukas podolski and per mertesacker , both 20 , also in the starting line-up it could almost have been an under-21 fixture .
although the youth stars have added vim to germany 's attack , the defense has been rather shaky .
mertesacker has caused a penalty in both of his last two matches with the national team .
but klinsmann has left seasoned internationals such as liverpool midfielder dietmar hamann and borussia dortmund defender christian worns on the sidelines and it is unclear what role , if any , they will play at the 2006 world cup .
poldi power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's lukas podolski celebrates after scoring the opening goal during the friendly soccer match between germany and south africa on wednesday , sept .
7 , 2005 .
germany has benefited greatly , however , from the new youth players up front .
fc cologne striker podolski woke up on thursday to find his picture plastered across the newspapers after scoring a hat-trick in germany 's 4-2 friendly win over south africa .
the 20-year-old podolski opened the scoring with a delightful chip on 12 minutes and then showed his killer instinct to score twice inside seven minutes to record a first international hat-trick .
" podolski phenomenom , " headlined kicker magazine .
" the cologne star scores three to compensate for shaky defense . "
klinsmann chose to start ' prince poldi ' on the substitutes ' bench for the recent 2-0 defeat by slovakia and the media claimed it would be folly to do that again .
" super poldi , " declared bild daily .
" klinsmann , never leave him out again . "
podolski , born in the polish city of gliwice , has now scored an impressive 10 goals in 17 internationals .
" it does not matter whether i am in the starting line-up or on the substitutes ' bench - i just want to score my goals , " explained podolski .
" the coach told me to go out there and get my goals and it worked .
the slovakia defeat was a setback but we are now back on track . "
too much pressure ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sebastian deisler podolski made his bundesliga debut at the age of 18 in november 2003 and in the subsequent two years , he has gone from a talented teenager to the next golden boy of german football .
it seems the polish-born striker can do no wrong at the moment but bayern munich midfielder sebastian deisler - once heralded as the savior of german football - insists people must not put too much pressure on podolski .
" it is irresponsible to hype up young players such as lukas podolski , " deisler said .
" they get built up and then knocked down later on . "
klinsmann hailed podolski 's perfomance but admitted the younger players all needed the arm-around-the-shoulder treatment .
" some of the younger players do need protecting as they are new at this level , " said klinsmann .
" that is why i do not play them all the time as they need to be bedded in slowly .

critics say it 's an attempt to change the political map of europe . russian president vladimir putin 's one-day visit to berlin thursday to meet with german chancellor gerhard schröder and hammer out a deal to build a pipeline linking russia with western europe has raised hackles in the continent 's east .
" the new russian-german alliance , which is today called an ' energy alliance , ' is a plan to change the political map of europe , " former lithuanian head of state and current eu parliamentarian vytautas landsbergis said in a statement .
by building the pipeline under the sea , by-passing the baltic states and poland , russia would be able to use " monopolistic gas prices " to " influence the policies of neighboring countries , " said landsbergis , who led lithuania when the baltic country became independent from the soviet union in 1990 .
baltic states wary the baltic states are particularly wary of pacts between germany and russia , because they were annexed by the soviet union after the signing of the molotov-ribbentrop pact between germany and the ussr in august 1939 .
they regained their independence only in the early 1990s , and joined the eu and nato last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin and germany 's gerhard schröder were present when the companies behind the project put their signatures to the controversial deal on thursday , paving the way for a gas pipeline to be built by russian state-owned energy giant gazprom and german companies e.on and basf .
the pipeline will stretch 1,200 kilometers -lrb- 750 miles -rrb- under the baltic sea , to link the russian city of vyborg , near st petersburg , to greifswald on the northeastern coast of germany . its underwater path means it will skirt the baltic states , as well as ukraine and poland , which currently receive transit fees from gazprom for allowing its pipelines to cross their territory on the way to the lucrative western european market .
the baltic states and poland wanted the pipeline to pass across their territory to ensure that russia will not apply an energy blockade against them or try to manipulate prices .
lithuanian economy minister kestutis dauksys said thursday the deal undermined the baltic state 's energy security .
" this agreement decreases our energy security , but lithuania could not influence this decision , " dauksys said in an interview to lithuanian public radio thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's kwasniewski on wednesday , polish president aleksander kwasniewski -lrb- photo -rrb- too slammed the pipeline deal , saying it was being struck " over the heads of poland and the eu . "
in july , russian parliamentary deputies urged the government to increase the price of gas exports to countries that have moved outside moscow 's orbit .
the duma , russia 's lower chamber of the parliament , approved a non-binding document calling on prime minister mikhail fradkov to increase tariffs for new eu members estonia , latvia and lithuania , as well as georgia , molodova and ukraine , which are ruled by pro-western governments .
russia has the world 's largest natural gas reserves .
russo-german ties face change putin 's visit to berlin on thursday to meet with his friend schröder is also being watched closely in germany , given that the country is heading to the polls in a general election in a week .
vladislav belov , a specialist on germany at the russian academy of science , said putin realized this could well be the last time he would see schröder in office . " putin is supporting his friend gerhard even if he understands objectively that he will no longer be either chancellor or vice-chancellor . ...
all the signs are that the schröder era is at an end , " belov said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while thursday 's visit could see the close of the chapter of warm schröder-putin relations , opinion is divided on the future of russian-german ties should conservative leader angela merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- take the mantle of german leadership . merkel grew up in the former east germany and speaks russian , while putin speaks fluent german after serving with the kgb in leipzig during the cold war .

the agreement for the north european gas pipeline was due to be signed in october .
but with an election called 12 months early and schröder 's social democrats trailing the opposition christian democrats in the polls , the meeting was brought forward .

significantly , it does not pass over ukraine , upsetting that country and poland , which receive considerable transit fees from gazprom for allowing its current pipelines to pass over their territory on their way to the lucrative western european market .
schröder has pushed for germany to lessen its dependence on oil and gas from the gulf and the united states , and 32 percent of germany 's natural gas is currently supplied by russia .
belov said the pipeline project would " increase the interdependence of the german and russian economies . "

munich-based lawyers rotter rechtsanwälte said in a statement that they had filed a suit with a court in stuttgart alleging that the german-us auto giant failed to inform their client promptly about the decision by chief executive juergen schrempp to step down early .
after schrempp announced he was quitting , daimlerchrysler shares soared by more than 10 percent on the stock exchange , boosting the company 's market value by more than three billion euros -lrb- $ 3.7 billion -rrb- .
" according to our information , schrempp 's resignation was a done-deal at least five weeks before it was made public , " the lawyers argued .
" but this insider information was not published until july 28 .
those shareholders who sold their shares before then could have got a much higher price for their shares if daimlerchrysler had made the information public as soon as it was known , " they said .
in this concrete case , the lawyers ' client had sold his shares in daimlerchrysler just 90 minutes before schrempp 's decision to resign was made public , meaning he pocketed just 36.50 euros from the transaction , rotter rechtsanwälte said . dw-world.de daimler investigated for insider trading german regulators are launching an investigation regarding possible insider dealings of daimlerchrysler 's shares .

luckily , the european parliament voted against the sun-protection bill , and just as the bavarians wanted to breathe a sigh of relief , another calamity struck the proud state . two fashion designers decided to challenge the role of the lederhosen - traditional german leather pants - as the male fashion accessory a la mode at the munich oktoberfest .
they invented a skirt for beer-drinking guys . what is this world coming to ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old school frocks for guys munich designers doreen anders and robert landinger , both in their mid-thirties , are promoting skirts for male drinkers as a more comfortable alternative to the tight leather pants .

in 2003 , their creations were featured in the exhibition " bravehearts - men in skirts " at the new york metropolitan museum of art .
and even though taking over the munich oktoberfest may prove to be more difficult than wiggling your way on the new york scene , the designers seem confident enough .

" we are operating in a very safe environment , but of course the tragic accidents we 've had have to give us a push to improve safety standards even further , " said commission spokesman stefaan de rynck . de rynck said the talks between member states were " important " in helping decide what criteria should be used in drawing up the blacklist , as well as what the consequences of being on a banned list should be . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trying to prevent more disasters like this one in greece " the european union needs common criteria to identify unsafe airlines .
such airlines would be put on a european black list and be subject to an eu-wide ban to fly , " said a commission statement . the european parliament will take up the issue in november , and a meeting of european transportation ministers will be organized after that . " the commission hopes for a political agreement on the common criteria , the eu black list , and the eu-wide ban by the end of the year , " it added . incoherent rules the eu commission said the " incoherence " of current air safety regulations was highlighted in may when a turkish airline , suspended by four european countries , simply redirected its flights to belgium which had not imposed a similar ban . " this is astonishing , and a little bit absurd , " said the spokesman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu officials want all member states to follow the same rules the european union blacklist idea is similar to a mechanism already operational in the united states , where would-be passengers can consult a website publishing the names of airlines with relatively poor safety records .
similar backlists exist in france , britain and sweden . experts from 35 european countries called last month for the definition of common criteria to establish lists of airline companies to be blacklisted on safety grounds . " it is essential to define common criteria , " said michel wachenheim , head of the french civil aviation authority -lrb- dgac -rrb- , at a meeting of the european civil aviation conference -lrb- ecac -rrb- . cypriot airlines deny pilot language problems the eu talks in brussels came as the low-cost airline involved in a mysterious crash in greece last month denied a report that below-par language skills and the inexperience of a pilot contributed to the accident . cyprus ' helios airways said it was confident that the pilots of the doomed flight , which crashed on august 14 killing all 121 on board , were able to understand each other in english on the flight to prague via athens .

" i believe sincerely that india will be a winner from greater openness , " european union trade commissioner peter mandelson told a gathering of business leaders at an india-eu summit . india 's minister for commerce and industry , kamal nath , however , told the business leaders that the european union is using non-tariff barriers to block imports from india such as shrimps and herbal remedies . " peter is badgering us that we are not giving them market access , " he said . india wants farm subsidies cut at an india-eu business summit attended by british prime minister tony blair , who holds the six-month eu presidency , and indian prime minister manmohan singh , the issue of farm subsidies was raised again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more access for european wine , please onkar kanwar , president of the federation of indian chambers of commerce and industry , said the 320 billion dollars the eu spends a year on farm subsidies should be cut so indian farmers can sell into the market . " you need exactly what we produce , " kanwar said . singh also raised the farm subsidy issue and that of non-tariff barriers preventing the sale of farm products from india , which he said was crucial to lifting millions out of poverty here . " i believe there is a perception in indian trade and industry circles that the european market is becoming increasingly difficult to penetrate .
as tariff barriers disintegrate , non-tariff barrier suddenly come up , " singh said . " india is one of the largest producers of agricultural commodities ... the famous basmati rice and the equally famous darjeeling tea ... but many of these are also products which find some form of discrimination and trade protection " in the eu . " blair did not discuss the issue .
in june , he angered some european leaders with calls for cuts in farm export subsidies , warning that failure to make progress would harm world trade talks in december . both want increased trade the eu is india 's largest trading partner and the destination for a quarter of indian exports .
however , mandelson noted that efforts by both sides should be to increase trade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite dispute , meetings are going very well , officials say " india is the eu 's 12th trading partner , a volume that stands at an impressive sounding 33 billion euros -lrb- $ 41.3 billion -rrb- , " mandelson said .
" impressive , that is , until you realize that the figure for korea is 48 billion -lrb- euros -rrb- , for russia 126 billion and for china 175 billion .
these frankly are sobering comparisons . " the eu-india summit is an annual event , but never before in its history has the european union sent such a high-ranking delegation to new delhi .
this time , blair , who holds the rotating presidency of the eu , was accompanied by european commission president jose barroso , as well as a host of commissioners and business leaders - a delegation befitting a nation that is widely regarded as one of the world 's up-and-coming economic powers . india rises in trading status the summit , which saw the signing of a so-called " action plan " setting out the way forward in political , trade and investment , economic , and cultural and academic relations , effectively put india on a par with other eu partners such as us , china and russia . " it is in my opinion long overdue , " said blair , referring to the joint action plan .
" it sets a framework for more action on a whole range of issues … such as science and technology . " indian prime minister manmohan singh was equally upbeat about the talks with european leaders . " we had extremely good and productive discussions , " the indian premier said .
" the most important outcome has been the adoption of a joint action plan … which provides the framework , a road map for identifying pathways for future cooperation . " airbus deal announced one key business deal has already been inked with india 's purchase of 43 planes from european aircraft maker airbus for 1.76 billion euros .
the aircraft would boost the fleet of state-run indian airlines , which mainly flies domestic routes but also heads to some regional , middle eastern and southeast asian destinations . the indian airlines board had agreed on the acquisition of 20 airbus a-319s , 19 a-321s and four a-320s more than two years ago but a final decision had been delayed by required clearances from several layers of the government because of the order 's size . a ministerial panel led by finance minister p. chidambaram held final price negotiations on tuesday with airbus for the purchase of the 43 planes . " we all know that the airbus has been highly successful aircraft around the world , " blair said , adding the purchase was a welcome sign of growing trade relations between the european union and india . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu and india get down to business a delegation of eu heavyweights led by british prime minister tony blair met with indian leaders in new delhi on wednesday for talks aimed at strengthening trade and political ties with the emerging economic power . -lrb- sept .

conceived as a rival to the british turner prize , the nationalgalerie prize for young art might pack the same kind of sensational punch we 've come to expect from the turner , but that ’ s where the similarities end . at the recent opening of the exhibition showcasing the artworks nominated for the nationalgalerie prize for young art at the hamburger bahnhof museum in berlin , curator joachim jäger compared monica bonvicini ’ s installation to an abu ghraib cell , while her fellow contestant john bock gave a performance that included getting pushed through a window by an angry " spectator " before leading the incredulous audience out of the gallery and jumping off a nearby bridge onto a waiting boat -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the four finalists for the prize set to be announced in late september are certainly not your standard museum fare .
bildunterschrift : john bock the emperor 's new clothes ?
in this respect , the nationalgalerie prize has taken an obvious cue from the 20-year-old turner - which , the critics have often argued , has a habit of favoring controversy over content .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : damian hirst 's shark floating in a tank of formaldehyde with a list of celebrity candidates ranging from damien hirst and his cows cut in half , tracey emin and her unmade bed to the cross-dressing grayson perry , the turner shortlist has more often than not boasted a generous dose of scandal that never failed to get the nation talking .
what tends to ruffle public feathers is less a matter of shocking content than a perceived lack of content .
it can be counted on to generate an annual media row , usually focused on that old chestnut : is it art ?
edgy but educational bildunterschrift : angela bulloch 's the disenchanted forest already dubbed " the german turner " and worth almost as much , the 50,000 euro -lrb- $ 62,000 -rrb- nationalgalerie prize for young art might be trying a similar tack in its stated aim of bringing art to a wider public , but with a short-list that includes bonvicini , bock , anri sala and angela bulloch -lrb- photo -rrb- , it 's giving a platform to four artists with established international reputations - even if they hardly deliver feel-good family fun .
" contemporary art attracts far less attention from the general public than 20th century modern art , for example , " said joachim jäger .
" it 's often edgy , provocative , and therefore not always instantly popular .
the competitive nature of the prize , as well as the ensuing publicity , is one way of raising awareness of contemporary art and arousing public curiosity . "
it 's also educational .
" it might be incomprehensible until you make an effort to get into it , " said peter raue from the friends of the nationalgalerie .
" but then it ’ s all very illuminating .
and ultimately , it should be a people ’ s prize . "
art as an event in any case , according to ursula prinz , deputy director at the german capital 's esteemed berlinische galerie , just about all contemporary art could be described as shocking .
" provocation is an integral part of today 's art , " she said .
" we live in an event culture , everything has to create a stir . "
many feel it 's a trend that raises the stakes for the average museum , and perhaps leaves the public bored by anything less than outrage .
" it does mean a lot of less spectacular work falls through the net , which is a little regrettable , " said prinz .
" less high-profile projects don ’ t get a look in .
art as an event is the order of the day , to the detriment of less flashy art . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but attention-grabbing art is n't all bad .
" events like this prize are one way of getting people into museums in the first place , " she admitted .
" in that sense , they definitely don ’ t hurt . "
conceptual rather than figurative old-school craft certainly is n't what the prize is about .
featuring performance , video and installation , the money is clearly on experimentation - another unmistakable nod to the turner , which has always been conceptual rather than figurative .
and if the prize attracts similar media frenzy , the entire german art world gets to benefit from the hype .
" everyone always wants to know who 's won the turner , " pointed out ursula prinz .
" so if one can achieve the same effect in germany , it would be a boon for everyone . "
individual , international but even though the turner has always triggered fierce opinions , much of the attention it attracts is unfavorable .
weird art is great in theory , but does n't it ultimately alienate the public ?
according to the german turner ’ s organizers , they have all their bases covered .
" shock tactics have the advantage of mass appeal , but also the disadvantage of reflecting a very one-sided facet to contemporary art , " said jäger .
" the nationalgalerie prize is aiming to be a crowd-puller , but it also takes a serious look at present-day art .
the jury 's selection represents four very different positions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anri sala it also represents different nationalities .
unlike the turner , which focuses on artists living and working in britain but often only shortlists british artists , the nationalgalerie prize has a very international slew of nominations .
in fact , german artists are conspicuously absent , as is traditional painting - so anyone expecting a sample of the fashionable new leipzig school , for example , will be sorely disappointed .
but it all goes to show just how open-minded the german art scene is .
" the prize turns the spotlight on international art developments in germany , rather than just german art , " pointed out jäger .

conceived as a rival to the british turner prize , the nationalgalerie prize for young art might pack the same kind of sensational punch we 've come to expect from the turner , but that ’ s where the similarities end . at the recent opening of the exhibition showcasing the artworks nominated for the nationalgalerie prize for young art at the hamburger bahnhof museum in berlin , curator joachim jäger compared monica bonvicini ’ s installation to an abu ghraib cell , while her fellow contestant john bock gave a performance that included getting pushed through a window by an angry " spectator " before leading the incredulous audience out of the gallery and jumping off a nearby bridge onto a waiting boat -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the four finalists for the prize set to be announced in late september are certainly not your standard museum fare .
bildunterschrift : john bock the emperor 's new clothes ?
in this respect , the nationalgalerie prize has taken an obvious cue from the 20-year-old turner - which , the critics have often argued , has a habit of favoring controversy over content .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : damian hirst 's shark floating in a tank of formaldehyde with a list of celebrity candidates ranging from damien hirst and his cows cut in half , tracey emin and her unmade bed to the cross-dressing grayson perry , the turner shortlist has more often than not boasted a generous dose of scandal that never failed to get the nation talking .
what tends to ruffle public feathers is less a matter of shocking content than a perceived lack of content .
it can be counted on to generate an annual media row , usually focused on that old chestnut : is it art ?
edgy but educational bildunterschrift : angela bulloch 's the disenchanted forest already dubbed " the german turner " and worth almost as much , the 50,000 euro -lrb- $ 62,000 -rrb- nationalgalerie prize for young art might be trying a similar tack in its stated aim of bringing art to a wider public , but with a short-list that includes bonvicini , bock , anri sala and angela bulloch -lrb- photo -rrb- , it 's giving a platform to four artists with established international reputations - even if they hardly deliver feel-good family fun .
" contemporary art attracts far less attention from the general public than 20th century modern art , for example , " said joachim jäger .
" it 's often edgy , provocative , and therefore not always instantly popular .
the competitive nature of the prize , as well as the ensuing publicity , is one way of raising awareness of contemporary art and arousing public curiosity . "
it 's also educational .
" it might be incomprehensible until you make an effort to get into it , " said peter raue from the friends of the nationalgalerie .
" but then it ’ s all very illuminating .
and ultimately , it should be a people ’ s prize . "
art as an event in any case , according to ursula prinz , deputy director at the german capital 's esteemed berlinische galerie , just about all contemporary art could be described as shocking .
" provocation is an integral part of today 's art , " she said .
" we live in an event culture , everything has to create a stir . "
many feel it 's a trend that raises the stakes for the average museum , and perhaps leaves the public bored by anything less than outrage .
" it does mean a lot of less spectacular work falls through the net , which is a little regrettable , " said prinz .
" less high-profile projects don ’ t get a look in .
art as an event is the order of the day , to the detriment of less flashy art . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but attention-grabbing art is n't all bad .
" events like this prize are one way of getting people into museums in the first place , " she admitted .
" in that sense , they definitely don ’ t hurt . "
conceptual rather than figurative old-school craft certainly is n't what the prize is about .
featuring performance , video and installation , the money is clearly on experimentation - another unmistakable nod to the turner , which has always been conceptual rather than figurative .
and if the prize attracts similar media frenzy , the entire german art world gets to benefit from the hype .
" everyone always wants to know who 's won the turner , " pointed out ursula prinz .
" so if one can achieve the same effect in germany , it would be a boon for everyone . "
individual , international but even though the turner has always triggered fierce opinions , much of the attention it attracts is unfavorable .
weird art is great in theory , but does n't it ultimately alienate the public ?
according to the german turner ’ s organizers , they have all their bases covered .
" shock tactics have the advantage of mass appeal , but also the disadvantage of reflecting a very one-sided facet to contemporary art , " said jäger .
" the nationalgalerie prize is aiming to be a crowd-puller , but it also takes a serious look at present-day art .
the jury 's selection represents four very different positions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anri sala it also represents different nationalities .
unlike the turner , which focuses on artists living and working in britain but often only shortlists british artists , the nationalgalerie prize has a very international slew of nominations .
in fact , german artists are conspicuously absent , as is traditional painting - so anyone expecting a sample of the fashionable new leipzig school , for example , will be sorely disappointed .
but it all goes to show just how open-minded the german art scene is .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 08.09.2005 -pipe- 13:00 utc daimler faces lawsuit over schrempp the first lawsuit has been filed against daimlerchrysler by an investor who claims he was short-changed over the automaker 's announcement that its chairman is stepping down at the end of the year , the plaintiff 's lawyers said on thursday .
munich-based lawyers rotter rechtsanwälte said in a statement that they had filed a suit with a court in stuttgart alleging that the german-us auto giant failed to inform their client promptly about the decision by chief executive juergen schrempp to step down early .
after schrempp announced he was quitting , daimlerchrysler shares soared by more than 10 percent on the stock exchange , boosting the company 's market value by more than three billion euros -lrb- $ 3.7 billion -rrb- .
" according to our information , schrempp 's resignation was a done-deal at least five weeks before it was made public , " the lawyers argued .
" but this insider information was not published until july 28 .
those shareholders who sold their shares before then could have got a much higher price for their shares if daimlerchrysler had made the information public as soon as it was known , " they said .
in this concrete case , the lawyers ' client had sold his shares in daimlerchrysler just 90 minutes before schrempp 's decision to resign was made public , meaning he pocketed just 36.50 euros from the transaction , rotter rechtsanwälte said . dw-world.de daimler investigated for insider trading german regulators are launching an investigation regarding possible insider dealings of daimlerchrysler 's shares .

munich-based lawyers rotter rechtsanwälte said in a statement that they had filed a suit with a court in stuttgart alleging that the german-us auto giant failed to inform their client promptly about the decision by chief executive juergen schrempp to step down early .
after schrempp announced he was quitting , daimlerchrysler shares soared by more than 10 percent on the stock exchange , boosting the company 's market value by more than three billion euros -lrb- $ 3.7 billion -rrb- .
" according to our information , schrempp 's resignation was a done-deal at least five weeks before it was made public , " the lawyers argued .
" but this insider information was not published until july 28 .
those shareholders who sold their shares before then could have got a much higher price for their shares if daimlerchrysler had made the information public as soon as it was known , " they said .
in this concrete case , the lawyers ' client had sold his shares in daimlerchrysler just 90 minutes before schrempp 's decision to resign was made public , meaning he pocketed just 36.50 euros from the transaction , rotter rechtsanwälte said . dw-world.de daimler investigated for insider trading german regulators are launching an investigation regarding possible insider dealings of daimlerchrysler 's shares .

the agreement for the north european gas pipeline was due to be signed in october .
but with an election called 12 months early and schröder 's social democrats trailing the opposition christian democrats in the polls , the meeting was brought forward .
vladislav belov , a specialist on germany at the russian academy of science , said putin realized this could well be the last time he would see schröder in office .
show of support " putin is supporting his friend gerhard even if he understands objectively that he will no longer be either chancellor or vice-chancellor . ...
all the signs are that the schröder era is at an end , " belov said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german-russian gas deal has circumvented the ukraine the pipeline will be built by state-owned russian energy giant gazprom , together with several german companies .
around 900 kilometers -lrb- 550 miles -rrb- long , it will stretch from near st. petersburg to the northeastern coast of germany .
significantly , it does not pass over ukraine , upsetting that country and poland , which receive considerable transit fees from gazprom for allowing its current pipelines to pass over their territory on their way to the lucrative western european market .
schröder has pushed for germany to lessen its dependence on oil and gas from the gulf and the united states , and 32 percent of germany 's natural gas is currently supplied by russia .
belov said the pipeline project would " increase the interdependence of the german and russian economies . "
speaking the same language while thursday 's visit could see the close of the chapter of warm schröder-putin relations , opinion is divided on the future of russian-german ties should conservative leader angela merkel take the mantle of german leadership .
merkel grew up in the former east germany and speaks russian , while putin speaks fluent german after serving with the kgb in leipzig during the cold war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel may strike a different tone with russia " economic links between russia and germany will not change under merkel because the two countries will be trying to fulfil their economic potential , " belov predicted .

munich-based lawyers rotter rechtsanwälte said in a statement that they had filed a suit with a court in stuttgart alleging that the german-us auto giant failed to inform their client promptly about the decision by chief executive juergen schrempp to step down early .
after schrempp announced he was quitting , daimlerchrysler shares soared by more than 10 percent on the stock exchange , boosting the company 's market value by more than three billion euros -lrb- $ 3.7 billion -rrb- .
" according to our information , schrempp 's resignation was a done-deal at least five weeks before it was made public , " the lawyers argued .
" but this insider information was not published until july 28 .
those shareholders who sold their shares before then could have got a much higher price for their shares if daimlerchrysler had made the information public as soon as it was known , " they said .
in this concrete case , the lawyers ' client had sold his shares in daimlerchrysler just 90 minutes before schrempp 's decision to resign was made public , meaning he pocketed just 36.50 euros from the transaction , rotter rechtsanwälte said . dw-world.de daimler investigated for insider trading german regulators are launching an investigation regarding possible insider dealings of daimlerchrysler 's shares .

critics say it 's an attempt to change the political map of europe . russian president vladimir putin 's one-day visit to berlin thursday to meet with german chancellor gerhard schröder and hammer out a deal to build a pipeline linking russia with western europe has raised hackles in the continent 's east .
" the new russian-german alliance , which is today called an ' energy alliance , ' is a plan to change the political map of europe , " former lithuanian head of state and current eu parliamentarian vytautas landsbergis said in a statement .
by building the pipeline under the sea , by-passing the baltic states and poland , russia would be able to use " monopolistic gas prices " to " influence the policies of neighboring countries , " said landsbergis , who led lithuania when the baltic country became independent from the soviet union in 1990 .
baltic states wary the baltic states are particularly wary of pacts between germany and russia , because they were annexed by the soviet union after the signing of the molotov-ribbentrop pact between germany and the ussr in august 1939 .
they regained their independence only in the early 1990s , and joined the eu and nato last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin and germany 's gerhard schröder were present when the companies behind the project put their signatures to the controversial deal on thursday , paving the way for a gas pipeline to be built by russian state-owned energy giant gazprom and german companies e.on and basf .
the pipeline will stretch 1,200 kilometers -lrb- 750 miles -rrb- under the baltic sea , to link the russian city of vyborg , near st petersburg , to greifswald on the northeastern coast of germany . its underwater path means it will skirt the baltic states , as well as ukraine and poland , which currently receive transit fees from gazprom for allowing its pipelines to cross their territory on the way to the lucrative western european market .
the baltic states and poland wanted the pipeline to pass across their territory to ensure that russia will not apply an energy blockade against them or try to manipulate prices .
lithuanian economy minister kestutis dauksys said thursday the deal undermined the baltic state 's energy security .
" this agreement decreases our energy security , but lithuania could not influence this decision , " dauksys said in an interview to lithuanian public radio thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's kwasniewski on wednesday , polish president aleksander kwasniewski -lrb- photo -rrb- too slammed the pipeline deal , saying it was being struck " over the heads of poland and the eu . "
in july , russian parliamentary deputies urged the government to increase the price of gas exports to countries that have moved outside moscow 's orbit .
the duma , russia 's lower chamber of the parliament , approved a non-binding document calling on prime minister mikhail fradkov to increase tariffs for new eu members estonia , latvia and lithuania , as well as georgia , molodova and ukraine , which are ruled by pro-western governments .
russia has the world 's largest natural gas reserves .
russo-german ties face change putin 's visit to berlin on thursday to meet with his friend schröder is also being watched closely in germany , given that the country is heading to the polls in a general election in a week .
vladislav belov , a specialist on germany at the russian academy of science , said putin realized this could well be the last time he would see schröder in office . " putin is supporting his friend gerhard even if he understands objectively that he will no longer be either chancellor or vice-chancellor . ...
all the signs are that the schröder era is at an end , " belov said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while thursday 's visit could see the close of the chapter of warm schröder-putin relations , opinion is divided on the future of russian-german ties should conservative leader angela merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- take the mantle of german leadership . merkel grew up in the former east germany and speaks russian , while putin speaks fluent german after serving with the kgb in leipzig during the cold war .
" economic links between russia and germany will not change under merkel because the two countries will be trying to fulfill their economic potential , " belov predicted . martin koopmann , an expert with the german society for foreign policy -lrb- dgap -rrb- , fears troubled times could be ahead .
merkel 's christian democrats will " keep a certain distance from a russia which places all its emphasis on power and less on western-style transparency , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin and schröder to seal gas deal vladimir putin will announce a major agreement to build a pipeline linking russia with western europe when he visits germany thursday , just ahead of the german general election .

critics say it 's an attempt to change the political map of europe . russian president vladimir putin 's one-day visit to berlin thursday to meet with german chancellor gerhard schröder and hammer out a deal to build a pipeline linking russia with western europe has raised hackles in the continent 's east .
" the new russian-german alliance , which is today called an ' energy alliance , ' is a plan to change the political map of europe , " former lithuanian head of state and current eu parliamentarian vytautas landsbergis said in a statement .
by building the pipeline under the sea , by-passing the baltic states and poland , russia would be able to use " monopolistic gas prices " to " influence the policies of neighboring countries , " said landsbergis , who led lithuania when the baltic country became independent from the soviet union in 1990 .
baltic states wary the baltic states are particularly wary of pacts between germany and russia , because they were annexed by the soviet union after the signing of the molotov-ribbentrop pact between germany and the ussr in august 1939 .
they regained their independence only in the early 1990s , and joined the eu and nato last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin and germany 's gerhard schröder were present when the companies behind the project put their signatures to the controversial deal on thursday , paving the way for a gas pipeline to be built by russian state-owned energy giant gazprom and german companies e.on and basf .
the pipeline will stretch 1,200 kilometers -lrb- 750 miles -rrb- under the baltic sea , to link the russian city of vyborg , near st petersburg , to greifswald on the northeastern coast of germany . its underwater path means it will skirt the baltic states , as well as ukraine and poland , which currently receive transit fees from gazprom for allowing its pipelines to cross their territory on the way to the lucrative western european market .
the baltic states and poland wanted the pipeline to pass across their territory to ensure that russia will not apply an energy blockade against them or try to manipulate prices .
lithuanian economy minister kestutis dauksys said thursday the deal undermined the baltic state 's energy security .
" this agreement decreases our energy security , but lithuania could not influence this decision , " dauksys said in an interview to lithuanian public radio thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's kwasniewski on wednesday , polish president aleksander kwasniewski -lrb- photo -rrb- too slammed the pipeline deal , saying it was being struck " over the heads of poland and the eu . "
in july , russian parliamentary deputies urged the government to increase the price of gas exports to countries that have moved outside moscow 's orbit .
the duma , russia 's lower chamber of the parliament , approved a non-binding document calling on prime minister mikhail fradkov to increase tariffs for new eu members estonia , latvia and lithuania , as well as georgia , molodova and ukraine , which are ruled by pro-western governments .
russia has the world 's largest natural gas reserves .
russo-german ties face change putin 's visit to berlin on thursday to meet with his friend schröder is also being watched closely in germany , given that the country is heading to the polls in a general election in a week .
vladislav belov , a specialist on germany at the russian academy of science , said putin realized this could well be the last time he would see schröder in office . " putin is supporting his friend gerhard even if he understands objectively that he will no longer be either chancellor or vice-chancellor . ...
all the signs are that the schröder era is at an end , " belov said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while thursday 's visit could see the close of the chapter of warm schröder-putin relations , opinion is divided on the future of russian-german ties should conservative leader angela merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- take the mantle of german leadership . merkel grew up in the former east germany and speaks russian , while putin speaks fluent german after serving with the kgb in leipzig during the cold war .
" economic links between russia and germany will not change under merkel because the two countries will be trying to fulfill their economic potential , " belov predicted . martin koopmann , an expert with the german society for foreign policy -lrb- dgap -rrb- , fears troubled times could be ahead .
merkel 's christian democrats will " keep a certain distance from a russia which places all its emphasis on power and less on western-style transparency , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin and schröder to seal gas deal vladimir putin will announce a major agreement to build a pipeline linking russia with western europe when he visits germany thursday , just ahead of the german general election .

germany defeated south africa 4-2 in wednesday 's friendly at the weserstadion in bremen and minus 35-year-old goalkeeper jens lehmann , the team had an average age of just under 23 .
" as otto rehhagel used to say there is no such thing as old and young players but good and bad ones , " explained klinsmann .
" if the young players are better they are going to play . "
klinsmann handed full debuts to 19-year-old duo patrick sinkiewitz and marcell jansen despite limited experience in the bundesliga .
the 1990 world cup victor felt the gamble was a success .
" marcell was calm and impressed with his surges forward , " declared klinsmann .
" patrick was also cool and is another alternative in central defense . "
inexperience not a concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borussia mönchengladbach defender jansen and fc cologne starlet sinkiewitz have played less than 30 bundesliga games between them but inexperience does not concern klinsmann .

it is great fun watching this team out there . "
with the 21-year-old bastian schweinsteiger , lukas podolski and per mertesacker , both 20 , also in the starting line-up it could almost have been an under-21 fixture .
although the youth stars have added vim to germany 's attack , the defense has been rather shaky .
mertesacker has caused a penalty in both of his last two matches with the national team .
but klinsmann has left seasoned internationals such as liverpool midfielder dietmar hamann and borussia dortmund defender christian worns on the sidelines and it is unclear what role , if any , they will play at the 2006 world cup .

germany has benefited greatly , however , from the new youth players up front .
fc cologne striker podolski woke up on thursday to find his picture plastered across the newspapers after scoring a hat-trick in germany 's 4-2 friendly win over south africa .
the 20-year-old podolski opened the scoring with a delightful chip on 12 minutes and then showed his killer instinct to score twice inside seven minutes to record a first international hat-trick .
" podolski phenomenom , " headlined kicker magazine .
" the cologne star scores three to compensate for shaky defense . "
klinsmann chose to start ' prince poldi ' on the substitutes ' bench for the recent 2-0 defeat by slovakia and the media claimed it would be folly to do that again .
" super poldi , " declared bild daily .
" klinsmann , never leave him out again . "
podolski , born in the polish city of gliwice , has now scored an impressive 10 goals in 17 internationals .
" it does not matter whether i am in the starting line-up or on the substitutes ' bench - i just want to score my goals , " explained podolski .
" the coach told me to go out there and get my goals and it worked .
the slovakia defeat was a setback but we are now back on track . "

" it is irresponsible to hype up young players such as lukas podolski , " deisler said .
" they get built up and then knocked down later on . "

germany defeated south africa 4-2 in wednesday 's friendly at the weserstadion in bremen and minus 35-year-old goalkeeper jens lehmann , the team had an average age of just under 23 .
" as otto rehhagel used to say there is no such thing as old and young players but good and bad ones , " explained klinsmann .
" if the young players are better they are going to play . "
klinsmann handed full debuts to 19-year-old duo patrick sinkiewitz and marcell jansen despite limited experience in the bundesliga .
the 1990 world cup victor felt the gamble was a success .
" marcell was calm and impressed with his surges forward , " declared klinsmann .
" patrick was also cool and is another alternative in central defense . "
inexperience not a concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borussia mönchengladbach defender jansen and fc cologne starlet sinkiewitz have played less than 30 bundesliga games between them but inexperience does not concern klinsmann .
" a young team is growing and it will get better and better , " he said .
" if we look back to august last year then almost all of our players have made progress .
it is great fun watching this team out there . "
with the 21-year-old bastian schweinsteiger , lukas podolski and per mertesacker , both 20 , also in the starting line-up it could almost have been an under-21 fixture .
although the youth stars have added vim to germany 's attack , the defense has been rather shaky .
mertesacker has caused a penalty in both of his last two matches with the national team .
but klinsmann has left seasoned internationals such as liverpool midfielder dietmar hamann and borussia dortmund defender christian worns on the sidelines and it is unclear what role , if any , they will play at the 2006 world cup .

germany has benefited greatly , however , from the new youth players up front .
fc cologne striker podolski woke up on thursday to find his picture plastered across the newspapers after scoring a hat-trick in germany 's 4-2 friendly win over south africa .
the 20-year-old podolski opened the scoring with a delightful chip on 12 minutes and then showed his killer instinct to score twice inside seven minutes to record a first international hat-trick .
" podolski phenomenom , " headlined kicker magazine .
" the cologne star scores three to compensate for shaky defense . "
klinsmann chose to start ' prince poldi ' on the substitutes ' bench for the recent 2-0 defeat by slovakia and the media claimed it would be folly to do that again .
" super poldi , " declared bild daily .
" klinsmann , never leave him out again . "
podolski , born in the polish city of gliwice , has now scored an impressive 10 goals in 17 internationals .
" it does not matter whether i am in the starting line-up or on the substitutes ' bench - i just want to score my goals , " explained podolski .
" the coach told me to go out there and get my goals and it worked .
the slovakia defeat was a setback but we are now back on track . "
too much pressure ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sebastian deisler podolski made his bundesliga debut at the age of 18 in november 2003 and in the subsequent two years , he has gone from a talented teenager to the next golden boy of german football .
it seems the polish-born striker can do no wrong at the moment but bayern munich midfielder sebastian deisler - once heralded as the savior of german football - insists people must not put too much pressure on podolski .
" it is irresponsible to hype up young players such as lukas podolski , " deisler said .
" they get built up and then knocked down later on . "
klinsmann hailed podolski 's perfomance but admitted the younger players all needed the arm-around-the-shoulder treatment .
" some of the younger players do need protecting as they are new at this level , " said klinsmann .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 08.09.2005 electronics fair ends on a high großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flat-screens were all the rage at the ifa the 45th international consumer electronics fair -lrb- ifa -rrb- in berlin has drawn to a close with experts predicting that the well-attended event would provide a much-needed boost to germany 's struggling electronics industry . even before the curtain fell on the six-day ifa spread out over the massive exhibition hall in western berlin on wednesday , organizers and industry representatives were in little doubt that in terms of figures and sales , the show had been a success .
" we even partly exceeded the high expectations preceding the fair .
we are very satisfied , " said roland stehle of the society for entertainment and communications electronics -lrb- gfu -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's electronics industry , which has been plagued by profit concerns and price falls in recent years , had pinned high hopes on the ifa which has improved continually every year in terms of attracting heavyweight exhibitors .
this year over 1,200 of them from 40 countries were vying for attention with their latest products .
more professionals , more orders according to stehle , even the specialized trade center at the fair was teeming with visitors this year , demand was high and buyers placed record number of orders .
" there were more industry professionals this year at the ifa than say two years ago , " said stehle who added that even the levels of know-how and expertise among them were significantly higher .
" the volume of orders was correspondingly higher - estimated at more than 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.1 billion -rrb- as compared to about 2.4 billion euros in 2003 , " said stehle .
though the estimates have not yet been officially confirmed and put down on paper , stehle said the industry was confident that the final figures on orders and visitors would make this year 's ifa stand out in the fair 's 81-year history .
innovation the key word one of the obvious trends at this year 's ifa was the presence of overwhelming plasma and lcd flat screens with the logo " hd-ready " in a reference to high-definition televisions -lrb- hdtv -rrb- , which are all the rage in the industry .
bildunterschrift : several german television stations announced at the ifa that they would broadcast their programs in the new standard starting this autumn .
the electronics industry is hoping that the new trend will provide a much-needed boost to the upcoming christmas retail sales and help sluggish consumer spending in the country .
" twenty-one percent of all households in germany want to buy a flat-screen television in the next 24 months , " said hans-joachim kamp , chairman of the consumer electronics trade association .
" i think this underpins the positive trend and the positive mood in the consumer electronics area . "
stehle confirmed that the continued digitalization of electronic gadgets right from radios to mobile phones and home entertainment was a promising development and that it would also raise demand for other digital products such as dvds and video players , cameras and mp3 players .
" the consumer electronics segment is overwhelmingly innovative .
we have around 10,000 new products each year and right now we seem to have the finger on the pulse of the consumers , " said stehle .

" we even partly exceeded the high expectations preceding the fair .
we are very satisfied , " said roland stehle of the society for entertainment and communications electronics -lrb- gfu -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's electronics industry , which has been plagued by profit concerns and price falls in recent years , had pinned high hopes on the ifa which has improved continually every year in terms of attracting heavyweight exhibitors .
this year over 1,200 of them from 40 countries were vying for attention with their latest products .
more professionals , more orders according to stehle , even the specialized trade center at the fair was teeming with visitors this year , demand was high and buyers placed record number of orders .
" there were more industry professionals this year at the ifa than say two years ago , " said stehle who added that even the levels of know-how and expertise among them were significantly higher .
" the volume of orders was correspondingly higher - estimated at more than 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.1 billion -rrb- as compared to about 2.4 billion euros in 2003 , " said stehle .
though the estimates have not yet been officially confirmed and put down on paper , stehle said the industry was confident that the final figures on orders and visitors would make this year 's ifa stand out in the fair 's 81-year history .
innovation the key word one of the obvious trends at this year 's ifa was the presence of overwhelming plasma and lcd flat screens with the logo " hd-ready " in a reference to high-definition televisions -lrb- hdtv -rrb- , which are all the rage in the industry .
bildunterschrift : several german television stations announced at the ifa that they would broadcast their programs in the new standard starting this autumn .
the electronics industry is hoping that the new trend will provide a much-needed boost to the upcoming christmas retail sales and help sluggish consumer spending in the country .
" twenty-one percent of all households in germany want to buy a flat-screen television in the next 24 months , " said hans-joachim kamp , chairman of the consumer electronics trade association .
" i think this underpins the positive trend and the positive mood in the consumer electronics area . "
stehle confirmed that the continued digitalization of electronic gadgets right from radios to mobile phones and home entertainment was a promising development and that it would also raise demand for other digital products such as dvds and video players , cameras and mp3 players .
" the consumer electronics segment is overwhelmingly innovative .
we have around 10,000 new products each year and right now we seem to have the finger on the pulse of the consumers , " said stehle .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.09.2005 eu states break chinese clothes deadlock großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu gates are now open to chinese textiles eu member states have given the green light to a deal to release millions of cheap chinese clothes blocked at european ports as early as next week .
but the move still has n't allayed deeper worries on both sides . delegations from the 25 eu governments reached agreement here two days after eu trade commissioner peter mandelson had struck a trade deal to resolve an embarrassing standoff which has seriously strained ties with beijing .
" we would hope that if everything goes smoothly .. that by the middle of next week the goods that are currently blocked in customs can be unblocked , " said a spokesman for the european commission .
millions of chinese textiles , including pullovers , trousers , blouses , t-shirts , bras and tons of flax yarn , have been impounded at european ports because they exceed import quotas agreed by both sides in june .
bildunterschrift : boxes of blockaded goods from china are stacked in a warehouse at the port of antwerp in antwerp , belgium the political agreement , reached by ambassadors from eu member states on wednesday , opened the way for experts to work on a legal document that will allow the blocked clothes to be released by customs .
mandelson praised the move .
" i am very pleased that member states have approved the agreement with china and the commission 's proposal for unblocking textile imports from china , " he said in a statement from india , where he was taking part in an eu-india summit . " this solidarity now allows the commission to put in place the legal instrument which should allow the member states to begin unblocking goods next week , " he added .
dispute strains ties between eu , china as well as straining relations between the eu and china , the dispute had led to warnings that a shortage of the goods could cause prices to rise and hit european importers and retailers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the question of how to deal with the logjam divided eu members , roughly between southern european countries whose manufacturers fear the flood of cheap imports and northern countries where retailers want fresh stocks .
about five eu states , including italy , spain and portugal , have balked at allowing the products into the bloc .
under the deal negotiated in beijing between mandelson and chinese commerce minister bo xilai , the eu and china will share the quota burden caused by the stockpiles . about half of the estimated 80 million textile products being held up will enter the eu outside the fixed quotas , while the other half will be added to china 's 2006 textile limit .
lasting solutions needed industry officials have welcomed the eu-china deal - but at least one key official warned that the chaotic scenes of the last month or two could happen again unless the eu commission gets a grip on the problem .
" we are happy with the short term solution , " said foreign trade association -lrb- fta -rrb- head ferry den hoed . but he added : " in the end it still can be chaos next year ...
we have large quantities blocked in warehouses in china , and the chinese are not issuing export licenses any more , " he said .
chinese officials have also warned that the deal remains a short-term fix to a long-term problem and that more lasting solutions were needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese models parade in outfits which use themes from the forbidden city , on a stage in front of the former imperial palace in beijing some chinese textile manufacturers have already started worrying about their future exports , according to the state-run xinhua news agency . " the export quotas for the second half of the year have almost been used up and if we start using next year 's quotas , we will face greater pressure next year , " said zhu hongjun , a senior manager with peiluocheng group in zhejiang .
in spain , finance minister pedro solbes said he believed that the compromise deal did not deal with the crux of the problem . he said that it " does not take into account in a balanced way the whole of the problem " .
leading spanish textile firms including inditex , whose flagship store is the retail chain zara , had earlier said they were " radically " opposed to the proposal . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu and china resolve textile dispute the eu-chinese summit in beijing , boosted by the settlement of the dispute over import quotas for chinese textiles , kicked off to an optimistic start on monday .

but the move still has n't allayed deeper worries on both sides . delegations from the 25 eu governments reached agreement here two days after eu trade commissioner peter mandelson had struck a trade deal to resolve an embarrassing standoff which has seriously strained ties with beijing .
" we would hope that if everything goes smoothly .. that by the middle of next week the goods that are currently blocked in customs can be unblocked , " said a spokesman for the european commission .
millions of chinese textiles , including pullovers , trousers , blouses , t-shirts , bras and tons of flax yarn , have been impounded at european ports because they exceed import quotas agreed by both sides in june .
bildunterschrift : boxes of blockaded goods from china are stacked in a warehouse at the port of antwerp in antwerp , belgium the political agreement , reached by ambassadors from eu member states on wednesday , opened the way for experts to work on a legal document that will allow the blocked clothes to be released by customs .
mandelson praised the move .
" i am very pleased that member states have approved the agreement with china and the commission 's proposal for unblocking textile imports from china , " he said in a statement from india , where he was taking part in an eu-india summit . " this solidarity now allows the commission to put in place the legal instrument which should allow the member states to begin unblocking goods next week , " he added .
dispute strains ties between eu , china as well as straining relations between the eu and china , the dispute had led to warnings that a shortage of the goods could cause prices to rise and hit european importers and retailers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the question of how to deal with the logjam divided eu members , roughly between southern european countries whose manufacturers fear the flood of cheap imports and northern countries where retailers want fresh stocks .
about five eu states , including italy , spain and portugal , have balked at allowing the products into the bloc .
under the deal negotiated in beijing between mandelson and chinese commerce minister bo xilai , the eu and china will share the quota burden caused by the stockpiles . about half of the estimated 80 million textile products being held up will enter the eu outside the fixed quotas , while the other half will be added to china 's 2006 textile limit .
lasting solutions needed industry officials have welcomed the eu-china deal - but at least one key official warned that the chaotic scenes of the last month or two could happen again unless the eu commission gets a grip on the problem .
" we are happy with the short term solution , " said foreign trade association -lrb- fta -rrb- head ferry den hoed . but he added : " in the end it still can be chaos next year ...
we have large quantities blocked in warehouses in china , and the chinese are not issuing export licenses any more , " he said .
chinese officials have also warned that the deal remains a short-term fix to a long-term problem and that more lasting solutions were needed .

" i believe sincerely that india will be a winner from greater openness , " european union trade commissioner peter mandelson told a gathering of business leaders at an india-eu summit . india 's minister for commerce and industry , kamal nath , however , told the business leaders that the european union is using non-tariff barriers to block imports from india such as shrimps and herbal remedies . " peter is badgering us that we are not giving them market access , " he said . india wants farm subsidies cut at an india-eu business summit attended by british prime minister tony blair , who holds the six-month eu presidency , and indian prime minister manmohan singh , the issue of farm subsidies was raised again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more access for european wine , please onkar kanwar , president of the federation of indian chambers of commerce and industry , said the 320 billion dollars the eu spends a year on farm subsidies should be cut so indian farmers can sell into the market . " you need exactly what we produce , " kanwar said . singh also raised the farm subsidy issue and that of non-tariff barriers preventing the sale of farm products from india , which he said was crucial to lifting millions out of poverty here . " i believe there is a perception in indian trade and industry circles that the european market is becoming increasingly difficult to penetrate .
as tariff barriers disintegrate , non-tariff barrier suddenly come up , " singh said . " india is one of the largest producers of agricultural commodities ... the famous basmati rice and the equally famous darjeeling tea ... but many of these are also products which find some form of discrimination and trade protection " in the eu . " blair did not discuss the issue .
in june , he angered some european leaders with calls for cuts in farm export subsidies , warning that failure to make progress would harm world trade talks in december . both want increased trade the eu is india 's largest trading partner and the destination for a quarter of indian exports .
however , mandelson noted that efforts by both sides should be to increase trade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite dispute , meetings are going very well , officials say " india is the eu 's 12th trading partner , a volume that stands at an impressive sounding 33 billion euros -lrb- $ 41.3 billion -rrb- , " mandelson said .
" impressive , that is , until you realize that the figure for korea is 48 billion -lrb- euros -rrb- , for russia 126 billion and for china 175 billion .
these frankly are sobering comparisons . " the eu-india summit is an annual event , but never before in its history has the european union sent such a high-ranking delegation to new delhi .
this time , blair , who holds the rotating presidency of the eu , was accompanied by european commission president jose barroso , as well as a host of commissioners and business leaders - a delegation befitting a nation that is widely regarded as one of the world 's up-and-coming economic powers . india rises in trading status the summit , which saw the signing of a so-called " action plan " setting out the way forward in political , trade and investment , economic , and cultural and academic relations , effectively put india on a par with other eu partners such as us , china and russia . " it is in my opinion long overdue , " said blair , referring to the joint action plan .
" it sets a framework for more action on a whole range of issues … such as science and technology . " indian prime minister manmohan singh was equally upbeat about the talks with european leaders . " we had extremely good and productive discussions , " the indian premier said .
" the most important outcome has been the adoption of a joint action plan … which provides the framework , a road map for identifying pathways for future cooperation .

" we even partly exceeded the high expectations preceding the fair .
we are very satisfied , " said roland stehle of the society for entertainment and communications electronics -lrb- gfu -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's electronics industry , which has been plagued by profit concerns and price falls in recent years , had pinned high hopes on the ifa which has improved continually every year in terms of attracting heavyweight exhibitors .
this year over 1,200 of them from 40 countries were vying for attention with their latest products .
more professionals , more orders according to stehle , even the specialized trade center at the fair was teeming with visitors this year , demand was high and buyers placed record number of orders .
" there were more industry professionals this year at the ifa than say two years ago , " said stehle who added that even the levels of know-how and expertise among them were significantly higher .
" the volume of orders was correspondingly higher - estimated at more than 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.1 billion -rrb- as compared to about 2.4 billion euros in 2003 , " said stehle .
though the estimates have not yet been officially confirmed and put down on paper , stehle said the industry was confident that the final figures on orders and visitors would make this year 's ifa stand out in the fair 's 81-year history .
innovation the key word one of the obvious trends at this year 's ifa was the presence of overwhelming plasma and lcd flat screens with the logo " hd-ready " in a reference to high-definition televisions -lrb- hdtv -rrb- , which are all the rage in the industry .
bildunterschrift : several german television stations announced at the ifa that they would broadcast their programs in the new standard starting this autumn .
the electronics industry is hoping that the new trend will provide a much-needed boost to the upcoming christmas retail sales and help sluggish consumer spending in the country .
" twenty-one percent of all households in germany want to buy a flat-screen television in the next 24 months , " said hans-joachim kamp , chairman of the consumer electronics trade association .
" i think this underpins the positive trend and the positive mood in the consumer electronics area . "
stehle confirmed that the continued digitalization of electronic gadgets right from radios to mobile phones and home entertainment was a promising development and that it would also raise demand for other digital products such as dvds and video players , cameras and mp3 players .
" the consumer electronics segment is overwhelmingly innovative .
we have around 10,000 new products each year and right now we seem to have the finger on the pulse of the consumers , " said stehle .
" our products are fun , they look good , they offer value and finally , that 's what 's honored by customers .

" we are operating in a very safe environment , but of course the tragic accidents we 've had have to give us a push to improve safety standards even further , " said commission spokesman stefaan de rynck . de rynck said the talks between member states were " important " in helping decide what criteria should be used in drawing up the blacklist , as well as what the consequences of being on a banned list should be . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trying to prevent more disasters like this one in greece " the european union needs common criteria to identify unsafe airlines .
such airlines would be put on a european black list and be subject to an eu-wide ban to fly , " said a commission statement . the european parliament will take up the issue in november , and a meeting of european transportation ministers will be organized after that . " the commission hopes for a political agreement on the common criteria , the eu black list , and the eu-wide ban by the end of the year , " it added . incoherent rules the eu commission said the " incoherence " of current air safety regulations was highlighted in may when a turkish airline , suspended by four european countries , simply redirected its flights to belgium which had not imposed a similar ban . " this is astonishing , and a little bit absurd , " said the spokesman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu officials want all member states to follow the same rules the european union blacklist idea is similar to a mechanism already operational in the united states , where would-be passengers can consult a website publishing the names of airlines with relatively poor safety records .
similar backlists exist in france , britain and sweden . experts from 35 european countries called last month for the definition of common criteria to establish lists of airline companies to be blacklisted on safety grounds . " it is essential to define common criteria , " said michel wachenheim , head of the french civil aviation authority -lrb- dgac -rrb- , at a meeting of the european civil aviation conference -lrb- ecac -rrb- . cypriot airlines deny pilot language problems the eu talks in brussels came as the low-cost airline involved in a mysterious crash in greece last month denied a report that below-par language skills and the inexperience of a pilot contributed to the accident . cyprus ' helios airways said it was confident that the pilots of the doomed flight , which crashed on august 14 killing all 121 on board , were able to understand each other in english on the flight to prague via athens . " i 've spoken to both pilots and their english was of a good standard ...

conceived as a rival to the british turner prize , the nationalgalerie prize for young art might pack the same kind of sensational punch we 've come to expect from the turner , but that ’ s where the similarities end . at the recent opening of the exhibition showcasing the artworks nominated for the nationalgalerie prize for young art at the hamburger bahnhof museum in berlin , curator joachim jäger compared monica bonvicini ’ s installation to an abu ghraib cell , while her fellow contestant john bock gave a performance that included getting pushed through a window by an angry " spectator " before leading the incredulous audience out of the gallery and jumping off a nearby bridge onto a waiting boat -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the four finalists for the prize set to be announced in late september are certainly not your standard museum fare .
bildunterschrift : john bock the emperor 's new clothes ?
in this respect , the nationalgalerie prize has taken an obvious cue from the 20-year-old turner - which , the critics have often argued , has a habit of favoring controversy over content .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : damian hirst 's shark floating in a tank of formaldehyde with a list of celebrity candidates ranging from damien hirst and his cows cut in half , tracey emin and her unmade bed to the cross-dressing grayson perry , the turner shortlist has more often than not boasted a generous dose of scandal that never failed to get the nation talking .
what tends to ruffle public feathers is less a matter of shocking content than a perceived lack of content .
it can be counted on to generate an annual media row , usually focused on that old chestnut : is it art ?
edgy but educational bildunterschrift : angela bulloch 's the disenchanted forest already dubbed " the german turner " and worth almost as much , the 50,000 euro -lrb- $ 62,000 -rrb- nationalgalerie prize for young art might be trying a similar tack in its stated aim of bringing art to a wider public , but with a short-list that includes bonvicini , bock , anri sala and angela bulloch -lrb- photo -rrb- , it 's giving a platform to four artists with established international reputations - even if they hardly deliver feel-good family fun .
" contemporary art attracts far less attention from the general public than 20th century modern art , for example , " said joachim jäger .
" it 's often edgy , provocative , and therefore not always instantly popular .
the competitive nature of the prize , as well as the ensuing publicity , is one way of raising awareness of contemporary art and arousing public curiosity . "
it 's also educational .
" it might be incomprehensible until you make an effort to get into it , " said peter raue from the friends of the nationalgalerie .
" but then it ’ s all very illuminating .
and ultimately , it should be a people ’ s prize . "
art as an event in any case , according to ursula prinz , deputy director at the german capital 's esteemed berlinische galerie , just about all contemporary art could be described as shocking .
" provocation is an integral part of today 's art , " she said .
" we live in an event culture , everything has to create a stir . "
many feel it 's a trend that raises the stakes for the average museum , and perhaps leaves the public bored by anything less than outrage .
" it does mean a lot of less spectacular work falls through the net , which is a little regrettable , " said prinz .
" less high-profile projects don ’ t get a look in .
art as an event is the order of the day , to the detriment of less flashy art . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but attention-grabbing art is n't all bad .
" events like this prize are one way of getting people into museums in the first place , " she admitted .
" in that sense , they definitely don ’ t hurt . "
conceptual rather than figurative old-school craft certainly is n't what the prize is about .
featuring performance , video and installation , the money is clearly on experimentation - another unmistakable nod to the turner , which has always been conceptual rather than figurative .
and if the prize attracts similar media frenzy , the entire german art world gets to benefit from the hype .
" everyone always wants to know who 's won the turner , " pointed out ursula prinz .
" so if one can achieve the same effect in germany , it would be a boon for everyone . "
individual , international but even though the turner has always triggered fierce opinions , much of the attention it attracts is unfavorable .
weird art is great in theory , but does n't it ultimately alienate the public ?
according to the german turner ’ s organizers , they have all their bases covered .
" shock tactics have the advantage of mass appeal , but also the disadvantage of reflecting a very one-sided facet to contemporary art , " said jäger .
" the nationalgalerie prize is aiming to be a crowd-puller , but it also takes a serious look at present-day art .
the jury 's selection represents four very different positions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anri sala it also represents different nationalities .
unlike the turner , which focuses on artists living and working in britain but often only shortlists british artists , the nationalgalerie prize has a very international slew of nominations .
in fact , german artists are conspicuously absent , as is traditional painting - so anyone expecting a sample of the fashionable new leipzig school , for example , will be sorely disappointed .
but it all goes to show just how open-minded the german art scene is .
" the prize turns the spotlight on international art developments in germany , rather than just german art , " pointed out jäger .

the agreement for the north european gas pipeline was due to be signed in october .
but with an election called 12 months early and schröder 's social democrats trailing the opposition christian democrats in the polls , the meeting was brought forward .
vladislav belov , a specialist on germany at the russian academy of science , said putin realized this could well be the last time he would see schröder in office .
show of support " putin is supporting his friend gerhard even if he understands objectively that he will no longer be either chancellor or vice-chancellor . ...
all the signs are that the schröder era is at an end , " belov said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german-russian gas deal has circumvented the ukraine the pipeline will be built by state-owned russian energy giant gazprom , together with several german companies .
around 900 kilometers -lrb- 550 miles -rrb- long , it will stretch from near st. petersburg to the northeastern coast of germany .
significantly , it does not pass over ukraine , upsetting that country and poland , which receive considerable transit fees from gazprom for allowing its current pipelines to pass over their territory on their way to the lucrative western european market .
schröder has pushed for germany to lessen its dependence on oil and gas from the gulf and the united states , and 32 percent of germany 's natural gas is currently supplied by russia .
belov said the pipeline project would " increase the interdependence of the german and russian economies . "
speaking the same language while thursday 's visit could see the close of the chapter of warm schröder-putin relations , opinion is divided on the future of russian-german ties should conservative leader angela merkel take the mantle of german leadership .
merkel grew up in the former east germany and speaks russian , while putin speaks fluent german after serving with the kgb in leipzig during the cold war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel may strike a different tone with russia " economic links between russia and germany will not change under merkel because the two countries will be trying to fulfil their economic potential , " belov predicted .
martin koopmann , an expert with the german society for foreign policy -lrb- dgap -rrb- , fears troubled times could be ahead .
merkel 's christian democrats will " keep a certain distance from a russia which places all its emphasis on power and less on western-style transparency , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin and chirac back germany 's un bid russian president vladimir putin and french president jacques chirac have voiced support for germany 's faltering bid for a permanent seat on the united nations security council .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 08.09.2005 art provocateurs steal the show großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bonvicini 's sado-maso darkroom : shocking ?
conceived as a rival to the british turner prize , the nationalgalerie prize for young art might pack the same kind of sensational punch we 've come to expect from the turner , but that ’ s where the similarities end . at the recent opening of the exhibition showcasing the artworks nominated for the nationalgalerie prize for young art at the hamburger bahnhof museum in berlin , curator joachim jäger compared monica bonvicini ’ s installation to an abu ghraib cell , while her fellow contestant john bock gave a performance that included getting pushed through a window by an angry " spectator " before leading the incredulous audience out of the gallery and jumping off a nearby bridge onto a waiting boat -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the four finalists for the prize set to be announced in late september are certainly not your standard museum fare .
bildunterschrift : john bock the emperor 's new clothes ?
in this respect , the nationalgalerie prize has taken an obvious cue from the 20-year-old turner - which , the critics have often argued , has a habit of favoring controversy over content .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : damian hirst 's shark floating in a tank of formaldehyde with a list of celebrity candidates ranging from damien hirst and his cows cut in half , tracey emin and her unmade bed to the cross-dressing grayson perry , the turner shortlist has more often than not boasted a generous dose of scandal that never failed to get the nation talking .
what tends to ruffle public feathers is less a matter of shocking content than a perceived lack of content .
it can be counted on to generate an annual media row , usually focused on that old chestnut : is it art ?
edgy but educational bildunterschrift : angela bulloch 's the disenchanted forest already dubbed " the german turner " and worth almost as much , the 50,000 euro -lrb- $ 62,000 -rrb- nationalgalerie prize for young art might be trying a similar tack in its stated aim of bringing art to a wider public , but with a short-list that includes bonvicini , bock , anri sala and angela bulloch -lrb- photo -rrb- , it 's giving a platform to four artists with established international reputations - even if they hardly deliver feel-good family fun .
" contemporary art attracts far less attention from the general public than 20th century modern art , for example , " said joachim jäger .
" it 's often edgy , provocative , and therefore not always instantly popular .
the competitive nature of the prize , as well as the ensuing publicity , is one way of raising awareness of contemporary art and arousing public curiosity . "
it 's also educational .
" it might be incomprehensible until you make an effort to get into it , " said peter raue from the friends of the nationalgalerie .
" but then it ’ s all very illuminating .
and ultimately , it should be a people ’ s prize . "
art as an event in any case , according to ursula prinz , deputy director at the german capital 's esteemed berlinische galerie , just about all contemporary art could be described as shocking .
" provocation is an integral part of today 's art , " she said .
" we live in an event culture , everything has to create a stir . "
many feel it 's a trend that raises the stakes for the average museum , and perhaps leaves the public bored by anything less than outrage .
" it does mean a lot of less spectacular work falls through the net , which is a little regrettable , " said prinz .
" less high-profile projects don ’ t get a look in .
art as an event is the order of the day , to the detriment of less flashy art . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but attention-grabbing art is n't all bad .
" events like this prize are one way of getting people into museums in the first place , " she admitted .
" in that sense , they definitely don ’ t hurt . "
conceptual rather than figurative old-school craft certainly is n't what the prize is about .
featuring performance , video and installation , the money is clearly on experimentation - another unmistakable nod to the turner , which has always been conceptual rather than figurative .
and if the prize attracts similar media frenzy , the entire german art world gets to benefit from the hype .
" everyone always wants to know who 's won the turner , " pointed out ursula prinz .
" so if one can achieve the same effect in germany , it would be a boon for everyone . "
individual , international but even though the turner has always triggered fierce opinions , much of the attention it attracts is unfavorable .
weird art is great in theory , but does n't it ultimately alienate the public ?
according to the german turner ’ s organizers , they have all their bases covered .
" shock tactics have the advantage of mass appeal , but also the disadvantage of reflecting a very one-sided facet to contemporary art , " said jäger .
" the nationalgalerie prize is aiming to be a crowd-puller , but it also takes a serious look at present-day art .
the jury 's selection represents four very different positions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anri sala it also represents different nationalities .
unlike the turner , which focuses on artists living and working in britain but often only shortlists british artists , the nationalgalerie prize has a very international slew of nominations .
in fact , german artists are conspicuously absent , as is traditional painting - so anyone expecting a sample of the fashionable new leipzig school , for example , will be sorely disappointed .
but it all goes to show just how open-minded the german art scene is .
" the prize turns the spotlight on international art developments in germany , rather than just german art , " pointed out jäger .

us president bush accepted berlin 's offer of help on sunday . the german technical relief team is expected to spend the next few weeks in the ravaged region helping with clean-up efforts in the wake of hurricane katrina .
the 89 experts , who are accompanied by a five-person medical team , are equipped with 15 high performance pumps , capable of pumping 175,000 liters of water per minute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dead bodies float down the flooded streets berlin , which is funding the technisches hilfswerk mission , is also planning to send between 20 and 30 specialists from the bundeskriminalamt , the federal criminal bureau , to help with the difficult task of identifying the bodies of katrina 's victims .
government spokesman bela anda said germany would be sending some 40 tons of food to the us . the situation in new orleans remains critical . following an evacuation order issued by the city mayor , ray nagin , national guard troops in the southern city are looking for thousands of people still thought to be trapped in the ruins of their homes of the city once famed for its party atmosphere . hide and seek as many as 10,000 stragglers , who are surrounded by a toxic soup of garbage , human excrement and corpses , have been without water or electricity for more than a week .
and although many of them are waiting desperately for their turn to be rescued , others have resigned themselves to the ruling to clear the city . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " those who do n't want us to find them , they hide , " gregg brown , a south carolina game warden who is involved in the search , told the reuters news agency . one new orleans resident told reporters that he had no money , nowhere to go and that if he was going to be miserable , he 'd sooner be miserable where he is . criticism continues although washington has accepted help from abroad , pressure over the president 's handling of the catastrophe continues to mount .
while the senate homeland security committee has already launched one inquiry , the democrats are demanding an independent probe into the government response to the gulf coast storm . harry reid , the democratic leader in the senate , has said any inquiry should look into whether the president 's long summer holiday at his texas ranch influenced the government response . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush is under fire for his handling of the disaster bush 's majority republicans only agreed on wednesday to a joint senate-house of representatives investigation to look into the actions of " all levels of government . "
bush , who has also promised to lead his own inquiry , would not say whether any aides would be fired over the slow response that he has admitted was unacceptable . he admitted that any inquiry will have to look at the links between federal and local authorities in handling such disasters - hinting that the federal authorities should take a stronger hand . politics at play both ray nagin , and the governor of louisiana , kathleen blanco , have accused washington of holding up the rescue . a survey conducted by the newspaper usa today said 25 percent of americans criticized local authorities and 18 percent the state of louisiana for the chaos .
but the president does n't escape .
forty-two percent of those asked said he had handled katrina " badly " or " very badly " .
thirty-five percent backed bush 's effort . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tiny patch of wreckage republicans have accused democrats of playing politics with their attacks and diverting attention from the rescue effort . democrats , meanwhile , also seized upon what they say are clumsy remarks by the republican speaker in the house , dennis hastert , who was forced to retract comments questioning whether rebuilding new orleans was worth the cost and by barbara bush , the president 's mother , that the " underprivileged " of louisiana were better off in their emergency shelter in the houston astrodome stadium , and that it was " working very well for them .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.09.2005 critics slam russo-german deal on pipeline großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chummy german-russian relationship is ruffling feathers opposition is growing in eastern europe to a deal to build a gas pipeline under the baltic sea , which germany and russia are poised to sign thursday .
critics say it 's an attempt to change the political map of europe . russian president vladimir putin 's one-day visit to berlin thursday to meet with german chancellor gerhard schröder and hammer out a deal to build a pipeline linking russia with western europe has raised hackles in the continent 's east .
" the new russian-german alliance , which is today called an ' energy alliance , ' is a plan to change the political map of europe , " former lithuanian head of state and current eu parliamentarian vytautas landsbergis said in a statement .
by building the pipeline under the sea , by-passing the baltic states and poland , russia would be able to use " monopolistic gas prices " to " influence the policies of neighboring countries , " said landsbergis , who led lithuania when the baltic country became independent from the soviet union in 1990 .
baltic states wary the baltic states are particularly wary of pacts between germany and russia , because they were annexed by the soviet union after the signing of the molotov-ribbentrop pact between germany and the ussr in august 1939 .
they regained their independence only in the early 1990s , and joined the eu and nato last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin and germany 's gerhard schröder were present when the companies behind the project put their signatures to the controversial deal on thursday , paving the way for a gas pipeline to be built by russian state-owned energy giant gazprom and german companies e.on and basf .
the pipeline will stretch 1,200 kilometers -lrb- 750 miles -rrb- under the baltic sea , to link the russian city of vyborg , near st petersburg , to greifswald on the northeastern coast of germany . its underwater path means it will skirt the baltic states , as well as ukraine and poland , which currently receive transit fees from gazprom for allowing its pipelines to cross their territory on the way to the lucrative western european market .
the baltic states and poland wanted the pipeline to pass across their territory to ensure that russia will not apply an energy blockade against them or try to manipulate prices .
lithuanian economy minister kestutis dauksys said thursday the deal undermined the baltic state 's energy security .
" this agreement decreases our energy security , but lithuania could not influence this decision , " dauksys said in an interview to lithuanian public radio thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's kwasniewski on wednesday , polish president aleksander kwasniewski -lrb- photo -rrb- too slammed the pipeline deal , saying it was being struck " over the heads of poland and the eu . "
in july , russian parliamentary deputies urged the government to increase the price of gas exports to countries that have moved outside moscow 's orbit .
the duma , russia 's lower chamber of the parliament , approved a non-binding document calling on prime minister mikhail fradkov to increase tariffs for new eu members estonia , latvia and lithuania , as well as georgia , molodova and ukraine , which are ruled by pro-western governments .
russia has the world 's largest natural gas reserves .
russo-german ties face change putin 's visit to berlin on thursday to meet with his friend schröder is also being watched closely in germany , given that the country is heading to the polls in a general election in a week .
vladislav belov , a specialist on germany at the russian academy of science , said putin realized this could well be the last time he would see schröder in office . " putin is supporting his friend gerhard even if he understands objectively that he will no longer be either chancellor or vice-chancellor . ...
all the signs are that the schröder era is at an end , " belov said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while thursday 's visit could see the close of the chapter of warm schröder-putin relations , opinion is divided on the future of russian-german ties should conservative leader angela merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- take the mantle of german leadership . merkel grew up in the former east germany and speaks russian , while putin speaks fluent german after serving with the kgb in leipzig during the cold war .
" economic links between russia and germany will not change under merkel because the two countries will be trying to fulfill their economic potential , " belov predicted . martin koopmann , an expert with the german society for foreign policy -lrb- dgap -rrb- , fears troubled times could be ahead .
merkel 's christian democrats will " keep a certain distance from a russia which places all its emphasis on power and less on western-style transparency , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin and schröder to seal gas deal vladimir putin will announce a major agreement to build a pipeline linking russia with western europe when he visits germany thursday , just ahead of the german general election .

but , critics say his foreign policy there suffers from a glaring blunder - the lack of mention of human rights .

munich-based lawyers rotter rechtsanwälte said in a statement that they had filed a suit with a court in stuttgart alleging that the german-us auto giant failed to inform their client promptly about the decision by chief executive juergen schrempp to step down early .
after schrempp announced he was quitting , daimlerchrysler shares soared by more than 10 percent on the stock exchange , boosting the company 's market value by more than three billion euros -lrb- $ 3.7 billion -rrb- .
" according to our information , schrempp 's resignation was a done-deal at least five weeks before it was made public , " the lawyers argued .
" but this insider information was not published until july 28 .
those shareholders who sold their shares before then could have got a much higher price for their shares if daimlerchrysler had made the information public as soon as it was known , " they said .
in this concrete case , the lawyers ' client had sold his shares in daimlerchrysler just 90 minutes before schrempp 's decision to resign was made public , meaning he pocketed just 36.50 euros from the transaction , rotter rechtsanwälte said . dw-world.de daimler investigated for insider trading german regulators are launching an investigation regarding possible insider dealings of daimlerchrysler 's shares .

" the new russian-german alliance , which is today called an ' energy alliance , ' is a plan to change the political map of europe , " former lithuanian head of state and current eu parliamentarian vytautas landsbergis said in a statement .
by building the pipeline under the sea , by-passing the baltic states and poland , russia would be able to use " monopolistic gas prices " to " influence the policies of neighboring countries , " said landsbergis , who led lithuania when the baltic country became independent from the soviet union in 1990 .
baltic states wary the baltic states are particularly wary of pacts between germany and russia , because they were annexed by the soviet union after the signing of the molotov-ribbentrop pact between germany and the ussr in august 1939 .
they regained their independence only in the early 1990s , and joined the eu and nato last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin and germany 's gerhard schröder were present when the companies behind the project put their signatures to the controversial deal on thursday , paving the way for a gas pipeline to be built by russian state-owned energy giant gazprom and german companies e.on and basf .
the pipeline will stretch 1,200 kilometers -lrb- 750 miles -rrb- under the baltic sea , to link the russian city of vyborg , near st petersburg , to greifswald on the northeastern coast of germany . its underwater path means it will skirt the baltic states , as well as ukraine and poland , which currently receive transit fees from gazprom for allowing its pipelines to cross their territory on the way to the lucrative western european market .
the baltic states and poland wanted the pipeline to pass across their territory to ensure that russia will not apply an energy blockade against them or try to manipulate prices .
lithuanian economy minister kestutis dauksys said thursday the deal undermined the baltic state 's energy security .
" this agreement decreases our energy security , but lithuania could not influence this decision , " dauksys said in an interview to lithuanian public radio thursday .

in july , russian parliamentary deputies urged the government to increase the price of gas exports to countries that have moved outside moscow 's orbit .
the duma , russia 's lower chamber of the parliament , approved a non-binding document calling on prime minister mikhail fradkov to increase tariffs for new eu members estonia , latvia and lithuania , as well as georgia , molodova and ukraine , which are ruled by pro-western governments .

russo-german ties face change putin 's visit to berlin on thursday to meet with his friend schröder is also being watched closely in germany , given that the country is heading to the polls in a general election in a week .

munich-based lawyers rotter rechtsanwälte said in a statement that they had filed a suit with a court in stuttgart alleging that the german-us auto giant failed to inform their client promptly about the decision by chief executive juergen schrempp to step down early .
after schrempp announced he was quitting , daimlerchrysler shares soared by more than 10 percent on the stock exchange , boosting the company 's market value by more than three billion euros -lrb- $ 3.7 billion -rrb- .

us president bush accepted berlin 's offer of help on sunday . the german technical relief team is expected to spend the next few weeks in the ravaged region helping with clean-up efforts in the wake of hurricane katrina .
the 89 experts , who are accompanied by a five-person medical team , are equipped with 15 high performance pumps , capable of pumping 175,000 liters of water per minute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dead bodies float down the flooded streets berlin , which is funding the technisches hilfswerk mission , is also planning to send between 20 and 30 specialists from the bundeskriminalamt , the federal criminal bureau , to help with the difficult task of identifying the bodies of katrina 's victims .
government spokesman bela anda said germany would be sending some 40 tons of food to the us . the situation in new orleans remains critical . following an evacuation order issued by the city mayor , ray nagin , national guard troops in the southern city are looking for thousands of people still thought to be trapped in the ruins of their homes of the city once famed for its party atmosphere . hide and seek as many as 10,000 stragglers , who are surrounded by a toxic soup of garbage , human excrement and corpses , have been without water or electricity for more than a week .
and although many of them are waiting desperately for their turn to be rescued , others have resigned themselves to the ruling to clear the city . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " those who do n't want us to find them , they hide , " gregg brown , a south carolina game warden who is involved in the search , told the reuters news agency . one new orleans resident told reporters that he had no money , nowhere to go and that if he was going to be miserable , he 'd sooner be miserable where he is . criticism continues although washington has accepted help from abroad , pressure over the president 's handling of the catastrophe continues to mount .
while the senate homeland security committee has already launched one inquiry , the democrats are demanding an independent probe into the government response to the gulf coast storm . harry reid , the democratic leader in the senate , has said any inquiry should look into whether the president 's long summer holiday at his texas ranch influenced the government response . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush is under fire for his handling of the disaster bush 's majority republicans only agreed on wednesday to a joint senate-house of representatives investigation to look into the actions of " all levels of government . "
bush , who has also promised to lead his own inquiry , would not say whether any aides would be fired over the slow response that he has admitted was unacceptable . he admitted that any inquiry will have to look at the links between federal and local authorities in handling such disasters - hinting that the federal authorities should take a stronger hand . politics at play both ray nagin , and the governor of louisiana , kathleen blanco , have accused washington of holding up the rescue . a survey conducted by the newspaper usa today said 25 percent of americans criticized local authorities and 18 percent the state of louisiana for the chaos .
but the president does n't escape .
forty-two percent of those asked said he had handled katrina " badly " or " very badly " .
thirty-five percent backed bush 's effort . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tiny patch of wreckage republicans have accused democrats of playing politics with their attacks and diverting attention from the rescue effort . democrats , meanwhile , also seized upon what they say are clumsy remarks by the republican speaker in the house , dennis hastert , who was forced to retract comments questioning whether rebuilding new orleans was worth the cost and by barbara bush , the president 's mother , that the " underprivileged " of louisiana were better off in their emergency shelter in the houston astrodome stadium , and that it was " working very well for them .

germany defeated south africa 4-2 in wednesday 's friendly at the weserstadion in bremen and minus 35-year-old goalkeeper jens lehmann , the team had an average age of just under 23 .
" as otto rehhagel used to say there is no such thing as old and young players but good and bad ones , " explained klinsmann .
" if the young players are better they are going to play . "
klinsmann handed full debuts to 19-year-old duo patrick sinkiewitz and marcell jansen despite limited experience in the bundesliga .
the 1990 world cup victor felt the gamble was a success .
" marcell was calm and impressed with his surges forward , " declared klinsmann .

although the youth stars have added vim to germany 's attack , the defense has been rather shaky .
mertesacker has caused a penalty in both of his last two matches with the national team .

germany has benefited greatly , however , from the new youth players up front .
fc cologne striker podolski woke up on thursday to find his picture plastered across the newspapers after scoring a hat-trick in germany 's 4-2 friendly win over south africa .
the 20-year-old podolski opened the scoring with a delightful chip on 12 minutes and then showed his killer instinct to score twice inside seven minutes to record a first international hat-trick .
" podolski phenomenom , " headlined kicker magazine .
" the cologne star scores three to compensate for shaky defense . "
klinsmann chose to start ' prince poldi ' on the substitutes ' bench for the recent 2-0 defeat by slovakia and the media claimed it would be folly to do that again .
" super poldi , " declared bild daily .
" klinsmann , never leave him out again . "
podolski , born in the polish city of gliwice , has now scored an impressive 10 goals in 17 internationals .
" it does not matter whether i am in the starting line-up or on the substitutes ' bench - i just want to score my goals , " explained podolski .

" it is irresponsible to hype up young players such as lukas podolski , " deisler said .

germany defeated south africa 4-2 in wednesday 's friendly at the weserstadion in bremen and minus 35-year-old goalkeeper jens lehmann , the team had an average age of just under 23 .
" as otto rehhagel used to say there is no such thing as old and young players but good and bad ones , " explained klinsmann .
" if the young players are better they are going to play . "
klinsmann handed full debuts to 19-year-old duo patrick sinkiewitz and marcell jansen despite limited experience in the bundesliga .
the 1990 world cup victor felt the gamble was a success .
" marcell was calm and impressed with his surges forward , " declared klinsmann .
" patrick was also cool and is another alternative in central defense . "
inexperience not a concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borussia mönchengladbach defender jansen and fc cologne starlet sinkiewitz have played less than 30 bundesliga games between them but inexperience does not concern klinsmann .

although the youth stars have added vim to germany 's attack , the defense has been rather shaky .
mertesacker has caused a penalty in both of his last two matches with the national team .
but klinsmann has left seasoned internationals such as liverpool midfielder dietmar hamann and borussia dortmund defender christian worns on the sidelines and it is unclear what role , if any , they will play at the 2006 world cup .

germany has benefited greatly , however , from the new youth players up front .
fc cologne striker podolski woke up on thursday to find his picture plastered across the newspapers after scoring a hat-trick in germany 's 4-2 friendly win over south africa .
the 20-year-old podolski opened the scoring with a delightful chip on 12 minutes and then showed his killer instinct to score twice inside seven minutes to record a first international hat-trick .
" podolski phenomenom , " headlined kicker magazine .
" the cologne star scores three to compensate for shaky defense . "
klinsmann chose to start ' prince poldi ' on the substitutes ' bench for the recent 2-0 defeat by slovakia and the media claimed it would be folly to do that again .
" super poldi , " declared bild daily .
" klinsmann , never leave him out again . "
podolski , born in the polish city of gliwice , has now scored an impressive 10 goals in 17 internationals .
" it does not matter whether i am in the starting line-up or on the substitutes ' bench - i just want to score my goals , " explained podolski .
" the coach told me to go out there and get my goals and it worked .
the slovakia defeat was a setback but we are now back on track . "

" it is irresponsible to hype up young players such as lukas podolski , " deisler said .
" they get built up and then knocked down later on . "
klinsmann hailed podolski 's perfomance but admitted the younger players all needed the arm-around-the-shoulder treatment .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's electronics industry , which has been plagued by profit concerns and price falls in recent years , had pinned high hopes on the ifa which has improved continually every year in terms of attracting heavyweight exhibitors .
this year over 1,200 of them from 40 countries were vying for attention with their latest products .
more professionals , more orders according to stehle , even the specialized trade center at the fair was teeming with visitors this year , demand was high and buyers placed record number of orders .
" there were more industry professionals this year at the ifa than say two years ago , " said stehle who added that even the levels of know-how and expertise among them were significantly higher .
" the volume of orders was correspondingly higher - estimated at more than 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.1 billion -rrb- as compared to about 2.4 billion euros in 2003 , " said stehle .
though the estimates have not yet been officially confirmed and put down on paper , stehle said the industry was confident that the final figures on orders and visitors would make this year 's ifa stand out in the fair 's 81-year history .
innovation the key word one of the obvious trends at this year 's ifa was the presence of overwhelming plasma and lcd flat screens with the logo " hd-ready " in a reference to high-definition televisions -lrb- hdtv -rrb- , which are all the rage in the industry .
bildunterschrift : several german television stations announced at the ifa that they would broadcast their programs in the new standard starting this autumn .
the electronics industry is hoping that the new trend will provide a much-needed boost to the upcoming christmas retail sales and help sluggish consumer spending in the country .
" twenty-one percent of all households in germany want to buy a flat-screen television in the next 24 months , " said hans-joachim kamp , chairman of the consumer electronics trade association .
" i think this underpins the positive trend and the positive mood in the consumer electronics area . "
stehle confirmed that the continued digitalization of electronic gadgets right from radios to mobile phones and home entertainment was a promising development and that it would also raise demand for other digital products such as dvds and video players , cameras and mp3 players .
" the consumer electronics segment is overwhelmingly innovative .
we have around 10,000 new products each year and right now we seem to have the finger on the pulse of the consumers , " said stehle .
" our products are fun , they look good , they offer value and finally , that 's what 's honored by customers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.09.2005 eu states break chinese clothes deadlock großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu gates are now open to chinese textiles eu member states have given the green light to a deal to release millions of cheap chinese clothes blocked at european ports as early as next week .
but the move still has n't allayed deeper worries on both sides . delegations from the 25 eu governments reached agreement here two days after eu trade commissioner peter mandelson had struck a trade deal to resolve an embarrassing standoff which has seriously strained ties with beijing .
" we would hope that if everything goes smoothly .. that by the middle of next week the goods that are currently blocked in customs can be unblocked , " said a spokesman for the european commission .
millions of chinese textiles , including pullovers , trousers , blouses , t-shirts , bras and tons of flax yarn , have been impounded at european ports because they exceed import quotas agreed by both sides in june .
bildunterschrift : boxes of blockaded goods from china are stacked in a warehouse at the port of antwerp in antwerp , belgium the political agreement , reached by ambassadors from eu member states on wednesday , opened the way for experts to work on a legal document that will allow the blocked clothes to be released by customs .
mandelson praised the move .
" i am very pleased that member states have approved the agreement with china and the commission 's proposal for unblocking textile imports from china , " he said in a statement from india , where he was taking part in an eu-india summit . " this solidarity now allows the commission to put in place the legal instrument which should allow the member states to begin unblocking goods next week , " he added .
dispute strains ties between eu , china as well as straining relations between the eu and china , the dispute had led to warnings that a shortage of the goods could cause prices to rise and hit european importers and retailers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the question of how to deal with the logjam divided eu members , roughly between southern european countries whose manufacturers fear the flood of cheap imports and northern countries where retailers want fresh stocks .
about five eu states , including italy , spain and portugal , have balked at allowing the products into the bloc .
under the deal negotiated in beijing between mandelson and chinese commerce minister bo xilai , the eu and china will share the quota burden caused by the stockpiles . about half of the estimated 80 million textile products being held up will enter the eu outside the fixed quotas , while the other half will be added to china 's 2006 textile limit .
lasting solutions needed industry officials have welcomed the eu-china deal - but at least one key official warned that the chaotic scenes of the last month or two could happen again unless the eu commission gets a grip on the problem .
" we are happy with the short term solution , " said foreign trade association -lrb- fta -rrb- head ferry den hoed . but he added : " in the end it still can be chaos next year ...
we have large quantities blocked in warehouses in china , and the chinese are not issuing export licenses any more , " he said .
chinese officials have also warned that the deal remains a short-term fix to a long-term problem and that more lasting solutions were needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese models parade in outfits which use themes from the forbidden city , on a stage in front of the former imperial palace in beijing some chinese textile manufacturers have already started worrying about their future exports , according to the state-run xinhua news agency . " the export quotas for the second half of the year have almost been used up and if we start using next year 's quotas , we will face greater pressure next year , " said zhu hongjun , a senior manager with peiluocheng group in zhejiang .
in spain , finance minister pedro solbes said he believed that the compromise deal did not deal with the crux of the problem . he said that it " does not take into account in a balanced way the whole of the problem " .
leading spanish textile firms including inditex , whose flagship store is the retail chain zara , had earlier said they were " radically " opposed to the proposal . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu and china resolve textile dispute the eu-chinese summit in beijing , boosted by the settlement of the dispute over import quotas for chinese textiles , kicked off to an optimistic start on monday .

but the move still has n't allayed deeper worries on both sides . delegations from the 25 eu governments reached agreement here two days after eu trade commissioner peter mandelson had struck a trade deal to resolve an embarrassing standoff which has seriously strained ties with beijing .
" we would hope that if everything goes smoothly .. that by the middle of next week the goods that are currently blocked in customs can be unblocked , " said a spokesman for the european commission .
millions of chinese textiles , including pullovers , trousers , blouses , t-shirts , bras and tons of flax yarn , have been impounded at european ports because they exceed import quotas agreed by both sides in june .
bildunterschrift : boxes of blockaded goods from china are stacked in a warehouse at the port of antwerp in antwerp , belgium the political agreement , reached by ambassadors from eu member states on wednesday , opened the way for experts to work on a legal document that will allow the blocked clothes to be released by customs .
mandelson praised the move .
" i am very pleased that member states have approved the agreement with china and the commission 's proposal for unblocking textile imports from china , " he said in a statement from india , where he was taking part in an eu-india summit . " this solidarity now allows the commission to put in place the legal instrument which should allow the member states to begin unblocking goods next week , " he added .
dispute strains ties between eu , china as well as straining relations between the eu and china , the dispute had led to warnings that a shortage of the goods could cause prices to rise and hit european importers and retailers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the question of how to deal with the logjam divided eu members , roughly between southern european countries whose manufacturers fear the flood of cheap imports and northern countries where retailers want fresh stocks .
about five eu states , including italy , spain and portugal , have balked at allowing the products into the bloc .
under the deal negotiated in beijing between mandelson and chinese commerce minister bo xilai , the eu and china will share the quota burden caused by the stockpiles . about half of the estimated 80 million textile products being held up will enter the eu outside the fixed quotas , while the other half will be added to china 's 2006 textile limit .
lasting solutions needed industry officials have welcomed the eu-china deal - but at least one key official warned that the chaotic scenes of the last month or two could happen again unless the eu commission gets a grip on the problem .
" we are happy with the short term solution , " said foreign trade association -lrb- fta -rrb- head ferry den hoed . but he added : " in the end it still can be chaos next year ...
we have large quantities blocked in warehouses in china , and the chinese are not issuing export licenses any more , " he said .
chinese officials have also warned that the deal remains a short-term fix to a long-term problem and that more lasting solutions were needed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 08.09.2005 india-eu argue over shrimp and wine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india says the eu is blocking shrimp imports despite an upgraded status for india as a trade partner and a new airbus deal on the table , india and eu squabbled over market access . the european union wednesday called on india to open its markets to agricultural products like wine , while india shot back that the 25-nation block should not be so fussy on rules for shrimp imports . " i believe sincerely that india will be a winner from greater openness , " european union trade commissioner peter mandelson told a gathering of business leaders at an india-eu summit . india 's minister for commerce and industry , kamal nath , however , told the business leaders that the european union is using non-tariff barriers to block imports from india such as shrimps and herbal remedies . " peter is badgering us that we are not giving them market access , " he said . india wants farm subsidies cut at an india-eu business summit attended by british prime minister tony blair , who holds the six-month eu presidency , and indian prime minister manmohan singh , the issue of farm subsidies was raised again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more access for european wine , please onkar kanwar , president of the federation of indian chambers of commerce and industry , said the 320 billion dollars the eu spends a year on farm subsidies should be cut so indian farmers can sell into the market . " you need exactly what we produce , " kanwar said . singh also raised the farm subsidy issue and that of non-tariff barriers preventing the sale of farm products from india , which he said was crucial to lifting millions out of poverty here . " i believe there is a perception in indian trade and industry circles that the european market is becoming increasingly difficult to penetrate .
as tariff barriers disintegrate , non-tariff barrier suddenly come up , " singh said . " india is one of the largest producers of agricultural commodities ... the famous basmati rice and the equally famous darjeeling tea ... but many of these are also products which find some form of discrimination and trade protection " in the eu . " blair did not discuss the issue .
in june , he angered some european leaders with calls for cuts in farm export subsidies , warning that failure to make progress would harm world trade talks in december . both want increased trade the eu is india 's largest trading partner and the destination for a quarter of indian exports .
however , mandelson noted that efforts by both sides should be to increase trade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite dispute , meetings are going very well , officials say " india is the eu 's 12th trading partner , a volume that stands at an impressive sounding 33 billion euros -lrb- $ 41.3 billion -rrb- , " mandelson said .
" impressive , that is , until you realize that the figure for korea is 48 billion -lrb- euros -rrb- , for russia 126 billion and for china 175 billion .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 08.09.2005 art provocateurs steal the show großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bonvicini 's sado-maso darkroom : shocking ?
conceived as a rival to the british turner prize , the nationalgalerie prize for young art might pack the same kind of sensational punch we 've come to expect from the turner , but that ’ s where the similarities end . at the recent opening of the exhibition showcasing the artworks nominated for the nationalgalerie prize for young art at the hamburger bahnhof museum in berlin , curator joachim jäger compared monica bonvicini ’ s installation to an abu ghraib cell , while her fellow contestant john bock gave a performance that included getting pushed through a window by an angry " spectator " before leading the incredulous audience out of the gallery and jumping off a nearby bridge onto a waiting boat -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the four finalists for the prize set to be announced in late september are certainly not your standard museum fare .
bildunterschrift : john bock the emperor 's new clothes ?
in this respect , the nationalgalerie prize has taken an obvious cue from the 20-year-old turner - which , the critics have often argued , has a habit of favoring controversy over content .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : damian hirst 's shark floating in a tank of formaldehyde with a list of celebrity candidates ranging from damien hirst and his cows cut in half , tracey emin and her unmade bed to the cross-dressing grayson perry , the turner shortlist has more often than not boasted a generous dose of scandal that never failed to get the nation talking .
what tends to ruffle public feathers is less a matter of shocking content than a perceived lack of content .
it can be counted on to generate an annual media row , usually focused on that old chestnut : is it art ?
edgy but educational bildunterschrift : angela bulloch 's the disenchanted forest already dubbed " the german turner " and worth almost as much , the 50,000 euro -lrb- $ 62,000 -rrb- nationalgalerie prize for young art might be trying a similar tack in its stated aim of bringing art to a wider public , but with a short-list that includes bonvicini , bock , anri sala and angela bulloch -lrb- photo -rrb- , it 's giving a platform to four artists with established international reputations - even if they hardly deliver feel-good family fun .
" contemporary art attracts far less attention from the general public than 20th century modern art , for example , " said joachim jäger .
" it 's often edgy , provocative , and therefore not always instantly popular .
the competitive nature of the prize , as well as the ensuing publicity , is one way of raising awareness of contemporary art and arousing public curiosity . "
it 's also educational .
" it might be incomprehensible until you make an effort to get into it , " said peter raue from the friends of the nationalgalerie .
" but then it ’ s all very illuminating .
and ultimately , it should be a people ’ s prize . "
art as an event in any case , according to ursula prinz , deputy director at the german capital 's esteemed berlinische galerie , just about all contemporary art could be described as shocking .
" provocation is an integral part of today 's art , " she said .
" we live in an event culture , everything has to create a stir . "
many feel it 's a trend that raises the stakes for the average museum , and perhaps leaves the public bored by anything less than outrage .
" it does mean a lot of less spectacular work falls through the net , which is a little regrettable , " said prinz .
" less high-profile projects don ’ t get a look in .
art as an event is the order of the day , to the detriment of less flashy art . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but attention-grabbing art is n't all bad .
" events like this prize are one way of getting people into museums in the first place , " she admitted .
" in that sense , they definitely don ’ t hurt . "

the four finalists for the prize set to be announced in late september are certainly not your standard museum fare .
bildunterschrift : john bock the emperor 's new clothes ?
in this respect , the nationalgalerie prize has taken an obvious cue from the 20-year-old turner - which , the critics have often argued , has a habit of favoring controversy over content .

" contemporary art attracts far less attention from the general public than 20th century modern art , for example , " said joachim jäger .
" it 's often edgy , provocative , and therefore not always instantly popular .
the competitive nature of the prize , as well as the ensuing publicity , is one way of raising awareness of contemporary art and arousing public curiosity . "

art as an event in any case , according to ursula prinz , deputy director at the german capital 's esteemed berlinische galerie , just about all contemporary art could be described as shocking .
" provocation is an integral part of today 's art , " she said .
" we live in an event culture , everything has to create a stir . "
many feel it 's a trend that raises the stakes for the average museum , and perhaps leaves the public bored by anything less than outrage .
" it does mean a lot of less spectacular work falls through the net , which is a little regrettable , " said prinz .

conceived as a rival to the british turner prize , the nationalgalerie prize for young art might pack the same kind of sensational punch we 've come to expect from the turner , but that ’ s where the similarities end . at the recent opening of the exhibition showcasing the artworks nominated for the nationalgalerie prize for young art at the hamburger bahnhof museum in berlin , curator joachim jäger compared monica bonvicini ’ s installation to an abu ghraib cell , while her fellow contestant john bock gave a performance that included getting pushed through a window by an angry " spectator " before leading the incredulous audience out of the gallery and jumping off a nearby bridge onto a waiting boat -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the four finalists for the prize set to be announced in late september are certainly not your standard museum fare .
bildunterschrift : john bock the emperor 's new clothes ?
in this respect , the nationalgalerie prize has taken an obvious cue from the 20-year-old turner - which , the critics have often argued , has a habit of favoring controversy over content .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : damian hirst 's shark floating in a tank of formaldehyde with a list of celebrity candidates ranging from damien hirst and his cows cut in half , tracey emin and her unmade bed to the cross-dressing grayson perry , the turner shortlist has more often than not boasted a generous dose of scandal that never failed to get the nation talking .
what tends to ruffle public feathers is less a matter of shocking content than a perceived lack of content .
it can be counted on to generate an annual media row , usually focused on that old chestnut : is it art ?
edgy but educational bildunterschrift : angela bulloch 's the disenchanted forest already dubbed " the german turner " and worth almost as much , the 50,000 euro -lrb- $ 62,000 -rrb- nationalgalerie prize for young art might be trying a similar tack in its stated aim of bringing art to a wider public , but with a short-list that includes bonvicini , bock , anri sala and angela bulloch -lrb- photo -rrb- , it 's giving a platform to four artists with established international reputations - even if they hardly deliver feel-good family fun .
" contemporary art attracts far less attention from the general public than 20th century modern art , for example , " said joachim jäger .
" it 's often edgy , provocative , and therefore not always instantly popular .
the competitive nature of the prize , as well as the ensuing publicity , is one way of raising awareness of contemporary art and arousing public curiosity . "
it 's also educational .
" it might be incomprehensible until you make an effort to get into it , " said peter raue from the friends of the nationalgalerie .
" but then it ’ s all very illuminating .
and ultimately , it should be a people ’ s prize . "
art as an event in any case , according to ursula prinz , deputy director at the german capital 's esteemed berlinische galerie , just about all contemporary art could be described as shocking .
" provocation is an integral part of today 's art , " she said .
" we live in an event culture , everything has to create a stir . "
many feel it 's a trend that raises the stakes for the average museum , and perhaps leaves the public bored by anything less than outrage .
" it does mean a lot of less spectacular work falls through the net , which is a little regrettable , " said prinz .
" less high-profile projects don ’ t get a look in .
art as an event is the order of the day , to the detriment of less flashy art . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but attention-grabbing art is n't all bad .
" events like this prize are one way of getting people into museums in the first place , " she admitted .
" in that sense , they definitely don ’ t hurt . "
conceptual rather than figurative old-school craft certainly is n't what the prize is about .
featuring performance , video and installation , the money is clearly on experimentation - another unmistakable nod to the turner , which has always been conceptual rather than figurative .
and if the prize attracts similar media frenzy , the entire german art world gets to benefit from the hype .
" everyone always wants to know who 's won the turner , " pointed out ursula prinz .
" so if one can achieve the same effect in germany , it would be a boon for everyone . "
individual , international but even though the turner has always triggered fierce opinions , much of the attention it attracts is unfavorable .
weird art is great in theory , but does n't it ultimately alienate the public ?
according to the german turner ’ s organizers , they have all their bases covered .
" shock tactics have the advantage of mass appeal , but also the disadvantage of reflecting a very one-sided facet to contemporary art , " said jäger .
" the nationalgalerie prize is aiming to be a crowd-puller , but it also takes a serious look at present-day art .
the jury 's selection represents four very different positions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anri sala it also represents different nationalities .
unlike the turner , which focuses on artists living and working in britain but often only shortlists british artists , the nationalgalerie prize has a very international slew of nominations .
in fact , german artists are conspicuously absent , as is traditional painting - so anyone expecting a sample of the fashionable new leipzig school , for example , will be sorely disappointed .
but it all goes to show just how open-minded the german art scene is .
" the prize turns the spotlight on international art developments in germany , rather than just german art , " pointed out jäger .

conceived as a rival to the british turner prize , the nationalgalerie prize for young art might pack the same kind of sensational punch we 've come to expect from the turner , but that ’ s where the similarities end . at the recent opening of the exhibition showcasing the artworks nominated for the nationalgalerie prize for young art at the hamburger bahnhof museum in berlin , curator joachim jäger compared monica bonvicini ’ s installation to an abu ghraib cell , while her fellow contestant john bock gave a performance that included getting pushed through a window by an angry " spectator " before leading the incredulous audience out of the gallery and jumping off a nearby bridge onto a waiting boat -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the four finalists for the prize set to be announced in late september are certainly not your standard museum fare .
bildunterschrift : john bock the emperor 's new clothes ?
in this respect , the nationalgalerie prize has taken an obvious cue from the 20-year-old turner - which , the critics have often argued , has a habit of favoring controversy over content .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : damian hirst 's shark floating in a tank of formaldehyde with a list of celebrity candidates ranging from damien hirst and his cows cut in half , tracey emin and her unmade bed to the cross-dressing grayson perry , the turner shortlist has more often than not boasted a generous dose of scandal that never failed to get the nation talking .
what tends to ruffle public feathers is less a matter of shocking content than a perceived lack of content .
it can be counted on to generate an annual media row , usually focused on that old chestnut : is it art ?
edgy but educational bildunterschrift : angela bulloch 's the disenchanted forest already dubbed " the german turner " and worth almost as much , the 50,000 euro -lrb- $ 62,000 -rrb- nationalgalerie prize for young art might be trying a similar tack in its stated aim of bringing art to a wider public , but with a short-list that includes bonvicini , bock , anri sala and angela bulloch -lrb- photo -rrb- , it 's giving a platform to four artists with established international reputations - even if they hardly deliver feel-good family fun .
" contemporary art attracts far less attention from the general public than 20th century modern art , for example , " said joachim jäger .
" it 's often edgy , provocative , and therefore not always instantly popular .
the competitive nature of the prize , as well as the ensuing publicity , is one way of raising awareness of contemporary art and arousing public curiosity . "
it 's also educational .
" it might be incomprehensible until you make an effort to get into it , " said peter raue from the friends of the nationalgalerie .
" but then it ’ s all very illuminating .
and ultimately , it should be a people ’ s prize . "
art as an event in any case , according to ursula prinz , deputy director at the german capital 's esteemed berlinische galerie , just about all contemporary art could be described as shocking .
" provocation is an integral part of today 's art , " she said .
" we live in an event culture , everything has to create a stir . "
many feel it 's a trend that raises the stakes for the average museum , and perhaps leaves the public bored by anything less than outrage .
" it does mean a lot of less spectacular work falls through the net , which is a little regrettable , " said prinz .
" less high-profile projects don ’ t get a look in .
art as an event is the order of the day , to the detriment of less flashy art . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but attention-grabbing art is n't all bad .
" events like this prize are one way of getting people into museums in the first place , " she admitted .
" in that sense , they definitely don ’ t hurt . "

the oktoberfest catwalk can be all yours . what a summer it 's been in bavaria !
first , the sun-shy eu bureaucrats wanted to ban plunging necklines from beer gardens and deprive bavarian waitresses of their natural joie de vivre .
luckily , the european parliament voted against the sun-protection bill , and just as the bavarians wanted to breathe a sigh of relief , another calamity struck the proud state . two fashion designers decided to challenge the role of the lederhosen - traditional german leather pants - as the male fashion accessory a la mode at the munich oktoberfest .
they invented a skirt for beer-drinking guys . what is this world coming to ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old school frocks for guys munich designers doreen anders and robert landinger , both in their mid-thirties , are promoting skirts for male drinkers as a more comfortable alternative to the tight leather pants . " with all that beer flowing at the fest you need to make sure your belly is free to take it in , " landinger said . the duo has been designing skirts for men for four years .
in 2003 , their creations were featured in the exhibition " bravehearts - men in skirts " at the new york metropolitan museum of art .
and even though taking over the munich oktoberfest may prove to be more difficult than wiggling your way on the new york scene , the designers seem confident enough .
" i think they 're going to go down well , " landinger said .

coco , a coconut crab , was one of four brought from a fish market in tokyo to the uk .
the crustacean has now been given a home at weymouth sea life park .
coconut crabs , also called robber crabs , grow as big as a cat and are the largest land crabs in the world .
they have strong claws which they use to open coconuts or even break into food cans .
tony barlow , supervisor at the park , said : " he 's a bit of a giant , and with the strength of his claws we took no chances when introducing him to his new home , letting him find his own way out of his transport box rather than lifting him out . "
mr barlow said the crabs were the first of their kind to star at a british aquarium .
but the four would fight if not kept separately , so the other three crabs have been sent to marine centres in birmingham , scarborough and brighton .

tony barlow , supervisor at the park , said : " he 's a bit of a giant , and with the strength of his claws we took no chances when introducing him to his new home , letting him find his own way out of his transport box rather than lifting him out . "
mr barlow said the crabs were the first of their kind to star at a british aquarium .
but the four would fight if not kept separately , so the other three crabs have been sent to marine centres in birmingham , scarborough and brighton .

that elusive little bit of green where you may be able to soak up the summer sun - for a few weeks of the year at least - and even enjoy a sense of outdoor living can make a potential home all the more desirable .
but more and more of us are concreting over our front gardens either to create car spaces which avoid the cost of on-street parking , or simply to make them easier to maintain .
but environmentalists , and water companies , are against this trend claiming it adds to the problem of flooding .
hilary bennett , of thames water , said problems occur when the grass and earth is replaced and the rainfall runs off into man-made underground drains instead of soaking away naturally .
these are the green lungs of london and when they go it destroys the streetscape donnachadh mccarthy green campaigner " we do find that since more front gardens have been levelled off , water from them races into the surface water drainage systems .
" london has a combined drainage and sewer system so all this water can overload the sewers .
" this in turn can flood out of manholes in roads , private connecting drains in properties and then flood gardens and even homes with foul water which contains untreated sewage . "
but simon waller , senior sales negotiator at the shepherd 's bush branch of estate agents winkworth , in west london , said he would estimate a parking space could potentially increase the value of a house by £ 5,000 to £ 10,000 .
it can also save a potential buyer the cost of applying for planning permission and the building work entailed in adding a drop kerb .
but if a house buyer does not own a car , the space could prove worthless , he said .
mr mccarthy uses his front garden for mulching cuttings " of course , it depends on the location of the property and if you 've got a nice car that needs to be parked off the road .
" it obviously decreases the insurance payments on your car so perhaps we could look to the insurance industry to do something about it .
" a garden is one of the most significant things you consider when you value a property because of the english obsession with the outdoors , but unfortunately a front garden is of no material value . "
donnachadh mccarthy , author of saving the planet without costing the earth , says he believes his front garden , in camberwell , south london , has actually increased the value of his property because it improves the way it looks .
he said : " i 've got a wall creeper and a hedge and in the space between the wall and the hedge i mulch cuttings which also produces a little bit of food because wild garlic grows there . "
' natures drains ' he added : " it makes the house look much more inviting and friendly .
everybody who comes here thinks it 's a lovely little cottage when it 's just a two-up two-down . "
the drive to concrete over front gardens to provide a parking space was " destroying nature 's natural drainage system , which leads to flash flooding " , mr mccarthy added .
" these are the green lungs of london and when they go it destroys the streetscape . "
mr waller says that in shepherd 's bush the cost of installing a drop kerb can cost as much as £ 2000 .
added to this is the cost of the planning application and installing and buying the paving stones .
the cost of a residents parking permit in the area is just under £ 100 for 12 months , so to a buyer a ready-made space can be financially attractive in the long run .
' worsening the problem ' the london assembly 's environment committee is calling on the government to bring in legislation which would limit the number of gardens that can be turned into paved areas .
but jennifer bates , the london campaign 's co-ordinator for friends of the earth , says concrete gardens are just part of an overall problem which needs to be addressed .
she said : " as hurricane katrina has showed us , and as the experts predict , we are experiencing more extreme weather events and we need to be cutting carbon dioxide emissions that are contributing to global warming .
" clearly concreting over gardens or putting in more non-porous surfaces is just going to exacerbate flooding problems .
" we are going the wrong way , " she added , " we are worsening the problem from all ends . "

he said : " i 've got a wall creeper and a hedge and in the space between the wall and the hedge i mulch cuttings which also produces a little bit of food because wild garlic grows there . "
' natures drains ' he added : " it makes the house look much more inviting and friendly .
everybody who comes here thinks it 's a lovely little cottage when it 's just a two-up two-down . "
the drive to concrete over front gardens to provide a parking space was " destroying nature 's natural drainage system , which leads to flash flooding " , mr mccarthy added .
" these are the green lungs of london and when they go it destroys the streetscape . "
mr waller says that in shepherd 's bush the cost of installing a drop kerb can cost as much as £ 2000 .
added to this is the cost of the planning application and installing and buying the paving stones .
the cost of a residents parking permit in the area is just under £ 100 for 12 months , so to a buyer a ready-made space can be financially attractive in the long run .
' worsening the problem ' the london assembly 's environment committee is calling on the government to bring in legislation which would limit the number of gardens that can be turned into paved areas .
but jennifer bates , the london campaign 's co-ordinator for friends of the earth , says concrete gardens are just part of an overall problem which needs to be addressed .
she said : " as hurricane katrina has showed us , and as the experts predict , we are experiencing more extreme weather events and we need to be cutting carbon dioxide emissions that are contributing to global warming .
" clearly concreting over gardens or putting in more non-porous surfaces is just going to exacerbate flooding problems .
" we are going the wrong way , " she added , " we are worsening the problem from all ends . "

that elusive little bit of green where you may be able to soak up the summer sun - for a few weeks of the year at least - and even enjoy a sense of outdoor living can make a potential home all the more desirable .
but more and more of us are concreting over our front gardens either to create car spaces which avoid the cost of on-street parking , or simply to make them easier to maintain .

but simon waller , senior sales negotiator at the shepherd 's bush branch of estate agents winkworth , in west london , said he would estimate a parking space could potentially increase the value of a house by £ 5,000 to £ 10,000 .
it can also save a potential buyer the cost of applying for planning permission and the building work entailed in adding a drop kerb .

that elusive little bit of green where you may be able to soak up the summer sun - for a few weeks of the year at least - and even enjoy a sense of outdoor living can make a potential home all the more desirable .
but more and more of us are concreting over our front gardens either to create car spaces which avoid the cost of on-street parking , or simply to make them easier to maintain .
but environmentalists , and water companies , are against this trend claiming it adds to the problem of flooding .
hilary bennett , of thames water , said problems occur when the grass and earth is replaced and the rainfall runs off into man-made underground drains instead of soaking away naturally .
these are the green lungs of london and when they go it destroys the streetscape donnachadh mccarthy green campaigner " we do find that since more front gardens have been levelled off , water from them races into the surface water drainage systems .
" london has a combined drainage and sewer system so all this water can overload the sewers .
" this in turn can flood out of manholes in roads , private connecting drains in properties and then flood gardens and even homes with foul water which contains untreated sewage . "
but simon waller , senior sales negotiator at the shepherd 's bush branch of estate agents winkworth , in west london , said he would estimate a parking space could potentially increase the value of a house by £ 5,000 to £ 10,000 .
it can also save a potential buyer the cost of applying for planning permission and the building work entailed in adding a drop kerb .
but if a house buyer does not own a car , the space could prove worthless , he said .
mr mccarthy uses his front garden for mulching cuttings " of course , it depends on the location of the property and if you 've got a nice car that needs to be parked off the road .
" it obviously decreases the insurance payments on your car so perhaps we could look to the insurance industry to do something about it .
" a garden is one of the most significant things you consider when you value a property because of the english obsession with the outdoors , but unfortunately a front garden is of no material value . "
donnachadh mccarthy , author of saving the planet without costing the earth , says he believes his front garden , in camberwell , south london , has actually increased the value of his property because it improves the way it looks .
he said : " i 've got a wall creeper and a hedge and in the space between the wall and the hedge i mulch cuttings which also produces a little bit of food because wild garlic grows there . "
' natures drains ' he added : " it makes the house look much more inviting and friendly .
everybody who comes here thinks it 's a lovely little cottage when it 's just a two-up two-down . "
the drive to concrete over front gardens to provide a parking space was " destroying nature 's natural drainage system , which leads to flash flooding " , mr mccarthy added .

they will have lessons in who they can and can not serve as well as tips on how to head off alcohol-related violence .
the initiative is part of a community safety project which has seen the number of drink-fuelled injuries in the city cut by a fifth since 2002 .
organisers have warned that bars which break licensing laws could be fined or have their licences revoked .
the idea of giving bar staff specific advice on how to encourage responsible drinking - and catch out underage drinkers - was developed after researchers interviewed 800 people .
issues covered on course the law about alcohol and young people who can be refused drinks in licensed premises which drinks are controlled by law , how the strength of a drink is measured and what a unit of alcohol is the circumstances which may lead to violence on licensed premises and how trouble can be prevented how barpersons can help to promote social responsibility in the use of alcohol how to act responsibly over ' happy hours ' their findings suggest that alcohol-related problems in cardiff city centre are caused by a small minority of drinkers .
around 700 drinkers provided breath tests for the survey .
of these , 17 were three times over the drink-drive limit , while a quarter were within the limit .
the training , conducted by the british institute of inn-keeping awarding body , aims to reduce binge drinking and associated problems such as violence and anti-social behaviour .
the training aims to improve working practices to end the sale of alcohol to drunk or underage customers as well as to help bar staff when they are handling potentially difficult situations .
' losing licence ' the initiative marks an intervention by the lion 's breath research project , led by the cardiff community safety partnership and backed by police , cardiff university and the alcohol education and research council .
project chair , professor jonathan shepherd , said : " one key aim is to attempt to improve the working practices of the city 's licensees , which includes work around the mis-selling of alcohol to drunk or underage customers .
" both acts are illegal and can result in a licensee being fined and losing his / her licence .
" this is not what we want to see , as cardiff is largely a safe , vibrant and successful city .
" however , we are mindful that such alcohol sales can increase the level of danger faced by those being inappropriately served , other revellers and innocent bystanders who become the victims of alcohol-related violence . "
' night-time economy ' dr simon moore , from cardiff university , said its surveys found " excessive drunkenness , disorder and aggression " were exhibited by a minority .
" the vast majority of people enjoy the city 's pubs , clubs and restaurants and , on the whole , drink sensibly , " he added .
erica painter , from the cardiff community safety partnership , said the interviews were helping to establish " a picture of cardiff 's night-time economy " .
a south wales police spokesman added it was always looking for new ways to make cardiff safer .

here are some of the mobiles vying to take the place of the digital music player .
nokia n91 nokia is not a company that does things by halves and its forthcoming n91 is the heavyweight of the music mobiles in more ways than one .
n91 specs operating system : symbian series 60 triband : 900 , 1800 , 1900 camera : 2 megapixels talktime : up to 3-4 hours size : 113.1 x 55.2 x 23.5mm weight : 156g display : 262k colour screen memory : 4gb hard drive audio formats : mp3 , aac , aacplus , real , wav , wma , awb , amr , true tones , sp-midi the smartphone is the flagship of nokia 's new n series of multimedia handsets .
sporting a meaty 4gb hard drive , the handset can hold up to 3,000 tracks in aacplus format , more than enough for the daily commute to work .
the stainless steel exterior of the device has a solid feel to it .
but the n91 pays the price of being a chunky piece of gadgetry and is too heavy to slip into a shirt or trouser pocket .
at first glance , the handset looks more like an mp3 player than a phone .
the numeric keypad is tucked away beneath a set of multimedia buttons for music .
this slides down to reveal a dinky set of keys .
transferring music to the phone is child 's play using a standard usb cable .
the n91 pops up on the computer screen as hard drive and tracks can be dragged and dropped .
sound quality is top notch and can be tweaked with the eight-band equaliser .
even the handset 's speaker fares relatively well , though music lovers might want to stick to the headphones .
nokia seem to have thrown everything into the n91 .
it comes with all the internet , messaging and organiser functions typically found in series 60 smartphones , as well as bluetooth and wi-fi .
the two megapixel camera is the icing on the cake .
the n91 may well set the standard in music mobiles .
but it will not become widely available until early 2006 and is likely to come with a hefty price tag attached .
o2 xm the xm clamshell from o2 feels like the poor relation of the bunch of music mobiles .
the silver handset feels cheap and the sleek lines on the front are let down by a squarish back when the battery slots in .
o2 xm specs operating system : intel mobile media triband : 900 , 1800 , 1900 camera : 1.3 mega-pixels talktime : up to 4 hours size : 47 x 89 x 23.5mm weight : 90g display : 262k colour screen / 64k external colour screen memory : 64mb card and support for up to 1gb audio formats : mp3 , aacplus the compact handset packs a 1.3 megapixel camera and a small screen on the front , but lacks bluetooth or e-mail .
its saving grace is that it is a cinch to use , making the 193-page manual redundant .
the handset is the first to be powered by intel 's mobile media technology and it makes for a zippy performance .
the music player can be brought to life at the touch of a button .
handy play , rewind / fast-forward and stop buttons along the side of the handset make it easy to control .
the headphones are crisp and clear , but annoyingly the phone needs an adaptor to work with a standard 3.5mm jack .
the onboard speakers manage to squeeze out some healthy beats , though they are light on the bass .
the xm comes with a 64mb sd memory card but this is merely enough for a paltry 15 mp3 tunes , so a bigger capacity card is a necessary extra expense .
the music player is linked in to o2 's music download service .
the catalogue of 185,000 tracks is easy to browse and search , but is somewhat pricey at £ 1.50 a tune when compared with other online music stores .
the tracks come in aacplus format which take up less room than standard mp3 files .
but they are digitally locked to the handset so can only be played back on the xm .
o2 's xm packs a lot of multimedia functions into a handy-sized clamshell , but it is let down by the lightweight feel of the handset .
orange spv c550 the c550 is the latest in the range of windows smartphones from orange designed to double up as a handheld computer .
c550 specs operating system : smartphone 2004 triband : 900 , 1800 , 1900 camera : 1.3 mega-pixels talktime : up to 4 hours size : 113.1 x 55.2 x 22mm weight : display : 65k colour screen memory : internal 64mb , external minisd card audio formats : sp-midi / smf , wav , mp3 , amr , aac , wma running on microsoft smartphone 2004 , it takes a while to boot up .
once up and running , the c550 synchronises easily with a windows pc to transfer contacts , calendar dates and e-mails from one to the other .
what sets the c550 apart from earlier orange smartphones are four multimedia buttons at the centre of the brushed aluminium handset , beneath a large , bright screen .
the downside of packing so much into the top half of the phone is that the keypad is tightly packed .
fortunately a little joystick in the middle of the handset provides a easy way of getting around .
the main focus of this phone is clearly tunes , with orange touting it as " great for music " .
however the way the music set-up works is baffling .
by default , the multimedia buttons launch the orange music player .
these can be changed to open the windows media player .
the orange player links to an online store of some 300,000 tracks , at a cost of £ 1.50 .
however it will only play tracks bought and downloaded from orange to the handset , ignoring songs transferred to the phone from a computer .
these have to be played using windows media player .
the catch is that the windows player will not see the orange tracks as they are in a proprietary format .
the result is two playlists which are incompatible with each other , leading to a frustrating experience on a mobile specifically designed for music .
the onboard speakers are good enough .
but the phone does not use a standard 3.5mm jack and the earphones provided leave much to be desired .
in the end , the c550 works best as a smartphone for the young professional who might want to listen to some music on the way to a meeting , rather than as a replacement for a mp3 player .
sony ericsson w800i sony is counting on the appeal of its walkman brand to make its line-up of music mobiles stand out in the crowd .
w800i specs triband : 900 , 1800 , 1900 camera : 2 mega-pixels talktime : up to 9 hours size : 100 x 46 x 20.5mm weight : 99g display : 262k colour screen memory : internal 34mb , external 512mb memory stick audio formats : midi , amr , mp3 , aac , xmf , wav leading the charge is the w800i , the first in a new family of walkman phones from sony ericsson .
the colour combination of vanilla white and orange is obviously designed to appeal to those who like a bit of funkiness in their handsets .
the phone is similar to other recent sony ericsson handsets , with the shutter button , play / pause button , zoom / volume keys and even the memory stick bay in identical positions .
the key difference is the button just below the screen , providing a one-click link to the music player software .
the program will look familiar to a generation who has grown up with mp3 music players and it is child 's play to listen to music with just the press of one button .
the mobile comes with a generous 512mb external memory stick , with can store around 125 music tracks , the equivalent of 12 cds .
bundled with the handset comes sony 's own pc software to rip cds and transfer tracks to the phone .
but this can also be done by just dragging and dropping files to the phone as the computer recognises the memory card as an external hard drive .
sony should be applauded for including a pair of decent earphones with the mobile , but an adapter cable is needed to connect them to the phone .
music playback is on the flat side , but a fuller sound can be created by tinkering with the eq settings .
the w800i comes with a two megapixel digital camera which can take some remarkably good quality photos , given the size of the lens .
it also features bluetooth , and triband connectivity .
the walkman mobile is clearly aimed at the style-conscious clubber who wants to combine digital music and pictures in one easy-to-use phone .

o2 's xm packs a lot of multimedia functions into a handy-sized clamshell , but it is let down by the lightweight feel of the handset .
return to top orange spv c550 the c550 is the latest in the range of windows smartphones from orange designed to double up as a handheld computer .
c550 specs operating system : smartphone 2004 triband : 900 , 1800 , 1900 camera : 1.3 mega-pixels talktime : up to 4 hours size : 113.1 x 55.2 x 22mm weight : display : 65k colour screen memory : internal 64mb , external minisd card audio formats : sp-midi / smf , wav , mp3 , amr , aac , wma running on microsoft smartphone 2004 , it takes a while to boot up .
once up and running , the c550 synchronises easily with a windows pc to transfer contacts , calendar dates and e-mails from one to the other .
what sets the c550 apart from earlier orange smartphones are four multimedia buttons at the centre of the brushed aluminium handset , beneath a large , bright screen .
the downside of packing so much into the top half of the phone is that the keypad is tightly packed .
fortunately a little joystick in the middle of the handset provides a easy way of getting around .
the main focus of this phone is clearly tunes , with orange touting it as " great for music " .
however the way the music set-up works is baffling .
by default , the multimedia buttons launch the orange music player .
these can be changed to open the windows media player .
the orange player links to an online store of some 300,000 tracks , at a cost of £ 1.50 .
however it will only play tracks bought and downloaded from orange to the handset , ignoring songs transferred to the phone from a computer .
these have to be played using windows media player .
the catch is that the windows player will not see the orange tracks as they are in a proprietary format .
the result is two playlists which are incompatible with each other , leading to a frustrating experience on a mobile specifically designed for music .
the onboard speakers are good enough .
but the phone does not use a standard 3.5mm jack and the earphones provided leave much to be desired .
in the end , the c550 works best as a smartphone for the young professional who might want to listen to some music on the way to a meeting , rather than as a replacement for a mp3 player .
return to top sony ericsson w800i sony is counting on the appeal of its walkman brand to make its line-up of music mobiles stand out in the crowd .
w800i specs triband : 900 , 1800 , 1900 camera : 2 mega-pixels talktime : up to 9 hours size : 100 x 46 x 20.5mm weight : 99g display : 262k colour screen memory : internal 34mb , external 512mb memory stick audio formats : midi , amr , mp3 , aac , xmf , wav leading the charge is the w800i , the first in a new family of walkman phones from sony ericsson .
the colour combination of vanilla white and orange is obviously designed to appeal to those who like a bit of funkiness in their handsets .
the phone is similar to other recent sony ericsson handsets , with the shutter button , play / pause button , zoom / volume keys and even the memory stick bay in identical positions .
the key difference is the button just below the screen , providing a one-click link to the music player software .
the program will look familiar to a generation who has grown up with mp3 music players and it is child 's play to listen to music with just the press of one button .
the mobile comes with a generous 512mb external memory stick , with can store around 125 music tracks , the equivalent of 12 cds .
bundled with the handset comes sony 's own pc software to rip cds and transfer tracks to the phone .
but this can also be done by just dragging and dropping files to the phone as the computer recognises the memory card as an external hard drive .
sony should be applauded for including a pair of decent earphones with the mobile , but an adapter cable is needed to connect them to the phone .
music playback is on the flat side , but a fuller sound can be created by tinkering with the eq settings .
the w800i comes with a two megapixel digital camera which can take some remarkably good quality photos , given the size of the lens .
it also features bluetooth , and triband connectivity .
the walkman mobile is clearly aimed at the style-conscious clubber who wants to combine digital music and pictures in one easy-to-use phone .

here are some of the mobiles vying to take the place of the digital music player .
nokia n91 o2 xm orange spv c550 sony ericsson w800i nokia n91 nokia is not a company that does things by halves and its forthcoming n91 is the heavyweight of the music mobiles in more ways than one .
n91 specs operating system : symbian series 60 triband : 900 , 1800 , 1900 camera : 2 megapixels talktime : up to 3-4 hours size : 113.1 x 55.2 x 23.5mm weight : 156g display : 262k colour screen memory : 4gb hard drive audio formats : mp3 , aac , aacplus , real , wav , wma , awb , amr , true tones , sp-midi the smartphone is the flagship of nokia 's new n series of multimedia handsets .
sporting a meaty 4gb hard drive , the handset can hold up to 3,000 tracks in aacplus format , more than enough for the daily commute to work .
the stainless steel exterior of the device has a solid feel to it .
but the n91 pays the price of being a chunky piece of gadgetry and is too heavy to slip into a shirt or trouser pocket .
at first glance , the handset looks more like an mp3 player than a phone .
the numeric keypad is tucked away beneath a set of multimedia buttons for music .
this slides down to reveal a dinky set of keys .
transferring music to the phone is child 's play using a standard usb cable .
the n91 pops up on the computer screen as hard drive and tracks can be dragged and dropped .
sound quality is top notch and can be tweaked with the eight-band equaliser .
even the handset 's speaker fares relatively well , though music lovers might want to stick to the headphones .
nokia seem to have thrown everything into the n91 .
it comes with all the internet , messaging and organiser functions typically found in series 60 smartphones , as well as bluetooth and wi-fi .
the two megapixel camera is the icing on the cake .
the n91 may well set the standard in music mobiles .
but it will not become widely available until early 2006 and is likely to come with a hefty price tag attached .
return to top o2 xm the xm clamshell from o2 feels like the poor relation of the bunch of music mobiles .
the silver handset feels cheap and the sleek lines on the front are let down by a squarish back when the battery slots in .
o2 xm specs operating system : intel mobile media triband : 900 , 1800 , 1900 camera : 1.3 mega-pixels talktime : up to 4 hours size : 47 x 89 x 23.5mm weight : 90g display : 262k colour screen / 64k external colour screen memory : 64mb card and support for up to 1gb audio formats : mp3 , aacplus the compact handset packs a 1.3 megapixel camera and a small screen on the front , but lacks bluetooth or e-mail .
its saving grace is that it is a cinch to use , making the 193-page manual redundant .
the handset is the first to be powered by intel 's mobile media technology and it makes for a zippy performance .
the music player can be brought to life at the touch of a button .
handy play , rewind / fast-forward and stop buttons along the side of the handset make it easy to control .
the headphones are crisp and clear , but annoyingly the phone needs an adaptor to work with a standard 3.5mm jack .
the onboard speakers manage to squeeze out some healthy beats , though they are light on the bass .
the xm comes with a 64mb sd memory card but this is merely enough for a paltry 15 mp3 tunes , so a bigger capacity card is a necessary extra expense .
the music player is linked in to o2 's music download service .
the catalogue of 185,000 tracks is easy to browse and search , but is somewhat pricey at £ 1.50 a tune when compared with other online music stores .
the tracks come in aacplus format which take up less room than standard mp3 files .
but they are digitally locked to the handset so can only be played back on the xm .

w800i specs triband : 900 , 1800 , 1900 camera : 2 mega-pixels talktime : up to 9 hours size : 100 x 46 x 20.5mm weight : 99g display : 262k colour screen memory : internal 34mb , external 512mb memory stick audio formats : midi , amr , mp3 , aac , xmf , wav leading the charge is the w800i , the first in a new family of walkman phones from sony ericsson .
the colour combination of vanilla white and orange is obviously designed to appeal to those who like a bit of funkiness in their handsets .
the phone is similar to other recent sony ericsson handsets , with the shutter button , play / pause button , zoom / volume keys and even the memory stick bay in identical positions .
the key difference is the button just below the screen , providing a one-click link to the music player software .
the program will look familiar to a generation who has grown up with mp3 music players and it is child 's play to listen to music with just the press of one button .
the mobile comes with a generous 512mb external memory stick , with can store around 125 music tracks , the equivalent of 12 cds .
bundled with the handset comes sony 's own pc software to rip cds and transfer tracks to the phone .
but this can also be done by just dragging and dropping files to the phone as the computer recognises the memory card as an external hard drive .
sony should be applauded for including a pair of decent earphones with the mobile , but an adapter cable is needed to connect them to the phone .
music playback is on the flat side , but a fuller sound can be created by tinkering with the eq settings .
the w800i comes with a two megapixel digital camera which can take some remarkably good quality photos , given the size of the lens .
it also features bluetooth , and triband connectivity .
the walkman mobile is clearly aimed at the style-conscious clubber who wants to combine digital music and pictures in one easy-to-use phone .

here are some of the mobiles vying to take the place of the digital music player .
nokia n91 o2 xm orange spv c550 sony ericsson w800i nokia n91 nokia is not a company that does things by halves and its forthcoming n91 is the heavyweight of the music mobiles in more ways than one .
n91 specs operating system : symbian series 60 triband : 900 , 1800 , 1900 camera : 2 megapixels talktime : up to 3-4 hours size : 113.1 x 55.2 x 23.5mm weight : 156g display : 262k colour screen memory : 4gb hard drive audio formats : mp3 , aac , aacplus , real , wav , wma , awb , amr , true tones , sp-midi the smartphone is the flagship of nokia 's new n series of multimedia handsets .
sporting a meaty 4gb hard drive , the handset can hold up to 3,000 tracks in aacplus format , more than enough for the daily commute to work .
the stainless steel exterior of the device has a solid feel to it .
but the n91 pays the price of being a chunky piece of gadgetry and is too heavy to slip into a shirt or trouser pocket .
at first glance , the handset looks more like an mp3 player than a phone .
the numeric keypad is tucked away beneath a set of multimedia buttons for music .
this slides down to reveal a dinky set of keys .
transferring music to the phone is child 's play using a standard usb cable .
the n91 pops up on the computer screen as hard drive and tracks can be dragged and dropped .
sound quality is top notch and can be tweaked with the eight-band equaliser .
even the handset 's speaker fares relatively well , though music lovers might want to stick to the headphones .
nokia seem to have thrown everything into the n91 .
it comes with all the internet , messaging and organiser functions typically found in series 60 smartphones , as well as bluetooth and wi-fi .
the two megapixel camera is the icing on the cake .
the n91 may well set the standard in music mobiles .
but it will not become widely available until early 2006 and is likely to come with a hefty price tag attached .
return to top o2 xm the xm clamshell from o2 feels like the poor relation of the bunch of music mobiles .
the silver handset feels cheap and the sleek lines on the front are let down by a squarish back when the battery slots in .
o2 xm specs operating system : intel mobile media triband : 900 , 1800 , 1900 camera : 1.3 mega-pixels talktime : up to 4 hours size : 47 x 89 x 23.5mm weight : 90g display : 262k colour screen / 64k external colour screen memory : 64mb card and support for up to 1gb audio formats : mp3 , aacplus the compact handset packs a 1.3 megapixel camera and a small screen on the front , but lacks bluetooth or e-mail .
its saving grace is that it is a cinch to use , making the 193-page manual redundant .
the handset is the first to be powered by intel 's mobile media technology and it makes for a zippy performance .
the music player can be brought to life at the touch of a button .
handy play , rewind / fast-forward and stop buttons along the side of the handset make it easy to control .
the headphones are crisp and clear , but annoyingly the phone needs an adaptor to work with a standard 3.5mm jack .
the onboard speakers manage to squeeze out some healthy beats , though they are light on the bass .
the xm comes with a 64mb sd memory card but this is merely enough for a paltry 15 mp3 tunes , so a bigger capacity card is a necessary extra expense .
the music player is linked in to o2 's music download service .
the catalogue of 185,000 tracks is easy to browse and search , but is somewhat pricey at £ 1.50 a tune when compared with other online music stores .
the tracks come in aacplus format which take up less room than standard mp3 files .
but they are digitally locked to the handset so can only be played back on the xm .
o2 's xm packs a lot of multimedia functions into a handy-sized clamshell , but it is let down by the lightweight feel of the handset .
return to top orange spv c550 the c550 is the latest in the range of windows smartphones from orange designed to double up as a handheld computer .
c550 specs operating system : smartphone 2004 triband : 900 , 1800 , 1900 camera : 1.3 mega-pixels talktime : up to 4 hours size : 113.1 x 55.2 x 22mm weight : display : 65k colour screen memory : internal 64mb , external minisd card audio formats : sp-midi / smf , wav , mp3 , amr , aac , wma running on microsoft smartphone 2004 , it takes a while to boot up .
once up and running , the c550 synchronises easily with a windows pc to transfer contacts , calendar dates and e-mails from one to the other .
what sets the c550 apart from earlier orange smartphones are four multimedia buttons at the centre of the brushed aluminium handset , beneath a large , bright screen .
the downside of packing so much into the top half of the phone is that the keypad is tightly packed .
fortunately a little joystick in the middle of the handset provides a easy way of getting around .
the main focus of this phone is clearly tunes , with orange touting it as " great for music " .
however the way the music set-up works is baffling .
by default , the multimedia buttons launch the orange music player .
these can be changed to open the windows media player .
the orange player links to an online store of some 300,000 tracks , at a cost of £ 1.50 .
however it will only play tracks bought and downloaded from orange to the handset , ignoring songs transferred to the phone from a computer .
these have to be played using windows media player .
the catch is that the windows player will not see the orange tracks as they are in a proprietary format .
the result is two playlists which are incompatible with each other , leading to a frustrating experience on a mobile specifically designed for music .
the onboard speakers are good enough .
but the phone does not use a standard 3.5mm jack and the earphones provided leave much to be desired .
in the end , the c550 works best as a smartphone for the young professional who might want to listen to some music on the way to a meeting , rather than as a replacement for a mp3 player .

here are some of the mobiles vying to take the place of the digital music player .
nokia n91 o2 xm orange spv c550 sony ericsson w800i nokia n91 nokia is not a company that does things by halves and its forthcoming n91 is the heavyweight of the music mobiles in more ways than one .
n91 specs operating system : symbian series 60 triband : 900 , 1800 , 1900 camera : 2 megapixels talktime : up to 3-4 hours size : 113.1 x 55.2 x 23.5mm weight : 156g display : 262k colour screen memory : 4gb hard drive audio formats : mp3 , aac , aacplus , real , wav , wma , awb , amr , true tones , sp-midi the smartphone is the flagship of nokia 's new n series of multimedia handsets .
sporting a meaty 4gb hard drive , the handset can hold up to 3,000 tracks in aacplus format , more than enough for the daily commute to work .
the stainless steel exterior of the device has a solid feel to it .
but the n91 pays the price of being a chunky piece of gadgetry and is too heavy to slip into a shirt or trouser pocket .
at first glance , the handset looks more like an mp3 player than a phone .
the numeric keypad is tucked away beneath a set of multimedia buttons for music .
this slides down to reveal a dinky set of keys .
transferring music to the phone is child 's play using a standard usb cable .
the n91 pops up on the computer screen as hard drive and tracks can be dragged and dropped .
sound quality is top notch and can be tweaked with the eight-band equaliser .
even the handset 's speaker fares relatively well , though music lovers might want to stick to the headphones .
nokia seem to have thrown everything into the n91 .
it comes with all the internet , messaging and organiser functions typically found in series 60 smartphones , as well as bluetooth and wi-fi .
the two megapixel camera is the icing on the cake .
the n91 may well set the standard in music mobiles .
but it will not become widely available until early 2006 and is likely to come with a hefty price tag attached .
return to top o2 xm the xm clamshell from o2 feels like the poor relation of the bunch of music mobiles .
the silver handset feels cheap and the sleek lines on the front are let down by a squarish back when the battery slots in .
o2 xm specs operating system : intel mobile media triband : 900 , 1800 , 1900 camera : 1.3 mega-pixels talktime : up to 4 hours size : 47 x 89 x 23.5mm weight : 90g display : 262k colour screen / 64k external colour screen memory : 64mb card and support for up to 1gb audio formats : mp3 , aacplus the compact handset packs a 1.3 megapixel camera and a small screen on the front , but lacks bluetooth or e-mail .
its saving grace is that it is a cinch to use , making the 193-page manual redundant .
the handset is the first to be powered by intel 's mobile media technology and it makes for a zippy performance .
the music player can be brought to life at the touch of a button .
handy play , rewind / fast-forward and stop buttons along the side of the handset make it easy to control .
the headphones are crisp and clear , but annoyingly the phone needs an adaptor to work with a standard 3.5mm jack .
the onboard speakers manage to squeeze out some healthy beats , though they are light on the bass .
the xm comes with a 64mb sd memory card but this is merely enough for a paltry 15 mp3 tunes , so a bigger capacity card is a necessary extra expense .
the music player is linked in to o2 's music download service .
the catalogue of 185,000 tracks is easy to browse and search , but is somewhat pricey at £ 1.50 a tune when compared with other online music stores .
the tracks come in aacplus format which take up less room than standard mp3 files .
but they are digitally locked to the handset so can only be played back on the xm .
o2 's xm packs a lot of multimedia functions into a handy-sized clamshell , but it is let down by the lightweight feel of the handset .
return to top orange spv c550 the c550 is the latest in the range of windows smartphones from orange designed to double up as a handheld computer .
c550 specs operating system : smartphone 2004 triband : 900 , 1800 , 1900 camera : 1.3 mega-pixels talktime : up to 4 hours size : 113.1 x 55.2 x 22mm weight : display : 65k colour screen memory : internal 64mb , external minisd card audio formats : sp-midi / smf , wav , mp3 , amr , aac , wma running on microsoft smartphone 2004 , it takes a while to boot up .
once up and running , the c550 synchronises easily with a windows pc to transfer contacts , calendar dates and e-mails from one to the other .
what sets the c550 apart from earlier orange smartphones are four multimedia buttons at the centre of the brushed aluminium handset , beneath a large , bright screen .
the downside of packing so much into the top half of the phone is that the keypad is tightly packed .
fortunately a little joystick in the middle of the handset provides a easy way of getting around .
the main focus of this phone is clearly tunes , with orange touting it as " great for music " .
however the way the music set-up works is baffling .
by default , the multimedia buttons launch the orange music player .
these can be changed to open the windows media player .
the orange player links to an online store of some 300,000 tracks , at a cost of £ 1.50 .
however it will only play tracks bought and downloaded from orange to the handset , ignoring songs transferred to the phone from a computer .
these have to be played using windows media player .
the catch is that the windows player will not see the orange tracks as they are in a proprietary format .
the result is two playlists which are incompatible with each other , leading to a frustrating experience on a mobile specifically designed for music .
the onboard speakers are good enough .
but the phone does not use a standard 3.5mm jack and the earphones provided leave much to be desired .
in the end , the c550 works best as a smartphone for the young professional who might want to listen to some music on the way to a meeting , rather than as a replacement for a mp3 player .
return to top sony ericsson w800i sony is counting on the appeal of its walkman brand to make its line-up of music mobiles stand out in the crowd .
w800i specs triband : 900 , 1800 , 1900 camera : 2 mega-pixels talktime : up to 9 hours size : 100 x 46 x 20.5mm weight : 99g display : 262k colour screen memory : internal 34mb , external 512mb memory stick audio formats : midi , amr , mp3 , aac , xmf , wav leading the charge is the w800i , the first in a new family of walkman phones from sony ericsson .
the colour combination of vanilla white and orange is obviously designed to appeal to those who like a bit of funkiness in their handsets .
the phone is similar to other recent sony ericsson handsets , with the shutter button , play / pause button , zoom / volume keys and even the memory stick bay in identical positions .
the key difference is the button just below the screen , providing a one-click link to the music player software .
the program will look familiar to a generation who has grown up with mp3 music players and it is child 's play to listen to music with just the press of one button .
the mobile comes with a generous 512mb external memory stick , with can store around 125 music tracks , the equivalent of 12 cds .
bundled with the handset comes sony 's own pc software to rip cds and transfer tracks to the phone .
but this can also be done by just dragging and dropping files to the phone as the computer recognises the memory card as an external hard drive .
sony should be applauded for including a pair of decent earphones with the mobile , but an adapter cable is needed to connect them to the phone .
music playback is on the flat side , but a fuller sound can be created by tinkering with the eq settings .
the w800i comes with a two megapixel digital camera which can take some remarkably good quality photos , given the size of the lens .
it also features bluetooth , and triband connectivity .
the walkman mobile is clearly aimed at the style-conscious clubber who wants to combine digital music and pictures in one easy-to-use phone .

the bse sensitive index -lrb- sensex -rrb- rose immediately after trading opened .
the gains were led by india 's largest private company , reliance industries which rose by nearly 2 % , and the state-owned oil giant , ongc .
analysts say the boom is being spurred by foreign investors who are pumping money into the bombay stock market .
" there is a lot of money flowing in as investors are blindly buying stocks ... foreign investors too are buying in to emerging markets , " hemen kapadia , analyst with morpheus incorporated , told the bbc news website .
agriculture is doing well and that means rural india will have more spending power than before sunil choksey stockbroker " india tops that list . "
a good monsoon in most parts of india has also helped , say stockbrokers .
" agriculture is doing well and that means rural india will have more spending power than before , " says sushil choksey of rosy blue securities .
strong performance india 's economy , one of the fastest growing in the world , is forecast to grow by 7 % this year , despite concern over rising oil prices .
the strong market performance has come as a boost to india 's congress-led coalition government , which is under pressure from its communist allies to roll back some of its economic reform plans .
just over a year ago , when the party was voted to office , indian share prices recorded their biggest ever fall in a single day 's trading over concerns that the new government would stall economic reforms .
