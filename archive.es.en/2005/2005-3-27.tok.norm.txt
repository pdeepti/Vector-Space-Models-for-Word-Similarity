but it 's already under fire for working closely with turkey 's state religion authority . in only a few weeks the summer semester will begin at frankfurt 's johann wolfgang von goethe university and for the first time students will be able to pursue islamic studies at the college 's theological faculty .
mehmet emin köktas and two professors of protestant theology have been working on the curriculum for two years .
köktas , a turk , is able to teach in frankfurt thanks to an agreement signed between the university and the turkish presidium for religious affairs -lrb- diyanet -rrb- . criticism followed public announcement of the cooperation , alleging turkey meant to use the new degree program to influence the training of islamic scholars in germany .
but its supporters vehemently deny the turkish state plays any role in the project . diyanet , however , is a state agency , and it represents sunni islam as taught in secular turkey , a modern , non-fundamentalist form of islam - but that is strictly controlled by the government . but the dean of the university 's protestant theology department , stefan alkier , ca n't understand the criticism of the cooperation with diyanet .
on the contrary , he 's pleased that the deal to fund the position brought a renowned islamic scholar to his faculty . " we could have carried out the course of studies with our own resources , but it 's much more interesting for students that we have muslim professors , " alkier said .
he stressed that diyanet has no direct influence on who is appointed to the position .
while another new islamic studies course , in münster , focuses on training islamic teachers , students in the frankfurt program will concentrate on an academic examination of religion and receive normal master 's degrees . training imams bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but students could also use their degrees as the basis for becoming islamic teachers .
" then they would have academic training that makes them capable of taking part in a dialog , " alkier said , adding that students pursuing islamic studies will also be required to study judaism and christianity . köktas said frankfurt islamic studies graduates could have a positive influence on german society with its 3 million muslims .
he pointed out the imams in germany usually come here without being familiar with the culture or the language . " naturally our course of studies here is n't a genuine alternative .
we actually just want to teach students about islam .
but , in the future both germany and the turks in germany will desperately need such well-educated people , " köktas said .
" they will be experts on islam , islamic scholars who know germany .
that 's why i think that , in this respect , we will make a great contribution . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lessons about islam in a cologne school köktas suggested that frankfurt graduates could eventually end up teaching islam in school religion classes .
so far , only very few of germany 's states allow for classes on islam , but graduates may be able to apply for work in a project currently underway in north rhine-westphalia , where children in 100 schools receive islamic instruction in german . but job vacancies are n't yet a problem , since the first graduates wo n't complete their studies for at least four years . vedat acikgöz -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the battle for german muslim minds police raids on islamic schools may shake up fundamentalist cells , but officials agree that the right teachers are the best way to root out radical islamic leanings among germany 's muslim youth .

no , thank you großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britons feel her marriage to prince charles will weaken the monarchy two weeks before their wedding , britain 's prince charles and bride-to-be camilla parker bowles have received some bad news .
a survey revealed that the vast majority of britons do n't want camilla to become queen . charles and camilla 's quest to become man and wife has suffered a series of setbacks since they announced their plans to wed on april 8 .
there were questions of the legality of the civil ceremony , then the news that the queen and the duke of edinburgh would not be attending . next , the venue had to be switched from windsor castle to windsor 's town hall when it emerged the castle was not licensed for weddings . now , a poll for britain 's daily mail newspaper has found that while most britons want to retain the monarchy , few want camilla parker bowles to become queen when prince charles eventually takes the throne .
a whopping 73 percent said they do n't believe camilla should be queen , while 60 percent would even deny her the title her royal highness . the icm poll found 65 percent of the 511 people quizzed over the phone believe the monarchy will be weakened by the impending marriage , up from just 49 percent when the wedding was announced six weeks ago . the poll was conducted two days after prime minister tony blair 's government confirmed that camilla would officially become queen once charles is king , although she will be known as princess consort . little public interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the presence in souvenir shops across the country of royal wedding paraphernalia such as tea towels bearing a smiling charles and camilla , interest in the nuptials among the british public is relatively low .
almost 70 percent of the poll 's respondents said it was unlikely they 'd watch the event on television , compared to around 30 percent who said they would . many britons say they blame camilla 's long affair with charles for the break-up of his first marriage to the hugely popular princess diana , who died in a paris car crash in august 1997 . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de charles and camilla set to wed britain 's prince charles and his longtime companion camilla parker bowles are to marry , putting the official seal on a relationship that first blossomed 35 years ago .

there were questions of the legality of the civil ceremony , then the news that the queen and the duke of edinburgh would not be attending . next , the venue had to be switched from windsor castle to windsor 's town hall when it emerged the castle was not licensed for weddings . now , a poll for britain 's daily mail newspaper has found that while most britons want to retain the monarchy , few want camilla parker bowles to become queen when prince charles eventually takes the throne .
a whopping 73 percent said they do n't believe camilla should be queen , while 60 percent would even deny her the title her royal highness . the icm poll found 65 percent of the 511 people quizzed over the phone believe the monarchy will be weakened by the impending marriage , up from just 49 percent when the wedding was announced six weeks ago . the poll was conducted two days after prime minister tony blair 's government confirmed that camilla would officially become queen once charles is king , although she will be known as princess consort . little public interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the presence in souvenir shops across the country of royal wedding paraphernalia such as tea towels bearing a smiling charles and camilla , interest in the nuptials among the british public is relatively low .
almost 70 percent of the poll 's respondents said it was unlikely they 'd watch the event on television , compared to around 30 percent who said they would . many britons say they blame camilla 's long affair with charles for the break-up of his first marriage to the hugely popular princess diana , who died in a paris car crash in august 1997 . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de charles and camilla set to wed britain 's prince charles and his longtime companion camilla parker bowles are to marry , putting the official seal on a relationship that first blossomed 35 years ago .

" during the negotiations on starting accession talks between croatia and the european union , the case of gotovina overshadowed everything and it seemed that no one wanted to remember that zagreb has met all the other demands by the un court , " a european diplomat commented . " certainly in serbia there is a whole package of war crimes fugitives ' cases , including karadzic and mladic , and croatia has only one , but zagreb has to make the big step if it wants its full cooperation to be acknowledged , " another western diplomat said . karadzic and mladic , bosnian serb wartime political and military leaders respectively , remain at large since being charged in 1995 by the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- for alleged genocide and crimes committed during bosnia 's 1992-95 war . " in serbia 's case , now we have the situation that everyone is speaking about positive cooperation -lrb- with the icty -rrb- , while as far as croatia is concerned , everyone is talking of incomplete cooperation , " political analyst zeljko trkanjec told afp .
" in this context , croatia 's position is more difficult than it was before . " " in order to resolve this , the croatian government has to make the final move , simply break general gotovina 's support network and thus remove this last obstacle to its cooperation with the hague court , " he stressed . another analyst , zarko puhovski , pointed out that in belgrade , the view was emerging that croatia and former foe serbia , despite a big gap between the two former yugoslav republics , could eventually enter the eu together .

aides brought a microphone to the pope 's mouth , but despite italian media reports that he 'd been working with a speech therapist , he was unable to utter any words . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope john paul ii delivers an easter sunday blessing from his studio window overlooking st. peter 's square at the vatican , sunday , march 27 , 2005 .
the pope stayed at his window while his secretary of state , cardinal angelo sodano , read the " urbi et orbi " message to the crowds of pilgrims thronging the square below . many of the faithful who 'd traveled to rome for the easter celebrations were hoping the pope would finally break a public silence that has lasted two weeks since his discharge from hospital after a throat operation to ease his breathing .

no , thank you großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britons feel her marriage to prince charles will weaken the monarchy two weeks before their wedding , britain 's prince charles and bride-to-be camilla parker bowles have received some bad news .
a survey revealed that the vast majority of britons do n't want camilla to become queen . charles and camilla 's quest to become man and wife has suffered a series of setbacks since they announced their plans to wed on april 8 .
there were questions of the legality of the civil ceremony , then the news that the queen and the duke of edinburgh would not be attending . next , the venue had to be switched from windsor castle to windsor 's town hall when it emerged the castle was not licensed for weddings . now , a poll for britain 's daily mail newspaper has found that while most britons want to retain the monarchy , few want camilla parker bowles to become queen when prince charles eventually takes the throne .
a whopping 73 percent said they do n't believe camilla should be queen , while 60 percent would even deny her the title her royal highness . the icm poll found 65 percent of the 511 people quizzed over the phone believe the monarchy will be weakened by the impending marriage , up from just 49 percent when the wedding was announced six weeks ago . the poll was conducted two days after prime minister tony blair 's government confirmed that camilla would officially become queen once charles is king , although she will be known as princess consort . little public interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the presence in souvenir shops across the country of royal wedding paraphernalia such as tea towels bearing a smiling charles and camilla , interest in the nuptials among the british public is relatively low .
almost 70 percent of the poll 's respondents said it was unlikely they 'd watch the event on television , compared to around 30 percent who said they would . many britons say they blame camilla 's long affair with charles for the break-up of his first marriage to the hugely popular princess diana , who died in a paris car crash in august 1997 . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de charles and camilla set to wed britain 's prince charles and his longtime companion camilla parker bowles are to marry , putting the official seal on a relationship that first blossomed 35 years ago .

köktas , a turk , is able to teach in frankfurt thanks to an agreement signed between the university and the turkish presidium for religious affairs -lrb- diyanet -rrb- . criticism followed public announcement of the cooperation , alleging turkey meant to use the new degree program to influence the training of islamic scholars in germany .
but its supporters vehemently deny the turkish state plays any role in the project . diyanet , however , is a state agency , and it represents sunni islam as taught in secular turkey , a modern , non-fundamentalist form of islam - but that is strictly controlled by the government . but the dean of the university 's protestant theology department , stefan alkier , ca n't understand the criticism of the cooperation with diyanet .
on the contrary , he 's pleased that the deal to fund the position brought a renowned islamic scholar to his faculty . " we could have carried out the course of studies with our own resources , but it 's much more interesting for students that we have muslim professors , " alkier said .
he stressed that diyanet has no direct influence on who is appointed to the position .
while another new islamic studies course , in münster , focuses on training islamic teachers , students in the frankfurt program will concentrate on an academic examination of religion and receive normal master 's degrees . training imams bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but students could also use their degrees as the basis for becoming islamic teachers .
" then they would have academic training that makes them capable of taking part in a dialog , " alkier said , adding that students pursuing islamic studies will also be required to study judaism and christianity . köktas said frankfurt islamic studies graduates could have a positive influence on german society with its 3 million muslims .
he pointed out the imams in germany usually come here without being familiar with the culture or the language . " naturally our course of studies here is n't a genuine alternative .
we actually just want to teach students about islam .
but , in the future both germany and the turks in germany will desperately need such well-educated people , " köktas said .
" they will be experts on islam , islamic scholars who know germany .
that 's why i think that , in this respect , we will make a great contribution . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lessons about islam in a cologne school köktas suggested that frankfurt graduates could eventually end up teaching islam in school religion classes .
so far , only very few of germany 's states allow for classes on islam , but graduates may be able to apply for work in a project currently underway in north rhine-westphalia , where children in 100 schools receive islamic instruction in german . but job vacancies are n't yet a problem , since the first graduates wo n't complete their studies for at least four years . vedat acikgöz -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : the battle for german muslim minds police raids on islamic schools may shake up fundamentalist cells , but officials agree that the right teachers are the best way to root out radical islamic leanings among germany 's muslim youth .

king jigme singye wangchuk says the draft will be sent to all 530,000 citizens , asking for their views .
the proposed 34-article constitution outlines the role of the monarchy , clergy and the duties of the people .
bhutan 's chief justice told the bbc a referendum would be held at the end of the year to ratify the constitution .
steady progress the proposed code is the culmination of four years of preparation for democracy .
one of its suggestions is for a national council to govern the country that will be filled by members elected to the national assembly . "
the country is more important than the king " king jigme singye wangchuk the constitution will replace the royal decree of 1953 that gave the king absolute power .
chief justice sonam tobgye told the bbc that the 49-year-old king wanted all bhutan 's citizens to read the draft and send in their suggestions in good time .
the king told the country 's only newspaper kuensel : " the sovereignty , stability and well-being of the country must be placed above everything else .
the country is more important than the king . "
king wangchuk assumed the throne at the age 16 , the fourth ruler in the wangchuk dynasty that came to power in december 1907 .
the transition began four years ago when the king handed down powers of daily governance to a council of ministers and even empowered the national assembly to force a royal abdication if the motion was backed by three-quarters of its membership .
observers say bhutan 's slow but steady progress towards democracy is in contrast to developments in nepal , where king gyanendra seized power this year and dismissed the elected government .

the amorous amphibians cross the road around the victorian lake in llandrindod wells in mid wales at this time of year in order to breed .
but traffic on the road has meant many of the dating toads have not reached their destination .
now powys county council has stepped in to temporarily close a stretch of the road overnight .
the breeding season for the toads runs from mid march to early april but in the past the council has said that closing the road was not an option .
now they have decided to close a 620 metre stretch of the road between 2000 gmt and 0600 gmt until 3 april .
dwindling population " it is a minor road which runs around the lake , but it is well used by local people , " said local county councillor keith tamplin .
" but everybody is quite happy with it " .
radnorshire wildlife trust has estimated that the area used to have a population of toads around 10,000 strong but it said their number has now dwindled to around 3,000 .
" i do n't think the road has helped at all with that , " said the trust 's conservation manager julian jones .
more than 200 toads had already been killed on the road this year before it was closed for the first time on friday night .
he said he hoped the temporary road closure would be implemented in future years too .

voigt told the new york times she lost 45kg -lrb- 100lbs -rrb- following the operation last june .
she was fired from the royal opera house 's ariadne auf naxos in march 2004 because it was felt she would not suit her costume .
her spokesman said surgery had taken place , but did not discuss details .
voigt , 44 , has since had positive reviews of her performances , and told the new york times she wanted to go public with the news because she was constantly being asked about her new look .
' blessing ' " i felt it was time to talk about it , " she said .
" i did n't want to be dishonest . "
" i really still think of myself as a very big woman , " she added .
" my mind has n't had the opportunity to catch up with the progress my body has made in a short amount of time . "
the procedure creates a small pouch out of the top of the stomach , which is connected to half of the small intestine .
