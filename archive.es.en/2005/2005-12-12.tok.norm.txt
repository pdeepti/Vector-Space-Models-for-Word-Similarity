eu ministers , however , are yet to approve the expensive project . european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- officials said friday that european countries remained interested in a russian plan to build a new crew-carrying spaceship known as the clipper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : esa director dordain is pushing for eu participation in the russian project " i shall make all the efforts i can in the next few months to secure wide participation for clipper among member states , " esa director general jean-jacques dordain said after meeting russian space agency officials in moscow . dordain said he would push the project to be approved before june 2006 by the 17-member esa , which backed off a decision on approval at a ministerial meeting in berlin last week . " a final decision has not been taken but neither has a negative decision .
this is very important for us , " anatoly perminov , head of russia 's federal space agency , said . with or without europe perminov previously said that russia could push ahead with the clipper project without european backing and mentioned china as a possible alternative partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new russian spacecraft could reach the international space station in 2010 russian scientists envisage that the clipper would weigh 14.5 tons and would carry up to six people on voyages to the international space station -lrb- iss -rrb- or on interplanetary trips . they have said the craft could be launched as soon as 2010 and have estimated the cost of development at $ 1 billion dollars -lrb- 845 million euros -rrb- . " before the final decision is taken , we will work together , we will come up with an action plan for the concept and utilization and the participation of european industries in the project , " dordain said . budgetary woes despite budgetary concerns voiced at last week 's berlin meeting , european financing would go ahead , daniel sacotte , the esa 's director of human spaceflight , microgravity and exploration , said . " the russians are not going to finance it , we will finance it from our side , " sacotte told afp . he added , however : " we needed the support from at least two states out of france , italy and germany .
we did n't get it . " also friday , the esa director general said russia 's soyuz space rockets , currently the only vehicles used for reaching the iss , had the full backing of the european agency . russian technology recognized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian space agency is still using the former soviet space center in baikonur , kazakhstan " based on performance , " the esa " has decided to consider soyuz as a full member of the family of launchers for esa missions , " alongside ariane and vega rockets , dordain said . a soyuz rocket will be used for the first launch in europe 's galileo satellite navigation project from kazakhstan 's baikonur cosmodrome on dec .
26 , dordoin said .
the esa also foresees use of soyuz rockets for a planned mission to mars , he added . the soyuz , a soviet-designed work horse , became the only means of taking personnel to and from the iss after the grounding of the us space shuttle fleet in august following a mishap on the latest mission similar to that which doomed the columbia orbiter in 2003 . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de esa meets in berlin to discuss future space programs the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- gathers in berlin monday to talk about the focus of european space exploration in coming years .

dw-world looks at the major areas of conflict . with the clock ticking down to the final days before the next budget needs to be signed and sealed , the european union is locked in a major dispute over who pays how much into the eu pot - and , just as important , who receives what over the seven years from 2007-2013 . key sticking points are britain 's refusal to give ground on its budget rebate , and french resistance to surrendering support for eu farmers , which swallows about 40 percent of spending . but the stakes are also high for the eu 's newer member states , desperate to get hold of eu aid for infrastructure such as motorway and train links , left lagging behind western europe by decades of communism . more broadly , failure to agree on a budget would leave the eu scuffling over its budget on a year-by-year basis , threatening regular deadlock in a bloc already hobbled by the rejection of its constitution this year . britain , which holds the eu 's presidency , is set to make modified proposals after talks among foreign ministers monday , as preparation for a summit of the bloc 's leaders starting on thursday . london is still hopeful a deal can be struck . here are some basic facts about the eu budget : global spending the six main contributors to the budget - austria , britain , france , germany , the netherlands and sweden - want spending limited to about 1.0 percent of eu gross national income , or 815 billion euros -lrb- 954 billion dollars -rrb- . but the european commission wants a robust budget to pay for ambitious programs sought by member states and has called for payments of 943 billion euros -lrb- 1.14 percent of gni -rrb- over the 2007-2013 period , while the parliament suggests 883 billion euros would be enough . luxembourg , which tried to negotiate a budget deal in june when it held the eu 's presidency , offered a compromise of 875 billion euros but it was rejected by britain , finland , the netherlands , spain and sweden . london argued last week that the budget should be smaller and proposed an estimated 846.8 billion euros , an offer which has largely been rejected . net contributors the member states often concentrate on how much they pay into the budget and how little they get back - their net outlay .
in 2001 , an average german citizen " paid " 114 euros a year to the budget while the average spaniard " received " 180 euros . the three biggest net contributors , germany , the netherlands and sweden would like to see their burden reduced . farm aid : the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- under a franco-german initiative , farm spending was set in 2002 at a summit aimed at preparing for eu enlargement .
cap spending will stabilize from 2006 at around 45.5 billion euros annually , plus around one percent each year . france , the system 's major beneficiary as the union 's biggest agricultural producer , has so far refused to renegotiate the agreement , which is hotly contested by britain . britain 's rebate the british rebate , a jealously-guarded mechanism for reducing its financial burden because it profits little from subsidies , averaged 4.6 billion euros -lrb- 5.4 billion dollars , 3.1 billion pounds -rrb- annually between 1997 and 2003 . by last year , the rebate , which grows in proportion to eu spending , had reached 5.3 billion euros and is projected to average 7.1 billion euros annually for the 2007-2013 budget period . regional aid the 10 members who joined in may 2004 are waiting impatiently for eu regional funding , but until now it has been greece , ireland , italy , portugal and spain which have benefited most . despite fierce opposition , britain has proposed a cut in such aid to new member states on the grounds that newcomers are rarely able to absorb all of the eu money put in front of them . research and transport : eu 's future ? to help improve the eu 's competitiveness , the commission has proposed trebling the budgets for research and trans-european transport links .
britain has argued that the budget needs to be focused on more future-oriented programs such as research and education and less on agriculture . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de criticism prompts britain to promise new proposals eu leaders are trying to break a deadlock over the budget before a summit next week .

the row comes just before nuclear talks with tehran . recent remarks by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad about the veracity of the holocaust and that israel be relocated to europe prompted a harsh reaction from german vice chancellor franz müntefering on sunday . " whatever is said will one day be desired to be done , " the employment and social welfare minister said after a meeting in berlin with paul spiegel , president of the central council of jews in germany . müntefering was referring to the iranian president 's comments in which he called on germany and austria to host a state of israel on their soil if they felt responsible for murdering jews during world war ii .

" i 'm surprised by the reaction to these comments .
the president 's statements were clear : if the europeans have treated the jews badly , they have to compensate at their own expense , not at the expense of the region , " iran 's foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi told reporters . bad omen before nuclear talks the controversy over ahmadinejad 's verbal attacks against israel has cast a shadow over upcoming negotiations between the eu-3 , britain , france and germany , and tehran over iran 's nuclear fuel program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : photo of reported nuclear area in iran where uranium enrichment could be taking place iran has taken an increasingly hardline stance in its dialog with the international atomic energy agency and the european union over what it says is its right to produce nuclear energy for its electricity sector , but which the west fears could be secretly diverted to developing nuclear weapons . talks are intended to resume on december 21 in vienna after a four-month break .
asefi said on sunday that iran would stick to its demand to conduct nuclear fuel work despite fears that such activities could be diverted to make an atomic bomb . " this meeting will be very serious .

asefi said the only chance for the negotiations was if the european side compromises - even though this appears out of the question . " if the europeans are rational and act according to npt and international agreements , there is nothing to worry about and the meeting will have a good result , " asefi told reporters .

his name is hans riegel , and millions of children around the world get their first sugar rush chewing on his sticky candies . it is practically impossible to find a kid in this world that does n't have a sweet tooth .
it is this law of nature that made hans riegel , junior , one of the richest germans living today . his assets , like those of his brother paul , have been estimated to 1.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- haribo , the international sweets giant with an estimated annual turnover of 1.5 billion euros , holds a 60 % market share on licorice and fruit drops in germany , and is undisputed number one in europe .
in the eighties , it crossed the big pond and started expanding in the united states .
in the nineties , it discovered eastern europe .
the world of gummy bears knows no borders . hans riegel , senior , confectioner from bonn , founded the family business in 1920 and gave it the exotic sounding name haribo , which was , in fact , an acronym consisting of his initials and the city of bonn .
but it was really hans junior , who took over the family business after the second world war , that turned it into an international success story . tradition and change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the summer of 2005 , haribo organized a licorice-inspired fashion show it is a well-established part of the haribo corporate mythology that , at least in the first few years of developing their business , hans senior and his wife gertrud used to deliver their products on their own , by bicycle .
hans junior , who prepared himself for his later career by earning a doctorate from the university of bonn on the role of sugar in world trade , does n't have to play delivery boy anymore because haribo candies are now sold over the world .
but he does like to fly his own chopper to a business meeting . what has n't changed over the years is the soul of the family business : hans riegel sits at the top of the gummy bear pyramid and rules supreme in a somewhat antiquated managerial style .
as a patriarchic figurehead who believes more in trust and authority than focus groups and marketing departments , this active octogenarian has single-handedly turned his father 's business into a major player on the world market .
he is known to have said that " without haribo , my life has no meaning . " tradition means everything to hans riegel .
the original haribo advertising slogan - " haribo macht kinder froh , " which literally means " haribo makes children happy " and , luckily enough , rhymes in german - was sold to riegel senior in the thirties by a traveling salesman .
the slogan was updated only once , in the sixties , to welcome the paying adults into the fairy world of gum drops : " kids and grown-ups love it so , the happy world of haribo . " techno grandpa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions of gummy bear leave the haribo factories on a daily basis in 1994 , riegel was awarded the order of the federal republic of germany , 1st class , -lrb- bundesverdienstkreuz -rrb- for his services to society .
he is a a self-proclaimed fan of techno music , who likes to follow latest trends “ i love kids and i enjoy watching them .
they are my customers , i have to know what sweets they enjoy , what they think , what language they speak , " riegel said . since 1991 , haribo has been advertised in germany by thomas gottschalk , an aging entertainer who is also a household name in germany .
the riegel-gottschalk partnership is the said to be the most successful advertising campaign in german history , although younger german entertainers , like the popular stefan raab , enjoy making fun of gottschalk 's not very convincing attempts to use slang in haribo ads . the gummy bear dynasty is in no shortage of males called hans .
hans junior inherited the family business from his father , hans senior , and he is likely to leave the throne to his nephew hans-jürgen , who is currently running a haribo factory in france .
the dynasty will probably live on . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de richest germans : silver spoon baby albert ii , prince of thurn and taxis was born into his wealthy surroundings , and at the tender age of just 22 , he is not only the hereditary head of the family estate , but officially germany 's youngest billionaire .

as a patriarchic figurehead who believes more in trust and authority than focus groups and marketing departments , this active octogenarian has single-handedly turned his father 's business into a major player on the world market .
he is known to have said that " without haribo , my life has no meaning . " tradition means everything to hans riegel .
the original haribo advertising slogan - " haribo macht kinder froh , " which literally means " haribo makes children happy " and , luckily enough , rhymes in german - was sold to riegel senior in the thirties by a traveling salesman .
the slogan was updated only once , in the sixties , to welcome the paying adults into the fairy world of gum drops : " kids and grown-ups love it so , the happy world of haribo . " techno grandpa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions of gummy bear leave the haribo factories on a daily basis in 1994 , riegel was awarded the order of the federal republic of germany , 1st class , -lrb- bundesverdienstkreuz -rrb- for his services to society .
he is a a self-proclaimed fan of techno music , who likes to follow latest trends “ i love kids and i enjoy watching them .
they are my customers , i have to know what sweets they enjoy , what they think , what language they speak , " riegel said . since 1991 , haribo has been advertised in germany by thomas gottschalk , an aging entertainer who is also a household name in germany .
the riegel-gottschalk partnership is the said to be the most successful advertising campaign in german history , although younger german entertainers , like the popular stefan raab , enjoy making fun of gottschalk 's not very convincing attempts to use slang in haribo ads . the gummy bear dynasty is in no shortage of males called hans .
hans junior inherited the family business from his father , hans senior , and he is likely to leave the throne to his nephew hans-jürgen , who is currently running a haribo factory in france .
the dynasty will probably live on . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de richest germans : silver spoon baby albert ii , prince of thurn and taxis was born into his wealthy surroundings , and at the tender age of just 22 , he is not only the hereditary head of the family estate , but officially germany 's youngest billionaire .

us officials acknowledged to the german government in 2004 that the man had been mistaken for somebody else and had been wrongly detained . foreign minister steinmeier , who already held a ministerial post in the schröder government , has vehemently denied german involvement in the affair .
he is expected to inform the german parliament and the public about the case in great detail this coming wednesday . unpleasant questions the question that el masri himself and leading german opposition figures have been asking is whether government officials assisted the abduction and detention of el masri in any way in a bid to improve german-us relations which had turned sour over the us-led war in iraq .
but german ministers at the weekend again denied any involvement by berlin in the abduction masterminded by the cia .

the el masri case will be debated in detail in the foreign and interior parliamentary committees before the foreign minister answers questions in the bundestag on wednesday .

he wants all the facts on the table this week to ensure that the affair does not linger on into 2006 . meanwhile , a german daily reported on sunday that el masri was already under observation by german intelligence when he was abducted by the cia .

eu ministers , however , are yet to approve the expensive project . european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- officials said friday that european countries remained interested in a russian plan to build a new crew-carrying spaceship known as the clipper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : esa director dordain is pushing for eu participation in the russian project " i shall make all the efforts i can in the next few months to secure wide participation for clipper among member states , " esa director general jean-jacques dordain said after meeting russian space agency officials in moscow . dordain said he would push the project to be approved before june 2006 by the 17-member esa , which backed off a decision on approval at a ministerial meeting in berlin last week . " a final decision has not been taken but neither has a negative decision .
this is very important for us , " anatoly perminov , head of russia 's federal space agency , said . with or without europe perminov previously said that russia could push ahead with the clipper project without european backing and mentioned china as a possible alternative partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new russian spacecraft could reach the international space station in 2010 russian scientists envisage that the clipper would weigh 14.5 tons and would carry up to six people on voyages to the international space station -lrb- iss -rrb- or on interplanetary trips . they have said the craft could be launched as soon as 2010 and have estimated the cost of development at $ 1 billion dollars -lrb- 845 million euros -rrb- . " before the final decision is taken , we will work together , we will come up with an action plan for the concept and utilization and the participation of european industries in the project , " dordain said . budgetary woes despite budgetary concerns voiced at last week 's berlin meeting , european financing would go ahead , daniel sacotte , the esa 's director of human spaceflight , microgravity and exploration , said . " the russians are not going to finance it , we will finance it from our side , " sacotte told afp . he added , however : " we needed the support from at least two states out of france , italy and germany .
we did n't get it . " also friday , the esa director general said russia 's soyuz space rockets , currently the only vehicles used for reaching the iss , had the full backing of the european agency . russian technology recognized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian space agency is still using the former soviet space center in baikonur , kazakhstan " based on performance , " the esa " has decided to consider soyuz as a full member of the family of launchers for esa missions , " alongside ariane and vega rockets , dordain said . a soyuz rocket will be used for the first launch in europe 's galileo satellite navigation project from kazakhstan 's baikonur cosmodrome on dec .
26 , dordoin said .
the esa also foresees use of soyuz rockets for a planned mission to mars , he added . the soyuz , a soviet-designed work horse , became the only means of taking personnel to and from the iss after the grounding of the us space shuttle fleet in august following a mishap on the latest mission similar to that which doomed the columbia orbiter in 2003 . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de esa meets in berlin to discuss future space programs the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- gathers in berlin monday to talk about the focus of european space exploration in coming years .

250,000 seats will be made available starting on monday in the fourth sales period . the organizing committee for the 2006 world cup in germany expects demand to soar when the fourth sales period of 250,000 tickets begins on monday at 12:00 noon cet -lrb- 1100 gmt -rrb- .
following friday 's draw fans of the 32 competing nations now know where and when their teams are playing and a mad ticket rush is anticipated . " we can sense the interest from participating teams and from neighboring countries increasing enormously , " said horst r. schmidt , vice-president of the organizing committee . tickets from world and national associations fans from abroad , if they did n't try to order tickets blindly in one of the first three phases , have two paths to choose from when ordering this time . they can turn to their national teams .
the 32 countries ' individual associations all received an allocation of eight percent of the tickets for the group phase matches they are playing in .
in addition , there are " conditional tickets " that can be ordered .
these are the knockout stage matches and will be filled if your country advances to that stage . the national associations dictate the sales process in their country . the world soccer body fifa , which has alone sold tickets so far , also has more on sale .
the opening match between germany and costa rica is already sold out and there is only a limited supply for the most in-demand matches , such as the finals and semifinals . the deadline for this phase is january 15 , 2006 and the lottery will be held on january 31 .
any unsold tickets then will be offered on a first come , first served basis starting february 15 . first phases massively oversubscribed the possibility that at that point , there are any more tickets remaining in the hands of fifa or the 32 national associations must be close to nil .
when the first sales window started earlier this year , there were over eight million orders for 812,000 tickets .
up to now , 80 percent of the tickets available have been snapped up by europeans according to the world cup committee . " we assume the demand will far outstrip the contingent this time again .
there is n't a fairer method to distribute the tickets than through a lottery , " said schmidt . naturally , many tickets will be returned over the course of the next six months , for which a last minute window will be opened starting on may 1 and running to the end of the tournament on july 9 . ticket prices range from 35 euros -lrb- $ 41 -rrb- for the cheapest seats at group games -lrb- excluding the opening match -rrb- to 600 euros -lrb- $ 706 -rrb- for the best seats at the final in berlin . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de favorites wary of first round foes while the tunisia-saudi arabia game probably wo n't have many local ticket holders in munich gasping in delight , the opening round of the 2006 world cup will have a number of lively match ups .

us officials acknowledged to the german government in 2004 that the man had been mistaken for somebody else and had been wrongly detained . foreign minister steinmeier , who already held a ministerial post in the schröder government , has vehemently denied german involvement in the affair .
he is expected to inform the german parliament and the public about the case in great detail this coming wednesday . unpleasant questions the question that el masri himself and leading german opposition figures have been asking is whether government officials assisted the abduction and detention of el masri in any way in a bid to improve german-us relations which had turned sour over the us-led war in iraq .
but german ministers at the weekend again denied any involvement by berlin in the abduction masterminded by the cia .
german deputy-chancellor franz müntefering indicated that media reports about possible government involvement were groundless . " what we are being confronted with is mere speculation , " müntefering said . " if people knew what happened as they claim , calls for a parliamentary inquiry would seem even more foolish .
it 's party politics that are behind much of the criticism being voiced right now , with the aim of discrediting the new foreign minister .
i 'm calling on all sides concerned to exercise restraint and wait for the results of the forthcoming meetings in the parliamentary committees , " he said . not our fault bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier will address the parliament on wednesday german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier says there are no signs that any mistakes were made by government members and other german officials in the el masri case .
steinmeier has repeatedly rejected opposition calls for his resignation , maintaining that the actions of the government were based on the law . but steinmeier is certainly sensing a need to inform the public about what happened in 2003 .
the el masri case will be debated in detail in the foreign and interior parliamentary committees before the foreign minister answers questions in the bundestag on wednesday .
social democrat floor leader and former defense minister peter struck is confident the el masri affair will not bring the new german government to its knees . " there 's no doubt that the german government would have violated the law , had it assisted in the abduction of a german citizen , " stuck said . " but from what i know at present , government offices were not involved and i have no reason to believe that we 'll see a different picture emerging by the end of this week , " he said . a touchstone for the new government wolfgang bosbach , a leading christian democrat lawmaker , said that the el mari case was clearly becoming a touchstone for the new government .
he wants all the facts on the table this week to ensure that the affair does not linger on into 2006 . meanwhile , a german daily reported on sunday that el masri was already under observation by german intelligence when he was abducted by the cia .
a german security official told the newspaper that masri was not considered to be an active islamic extremist .

but the ex-chancellor has no intention of putting his feet up . less than three weeks after leaving office , former german chancellor gerhard schröder has reinvented himself as an international businessman with concerns in russia and switzerland . schröder wasted no time in making a clean break with politics after he handed the reins of power to angela merkel on november 22 .
but his decision to delve into the world of international business has not been without a political fallout . on friday , the chairman of russian energy giant gazprom , alexei miller , announced that schröder would head the shareholders ' committee of the consortium building a controversial gas pipeline under the baltic sea from russia to germany . the announcement came just after the ceremonial launch of construction of the north european gas pipeline , in which gazprom owns a 51-percent stake and germany 's e.on and basf own 24.5-percent stakes . the appointment of schröder , who helped secure the deal for the four-billion-euro -lrb- $ 4.7-billion -rrb- pipeline earlier this year while he was still chancellor , has already sparked questions of potential conflict of interest and debate about the need for regulations for retired politicians moving into business . while newspaper commentators generally agreed the pipeline project was useful , they said schröder 's move raised fresh questions about the links between big business and politics and the cosy relations with putin when in office . questionable occupation " it stinks , " greens co-leader richard bütikofer , whose party was in power with schröder 's social democrats when the pipeline deal was struck , told tagesspiegel newspaper .

us officials acknowledged to the german government in 2004 that the man had been mistaken for somebody else and had been wrongly detained . foreign minister steinmeier , who already held a ministerial post in the schröder government , has vehemently denied german involvement in the affair .
he is expected to inform the german parliament and the public about the case in great detail this coming wednesday . unpleasant questions the question that el masri himself and leading german opposition figures have been asking is whether government officials assisted the abduction and detention of el masri in any way in a bid to improve german-us relations which had turned sour over the us-led war in iraq .
but german ministers at the weekend again denied any involvement by berlin in the abduction masterminded by the cia .
german deputy-chancellor franz müntefering indicated that media reports about possible government involvement were groundless . " what we are being confronted with is mere speculation , " müntefering said . " if people knew what happened as they claim , calls for a parliamentary inquiry would seem even more foolish .
it 's party politics that are behind much of the criticism being voiced right now , with the aim of discrediting the new foreign minister .
i 'm calling on all sides concerned to exercise restraint and wait for the results of the forthcoming meetings in the parliamentary committees , " he said . not our fault bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier will address the parliament on wednesday german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier says there are no signs that any mistakes were made by government members and other german officials in the el masri case .
steinmeier has repeatedly rejected opposition calls for his resignation , maintaining that the actions of the government were based on the law . but steinmeier is certainly sensing a need to inform the public about what happened in 2003 .
the el masri case will be debated in detail in the foreign and interior parliamentary committees before the foreign minister answers questions in the bundestag on wednesday .
social democrat floor leader and former defense minister peter struck is confident the el masri affair will not bring the new german government to its knees . " there 's no doubt that the german government would have violated the law , had it assisted in the abduction of a german citizen , " stuck said . " but from what i know at present , government offices were not involved and i have no reason to believe that we 'll see a different picture emerging by the end of this week , " he said . a touchstone for the new government wolfgang bosbach , a leading christian democrat lawmaker , said that the el mari case was clearly becoming a touchstone for the new government .
he wants all the facts on the table this week to ensure that the affair does not linger on into 2006 . meanwhile , a german daily reported on sunday that el masri was already under observation by german intelligence when he was abducted by the cia .
a german security official told the newspaper that masri was not considered to be an active islamic extremist .
it is known , however that he did have contacts to another man under observation .
he said the little that was known was transmitted to the americans . hardy graupner -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de questions arise over us base in kosovo while us secretary of state condoleezza rice secured a reprieve from european governments over the treatment of detainees , the suspicion of systematical abuse grows after reports of a guantanamo-like base in kosovo . -lrb- dec .

250,000 seats will be made available starting on monday in the fourth sales period . the organizing committee for the 2006 world cup in germany expects demand to soar when the fourth sales period of 250,000 tickets begins on monday at 12:00 noon cet -lrb- 1100 gmt -rrb- .
following friday 's draw fans of the 32 competing nations now know where and when their teams are playing and a mad ticket rush is anticipated . " we can sense the interest from participating teams and from neighboring countries increasing enormously , " said horst r. schmidt , vice-president of the organizing committee . tickets from world and national associations fans from abroad , if they did n't try to order tickets blindly in one of the first three phases , have two paths to choose from when ordering this time . they can turn to their national teams .
the 32 countries ' individual associations all received an allocation of eight percent of the tickets for the group phase matches they are playing in .
in addition , there are " conditional tickets " that can be ordered .
these are the knockout stage matches and will be filled if your country advances to that stage . the national associations dictate the sales process in their country . the world soccer body fifa , which has alone sold tickets so far , also has more on sale .
the opening match between germany and costa rica is already sold out and there is only a limited supply for the most in-demand matches , such as the finals and semifinals . the deadline for this phase is january 15 , 2006 and the lottery will be held on january 31 .
any unsold tickets then will be offered on a first come , first served basis starting february 15 . first phases massively oversubscribed the possibility that at that point , there are any more tickets remaining in the hands of fifa or the 32 national associations must be close to nil .
when the first sales window started earlier this year , there were over eight million orders for 812,000 tickets .
up to now , 80 percent of the tickets available have been snapped up by europeans according to the world cup committee . " we assume the demand will far outstrip the contingent this time again .
there is n't a fairer method to distribute the tickets than through a lottery , " said schmidt . naturally , many tickets will be returned over the course of the next six months , for which a last minute window will be opened starting on may 1 and running to the end of the tournament on july 9 . ticket prices range from 35 euros -lrb- $ 41 -rrb- for the cheapest seats at group games -lrb- excluding the opening match -rrb- to 600 euros -lrb- $ 706 -rrb- for the best seats at the final in berlin . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de favorites wary of first round foes while the tunisia-saudi arabia game probably wo n't have many local ticket holders in munich gasping in delight , the opening round of the 2006 world cup will have a number of lively match ups .

" it lasted 45 seconds , " one said .
straw merely said london would put forward revised proposals during the week but added that london would not pay any price for an agreement . " we 're not in for a deal at any price , " straw told reporters , referring to the pressure britain has been under to relinquish more of its annual rebate to fund aid to new east european members in the budget . straw ’ s stance makes it look increasingly unlikely that that there would be any concessions on the long-term eu budget when the ministers of the 25-nation bloc convene on wednesday .
when pressed on whether there was a chance of an accord being agreed upon on thursday and friday , straw told reporters : " i ca n't say . " it was a further slap in the face for eu officials who are keen to avoid a damaging split over the budget akin to the crisis resulting from the bloc ’ s failure to ratify its own constitution . barroso appeals to blair but to little avail bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actions not words suggest that tony blair has ignored jose barroso 's appeals .
in an attempt to prevent another schism in the eu , european commission president jose manuel barroso had personally appealed to british prime minister tony blair for a rapid resolution , urging him to find a workable alternative to the existing proposals . barroso , pressing the point that britain bore a special responsibility to ensure that talks did not collapse as they did at the acrimonious constitution summit last june , also asked blair to raise overall eu spending and offer deeper and permanent cuts to britain ’ s controversial rebate . on evidence , barroso ’ s words have fallen on deaf ears and have instilled a sense of dread in the eu president ahead of the summit this week .
" as somebody put it , to fail once is unfortunate .
to fail twice would be careless , " barroso told reporters . the package britain put forward last week proposed a cut of 14 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.49 billion -rrb- or 8.5 percent in aid to poor ex-communist newcomers to the bloc and detailed a continued rise of britain ’ s own rebate over the next seven years .
it was almost unanimously rejected . newest eu members facing huge bill if talks fail bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the talks fail , come 2007 the new states will have pay up .
barroso highlighted the need to support the newest eu members when he spoke on monday .
" new member states must be offered a fairer deal .
i believe they need to be offered significantly higher levels of investment than in the current proposal . "
failure to reach a deal will immediately cost the new states cash in 2007 .
despite the ominous signs , barroso added that the " urgent , necessary " budget deal was " within reach . " not according to jack straw it isn ’ t .
the foreign secretary maintained that those members expecting big changes to the proposals would be disappointed , hinting at a set of plans not too different that were thrown out last week . " we are thinking about revisions to those proposals , and those revisions , if indeed there are any , will be made available in the course of this week .
these are difficult negotiations .
the margin for maneuver is narrow , " he said . britain thought it had the deal in the bag when it offered to forego 8 billion euros over seven years from its rebate , worth 5.6 billion euros this year , to meet what it called its fair share of the costs of the eu 's eastward enlargement last year . britain 's full share of the non-agricultural costs of enlargement would in fact be 18 billion euros , according to european union financial experts .
france put the figure at 14 billion . france wants rebate cut in return for cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french foreign minister philippe douste- blazy wants a massive cut in britain 's rebate .
the french weighed in with particular relish in the row over the british rebate , saying that it should be cut to 35-36 billion euros over the period instead of the 50 billion it would reach without reform .
french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy insisted that the reduction should be a " permanent legal commitment . " as an incentive , douste-blazy said that paris would allow a future review of the entire budget as long as the 2007-13 package , which has provisions included for the protection of french agriculture , remained guaranteed . officials close to the british contingent said that there was a fair chance that the new proposals , due on wednesday , would include a slight increase in the amount but by nothing like the amounts suggested by brussels or paris .

eu ministers , however , are yet to approve the expensive project . european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- officials said friday that european countries remained interested in a russian plan to build a new crew-carrying spaceship known as the clipper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : esa director dordain is pushing for eu participation in the russian project " i shall make all the efforts i can in the next few months to secure wide participation for clipper among member states , " esa director general jean-jacques dordain said after meeting russian space agency officials in moscow . dordain said he would push the project to be approved before june 2006 by the 17-member esa , which backed off a decision on approval at a ministerial meeting in berlin last week . " a final decision has not been taken but neither has a negative decision .
this is very important for us , " anatoly perminov , head of russia 's federal space agency , said . with or without europe perminov previously said that russia could push ahead with the clipper project without european backing and mentioned china as a possible alternative partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new russian spacecraft could reach the international space station in 2010 russian scientists envisage that the clipper would weigh 14.5 tons and would carry up to six people on voyages to the international space station -lrb- iss -rrb- or on interplanetary trips . they have said the craft could be launched as soon as 2010 and have estimated the cost of development at $ 1 billion dollars -lrb- 845 million euros -rrb- . " before the final decision is taken , we will work together , we will come up with an action plan for the concept and utilization and the participation of european industries in the project , " dordain said . budgetary woes despite budgetary concerns voiced at last week 's berlin meeting , european financing would go ahead , daniel sacotte , the esa 's director of human spaceflight , microgravity and exploration , said . " the russians are not going to finance it , we will finance it from our side , " sacotte told afp . he added , however : " we needed the support from at least two states out of france , italy and germany .
we did n't get it . " also friday , the esa director general said russia 's soyuz space rockets , currently the only vehicles used for reaching the iss , had the full backing of the european agency . russian technology recognized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian space agency is still using the former soviet space center in baikonur , kazakhstan " based on performance , " the esa " has decided to consider soyuz as a full member of the family of launchers for esa missions , " alongside ariane and vega rockets , dordain said . a soyuz rocket will be used for the first launch in europe 's galileo satellite navigation project from kazakhstan 's baikonur cosmodrome on dec .
26 , dordoin said .
the esa also foresees use of soyuz rockets for a planned mission to mars , he added . the soyuz , a soviet-designed work horse , became the only means of taking personnel to and from the iss after the grounding of the us space shuttle fleet in august following a mishap on the latest mission similar to that which doomed the columbia orbiter in 2003 . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de esa meets in berlin to discuss future space programs the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- gathers in berlin monday to talk about the focus of european space exploration in coming years .

his name is hans riegel , and millions of children around the world get their first sugar rush chewing on his sticky candies . it is practically impossible to find a kid in this world that does n't have a sweet tooth .
it is this law of nature that made hans riegel , junior , one of the richest germans living today . his assets , like those of his brother paul , have been estimated to 1.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- haribo , the international sweets giant with an estimated annual turnover of 1.5 billion euros , holds a 60 % market share on licorice and fruit drops in germany , and is undisputed number one in europe .
in the eighties , it crossed the big pond and started expanding in the united states .
in the nineties , it discovered eastern europe .
the world of gummy bears knows no borders . hans riegel , senior , confectioner from bonn , founded the family business in 1920 and gave it the exotic sounding name haribo , which was , in fact , an acronym consisting of his initials and the city of bonn .
but it was really hans junior , who took over the family business after the second world war , that turned it into an international success story . tradition and change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the summer of 2005 , haribo organized a licorice-inspired fashion show it is a well-established part of the haribo corporate mythology that , at least in the first few years of developing their business , hans senior and his wife gertrud used to deliver their products on their own , by bicycle .
hans junior , who prepared himself for his later career by earning a doctorate from the university of bonn on the role of sugar in world trade , does n't have to play delivery boy anymore because haribo candies are now sold over the world .
but he does like to fly his own chopper to a business meeting . what has n't changed over the years is the soul of the family business : hans riegel sits at the top of the gummy bear pyramid and rules supreme in a somewhat antiquated managerial style .
as a patriarchic figurehead who believes more in trust and authority than focus groups and marketing departments , this active octogenarian has single-handedly turned his father 's business into a major player on the world market .
he is known to have said that " without haribo , my life has no meaning . " tradition means everything to hans riegel .
the original haribo advertising slogan - " haribo macht kinder froh , " which literally means " haribo makes children happy " and , luckily enough , rhymes in german - was sold to riegel senior in the thirties by a traveling salesman .
the slogan was updated only once , in the sixties , to welcome the paying adults into the fairy world of gum drops : " kids and grown-ups love it so , the happy world of haribo . " techno grandpa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions of gummy bear leave the haribo factories on a daily basis in 1994 , riegel was awarded the order of the federal republic of germany , 1st class , -lrb- bundesverdienstkreuz -rrb- for his services to society .
he is a a self-proclaimed fan of techno music , who likes to follow latest trends “ i love kids and i enjoy watching them .
they are my customers , i have to know what sweets they enjoy , what they think , what language they speak , " riegel said . since 1991 , haribo has been advertised in germany by thomas gottschalk , an aging entertainer who is also a household name in germany .
the riegel-gottschalk partnership is the said to be the most successful advertising campaign in german history , although younger german entertainers , like the popular stefan raab , enjoy making fun of gottschalk 's not very convincing attempts to use slang in haribo ads . the gummy bear dynasty is in no shortage of males called hans .
hans junior inherited the family business from his father , hans senior , and he is likely to leave the throne to his nephew hans-jürgen , who is currently running a haribo factory in france .
the dynasty will probably live on . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de richest germans : silver spoon baby albert ii , prince of thurn and taxis was born into his wealthy surroundings , and at the tender age of just 22 , he is not only the hereditary head of the family estate , but officially germany 's youngest billionaire .

it is this law of nature that made hans riegel , junior , one of the richest germans living today . his assets , like those of his brother paul , have been estimated to 1.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- haribo , the international sweets giant with an estimated annual turnover of 1.5 billion euros , holds a 60 % market share on licorice and fruit drops in germany , and is undisputed number one in europe .
in the eighties , it crossed the big pond and started expanding in the united states .
in the nineties , it discovered eastern europe .
the world of gummy bears knows no borders . hans riegel , senior , confectioner from bonn , founded the family business in 1920 and gave it the exotic sounding name haribo , which was , in fact , an acronym consisting of his initials and the city of bonn .
but it was really hans junior , who took over the family business after the second world war , that turned it into an international success story . tradition and change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the summer of 2005 , haribo organized a licorice-inspired fashion show it is a well-established part of the haribo corporate mythology that , at least in the first few years of developing their business , hans senior and his wife gertrud used to deliver their products on their own , by bicycle .
hans junior , who prepared himself for his later career by earning a doctorate from the university of bonn on the role of sugar in world trade , does n't have to play delivery boy anymore because haribo candies are now sold over the world .
but he does like to fly his own chopper to a business meeting . what has n't changed over the years is the soul of the family business : hans riegel sits at the top of the gummy bear pyramid and rules supreme in a somewhat antiquated managerial style .
as a patriarchic figurehead who believes more in trust and authority than focus groups and marketing departments , this active octogenarian has single-handedly turned his father 's business into a major player on the world market .
he is known to have said that " without haribo , my life has no meaning . " tradition means everything to hans riegel .
the original haribo advertising slogan - " haribo macht kinder froh , " which literally means " haribo makes children happy " and , luckily enough , rhymes in german - was sold to riegel senior in the thirties by a traveling salesman .
the slogan was updated only once , in the sixties , to welcome the paying adults into the fairy world of gum drops : " kids and grown-ups love it so , the happy world of haribo . " techno grandpa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions of gummy bear leave the haribo factories on a daily basis in 1994 , riegel was awarded the order of the federal republic of germany , 1st class , -lrb- bundesverdienstkreuz -rrb- for his services to society .
he is a a self-proclaimed fan of techno music , who likes to follow latest trends “ i love kids and i enjoy watching them .
they are my customers , i have to know what sweets they enjoy , what they think , what language they speak , " riegel said . since 1991 , haribo has been advertised in germany by thomas gottschalk , an aging entertainer who is also a household name in germany .
the riegel-gottschalk partnership is the said to be the most successful advertising campaign in german history , although younger german entertainers , like the popular stefan raab , enjoy making fun of gottschalk 's not very convincing attempts to use slang in haribo ads . the gummy bear dynasty is in no shortage of males called hans .
hans junior inherited the family business from his father , hans senior , and he is likely to leave the throne to his nephew hans-jürgen , who is currently running a haribo factory in france .
the dynasty will probably live on . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de richest germans : silver spoon baby albert ii , prince of thurn and taxis was born into his wealthy surroundings , and at the tender age of just 22 , he is not only the hereditary head of the family estate , but officially germany 's youngest billionaire .

following friday 's draw fans of the 32 competing nations now know where and when their teams are playing and a mad ticket rush is anticipated . " we can sense the interest from participating teams and from neighboring countries increasing enormously , " said horst r. schmidt , vice-president of the organizing committee . tickets from world and national associations fans from abroad , if they did n't try to order tickets blindly in one of the first three phases , have two paths to choose from when ordering this time . they can turn to their national teams .
the 32 countries ' individual associations all received an allocation of eight percent of the tickets for the group phase matches they are playing in .

" it lasted 45 seconds , " one said .
straw merely said london would put forward revised proposals during the week but added that london would not pay any price for an agreement . " we 're not in for a deal at any price , " straw told reporters , referring to the pressure britain has been under to relinquish more of its annual rebate to fund aid to new east european members in the budget . straw ’ s stance makes it look increasingly unlikely that that there would be any concessions on the long-term eu budget when the ministers of the 25-nation bloc convene on wednesday .
when pressed on whether there was a chance of an accord being agreed upon on thursday and friday , straw told reporters : " i ca n't say . " it was a further slap in the face for eu officials who are keen to avoid a damaging split over the budget akin to the crisis resulting from the bloc ’ s failure to ratify its own constitution . barroso appeals to blair but to little avail bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actions not words suggest that tony blair has ignored jose barroso 's appeals .
in an attempt to prevent another schism in the eu , european commission president jose manuel barroso had personally appealed to british prime minister tony blair for a rapid resolution , urging him to find a workable alternative to the existing proposals . barroso , pressing the point that britain bore a special responsibility to ensure that talks did not collapse as they did at the acrimonious constitution summit last june , also asked blair to raise overall eu spending and offer deeper and permanent cuts to britain ’ s controversial rebate . on evidence , barroso ’ s words have fallen on deaf ears and have instilled a sense of dread in the eu president ahead of the summit this week .
" as somebody put it , to fail once is unfortunate .
to fail twice would be careless , " barroso told reporters . the package britain put forward last week proposed a cut of 14 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.49 billion -rrb- or 8.5 percent in aid to poor ex-communist newcomers to the bloc and detailed a continued rise of britain ’ s own rebate over the next seven years .
it was almost unanimously rejected . newest eu members facing huge bill if talks fail bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the talks fail , come 2007 the new states will have pay up .
barroso highlighted the need to support the newest eu members when he spoke on monday .
" new member states must be offered a fairer deal .
i believe they need to be offered significantly higher levels of investment than in the current proposal . "
failure to reach a deal will immediately cost the new states cash in 2007 .
despite the ominous signs , barroso added that the " urgent , necessary " budget deal was " within reach . " not according to jack straw it isn ’ t .
the foreign secretary maintained that those members expecting big changes to the proposals would be disappointed , hinting at a set of plans not too different that were thrown out last week . " we are thinking about revisions to those proposals , and those revisions , if indeed there are any , will be made available in the course of this week .
these are difficult negotiations .
the margin for maneuver is narrow , " he said . britain thought it had the deal in the bag when it offered to forego 8 billion euros over seven years from its rebate , worth 5.6 billion euros this year , to meet what it called its fair share of the costs of the eu 's eastward enlargement last year . britain 's full share of the non-agricultural costs of enlargement would in fact be 18 billion euros , according to european union financial experts .
france put the figure at 14 billion . france wants rebate cut in return for cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french foreign minister philippe douste- blazy wants a massive cut in britain 's rebate .
the french weighed in with particular relish in the row over the british rebate , saying that it should be cut to 35-36 billion euros over the period instead of the 50 billion it would reach without reform .
french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy insisted that the reduction should be a " permanent legal commitment . " as an incentive , douste-blazy said that paris would allow a future review of the entire budget as long as the 2007-13 package , which has provisions included for the protection of french agriculture , remained guaranteed . officials close to the british contingent said that there was a fair chance that the new proposals , due on wednesday , would include a slight increase in the amount but by nothing like the amounts suggested by brussels or paris .

in an attempt to prevent another schism in the eu , european commission president jose manuel barroso had personally appealed to british prime minister tony blair for a rapid resolution , urging him to find a workable alternative to the existing proposals . barroso , pressing the point that britain bore a special responsibility to ensure that talks did not collapse as they did at the acrimonious constitution summit last june , also asked blair to raise overall eu spending and offer deeper and permanent cuts to britain ’ s controversial rebate . on evidence , barroso ’ s words have fallen on deaf ears and have instilled a sense of dread in the eu president ahead of the summit this week .
" as somebody put it , to fail once is unfortunate .
to fail twice would be careless , " barroso told reporters . the package britain put forward last week proposed a cut of 14 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.49 billion -rrb- or 8.5 percent in aid to poor ex-communist newcomers to the bloc and detailed a continued rise of britain ’ s own rebate over the next seven years .
it was almost unanimously rejected . newest eu members facing huge bill if talks fail bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the talks fail , come 2007 the new states will have pay up .
barroso highlighted the need to support the newest eu members when he spoke on monday .
" new member states must be offered a fairer deal .
i believe they need to be offered significantly higher levels of investment than in the current proposal . "
failure to reach a deal will immediately cost the new states cash in 2007 .
despite the ominous signs , barroso added that the " urgent , necessary " budget deal was " within reach . " not according to jack straw it isn ’ t .
the foreign secretary maintained that those members expecting big changes to the proposals would be disappointed , hinting at a set of plans not too different that were thrown out last week . " we are thinking about revisions to those proposals , and those revisions , if indeed there are any , will be made available in the course of this week .
these are difficult negotiations .
the margin for maneuver is narrow , " he said . britain thought it had the deal in the bag when it offered to forego 8 billion euros over seven years from its rebate , worth 5.6 billion euros this year , to meet what it called its fair share of the costs of the eu 's eastward enlargement last year . britain 's full share of the non-agricultural costs of enlargement would in fact be 18 billion euros , according to european union financial experts .
france put the figure at 14 billion . france wants rebate cut in return for cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french foreign minister philippe douste- blazy wants a massive cut in britain 's rebate .
the french weighed in with particular relish in the row over the british rebate , saying that it should be cut to 35-36 billion euros over the period instead of the 50 billion it would reach without reform .
french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy insisted that the reduction should be a " permanent legal commitment . " as an incentive , douste-blazy said that paris would allow a future review of the entire budget as long as the 2007-13 package , which has provisions included for the protection of french agriculture , remained guaranteed . officials close to the british contingent said that there was a fair chance that the new proposals , due on wednesday , would include a slight increase in the amount but by nothing like the amounts suggested by brussels or paris .

a constitutional crisis ?
the ratification process for the constitution was put on ice by eu leaders in june following a rejection of the new treaty by french and dutch voters .
since the text of the constitution itself can not be changed and a second round of referenda on the same text is unlikely , the eu finds itself between a rock and a hard place . a solution must be found by next summer ; in autumn 2006 at the latest , the eu council - the heads of state who make up the union 's main decision-making body - must officially decide on the constitution 's future . eu expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigration from africa is a growing problem for the eu on the foreign-policy agendy , monday 's meeting is expected to recommend that macedonia - previously a part of yugoslavia - be allowed candidacy status for acceptance into the european union .
however , the council of ministers is expected to make it clear that concrete negotiations over eu entry are still far off , and that no specific date can be named . in a related topic , a number of member states have requested earnest debate over the future expansion plans of the current 25-member bloc , which many feel is admitting new members far too quickly .

since the text of the constitution itself can not be changed and a second round of referenda on the same text is unlikely , the eu finds itself between a rock and a hard place . a solution must be found by next summer ; in autumn 2006 at the latest , the eu council - the heads of state who make up the union 's main decision-making body - must officially decide on the constitution 's future . eu expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigration from africa is a growing problem for the eu on the foreign-policy agendy , monday 's meeting is expected to recommend that macedonia - previously a part of yugoslavia - be allowed candidacy status for acceptance into the european union .
however , the council of ministers is expected to make it clear that concrete negotiations over eu entry are still far off , and that no specific date can be named . in a related topic , a number of member states have requested earnest debate over the future expansion plans of the current 25-member bloc , which many feel is admitting new members far too quickly .
what the union really needs is a consolidation phase , many diplomats say . fighting poverty in africa also on monday , foreign ministers are expected to adopt an overall strategy for eu relations with africa .
ministers agree that the neighboring continent needs more attention ; the goal is long-term development and economic partnership , if only as a means of staunching the flow of illegal refugees to europe .
the european union wants to enter a strategic partnership with all of africa 's approximately 50 states , in order to reach the eu millennium goals of fighting poverty by 2015 .
the foreign ministers are also very likely to vehemently reject the latest comments by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
last week , he questioned the veracity of the holocaust and suggested moving the state of israel to germany or austria .

the row comes just before nuclear talks with tehran . recent remarks by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad about the veracity of the holocaust and that israel be relocated to europe prompted a harsh reaction from german vice chancellor franz müntefering on sunday . " whatever is said will one day be desired to be done , " the employment and social welfare minister said after a meeting in berlin with paul spiegel , president of the central council of jews in germany . müntefering was referring to the iranian president 's comments in which he called on germany and austria to host a state of israel on their soil if they felt responsible for murdering jews during world war ii .
ahmadinejad , who in october said israel should be " wiped off the map , " also described the jewish state as a " tumor . " " unacceptable " comments , says merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul spiegel , head of the central council of jews spiegel has described the comments as the worst anti-semitic attack by a statesman since adolf hitler and called on germany to sever diplomatic ties with iran . chancellor angela merkel described the remarks as " totally unacceptable " and the german government announced it would protest to the iranian ambassador . analysts say the comments were an attempt by ahmedinejad , an ex-member of the revolutionary guard , to woo iranian radicals in the regime who relish confrontation with the west . but tehran said it was surprised the international community had so vehemently condemned ahmedinejad 's remarks . " i 'm surprised by the reaction to these comments .
the president 's statements were clear : if the europeans have treated the jews badly , they have to compensate at their own expense , not at the expense of the region , " iran 's foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi told reporters . bad omen before nuclear talks the controversy over ahmadinejad 's verbal attacks against israel has cast a shadow over upcoming negotiations between the eu-3 , britain , france and germany , and tehran over iran 's nuclear fuel program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : photo of reported nuclear area in iran where uranium enrichment could be taking place iran has taken an increasingly hardline stance in its dialog with the international atomic energy agency and the european union over what it says is its right to produce nuclear energy for its electricity sector , but which the west fears could be secretly diverted to developing nuclear weapons . talks are intended to resume on december 21 in vienna after a four-month break .
asefi said on sunday that iran would stick to its demand to conduct nuclear fuel work despite fears that such activities could be diverted to make an atomic bomb . " this meeting will be very serious .
everything depends on this meeting , " asefi said of the planned discussions . nuclear energy " rights " at stake the iranian government has argued that as a signatory of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , it has the " right " to pursue fuel cycle work for peaceful intentions ; the eu-3 and the united states worry that the uranium enrichment process could be taken a step further and used for military purposes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is supplying fuel for iran 's bushehr nuclear power plant the eu-3 has proposed that iran 's enrichment work be carried out in russia , but tehran has rejected such a possibility .
asefi said the only chance for the negotiations was if the european side compromises - even though this appears out of the question . " if the europeans are rational and act according to npt and international agreements , there is nothing to worry about and the meeting will have a good result , " asefi told reporters .

" it lasted 45 seconds , " one said .
straw merely said london would put forward revised proposals during the week but added that london would not pay any price for an agreement . " we 're not in for a deal at any price , " straw told reporters , referring to the pressure britain has been under to relinquish more of its annual rebate to fund aid to new east european members in the budget . straw ’ s stance makes it look increasingly unlikely that that there would be any concessions on the long-term eu budget when the ministers of the 25-nation bloc convene on wednesday .
when pressed on whether there was a chance of an accord being agreed upon on thursday and friday , straw told reporters : " i ca n't say . " it was a further slap in the face for eu officials who are keen to avoid a damaging split over the budget akin to the crisis resulting from the bloc ’ s failure to ratify its own constitution . barroso appeals to blair but to little avail bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actions not words suggest that tony blair has ignored jose barroso 's appeals .
in an attempt to prevent another schism in the eu , european commission president jose manuel barroso had personally appealed to british prime minister tony blair for a rapid resolution , urging him to find a workable alternative to the existing proposals . barroso , pressing the point that britain bore a special responsibility to ensure that talks did not collapse as they did at the acrimonious constitution summit last june , also asked blair to raise overall eu spending and offer deeper and permanent cuts to britain ’ s controversial rebate . on evidence , barroso ’ s words have fallen on deaf ears and have instilled a sense of dread in the eu president ahead of the summit this week .
" as somebody put it , to fail once is unfortunate .
to fail twice would be careless , " barroso told reporters . the package britain put forward last week proposed a cut of 14 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.49 billion -rrb- or 8.5 percent in aid to poor ex-communist newcomers to the bloc and detailed a continued rise of britain ’ s own rebate over the next seven years .
it was almost unanimously rejected . newest eu members facing huge bill if talks fail bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the talks fail , come 2007 the new states will have pay up .

" new member states must be offered a fairer deal .
i believe they need to be offered significantly higher levels of investment than in the current proposal . "
failure to reach a deal will immediately cost the new states cash in 2007 .
despite the ominous signs , barroso added that the " urgent , necessary " budget deal was " within reach . " not according to jack straw it isn ’ t .

dw-world looks at the major areas of conflict . with the clock ticking down to the final days before the next budget needs to be signed and sealed , the european union is locked in a major dispute over who pays how much into the eu pot - and , just as important , who receives what over the seven years from 2007-2013 . key sticking points are britain 's refusal to give ground on its budget rebate , and french resistance to surrendering support for eu farmers , which swallows about 40 percent of spending . but the stakes are also high for the eu 's newer member states , desperate to get hold of eu aid for infrastructure such as motorway and train links , left lagging behind western europe by decades of communism . more broadly , failure to agree on a budget would leave the eu scuffling over its budget on a year-by-year basis , threatening regular deadlock in a bloc already hobbled by the rejection of its constitution this year . britain , which holds the eu 's presidency , is set to make modified proposals after talks among foreign ministers monday , as preparation for a summit of the bloc 's leaders starting on thursday . london is still hopeful a deal can be struck . here are some basic facts about the eu budget : global spending the six main contributors to the budget - austria , britain , france , germany , the netherlands and sweden - want spending limited to about 1.0 percent of eu gross national income , or 815 billion euros -lrb- 954 billion dollars -rrb- . but the european commission wants a robust budget to pay for ambitious programs sought by member states and has called for payments of 943 billion euros -lrb- 1.14 percent of gni -rrb- over the 2007-2013 period , while the parliament suggests 883 billion euros would be enough . luxembourg , which tried to negotiate a budget deal in june when it held the eu 's presidency , offered a compromise of 875 billion euros but it was rejected by britain , finland , the netherlands , spain and sweden . london argued last week that the budget should be smaller and proposed an estimated 846.8 billion euros , an offer which has largely been rejected . net contributors the member states often concentrate on how much they pay into the budget and how little they get back - their net outlay .
in 2001 , an average german citizen " paid " 114 euros a year to the budget while the average spaniard " received " 180 euros . the three biggest net contributors , germany , the netherlands and sweden would like to see their burden reduced . farm aid : the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- under a franco-german initiative , farm spending was set in 2002 at a summit aimed at preparing for eu enlargement .
cap spending will stabilize from 2006 at around 45.5 billion euros annually , plus around one percent each year . france , the system 's major beneficiary as the union 's biggest agricultural producer , has so far refused to renegotiate the agreement , which is hotly contested by britain . britain 's rebate the british rebate , a jealously-guarded mechanism for reducing its financial burden because it profits little from subsidies , averaged 4.6 billion euros -lrb- 5.4 billion dollars , 3.1 billion pounds -rrb- annually between 1997 and 2003 . by last year , the rebate , which grows in proportion to eu spending , had reached 5.3 billion euros and is projected to average 7.1 billion euros annually for the 2007-2013 budget period . regional aid the 10 members who joined in may 2004 are waiting impatiently for eu regional funding , but until now it has been greece , ireland , italy , portugal and spain which have benefited most . despite fierce opposition , britain has proposed a cut in such aid to new member states on the grounds that newcomers are rarely able to absorb all of the eu money put in front of them . research and transport : eu 's future ? to help improve the eu 's competitiveness , the commission has proposed trebling the budgets for research and trans-european transport links .
britain has argued that the budget needs to be focused on more future-oriented programs such as research and education and less on agriculture . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de criticism prompts britain to promise new proposals eu leaders are trying to break a deadlock over the budget before a summit next week .

dw-world looks at the major areas of conflict . with the clock ticking down to the final days before the next budget needs to be signed and sealed , the european union is locked in a major dispute over who pays how much into the eu pot - and , just as important , who receives what over the seven years from 2007-2013 . key sticking points are britain 's refusal to give ground on its budget rebate , and french resistance to surrendering support for eu farmers , which swallows about 40 percent of spending . but the stakes are also high for the eu 's newer member states , desperate to get hold of eu aid for infrastructure such as motorway and train links , left lagging behind western europe by decades of communism . more broadly , failure to agree on a budget would leave the eu scuffling over its budget on a year-by-year basis , threatening regular deadlock in a bloc already hobbled by the rejection of its constitution this year . britain , which holds the eu 's presidency , is set to make modified proposals after talks among foreign ministers monday , as preparation for a summit of the bloc 's leaders starting on thursday . london is still hopeful a deal can be struck . here are some basic facts about the eu budget : global spending the six main contributors to the budget - austria , britain , france , germany , the netherlands and sweden - want spending limited to about 1.0 percent of eu gross national income , or 815 billion euros -lrb- 954 billion dollars -rrb- . but the european commission wants a robust budget to pay for ambitious programs sought by member states and has called for payments of 943 billion euros -lrb- 1.14 percent of gni -rrb- over the 2007-2013 period , while the parliament suggests 883 billion euros would be enough . luxembourg , which tried to negotiate a budget deal in june when it held the eu 's presidency , offered a compromise of 875 billion euros but it was rejected by britain , finland , the netherlands , spain and sweden . london argued last week that the budget should be smaller and proposed an estimated 846.8 billion euros , an offer which has largely been rejected . net contributors the member states often concentrate on how much they pay into the budget and how little they get back - their net outlay .
in 2001 , an average german citizen " paid " 114 euros a year to the budget while the average spaniard " received " 180 euros . the three biggest net contributors , germany , the netherlands and sweden would like to see their burden reduced . farm aid : the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- under a franco-german initiative , farm spending was set in 2002 at a summit aimed at preparing for eu enlargement .
cap spending will stabilize from 2006 at around 45.5 billion euros annually , plus around one percent each year . france , the system 's major beneficiary as the union 's biggest agricultural producer , has so far refused to renegotiate the agreement , which is hotly contested by britain . britain 's rebate the british rebate , a jealously-guarded mechanism for reducing its financial burden because it profits little from subsidies , averaged 4.6 billion euros -lrb- 5.4 billion dollars , 3.1 billion pounds -rrb- annually between 1997 and 2003 . by last year , the rebate , which grows in proportion to eu spending , had reached 5.3 billion euros and is projected to average 7.1 billion euros annually for the 2007-2013 budget period . regional aid the 10 members who joined in may 2004 are waiting impatiently for eu regional funding , but until now it has been greece , ireland , italy , portugal and spain which have benefited most . despite fierce opposition , britain has proposed a cut in such aid to new member states on the grounds that newcomers are rarely able to absorb all of the eu money put in front of them . research and transport : eu 's future ? to help improve the eu 's competitiveness , the commission has proposed trebling the budgets for research and trans-european transport links .
britain has argued that the budget needs to be focused on more future-oriented programs such as research and education and less on agriculture . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de criticism prompts britain to promise new proposals eu leaders are trying to break a deadlock over the budget before a summit next week .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.12.2005 no pipe and slippers for rejuvenated schröder großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-chancellor ; media consultant , businessman , student and beer connoisseur after running germany and sparring with some the world 's most powerful leaders for seven years , gerhard schröder could be excused for taking a rest .
but the ex-chancellor has no intention of putting his feet up . less than three weeks after leaving office , former german chancellor gerhard schröder has reinvented himself as an international businessman with concerns in russia and switzerland . schröder wasted no time in making a clean break with politics after he handed the reins of power to angela merkel on november 22 .
but his decision to delve into the world of international business has not been without a political fallout . on friday , the chairman of russian energy giant gazprom , alexei miller , announced that schröder would head the shareholders ' committee of the consortium building a controversial gas pipeline under the baltic sea from russia to germany . the announcement came just after the ceremonial launch of construction of the north european gas pipeline , in which gazprom owns a 51-percent stake and germany 's e.on and basf own 24.5-percent stakes . the appointment of schröder , who helped secure the deal for the four-billion-euro -lrb- $ 4.7-billion -rrb- pipeline earlier this year while he was still chancellor , has already sparked questions of potential conflict of interest and debate about the need for regulations for retired politicians moving into business . while newspaper commentators generally agreed the pipeline project was useful , they said schröder 's move raised fresh questions about the links between big business and politics and the cosy relations with putin when in office . questionable occupation " it stinks , " greens co-leader richard bütikofer , whose party was in power with schröder 's social democrats when the pipeline deal was struck , told tagesspiegel newspaper . " the problem is that he pursued a policy for the federal republic which he will now draw private benefit from , " argued dirk niebel of the opposition free democrats . there had long been speculation that schröder , 61 , was planning to trade in politics for the business world and more specifically that he would take on a high-level post in russia 's energy sector . close relationship with putin pays off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political counterparts and personal friends : putin and schröder .
during his seven years in office , schröder built up a close personal relationship with russian president vladimir putin , whom he often visited privately . in germany , many criticized schröder 's friendship with the russian leader , particularly his silence on moscow 's policies in the caucuses and its hard line in the yukos oil saga . the news that schröder will be sitting on the board of the gas pipeline casts a new " smudgy light " on the former government 's cool relations with poland and the baltic states , who were left out of the pipeline project , the berlin tagesspiegel wrote on saturday .
however , the german chairman of corruption watchdog transparency international said there was no reason for alarm . " a supervisory board post is in our view certainly something that a former prominent politician can take up , " hansjoerg elshorst told tagesspiegel .

" it lasted 45 seconds , " one said .
straw merely said london would put forward revised proposals during the week but added that london would not pay any price for an agreement . " we 're not in for a deal at any price , " straw told reporters , referring to the pressure britain has been under to relinquish more of its annual rebate to fund aid to new east european members in the budget . straw ’ s stance makes it look increasingly unlikely that that there would be any concessions on the long-term eu budget when the ministers of the 25-nation bloc convene on wednesday .
when pressed on whether there was a chance of an accord being agreed upon on thursday and friday , straw told reporters : " i ca n't say . " it was a further slap in the face for eu officials who are keen to avoid a damaging split over the budget akin to the crisis resulting from the bloc ’ s failure to ratify its own constitution . barroso appeals to blair but to little avail bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actions not words suggest that tony blair has ignored jose barroso 's appeals .
in an attempt to prevent another schism in the eu , european commission president jose manuel barroso had personally appealed to british prime minister tony blair for a rapid resolution , urging him to find a workable alternative to the existing proposals . barroso , pressing the point that britain bore a special responsibility to ensure that talks did not collapse as they did at the acrimonious constitution summit last june , also asked blair to raise overall eu spending and offer deeper and permanent cuts to britain ’ s controversial rebate . on evidence , barroso ’ s words have fallen on deaf ears and have instilled a sense of dread in the eu president ahead of the summit this week .
" as somebody put it , to fail once is unfortunate .
to fail twice would be careless , " barroso told reporters . the package britain put forward last week proposed a cut of 14 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.49 billion -rrb- or 8.5 percent in aid to poor ex-communist newcomers to the bloc and detailed a continued rise of britain ’ s own rebate over the next seven years .
it was almost unanimously rejected . newest eu members facing huge bill if talks fail bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the talks fail , come 2007 the new states will have pay up .
barroso highlighted the need to support the newest eu members when he spoke on monday .
" new member states must be offered a fairer deal .
i believe they need to be offered significantly higher levels of investment than in the current proposal . "
failure to reach a deal will immediately cost the new states cash in 2007 .
despite the ominous signs , barroso added that the " urgent , necessary " budget deal was " within reach . " not according to jack straw it isn ’ t .
the foreign secretary maintained that those members expecting big changes to the proposals would be disappointed , hinting at a set of plans not too different that were thrown out last week . " we are thinking about revisions to those proposals , and those revisions , if indeed there are any , will be made available in the course of this week .
these are difficult negotiations .
the margin for maneuver is narrow , " he said . britain thought it had the deal in the bag when it offered to forego 8 billion euros over seven years from its rebate , worth 5.6 billion euros this year , to meet what it called its fair share of the costs of the eu 's eastward enlargement last year . britain 's full share of the non-agricultural costs of enlargement would in fact be 18 billion euros , according to european union financial experts .
france put the figure at 14 billion . france wants rebate cut in return for cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french foreign minister philippe douste- blazy wants a massive cut in britain 's rebate .
the french weighed in with particular relish in the row over the british rebate , saying that it should be cut to 35-36 billion euros over the period instead of the 50 billion it would reach without reform .
french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy insisted that the reduction should be a " permanent legal commitment . " as an incentive , douste-blazy said that paris would allow a future review of the entire budget as long as the 2007-13 package , which has provisions included for the protection of french agriculture , remained guaranteed . officials close to the british contingent said that there was a fair chance that the new proposals , due on wednesday , would include a slight increase in the amount but by nothing like the amounts suggested by brussels or paris .

the british presidency has simply disregarded the constitution topic , and " made a mess of it , " according to one eu worker , who spoke off the record .
in general , the british had to " be pushed to engage " with any important topics , an eu diplomat said .
a constitutional crisis ?
the ratification process for the constitution was put on ice by eu leaders in june following a rejection of the new treaty by french and dutch voters .
since the text of the constitution itself can not be changed and a second round of referenda on the same text is unlikely , the eu finds itself between a rock and a hard place . a solution must be found by next summer ; in autumn 2006 at the latest , the eu council - the heads of state who make up the union 's main decision-making body - must officially decide on the constitution 's future . eu expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigration from africa is a growing problem for the eu on the foreign-policy agendy , monday 's meeting is expected to recommend that macedonia - previously a part of yugoslavia - be allowed candidacy status for acceptance into the european union .
however , the council of ministers is expected to make it clear that concrete negotiations over eu entry are still far off , and that no specific date can be named . in a related topic , a number of member states have requested earnest debate over the future expansion plans of the current 25-member bloc , which many feel is admitting new members far too quickly .
what the union really needs is a consolidation phase , many diplomats say . fighting poverty in africa also on monday , foreign ministers are expected to adopt an overall strategy for eu relations with africa .
ministers agree that the neighboring continent needs more attention ; the goal is long-term development and economic partnership , if only as a means of staunching the flow of illegal refugees to europe .
the european union wants to enter a strategic partnership with all of africa 's approximately 50 states , in order to reach the eu millennium goals of fighting poverty by 2015 .
the foreign ministers are also very likely to vehemently reject the latest comments by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's steinmeier wants to focus on the eu constitution german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has put pressure on the gathering to at least come up with a time frame for further " reflection " on the eu constitutional crisis .
the british presidency has simply disregarded the constitution topic , and " made a mess of it , " according to one eu worker , who spoke off the record .

a constitutional crisis ?
the ratification process for the constitution was put on ice by eu leaders in june following a rejection of the new treaty by french and dutch voters .
since the text of the constitution itself can not be changed and a second round of referenda on the same text is unlikely , the eu finds itself between a rock and a hard place . a solution must be found by next summer ; in autumn 2006 at the latest , the eu council - the heads of state who make up the union 's main decision-making body - must officially decide on the constitution 's future . eu expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigration from africa is a growing problem for the eu on the foreign-policy agendy , monday 's meeting is expected to recommend that macedonia - previously a part of yugoslavia - be allowed candidacy status for acceptance into the european union .
however , the council of ministers is expected to make it clear that concrete negotiations over eu entry are still far off , and that no specific date can be named . in a related topic , a number of member states have requested earnest debate over the future expansion plans of the current 25-member bloc , which many feel is admitting new members far too quickly .
what the union really needs is a consolidation phase , many diplomats say . fighting poverty in africa also on monday , foreign ministers are expected to adopt an overall strategy for eu relations with africa .
ministers agree that the neighboring continent needs more attention ; the goal is long-term development and economic partnership , if only as a means of staunching the flow of illegal refugees to europe .
the european union wants to enter a strategic partnership with all of africa 's approximately 50 states , in order to reach the eu millennium goals of fighting poverty by 2015 .
the foreign ministers are also very likely to vehemently reject the latest comments by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .

" it lasted 45 seconds , " one said .
straw merely said london would put forward revised proposals during the week but added that london would not pay any price for an agreement . " we 're not in for a deal at any price , " straw told reporters , referring to the pressure britain has been under to relinquish more of its annual rebate to fund aid to new east european members in the budget . straw ’ s stance makes it look increasingly unlikely that that there would be any concessions on the long-term eu budget when the ministers of the 25-nation bloc convene on wednesday .
when pressed on whether there was a chance of an accord being agreed upon on thursday and friday , straw told reporters : " i ca n't say .

in an attempt to prevent another schism in the eu , european commission president jose manuel barroso had personally appealed to british prime minister tony blair for a rapid resolution , urging him to find a workable alternative to the existing proposals . barroso , pressing the point that britain bore a special responsibility to ensure that talks did not collapse as they did at the acrimonious constitution summit last june , also asked blair to raise overall eu spending and offer deeper and permanent cuts to britain ’ s controversial rebate . on evidence , barroso ’ s words have fallen on deaf ears and have instilled a sense of dread in the eu president ahead of the summit this week .
" as somebody put it , to fail once is unfortunate .
to fail twice would be careless , " barroso told reporters . the package britain put forward last week proposed a cut of 14 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.49 billion -rrb- or 8.5 percent in aid to poor ex-communist newcomers to the bloc and detailed a continued rise of britain ’ s own rebate over the next seven years .

barroso highlighted the need to support the newest eu members when he spoke on monday .
" new member states must be offered a fairer deal .
i believe they need to be offered significantly higher levels of investment than in the current proposal . "
failure to reach a deal will immediately cost the new states cash in 2007 .
despite the ominous signs , barroso added that the " urgent , necessary " budget deal was " within reach . " not according to jack straw it isn ’ t .
the foreign secretary maintained that those members expecting big changes to the proposals would be disappointed , hinting at a set of plans not too different that were thrown out last week . " we are thinking about revisions to those proposals , and those revisions , if indeed there are any , will be made available in the course of this week .
these are difficult negotiations .
the margin for maneuver is narrow , " he said . britain thought it had the deal in the bag when it offered to forego 8 billion euros over seven years from its rebate , worth 5.6 billion euros this year , to meet what it called its fair share of the costs of the eu 's eastward enlargement last year . britain 's full share of the non-agricultural costs of enlargement would in fact be 18 billion euros , according to european union financial experts .

french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy insisted that the reduction should be a " permanent legal commitment .

but the ex-chancellor has no intention of putting his feet up . less than three weeks after leaving office , former german chancellor gerhard schröder has reinvented himself as an international businessman with concerns in russia and switzerland . schröder wasted no time in making a clean break with politics after he handed the reins of power to angela merkel on november 22 .
but his decision to delve into the world of international business has not been without a political fallout . on friday , the chairman of russian energy giant gazprom , alexei miller , announced that schröder would head the shareholders ' committee of the consortium building a controversial gas pipeline under the baltic sea from russia to germany . the announcement came just after the ceremonial launch of construction of the north european gas pipeline , in which gazprom owns a 51-percent stake and germany 's e.on and basf own 24.5-percent stakes . the appointment of schröder , who helped secure the deal for the four-billion-euro -lrb- $ 4.7-billion -rrb- pipeline earlier this year while he was still chancellor , has already sparked questions of potential conflict of interest and debate about the need for regulations for retired politicians moving into business . while newspaper commentators generally agreed the pipeline project was useful , they said schröder 's move raised fresh questions about the links between big business and politics and the cosy relations with putin when in office . questionable occupation " it stinks , " greens co-leader richard bütikofer , whose party was in power with schröder 's social democrats when the pipeline deal was struck , told tagesspiegel newspaper . " the problem is that he pursued a policy for the federal republic which he will now draw private benefit from , " argued dirk niebel of the opposition free democrats . there had long been speculation that schröder , 61 , was planning to trade in politics for the business world and more specifically that he would take on a high-level post in russia 's energy sector . close relationship with putin pays off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political counterparts and personal friends : putin and schröder .
during his seven years in office , schröder built up a close personal relationship with russian president vladimir putin , whom he often visited privately . in germany , many criticized schröder 's friendship with the russian leader , particularly his silence on moscow 's policies in the caucuses and its hard line in the yukos oil saga . the news that schröder will be sitting on the board of the gas pipeline casts a new " smudgy light " on the former government 's cool relations with poland and the baltic states , who were left out of the pipeline project , the berlin tagesspiegel wrote on saturday .
however , the german chairman of corruption watchdog transparency international said there was no reason for alarm . " a supervisory board post is in our view certainly something that a former prominent politician can take up , " hansjoerg elshorst told tagesspiegel . " one can only talk of abuse if schröder receives excessive reward , " he said . media chancellor turns media consultant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder was equally at home in front of the camera as he was the lecturn .
far less critical was schröder 's decision to dabble in media .
the man often called the media chancellor for his skill in playing to the cameras has accepted a job as an advisor to leading swiss media group , ringier . the group publishes the blick tabloid , switzerland 's top-selling newspaper , and also has interests in eastern europe , china and vietnam . the post at zurich-based ringier came as something of a surprise as schröder had told the german press he intended to return to his first profession of practicing law . english lessons to broaden future horizons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " what did tony say ? "
perhaps to smooth his way in the business world , the former chancellor has started brushing up on his english , which he has always freely admitted to be poor .
according to german press reports , he has recently been improving his english skills in the small town of montgomery on the border of england and wales . they said schröder was taking private courses aimed at " business and professional people " at park house school , situated in an 18th century country house in montgomery , and had been seen enjoying a few glasses of wine at the local pub , the dragon hotel , in his free time . the social-democrat has never made a secret of enjoying the good life and is an ardent soccer fan , something which has now also found a mention on his curriculum vitae . soccer fanaticism honored by dfb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nasty tracksuit , good technique : schröder on the ball .
the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- on friday made him an honorary member for his support for germany 's successful bid to host the 2006 world cup and for the organization of the tournament , which will be played in 12 german cities from june 9 to july 9 next year . in the meanwhile , schröder is also writing his political memoirs , which he hopes to publish next autumn . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder ponders life after chancellery now that germany has a new leader , there is much speculation about the future of outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder .

his name is hans riegel , and millions of children around the world get their first sugar rush chewing on his sticky candies . it is practically impossible to find a kid in this world that does n't have a sweet tooth .
it is this law of nature that made hans riegel , junior , one of the richest germans living today . his assets , like those of his brother paul , have been estimated to 1.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- haribo , the international sweets giant with an estimated annual turnover of 1.5 billion euros , holds a 60 % market share on licorice and fruit drops in germany , and is undisputed number one in europe .
in the eighties , it crossed the big pond and started expanding in the united states .
in the nineties , it discovered eastern europe .
the world of gummy bears knows no borders . hans riegel , senior , confectioner from bonn , founded the family business in 1920 and gave it the exotic sounding name haribo , which was , in fact , an acronym consisting of his initials and the city of bonn .
but it was really hans junior , who took over the family business after the second world war , that turned it into an international success story . tradition and change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the summer of 2005 , haribo organized a licorice-inspired fashion show it is a well-established part of the haribo corporate mythology that , at least in the first few years of developing their business , hans senior and his wife gertrud used to deliver their products on their own , by bicycle .
hans junior , who prepared himself for his later career by earning a doctorate from the university of bonn on the role of sugar in world trade , does n't have to play delivery boy anymore because haribo candies are now sold over the world .
but he does like to fly his own chopper to a business meeting . what has n't changed over the years is the soul of the family business : hans riegel sits at the top of the gummy bear pyramid and rules supreme in a somewhat antiquated managerial style .
as a patriarchic figurehead who believes more in trust and authority than focus groups and marketing departments , this active octogenarian has single-handedly turned his father 's business into a major player on the world market .
he is known to have said that " without haribo , my life has no meaning . " tradition means everything to hans riegel .
the original haribo advertising slogan - " haribo macht kinder froh , " which literally means " haribo makes children happy " and , luckily enough , rhymes in german - was sold to riegel senior in the thirties by a traveling salesman .
the slogan was updated only once , in the sixties , to welcome the paying adults into the fairy world of gum drops : " kids and grown-ups love it so , the happy world of haribo . " techno grandpa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions of gummy bear leave the haribo factories on a daily basis in 1994 , riegel was awarded the order of the federal republic of germany , 1st class , -lrb- bundesverdienstkreuz -rrb- for his services to society .
he is a a self-proclaimed fan of techno music , who likes to follow latest trends “ i love kids and i enjoy watching them .
they are my customers , i have to know what sweets they enjoy , what they think , what language they speak , " riegel said . since 1991 , haribo has been advertised in germany by thomas gottschalk , an aging entertainer who is also a household name in germany .
the riegel-gottschalk partnership is the said to be the most successful advertising campaign in german history , although younger german entertainers , like the popular stefan raab , enjoy making fun of gottschalk 's not very convincing attempts to use slang in haribo ads . the gummy bear dynasty is in no shortage of males called hans .

the row comes just before nuclear talks with tehran . recent remarks by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad about the veracity of the holocaust and that israel be relocated to europe prompted a harsh reaction from german vice chancellor franz müntefering on sunday . " whatever is said will one day be desired to be done , " the employment and social welfare minister said after a meeting in berlin with paul spiegel , president of the central council of jews in germany . müntefering was referring to the iranian president 's comments in which he called on germany and austria to host a state of israel on their soil if they felt responsible for murdering jews during world war ii .
ahmadinejad , who in october said israel should be " wiped off the map , " also described the jewish state as a " tumor . " " unacceptable " comments , says merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul spiegel , head of the central council of jews spiegel has described the comments as the worst anti-semitic attack by a statesman since adolf hitler and called on germany to sever diplomatic ties with iran . chancellor angela merkel described the remarks as " totally unacceptable " and the german government announced it would protest to the iranian ambassador . analysts say the comments were an attempt by ahmedinejad , an ex-member of the revolutionary guard , to woo iranian radicals in the regime who relish confrontation with the west . but tehran said it was surprised the international community had so vehemently condemned ahmedinejad 's remarks . " i 'm surprised by the reaction to these comments .
the president 's statements were clear : if the europeans have treated the jews badly , they have to compensate at their own expense , not at the expense of the region , " iran 's foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi told reporters . bad omen before nuclear talks the controversy over ahmadinejad 's verbal attacks against israel has cast a shadow over upcoming negotiations between the eu-3 , britain , france and germany , and tehran over iran 's nuclear fuel program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : photo of reported nuclear area in iran where uranium enrichment could be taking place iran has taken an increasingly hardline stance in its dialog with the international atomic energy agency and the european union over what it says is its right to produce nuclear energy for its electricity sector , but which the west fears could be secretly diverted to developing nuclear weapons . talks are intended to resume on december 21 in vienna after a four-month break .

his name is hans riegel , and millions of children around the world get their first sugar rush chewing on his sticky candies . it is practically impossible to find a kid in this world that does n't have a sweet tooth .

in the eighties , it crossed the big pond and started expanding in the united states .
in the nineties , it discovered eastern europe .
the world of gummy bears knows no borders . hans riegel , senior , confectioner from bonn , founded the family business in 1920 and gave it the exotic sounding name haribo , which was , in fact , an acronym consisting of his initials and the city of bonn .
but it was really hans junior , who took over the family business after the second world war , that turned it into an international success story . tradition and change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the summer of 2005 , haribo organized a licorice-inspired fashion show it is a well-established part of the haribo corporate mythology that , at least in the first few years of developing their business , hans senior and his wife gertrud used to deliver their products on their own , by bicycle .
hans junior , who prepared himself for his later career by earning a doctorate from the university of bonn on the role of sugar in world trade , does n't have to play delivery boy anymore because haribo candies are now sold over the world .
but he does like to fly his own chopper to a business meeting . what has n't changed over the years is the soul of the family business : hans riegel sits at the top of the gummy bear pyramid and rules supreme in a somewhat antiquated managerial style .
as a patriarchic figurehead who believes more in trust and authority than focus groups and marketing departments , this active octogenarian has single-handedly turned his father 's business into a major player on the world market .
he is known to have said that " without haribo , my life has no meaning . " tradition means everything to hans riegel .
the original haribo advertising slogan - " haribo macht kinder froh , " which literally means " haribo makes children happy " and , luckily enough , rhymes in german - was sold to riegel senior in the thirties by a traveling salesman .
the slogan was updated only once , in the sixties , to welcome the paying adults into the fairy world of gum drops : " kids and grown-ups love it so , the happy world of haribo . " techno grandpa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions of gummy bear leave the haribo factories on a daily basis in 1994 , riegel was awarded the order of the federal republic of germany , 1st class , -lrb- bundesverdienstkreuz -rrb- for his services to society .

they are my customers , i have to know what sweets they enjoy , what they think , what language they speak , " riegel said . since 1991 , haribo has been advertised in germany by thomas gottschalk , an aging entertainer who is also a household name in germany .
the riegel-gottschalk partnership is the said to be the most successful advertising campaign in german history , although younger german entertainers , like the popular stefan raab , enjoy making fun of gottschalk 's not very convincing attempts to use slang in haribo ads . the gummy bear dynasty is in no shortage of males called hans .

his name is hans riegel , and millions of children around the world get their first sugar rush chewing on his sticky candies . it is practically impossible to find a kid in this world that does n't have a sweet tooth .
it is this law of nature that made hans riegel , junior , one of the richest germans living today . his assets , like those of his brother paul , have been estimated to 1.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- haribo , the international sweets giant with an estimated annual turnover of 1.5 billion euros , holds a 60 % market share on licorice and fruit drops in germany , and is undisputed number one in europe .
in the eighties , it crossed the big pond and started expanding in the united states .
in the nineties , it discovered eastern europe .
the world of gummy bears knows no borders . hans riegel , senior , confectioner from bonn , founded the family business in 1920 and gave it the exotic sounding name haribo , which was , in fact , an acronym consisting of his initials and the city of bonn .
but it was really hans junior , who took over the family business after the second world war , that turned it into an international success story . tradition and change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the summer of 2005 , haribo organized a licorice-inspired fashion show it is a well-established part of the haribo corporate mythology that , at least in the first few years of developing their business , hans senior and his wife gertrud used to deliver their products on their own , by bicycle .
hans junior , who prepared himself for his later career by earning a doctorate from the university of bonn on the role of sugar in world trade , does n't have to play delivery boy anymore because haribo candies are now sold over the world .
but he does like to fly his own chopper to a business meeting . what has n't changed over the years is the soul of the family business : hans riegel sits at the top of the gummy bear pyramid and rules supreme in a somewhat antiquated managerial style .
as a patriarchic figurehead who believes more in trust and authority than focus groups and marketing departments , this active octogenarian has single-handedly turned his father 's business into a major player on the world market .
he is known to have said that " without haribo , my life has no meaning . " tradition means everything to hans riegel .
the original haribo advertising slogan - " haribo macht kinder froh , " which literally means " haribo makes children happy " and , luckily enough , rhymes in german - was sold to riegel senior in the thirties by a traveling salesman .
the slogan was updated only once , in the sixties , to welcome the paying adults into the fairy world of gum drops : " kids and grown-ups love it so , the happy world of haribo . " techno grandpa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions of gummy bear leave the haribo factories on a daily basis in 1994 , riegel was awarded the order of the federal republic of germany , 1st class , -lrb- bundesverdienstkreuz -rrb- for his services to society .
he is a a self-proclaimed fan of techno music , who likes to follow latest trends “ i love kids and i enjoy watching them .
they are my customers , i have to know what sweets they enjoy , what they think , what language they speak , " riegel said . since 1991 , haribo has been advertised in germany by thomas gottschalk , an aging entertainer who is also a household name in germany .
the riegel-gottschalk partnership is the said to be the most successful advertising campaign in german history , although younger german entertainers , like the popular stefan raab , enjoy making fun of gottschalk 's not very convincing attempts to use slang in haribo ads . the gummy bear dynasty is in no shortage of males called hans .
hans junior inherited the family business from his father , hans senior , and he is likely to leave the throne to his nephew hans-jürgen , who is currently running a haribo factory in france .
the dynasty will probably live on . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de richest germans : silver spoon baby albert ii , prince of thurn and taxis was born into his wealthy surroundings , and at the tender age of just 22 , he is not only the hereditary head of the family estate , but officially germany 's youngest billionaire .

these are the knockout stage matches and will be filled if your country advances to that stage . the national associations dictate the sales process in their country . the world soccer body fifa , which has alone sold tickets so far , also has more on sale .
the opening match between germany and costa rica is already sold out and there is only a limited supply for the most in-demand matches , such as the finals and semifinals . the deadline for this phase is january 15 , 2006 and the lottery will be held on january 31 .

us officials acknowledged to the german government in 2004 that the man had been mistaken for somebody else and had been wrongly detained . foreign minister steinmeier , who already held a ministerial post in the schröder government , has vehemently denied german involvement in the affair .
he is expected to inform the german parliament and the public about the case in great detail this coming wednesday . unpleasant questions the question that el masri himself and leading german opposition figures have been asking is whether government officials assisted the abduction and detention of el masri in any way in a bid to improve german-us relations which had turned sour over the us-led war in iraq .
but german ministers at the weekend again denied any involvement by berlin in the abduction masterminded by the cia .
german deputy-chancellor franz müntefering indicated that media reports about possible government involvement were groundless . " what we are being confronted with is mere speculation , " müntefering said . " if people knew what happened as they claim , calls for a parliamentary inquiry would seem even more foolish .

the el masri case will be debated in detail in the foreign and interior parliamentary committees before the foreign minister answers questions in the bundestag on wednesday .
social democrat floor leader and former defense minister peter struck is confident the el masri affair will not bring the new german government to its knees .

he wants all the facts on the table this week to ensure that the affair does not linger on into 2006 . meanwhile , a german daily reported on sunday that el masri was already under observation by german intelligence when he was abducted by the cia .

us officials acknowledged to the german government in 2004 that the man had been mistaken for somebody else and had been wrongly detained . foreign minister steinmeier , who already held a ministerial post in the schröder government , has vehemently denied german involvement in the affair .
he is expected to inform the german parliament and the public about the case in great detail this coming wednesday . unpleasant questions the question that el masri himself and leading german opposition figures have been asking is whether government officials assisted the abduction and detention of el masri in any way in a bid to improve german-us relations which had turned sour over the us-led war in iraq .
but german ministers at the weekend again denied any involvement by berlin in the abduction masterminded by the cia .
german deputy-chancellor franz müntefering indicated that media reports about possible government involvement were groundless . " what we are being confronted with is mere speculation , " müntefering said . " if people knew what happened as they claim , calls for a parliamentary inquiry would seem even more foolish .

steinmeier has repeatedly rejected opposition calls for his resignation , maintaining that the actions of the government were based on the law . but steinmeier is certainly sensing a need to inform the public about what happened in 2003 .
the el masri case will be debated in detail in the foreign and interior parliamentary committees before the foreign minister answers questions in the bundestag on wednesday .
social democrat floor leader and former defense minister peter struck is confident the el masri affair will not bring the new german government to its knees . " there 's no doubt that the german government would have violated the law , had it assisted in the abduction of a german citizen , " stuck said . " but from what i know at present , government offices were not involved and i have no reason to believe that we 'll see a different picture emerging by the end of this week , " he said . a touchstone for the new government wolfgang bosbach , a leading christian democrat lawmaker , said that the el mari case was clearly becoming a touchstone for the new government .
he wants all the facts on the table this week to ensure that the affair does not linger on into 2006 . meanwhile , a german daily reported on sunday that el masri was already under observation by german intelligence when he was abducted by the cia .

250,000 seats will be made available starting on monday in the fourth sales period . the organizing committee for the 2006 world cup in germany expects demand to soar when the fourth sales period of 250,000 tickets begins on monday at 12:00 noon cet -lrb- 1100 gmt -rrb- .
following friday 's draw fans of the 32 competing nations now know where and when their teams are playing and a mad ticket rush is anticipated . " we can sense the interest from participating teams and from neighboring countries increasing enormously , " said horst r. schmidt , vice-president of the organizing committee . tickets from world and national associations fans from abroad , if they did n't try to order tickets blindly in one of the first three phases , have two paths to choose from when ordering this time . they can turn to their national teams .
the 32 countries ' individual associations all received an allocation of eight percent of the tickets for the group phase matches they are playing in .
in addition , there are " conditional tickets " that can be ordered .
these are the knockout stage matches and will be filled if your country advances to that stage . the national associations dictate the sales process in their country . the world soccer body fifa , which has alone sold tickets so far , also has more on sale .
the opening match between germany and costa rica is already sold out and there is only a limited supply for the most in-demand matches , such as the finals and semifinals . the deadline for this phase is january 15 , 2006 and the lottery will be held on january 31 .
any unsold tickets then will be offered on a first come , first served basis starting february 15 . first phases massively oversubscribed the possibility that at that point , there are any more tickets remaining in the hands of fifa or the 32 national associations must be close to nil .
when the first sales window started earlier this year , there were over eight million orders for 812,000 tickets .
up to now , 80 percent of the tickets available have been snapped up by europeans according to the world cup committee . " we assume the demand will far outstrip the contingent this time again .

dw-world looks at the major areas of conflict . with the clock ticking down to the final days before the next budget needs to be signed and sealed , the european union is locked in a major dispute over who pays how much into the eu pot - and , just as important , who receives what over the seven years from 2007-2013 . key sticking points are britain 's refusal to give ground on its budget rebate , and french resistance to surrendering support for eu farmers , which swallows about 40 percent of spending . but the stakes are also high for the eu 's newer member states , desperate to get hold of eu aid for infrastructure such as motorway and train links , left lagging behind western europe by decades of communism . more broadly , failure to agree on a budget would leave the eu scuffling over its budget on a year-by-year basis , threatening regular deadlock in a bloc already hobbled by the rejection of its constitution this year . britain , which holds the eu 's presidency , is set to make modified proposals after talks among foreign ministers monday , as preparation for a summit of the bloc 's leaders starting on thursday . london is still hopeful a deal can be struck . here are some basic facts about the eu budget : global spending the six main contributors to the budget - austria , britain , france , germany , the netherlands and sweden - want spending limited to about 1.0 percent of eu gross national income , or 815 billion euros -lrb- 954 billion dollars -rrb- . but the european commission wants a robust budget to pay for ambitious programs sought by member states and has called for payments of 943 billion euros -lrb- 1.14 percent of gni -rrb- over the 2007-2013 period , while the parliament suggests 883 billion euros would be enough . luxembourg , which tried to negotiate a budget deal in june when it held the eu 's presidency , offered a compromise of 875 billion euros but it was rejected by britain , finland , the netherlands , spain and sweden . london argued last week that the budget should be smaller and proposed an estimated 846.8 billion euros , an offer which has largely been rejected . net contributors the member states often concentrate on how much they pay into the budget and how little they get back - their net outlay .
in 2001 , an average german citizen " paid " 114 euros a year to the budget while the average spaniard " received " 180 euros . the three biggest net contributors , germany , the netherlands and sweden would like to see their burden reduced . farm aid : the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- under a franco-german initiative , farm spending was set in 2002 at a summit aimed at preparing for eu enlargement .
cap spending will stabilize from 2006 at around 45.5 billion euros annually , plus around one percent each year . france , the system 's major beneficiary as the union 's biggest agricultural producer , has so far refused to renegotiate the agreement , which is hotly contested by britain . britain 's rebate the british rebate , a jealously-guarded mechanism for reducing its financial burden because it profits little from subsidies , averaged 4.6 billion euros -lrb- 5.4 billion dollars , 3.1 billion pounds -rrb- annually between 1997 and 2003 . by last year , the rebate , which grows in proportion to eu spending , had reached 5.3 billion euros and is projected to average 7.1 billion euros annually for the 2007-2013 budget period . regional aid the 10 members who joined in may 2004 are waiting impatiently for eu regional funding , but until now it has been greece , ireland , italy , portugal and spain which have benefited most . despite fierce opposition , britain has proposed a cut in such aid to new member states on the grounds that newcomers are rarely able to absorb all of the eu money put in front of them . research and transport : eu 's future ? to help improve the eu 's competitiveness , the commission has proposed trebling the budgets for research and trans-european transport links .
britain has argued that the budget needs to be focused on more future-oriented programs such as research and education and less on agriculture . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de criticism prompts britain to promise new proposals eu leaders are trying to break a deadlock over the budget before a summit next week .

" it lasted 45 seconds , " one said .
straw merely said london would put forward revised proposals during the week but added that london would not pay any price for an agreement . " we 're not in for a deal at any price , " straw told reporters , referring to the pressure britain has been under to relinquish more of its annual rebate to fund aid to new east european members in the budget . straw ’ s stance makes it look increasingly unlikely that that there would be any concessions on the long-term eu budget when the ministers of the 25-nation bloc convene on wednesday .
when pressed on whether there was a chance of an accord being agreed upon on thursday and friday , straw told reporters : " i ca n't say . " it was a further slap in the face for eu officials who are keen to avoid a damaging split over the budget akin to the crisis resulting from the bloc ’ s failure to ratify its own constitution . barroso appeals to blair but to little avail bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actions not words suggest that tony blair has ignored jose barroso 's appeals .
in an attempt to prevent another schism in the eu , european commission president jose manuel barroso had personally appealed to british prime minister tony blair for a rapid resolution , urging him to find a workable alternative to the existing proposals . barroso , pressing the point that britain bore a special responsibility to ensure that talks did not collapse as they did at the acrimonious constitution summit last june , also asked blair to raise overall eu spending and offer deeper and permanent cuts to britain ’ s controversial rebate . on evidence , barroso ’ s words have fallen on deaf ears and have instilled a sense of dread in the eu president ahead of the summit this week .
" as somebody put it , to fail once is unfortunate .
to fail twice would be careless , " barroso told reporters . the package britain put forward last week proposed a cut of 14 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.49 billion -rrb- or 8.5 percent in aid to poor ex-communist newcomers to the bloc and detailed a continued rise of britain ’ s own rebate over the next seven years .
it was almost unanimously rejected . newest eu members facing huge bill if talks fail bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the talks fail , come 2007 the new states will have pay up .
barroso highlighted the need to support the newest eu members when he spoke on monday .
" new member states must be offered a fairer deal .
i believe they need to be offered significantly higher levels of investment than in the current proposal . "
failure to reach a deal will immediately cost the new states cash in 2007 .
despite the ominous signs , barroso added that the " urgent , necessary " budget deal was " within reach . " not according to jack straw it isn ’ t .
the foreign secretary maintained that those members expecting big changes to the proposals would be disappointed , hinting at a set of plans not too different that were thrown out last week . " we are thinking about revisions to those proposals , and those revisions , if indeed there are any , will be made available in the course of this week .
these are difficult negotiations .
the margin for maneuver is narrow , " he said . britain thought it had the deal in the bag when it offered to forego 8 billion euros over seven years from its rebate , worth 5.6 billion euros this year , to meet what it called its fair share of the costs of the eu 's eastward enlargement last year . britain 's full share of the non-agricultural costs of enlargement would in fact be 18 billion euros , according to european union financial experts .
france put the figure at 14 billion . france wants rebate cut in return for cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french foreign minister philippe douste- blazy wants a massive cut in britain 's rebate .
the french weighed in with particular relish in the row over the british rebate , saying that it should be cut to 35-36 billion euros over the period instead of the 50 billion it would reach without reform .
french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy insisted that the reduction should be a " permanent legal commitment . " as an incentive , douste-blazy said that paris would allow a future review of the entire budget as long as the 2007-13 package , which has provisions included for the protection of french agriculture , remained guaranteed . officials close to the british contingent said that there was a fair chance that the new proposals , due on wednesday , would include a slight increase in the amount but by nothing like the amounts suggested by brussels or paris .

" it lasted 45 seconds , " one said .
straw merely said london would put forward revised proposals during the week but added that london would not pay any price for an agreement . " we 're not in for a deal at any price , " straw told reporters , referring to the pressure britain has been under to relinquish more of its annual rebate to fund aid to new east european members in the budget . straw ’ s stance makes it look increasingly unlikely that that there would be any concessions on the long-term eu budget when the ministers of the 25-nation bloc convene on wednesday .
when pressed on whether there was a chance of an accord being agreed upon on thursday and friday , straw told reporters : " i ca n't say . " it was a further slap in the face for eu officials who are keen to avoid a damaging split over the budget akin to the crisis resulting from the bloc ’ s failure to ratify its own constitution . barroso appeals to blair but to little avail bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actions not words suggest that tony blair has ignored jose barroso 's appeals .
in an attempt to prevent another schism in the eu , european commission president jose manuel barroso had personally appealed to british prime minister tony blair for a rapid resolution , urging him to find a workable alternative to the existing proposals . barroso , pressing the point that britain bore a special responsibility to ensure that talks did not collapse as they did at the acrimonious constitution summit last june , also asked blair to raise overall eu spending and offer deeper and permanent cuts to britain ’ s controversial rebate . on evidence , barroso ’ s words have fallen on deaf ears and have instilled a sense of dread in the eu president ahead of the summit this week .
" as somebody put it , to fail once is unfortunate .
to fail twice would be careless , " barroso told reporters . the package britain put forward last week proposed a cut of 14 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.49 billion -rrb- or 8.5 percent in aid to poor ex-communist newcomers to the bloc and detailed a continued rise of britain ’ s own rebate over the next seven years .
it was almost unanimously rejected . newest eu members facing huge bill if talks fail bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the talks fail , come 2007 the new states will have pay up .
barroso highlighted the need to support the newest eu members when he spoke on monday .
" new member states must be offered a fairer deal .
i believe they need to be offered significantly higher levels of investment than in the current proposal . "
failure to reach a deal will immediately cost the new states cash in 2007 .
despite the ominous signs , barroso added that the " urgent , necessary " budget deal was " within reach . " not according to jack straw it isn ’ t .
the foreign secretary maintained that those members expecting big changes to the proposals would be disappointed , hinting at a set of plans not too different that were thrown out last week . " we are thinking about revisions to those proposals , and those revisions , if indeed there are any , will be made available in the course of this week .
these are difficult negotiations .
the margin for maneuver is narrow , " he said . britain thought it had the deal in the bag when it offered to forego 8 billion euros over seven years from its rebate , worth 5.6 billion euros this year , to meet what it called its fair share of the costs of the eu 's eastward enlargement last year . britain 's full share of the non-agricultural costs of enlargement would in fact be 18 billion euros , according to european union financial experts .
france put the figure at 14 billion . france wants rebate cut in return for cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french foreign minister philippe douste- blazy wants a massive cut in britain 's rebate .
the french weighed in with particular relish in the row over the british rebate , saying that it should be cut to 35-36 billion euros over the period instead of the 50 billion it would reach without reform .
french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy insisted that the reduction should be a " permanent legal commitment . " as an incentive , douste-blazy said that paris would allow a future review of the entire budget as long as the 2007-13 package , which has provisions included for the protection of french agriculture , remained guaranteed . officials close to the british contingent said that there was a fair chance that the new proposals , due on wednesday , would include a slight increase in the amount but by nothing like the amounts suggested by brussels or paris .

dw-world looks at the major areas of conflict . with the clock ticking down to the final days before the next budget needs to be signed and sealed , the european union is locked in a major dispute over who pays how much into the eu pot - and , just as important , who receives what over the seven years from 2007-2013 . key sticking points are britain 's refusal to give ground on its budget rebate , and french resistance to surrendering support for eu farmers , which swallows about 40 percent of spending . but the stakes are also high for the eu 's newer member states , desperate to get hold of eu aid for infrastructure such as motorway and train links , left lagging behind western europe by decades of communism . more broadly , failure to agree on a budget would leave the eu scuffling over its budget on a year-by-year basis , threatening regular deadlock in a bloc already hobbled by the rejection of its constitution this year . britain , which holds the eu 's presidency , is set to make modified proposals after talks among foreign ministers monday , as preparation for a summit of the bloc 's leaders starting on thursday . london is still hopeful a deal can be struck . here are some basic facts about the eu budget : global spending the six main contributors to the budget - austria , britain , france , germany , the netherlands and sweden - want spending limited to about 1.0 percent of eu gross national income , or 815 billion euros -lrb- 954 billion dollars -rrb- . but the european commission wants a robust budget to pay for ambitious programs sought by member states and has called for payments of 943 billion euros -lrb- 1.14 percent of gni -rrb- over the 2007-2013 period , while the parliament suggests 883 billion euros would be enough . luxembourg , which tried to negotiate a budget deal in june when it held the eu 's presidency , offered a compromise of 875 billion euros but it was rejected by britain , finland , the netherlands , spain and sweden . london argued last week that the budget should be smaller and proposed an estimated 846.8 billion euros , an offer which has largely been rejected . net contributors the member states often concentrate on how much they pay into the budget and how little they get back - their net outlay .
in 2001 , an average german citizen " paid " 114 euros a year to the budget while the average spaniard " received " 180 euros . the three biggest net contributors , germany , the netherlands and sweden would like to see their burden reduced . farm aid : the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- under a franco-german initiative , farm spending was set in 2002 at a summit aimed at preparing for eu enlargement .
cap spending will stabilize from 2006 at around 45.5 billion euros annually , plus around one percent each year . france , the system 's major beneficiary as the union 's biggest agricultural producer , has so far refused to renegotiate the agreement , which is hotly contested by britain . britain 's rebate the british rebate , a jealously-guarded mechanism for reducing its financial burden because it profits little from subsidies , averaged 4.6 billion euros -lrb- 5.4 billion dollars , 3.1 billion pounds -rrb- annually between 1997 and 2003 . by last year , the rebate , which grows in proportion to eu spending , had reached 5.3 billion euros and is projected to average 7.1 billion euros annually for the 2007-2013 budget period . regional aid the 10 members who joined in may 2004 are waiting impatiently for eu regional funding , but until now it has been greece , ireland , italy , portugal and spain which have benefited most . despite fierce opposition , britain has proposed a cut in such aid to new member states on the grounds that newcomers are rarely able to absorb all of the eu money put in front of them . research and transport : eu 's future ? to help improve the eu 's competitiveness , the commission has proposed trebling the budgets for research and trans-european transport links .
britain has argued that the budget needs to be focused on more future-oriented programs such as research and education and less on agriculture . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de criticism prompts britain to promise new proposals eu leaders are trying to break a deadlock over the budget before a summit next week .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.12.2005 no pipe and slippers for rejuvenated schröder großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-chancellor ; media consultant , businessman , student and beer connoisseur after running germany and sparring with some the world 's most powerful leaders for seven years , gerhard schröder could be excused for taking a rest .
but the ex-chancellor has no intention of putting his feet up . less than three weeks after leaving office , former german chancellor gerhard schröder has reinvented himself as an international businessman with concerns in russia and switzerland . schröder wasted no time in making a clean break with politics after he handed the reins of power to angela merkel on november 22 .
but his decision to delve into the world of international business has not been without a political fallout . on friday , the chairman of russian energy giant gazprom , alexei miller , announced that schröder would head the shareholders ' committee of the consortium building a controversial gas pipeline under the baltic sea from russia to germany . the announcement came just after the ceremonial launch of construction of the north european gas pipeline , in which gazprom owns a 51-percent stake and germany 's e.on and basf own 24.5-percent stakes . the appointment of schröder , who helped secure the deal for the four-billion-euro -lrb- $ 4.7-billion -rrb- pipeline earlier this year while he was still chancellor , has already sparked questions of potential conflict of interest and debate about the need for regulations for retired politicians moving into business . while newspaper commentators generally agreed the pipeline project was useful , they said schröder 's move raised fresh questions about the links between big business and politics and the cosy relations with putin when in office . questionable occupation " it stinks , " greens co-leader richard bütikofer , whose party was in power with schröder 's social democrats when the pipeline deal was struck , told tagesspiegel newspaper . " the problem is that he pursued a policy for the federal republic which he will now draw private benefit from , " argued dirk niebel of the opposition free democrats . there had long been speculation that schröder , 61 , was planning to trade in politics for the business world and more specifically that he would take on a high-level post in russia 's energy sector . close relationship with putin pays off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political counterparts and personal friends : putin and schröder .
during his seven years in office , schröder built up a close personal relationship with russian president vladimir putin , whom he often visited privately . in germany , many criticized schröder 's friendship with the russian leader , particularly his silence on moscow 's policies in the caucuses and its hard line in the yukos oil saga . the news that schröder will be sitting on the board of the gas pipeline casts a new " smudgy light " on the former government 's cool relations with poland and the baltic states , who were left out of the pipeline project , the berlin tagesspiegel wrote on saturday .
however , the german chairman of corruption watchdog transparency international said there was no reason for alarm . " a supervisory board post is in our view certainly something that a former prominent politician can take up , " hansjoerg elshorst told tagesspiegel . " one can only talk of abuse if schröder receives excessive reward , " he said . media chancellor turns media consultant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder was equally at home in front of the camera as he was the lecturn .
far less critical was schröder 's decision to dabble in media .
the man often called the media chancellor for his skill in playing to the cameras has accepted a job as an advisor to leading swiss media group , ringier . the group publishes the blick tabloid , switzerland 's top-selling newspaper , and also has interests in eastern europe , china and vietnam . the post at zurich-based ringier came as something of a surprise as schröder had told the german press he intended to return to his first profession of practicing law . english lessons to broaden future horizons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " what did tony say ? "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 12.12.2005 moaning tops agenda at eu wrap-up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair is likely to attract flak as the year comes to an end the eu foreign ministers meet for the last time this year , but the usual end-of-year praise will likely be trumped by dissatisfaction over britain 's presidency . three days before eu heads of state meet for a summit to decide on a budget for 2007 to 2013 , britain , which held the eu presidency this past calendar year , still has n't come up with an acceptable concept to bring to the negotiating table .
on the contrary , diplomats are still waiting on british prime minister tony blair 's promised suggestion .
this means eu foreign ministers , who were gathered monday to begin preparations for the summit that will take place on dec .
15 and 16 , have something of an empty agenda , with little to discuss .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's steinmeier wants to focus on the eu constitution german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has put pressure on the gathering to at least come up with a time frame for further " reflection " on the eu constitutional crisis .
the british presidency has simply disregarded the constitution topic , and " made a mess of it , " according to one eu worker , who spoke off the record .
in general , the british had to " be pushed to engage " with any important topics , an eu diplomat said .
a constitutional crisis ?
the ratification process for the constitution was put on ice by eu leaders in june following a rejection of the new treaty by french and dutch voters .
since the text of the constitution itself can not be changed and a second round of referenda on the same text is unlikely , the eu finds itself between a rock and a hard place . a solution must be found by next summer ; in autumn 2006 at the latest , the eu council - the heads of state who make up the union 's main decision-making body - must officially decide on the constitution 's future . eu expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigration from africa is a growing problem for the eu on the foreign-policy agendy , monday 's meeting is expected to recommend that macedonia - previously a part of yugoslavia - be allowed candidacy status for acceptance into the european union .
however , the council of ministers is expected to make it clear that concrete negotiations over eu entry are still far off , and that no specific date can be named . in a related topic , a number of member states have requested earnest debate over the future expansion plans of the current 25-member bloc , which many feel is admitting new members far too quickly .
what the union really needs is a consolidation phase , many diplomats say . fighting poverty in africa also on monday , foreign ministers are expected to adopt an overall strategy for eu relations with africa .
ministers agree that the neighboring continent needs more attention ; the goal is long-term development and economic partnership , if only as a means of staunching the flow of illegal refugees to europe .
the european union wants to enter a strategic partnership with all of africa 's approximately 50 states , in order to reach the eu millennium goals of fighting poverty by 2015 .
the foreign ministers are also very likely to vehemently reject the latest comments by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
last week , he questioned the veracity of the holocaust and suggested moving the state of israel to germany or austria .

us officials acknowledged to the german government in 2004 that the man had been mistaken for somebody else and had been wrongly detained . foreign minister steinmeier , who already held a ministerial post in the schröder government , has vehemently denied german involvement in the affair .
he is expected to inform the german parliament and the public about the case in great detail this coming wednesday . unpleasant questions the question that el masri himself and leading german opposition figures have been asking is whether government officials assisted the abduction and detention of el masri in any way in a bid to improve german-us relations which had turned sour over the us-led war in iraq .
but german ministers at the weekend again denied any involvement by berlin in the abduction masterminded by the cia .
german deputy-chancellor franz müntefering indicated that media reports about possible government involvement were groundless . " what we are being confronted with is mere speculation , " müntefering said . " if people knew what happened as they claim , calls for a parliamentary inquiry would seem even more foolish .
it 's party politics that are behind much of the criticism being voiced right now , with the aim of discrediting the new foreign minister .
i 'm calling on all sides concerned to exercise restraint and wait for the results of the forthcoming meetings in the parliamentary committees , " he said . not our fault bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier will address the parliament on wednesday german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier says there are no signs that any mistakes were made by government members and other german officials in the el masri case .
steinmeier has repeatedly rejected opposition calls for his resignation , maintaining that the actions of the government were based on the law . but steinmeier is certainly sensing a need to inform the public about what happened in 2003 .
the el masri case will be debated in detail in the foreign and interior parliamentary committees before the foreign minister answers questions in the bundestag on wednesday .
social democrat floor leader and former defense minister peter struck is confident the el masri affair will not bring the new german government to its knees . " there 's no doubt that the german government would have violated the law , had it assisted in the abduction of a german citizen , " stuck said . " but from what i know at present , government offices were not involved and i have no reason to believe that we 'll see a different picture emerging by the end of this week , " he said . a touchstone for the new government wolfgang bosbach , a leading christian democrat lawmaker , said that the el mari case was clearly becoming a touchstone for the new government .
he wants all the facts on the table this week to ensure that the affair does not linger on into 2006 . meanwhile , a german daily reported on sunday that el masri was already under observation by german intelligence when he was abducted by the cia .
a german security official told the newspaper that masri was not considered to be an active islamic extremist .
it is known , however that he did have contacts to another man under observation .

but the ex-chancellor has no intention of putting his feet up . less than three weeks after leaving office , former german chancellor gerhard schröder has reinvented himself as an international businessman with concerns in russia and switzerland . schröder wasted no time in making a clean break with politics after he handed the reins of power to angela merkel on november 22 .
but his decision to delve into the world of international business has not been without a political fallout . on friday , the chairman of russian energy giant gazprom , alexei miller , announced that schröder would head the shareholders ' committee of the consortium building a controversial gas pipeline under the baltic sea from russia to germany . the announcement came just after the ceremonial launch of construction of the north european gas pipeline , in which gazprom owns a 51-percent stake and germany 's e.on and basf own 24.5-percent stakes . the appointment of schröder , who helped secure the deal for the four-billion-euro -lrb- $ 4.7-billion -rrb- pipeline earlier this year while he was still chancellor , has already sparked questions of potential conflict of interest and debate about the need for regulations for retired politicians moving into business . while newspaper commentators generally agreed the pipeline project was useful , they said schröder 's move raised fresh questions about the links between big business and politics and the cosy relations with putin when in office . questionable occupation " it stinks , " greens co-leader richard bütikofer , whose party was in power with schröder 's social democrats when the pipeline deal was struck , told tagesspiegel newspaper . " the problem is that he pursued a policy for the federal republic which he will now draw private benefit from , " argued dirk niebel of the opposition free democrats . there had long been speculation that schröder , 61 , was planning to trade in politics for the business world and more specifically that he would take on a high-level post in russia 's energy sector . close relationship with putin pays off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political counterparts and personal friends : putin and schröder .
during his seven years in office , schröder built up a close personal relationship with russian president vladimir putin , whom he often visited privately . in germany , many criticized schröder 's friendship with the russian leader , particularly his silence on moscow 's policies in the caucuses and its hard line in the yukos oil saga . the news that schröder will be sitting on the board of the gas pipeline casts a new " smudgy light " on the former government 's cool relations with poland and the baltic states , who were left out of the pipeline project , the berlin tagesspiegel wrote on saturday .
however , the german chairman of corruption watchdog transparency international said there was no reason for alarm . " a supervisory board post is in our view certainly something that a former prominent politician can take up , " hansjoerg elshorst told tagesspiegel . " one can only talk of abuse if schröder receives excessive reward , " he said . media chancellor turns media consultant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder was equally at home in front of the camera as he was the lecturn .
far less critical was schröder 's decision to dabble in media .
the man often called the media chancellor for his skill in playing to the cameras has accepted a job as an advisor to leading swiss media group , ringier . the group publishes the blick tabloid , switzerland 's top-selling newspaper , and also has interests in eastern europe , china and vietnam . the post at zurich-based ringier came as something of a surprise as schröder had told the german press he intended to return to his first profession of practicing law . english lessons to broaden future horizons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " what did tony say ? "
perhaps to smooth his way in the business world , the former chancellor has started brushing up on his english , which he has always freely admitted to be poor .
according to german press reports , he has recently been improving his english skills in the small town of montgomery on the border of england and wales . they said schröder was taking private courses aimed at " business and professional people " at park house school , situated in an 18th century country house in montgomery , and had been seen enjoying a few glasses of wine at the local pub , the dragon hotel , in his free time . the social-democrat has never made a secret of enjoying the good life and is an ardent soccer fan , something which has now also found a mention on his curriculum vitae . soccer fanaticism honored by dfb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nasty tracksuit , good technique : schröder on the ball .
the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- on friday made him an honorary member for his support for germany 's successful bid to host the 2006 world cup and for the organization of the tournament , which will be played in 12 german cities from june 9 to july 9 next year . in the meanwhile , schröder is also writing his political memoirs , which he hopes to publish next autumn . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder ponders life after chancellery now that germany has a new leader , there is much speculation about the future of outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 12.12.2005 moaning tops agenda at eu wrap-up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair is likely to attract flak as the year comes to an end the eu foreign ministers meet for the last time this year , but the usual end-of-year praise will likely be trumped by dissatisfaction over britain 's presidency . three days before eu heads of state meet for a summit to decide on a budget for 2007 to 2013 , britain , which held the eu presidency this past calendar year , still has n't come up with an acceptable concept to bring to the negotiating table .
on the contrary , diplomats are still waiting on british prime minister tony blair 's promised suggestion .
this means eu foreign ministers , who were gathered monday to begin preparations for the summit that will take place on dec .
15 and 16 , have something of an empty agenda , with little to discuss .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's steinmeier wants to focus on the eu constitution german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has put pressure on the gathering to at least come up with a time frame for further " reflection " on the eu constitutional crisis .
the british presidency has simply disregarded the constitution topic , and " made a mess of it , " according to one eu worker , who spoke off the record .
in general , the british had to " be pushed to engage " with any important topics , an eu diplomat said .
a constitutional crisis ?
the ratification process for the constitution was put on ice by eu leaders in june following a rejection of the new treaty by french and dutch voters .
since the text of the constitution itself can not be changed and a second round of referenda on the same text is unlikely , the eu finds itself between a rock and a hard place . a solution must be found by next summer ; in autumn 2006 at the latest , the eu council - the heads of state who make up the union 's main decision-making body - must officially decide on the constitution 's future . eu expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigration from africa is a growing problem for the eu on the foreign-policy agendy , monday 's meeting is expected to recommend that macedonia - previously a part of yugoslavia - be allowed candidacy status for acceptance into the european union .
however , the council of ministers is expected to make it clear that concrete negotiations over eu entry are still far off , and that no specific date can be named . in a related topic , a number of member states have requested earnest debate over the future expansion plans of the current 25-member bloc , which many feel is admitting new members far too quickly .
what the union really needs is a consolidation phase , many diplomats say . fighting poverty in africa also on monday , foreign ministers are expected to adopt an overall strategy for eu relations with africa .
ministers agree that the neighboring continent needs more attention ; the goal is long-term development and economic partnership , if only as a means of staunching the flow of illegal refugees to europe .
the european union wants to enter a strategic partnership with all of africa 's approximately 50 states , in order to reach the eu millennium goals of fighting poverty by 2015 .
the foreign ministers are also very likely to vehemently reject the latest comments by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
last week , he questioned the veracity of the holocaust and suggested moving the state of israel to germany or austria .
there are no signs of progress when it comes to reanimating talks between the eu and iran over the latter 's atomic program . bernd riegert -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the eu budget stand-off : the areas of conflict as the six-month british presidency draws to a close , eu leaders embark on a critical week aimed at breaking the deadlock over the bloc 's budget .

but his decision to delve into the world of international business has not been without a political fallout . on friday , the chairman of russian energy giant gazprom , alexei miller , announced that schröder would head the shareholders ' committee of the consortium building a controversial gas pipeline under the baltic sea from russia to germany . the announcement came just after the ceremonial launch of construction of the north european gas pipeline , in which gazprom owns a 51-percent stake and germany 's e.on and basf own 24.5-percent stakes . the appointment of schröder , who helped secure the deal for the four-billion-euro -lrb- $ 4.7-billion -rrb- pipeline earlier this year while he was still chancellor , has already sparked questions of potential conflict of interest and debate about the need for regulations for retired politicians moving into business . while newspaper commentators generally agreed the pipeline project was useful , they said schröder 's move raised fresh questions about the links between big business and politics and the cosy relations with putin when in office . questionable occupation " it stinks , " greens co-leader richard bütikofer , whose party was in power with schröder 's social democrats when the pipeline deal was struck , told tagesspiegel newspaper . " the problem is that he pursued a policy for the federal republic which he will now draw private benefit from , " argued dirk niebel of the opposition free democrats . there had long been speculation that schröder , 61 , was planning to trade in politics for the business world and more specifically that he would take on a high-level post in russia 's energy sector . close relationship with putin pays off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political counterparts and personal friends : putin and schröder .
during his seven years in office , schröder built up a close personal relationship with russian president vladimir putin , whom he often visited privately . in germany , many criticized schröder 's friendship with the russian leader , particularly his silence on moscow 's policies in the caucuses and its hard line in the yukos oil saga . the news that schröder will be sitting on the board of the gas pipeline casts a new " smudgy light " on the former government 's cool relations with poland and the baltic states , who were left out of the pipeline project , the berlin tagesspiegel wrote on saturday .
however , the german chairman of corruption watchdog transparency international said there was no reason for alarm . " a supervisory board post is in our view certainly something that a former prominent politician can take up , " hansjoerg elshorst told tagesspiegel . " one can only talk of abuse if schröder receives excessive reward , " he said . media chancellor turns media consultant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder was equally at home in front of the camera as he was the lecturn .
far less critical was schröder 's decision to dabble in media .
the man often called the media chancellor for his skill in playing to the cameras has accepted a job as an advisor to leading swiss media group , ringier . the group publishes the blick tabloid , switzerland 's top-selling newspaper , and also has interests in eastern europe , china and vietnam . the post at zurich-based ringier came as something of a surprise as schröder had told the german press he intended to return to his first profession of practicing law . english lessons to broaden future horizons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " what did tony say ? "
perhaps to smooth his way in the business world , the former chancellor has started brushing up on his english , which he has always freely admitted to be poor .
according to german press reports , he has recently been improving his english skills in the small town of montgomery on the border of england and wales . they said schröder was taking private courses aimed at " business and professional people " at park house school , situated in an 18th century country house in montgomery , and had been seen enjoying a few glasses of wine at the local pub , the dragon hotel , in his free time . the social-democrat has never made a secret of enjoying the good life and is an ardent soccer fan , something which has now also found a mention on his curriculum vitae . soccer fanaticism honored by dfb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nasty tracksuit , good technique : schröder on the ball .

on the contrary , diplomats are still waiting on british prime minister tony blair 's promised suggestion .
this means eu foreign ministers , who were gathered monday to begin preparations for the summit that will take place on dec .
15 and 16 , have something of an empty agenda , with little to discuss .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's steinmeier wants to focus on the eu constitution german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has put pressure on the gathering to at least come up with a time frame for further " reflection " on the eu constitutional crisis .
the british presidency has simply disregarded the constitution topic , and " made a mess of it , " according to one eu worker , who spoke off the record .
in general , the british had to " be pushed to engage " with any important topics , an eu diplomat said .
a constitutional crisis ?
the ratification process for the constitution was put on ice by eu leaders in june following a rejection of the new treaty by french and dutch voters .
since the text of the constitution itself can not be changed and a second round of referenda on the same text is unlikely , the eu finds itself between a rock and a hard place . a solution must be found by next summer ; in autumn 2006 at the latest , the eu council - the heads of state who make up the union 's main decision-making body - must officially decide on the constitution 's future . eu expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigration from africa is a growing problem for the eu on the foreign-policy agendy , monday 's meeting is expected to recommend that macedonia - previously a part of yugoslavia - be allowed candidacy status for acceptance into the european union .
however , the council of ministers is expected to make it clear that concrete negotiations over eu entry are still far off , and that no specific date can be named . in a related topic , a number of member states have requested earnest debate over the future expansion plans of the current 25-member bloc , which many feel is admitting new members far too quickly .
what the union really needs is a consolidation phase , many diplomats say . fighting poverty in africa also on monday , foreign ministers are expected to adopt an overall strategy for eu relations with africa .
ministers agree that the neighboring continent needs more attention ; the goal is long-term development and economic partnership , if only as a means of staunching the flow of illegal refugees to europe .
the european union wants to enter a strategic partnership with all of africa 's approximately 50 states , in order to reach the eu millennium goals of fighting poverty by 2015 .
the foreign ministers are also very likely to vehemently reject the latest comments by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
last week , he questioned the veracity of the holocaust and suggested moving the state of israel to germany or austria .
there are no signs of progress when it comes to reanimating talks between the eu and iran over the latter 's atomic program . bernd riegert -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the eu budget stand-off : the areas of conflict as the six-month british presidency draws to a close , eu leaders embark on a critical week aimed at breaking the deadlock over the bloc 's budget .

dw-world looks at the major areas of conflict . with the clock ticking down to the final days before the next budget needs to be signed and sealed , the european union is locked in a major dispute over who pays how much into the eu pot - and , just as important , who receives what over the seven years from 2007-2013 . key sticking points are britain 's refusal to give ground on its budget rebate , and french resistance to surrendering support for eu farmers , which swallows about 40 percent of spending . but the stakes are also high for the eu 's newer member states , desperate to get hold of eu aid for infrastructure such as motorway and train links , left lagging behind western europe by decades of communism . more broadly , failure to agree on a budget would leave the eu scuffling over its budget on a year-by-year basis , threatening regular deadlock in a bloc already hobbled by the rejection of its constitution this year . britain , which holds the eu 's presidency , is set to make modified proposals after talks among foreign ministers monday , as preparation for a summit of the bloc 's leaders starting on thursday . london is still hopeful a deal can be struck . here are some basic facts about the eu budget : global spending the six main contributors to the budget - austria , britain , france , germany , the netherlands and sweden - want spending limited to about 1.0 percent of eu gross national income , or 815 billion euros -lrb- 954 billion dollars -rrb- . but the european commission wants a robust budget to pay for ambitious programs sought by member states and has called for payments of 943 billion euros -lrb- 1.14 percent of gni -rrb- over the 2007-2013 period , while the parliament suggests 883 billion euros would be enough . luxembourg , which tried to negotiate a budget deal in june when it held the eu 's presidency , offered a compromise of 875 billion euros but it was rejected by britain , finland , the netherlands , spain and sweden . london argued last week that the budget should be smaller and proposed an estimated 846.8 billion euros , an offer which has largely been rejected . net contributors the member states often concentrate on how much they pay into the budget and how little they get back - their net outlay .
in 2001 , an average german citizen " paid " 114 euros a year to the budget while the average spaniard " received " 180 euros . the three biggest net contributors , germany , the netherlands and sweden would like to see their burden reduced . farm aid : the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- under a franco-german initiative , farm spending was set in 2002 at a summit aimed at preparing for eu enlargement .
cap spending will stabilize from 2006 at around 45.5 billion euros annually , plus around one percent each year . france , the system 's major beneficiary as the union 's biggest agricultural producer , has so far refused to renegotiate the agreement , which is hotly contested by britain . britain 's rebate the british rebate , a jealously-guarded mechanism for reducing its financial burden because it profits little from subsidies , averaged 4.6 billion euros -lrb- 5.4 billion dollars , 3.1 billion pounds -rrb- annually between 1997 and 2003 . by last year , the rebate , which grows in proportion to eu spending , had reached 5.3 billion euros and is projected to average 7.1 billion euros annually for the 2007-2013 budget period . regional aid the 10 members who joined in may 2004 are waiting impatiently for eu regional funding , but until now it has been greece , ireland , italy , portugal and spain which have benefited most . despite fierce opposition , britain has proposed a cut in such aid to new member states on the grounds that newcomers are rarely able to absorb all of the eu money put in front of them . research and transport : eu 's future ? to help improve the eu 's competitiveness , the commission has proposed trebling the budgets for research and trans-european transport links .
britain has argued that the budget needs to be focused on more future-oriented programs such as research and education and less on agriculture . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de criticism prompts britain to promise new proposals eu leaders are trying to break a deadlock over the budget before a summit next week .

but the ex-chancellor has no intention of putting his feet up . less than three weeks after leaving office , former german chancellor gerhard schröder has reinvented himself as an international businessman with concerns in russia and switzerland . schröder wasted no time in making a clean break with politics after he handed the reins of power to angela merkel on november 22 .
but his decision to delve into the world of international business has not been without a political fallout . on friday , the chairman of russian energy giant gazprom , alexei miller , announced that schröder would head the shareholders ' committee of the consortium building a controversial gas pipeline under the baltic sea from russia to germany . the announcement came just after the ceremonial launch of construction of the north european gas pipeline , in which gazprom owns a 51-percent stake and germany 's e.on and basf own 24.5-percent stakes . the appointment of schröder , who helped secure the deal for the four-billion-euro -lrb- $ 4.7-billion -rrb- pipeline earlier this year while he was still chancellor , has already sparked questions of potential conflict of interest and debate about the need for regulations for retired politicians moving into business . while newspaper commentators generally agreed the pipeline project was useful , they said schröder 's move raised fresh questions about the links between big business and politics and the cosy relations with putin when in office . questionable occupation " it stinks , " greens co-leader richard bütikofer , whose party was in power with schröder 's social democrats when the pipeline deal was struck , told tagesspiegel newspaper . " the problem is that he pursued a policy for the federal republic which he will now draw private benefit from , " argued dirk niebel of the opposition free democrats . there had long been speculation that schröder , 61 , was planning to trade in politics for the business world and more specifically that he would take on a high-level post in russia 's energy sector . close relationship with putin pays off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political counterparts and personal friends : putin and schröder .
during his seven years in office , schröder built up a close personal relationship with russian president vladimir putin , whom he often visited privately . in germany , many criticized schröder 's friendship with the russian leader , particularly his silence on moscow 's policies in the caucuses and its hard line in the yukos oil saga . the news that schröder will be sitting on the board of the gas pipeline casts a new " smudgy light " on the former government 's cool relations with poland and the baltic states , who were left out of the pipeline project , the berlin tagesspiegel wrote on saturday .
however , the german chairman of corruption watchdog transparency international said there was no reason for alarm . " a supervisory board post is in our view certainly something that a former prominent politician can take up , " hansjoerg elshorst told tagesspiegel . " one can only talk of abuse if schröder receives excessive reward , " he said . media chancellor turns media consultant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder was equally at home in front of the camera as he was the lecturn .
far less critical was schröder 's decision to dabble in media .
the man often called the media chancellor for his skill in playing to the cameras has accepted a job as an advisor to leading swiss media group , ringier . the group publishes the blick tabloid , switzerland 's top-selling newspaper , and also has interests in eastern europe , china and vietnam . the post at zurich-based ringier came as something of a surprise as schröder had told the german press he intended to return to his first profession of practicing law . english lessons to broaden future horizons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " what did tony say ? "
perhaps to smooth his way in the business world , the former chancellor has started brushing up on his english , which he has always freely admitted to be poor .
according to german press reports , he has recently been improving his english skills in the small town of montgomery on the border of england and wales . they said schröder was taking private courses aimed at " business and professional people " at park house school , situated in an 18th century country house in montgomery , and had been seen enjoying a few glasses of wine at the local pub , the dragon hotel , in his free time . the social-democrat has never made a secret of enjoying the good life and is an ardent soccer fan , something which has now also found a mention on his curriculum vitae . soccer fanaticism honored by dfb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nasty tracksuit , good technique : schröder on the ball .
the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- on friday made him an honorary member for his support for germany 's successful bid to host the 2006 world cup and for the organization of the tournament , which will be played in 12 german cities from june 9 to july 9 next year . in the meanwhile , schröder is also writing his political memoirs , which he hopes to publish next autumn . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder ponders life after chancellery now that germany has a new leader , there is much speculation about the future of outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.12.2005 berlin under pressure in the cia abduction case großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german government must polish up its image , tainted by the cia affair alleged involvement of german officials in the cia abduction of a german citizen have been causing headaches in berlin , but the government has promised to lay its cards on the table this week . the german grand coalition government went on the offensive over the weekend to answer nagging questions as to whether german officials under the former schröder government assisted the abduction and detention of a lebanese-born german national khaled el masri . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both khaled el masri and the german public want answers in 2003 , the cia abducted german national khaled el masri in macedonia and flew him to afghanistan where he was detained for five months as a terror suspect and allegedly mistreated .
us officials acknowledged to the german government in 2004 that the man had been mistaken for somebody else and had been wrongly detained . foreign minister steinmeier , who already held a ministerial post in the schröder government , has vehemently denied german involvement in the affair .
he is expected to inform the german parliament and the public about the case in great detail this coming wednesday . unpleasant questions the question that el masri himself and leading german opposition figures have been asking is whether government officials assisted the abduction and detention of el masri in any way in a bid to improve german-us relations which had turned sour over the us-led war in iraq .
but german ministers at the weekend again denied any involvement by berlin in the abduction masterminded by the cia .
german deputy-chancellor franz müntefering indicated that media reports about possible government involvement were groundless . " what we are being confronted with is mere speculation , " müntefering said . " if people knew what happened as they claim , calls for a parliamentary inquiry would seem even more foolish .
it 's party politics that are behind much of the criticism being voiced right now , with the aim of discrediting the new foreign minister .
i 'm calling on all sides concerned to exercise restraint and wait for the results of the forthcoming meetings in the parliamentary committees , " he said . not our fault bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier will address the parliament on wednesday german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier says there are no signs that any mistakes were made by government members and other german officials in the el masri case .
steinmeier has repeatedly rejected opposition calls for his resignation , maintaining that the actions of the government were based on the law . but steinmeier is certainly sensing a need to inform the public about what happened in 2003 .
the el masri case will be debated in detail in the foreign and interior parliamentary committees before the foreign minister answers questions in the bundestag on wednesday .
social democrat floor leader and former defense minister peter struck is confident the el masri affair will not bring the new german government to its knees . " there 's no doubt that the german government would have violated the law , had it assisted in the abduction of a german citizen , " stuck said . " but from what i know at present , government offices were not involved and i have no reason to believe that we 'll see a different picture emerging by the end of this week , " he said . a touchstone for the new government wolfgang bosbach , a leading christian democrat lawmaker , said that the el mari case was clearly becoming a touchstone for the new government .
he wants all the facts on the table this week to ensure that the affair does not linger on into 2006 . meanwhile , a german daily reported on sunday that el masri was already under observation by german intelligence when he was abducted by the cia .
a german security official told the newspaper that masri was not considered to be an active islamic extremist .
it is known , however that he did have contacts to another man under observation .
he said the little that was known was transmitted to the americans . hardy graupner -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de questions arise over us base in kosovo while us secretary of state condoleezza rice secured a reprieve from european governments over the treatment of detainees , the suspicion of systematical abuse grows after reports of a guantanamo-like base in kosovo . -lrb- dec .

us officials acknowledged to the german government in 2004 that the man had been mistaken for somebody else and had been wrongly detained . foreign minister steinmeier , who already held a ministerial post in the schröder government , has vehemently denied german involvement in the affair .
he is expected to inform the german parliament and the public about the case in great detail this coming wednesday . unpleasant questions the question that el masri himself and leading german opposition figures have been asking is whether government officials assisted the abduction and detention of el masri in any way in a bid to improve german-us relations which had turned sour over the us-led war in iraq .
but german ministers at the weekend again denied any involvement by berlin in the abduction masterminded by the cia .
german deputy-chancellor franz müntefering indicated that media reports about possible government involvement were groundless . " what we are being confronted with is mere speculation , " müntefering said . " if people knew what happened as they claim , calls for a parliamentary inquiry would seem even more foolish .
it 's party politics that are behind much of the criticism being voiced right now , with the aim of discrediting the new foreign minister .
i 'm calling on all sides concerned to exercise restraint and wait for the results of the forthcoming meetings in the parliamentary committees , " he said . not our fault bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier will address the parliament on wednesday german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier says there are no signs that any mistakes were made by government members and other german officials in the el masri case .
steinmeier has repeatedly rejected opposition calls for his resignation , maintaining that the actions of the government were based on the law . but steinmeier is certainly sensing a need to inform the public about what happened in 2003 .
the el masri case will be debated in detail in the foreign and interior parliamentary committees before the foreign minister answers questions in the bundestag on wednesday .
social democrat floor leader and former defense minister peter struck is confident the el masri affair will not bring the new german government to its knees . " there 's no doubt that the german government would have violated the law , had it assisted in the abduction of a german citizen , " stuck said . " but from what i know at present , government offices were not involved and i have no reason to believe that we 'll see a different picture emerging by the end of this week , " he said . a touchstone for the new government wolfgang bosbach , a leading christian democrat lawmaker , said that the el mari case was clearly becoming a touchstone for the new government .
he wants all the facts on the table this week to ensure that the affair does not linger on into 2006 . meanwhile , a german daily reported on sunday that el masri was already under observation by german intelligence when he was abducted by the cia .
a german security official told the newspaper that masri was not considered to be an active islamic extremist .
it is known , however that he did have contacts to another man under observation .
he said the little that was known was transmitted to the americans . hardy graupner -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de questions arise over us base in kosovo while us secretary of state condoleezza rice secured a reprieve from european governments over the treatment of detainees , the suspicion of systematical abuse grows after reports of a guantanamo-like base in kosovo . -lrb- dec .

his name is hans riegel , and millions of children around the world get their first sugar rush chewing on his sticky candies . it is practically impossible to find a kid in this world that does n't have a sweet tooth .
it is this law of nature that made hans riegel , junior , one of the richest germans living today . his assets , like those of his brother paul , have been estimated to 1.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- haribo , the international sweets giant with an estimated annual turnover of 1.5 billion euros , holds a 60 % market share on licorice and fruit drops in germany , and is undisputed number one in europe .
in the eighties , it crossed the big pond and started expanding in the united states .
in the nineties , it discovered eastern europe .
the world of gummy bears knows no borders . hans riegel , senior , confectioner from bonn , founded the family business in 1920 and gave it the exotic sounding name haribo , which was , in fact , an acronym consisting of his initials and the city of bonn .
but it was really hans junior , who took over the family business after the second world war , that turned it into an international success story . tradition and change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the summer of 2005 , haribo organized a licorice-inspired fashion show it is a well-established part of the haribo corporate mythology that , at least in the first few years of developing their business , hans senior and his wife gertrud used to deliver their products on their own , by bicycle .
hans junior , who prepared himself for his later career by earning a doctorate from the university of bonn on the role of sugar in world trade , does n't have to play delivery boy anymore because haribo candies are now sold over the world .
but he does like to fly his own chopper to a business meeting . what has n't changed over the years is the soul of the family business : hans riegel sits at the top of the gummy bear pyramid and rules supreme in a somewhat antiquated managerial style .
as a patriarchic figurehead who believes more in trust and authority than focus groups and marketing departments , this active octogenarian has single-handedly turned his father 's business into a major player on the world market .
he is known to have said that " without haribo , my life has no meaning . " tradition means everything to hans riegel .
the original haribo advertising slogan - " haribo macht kinder froh , " which literally means " haribo makes children happy " and , luckily enough , rhymes in german - was sold to riegel senior in the thirties by a traveling salesman .
the slogan was updated only once , in the sixties , to welcome the paying adults into the fairy world of gum drops : " kids and grown-ups love it so , the happy world of haribo . " techno grandpa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions of gummy bear leave the haribo factories on a daily basis in 1994 , riegel was awarded the order of the federal republic of germany , 1st class , -lrb- bundesverdienstkreuz -rrb- for his services to society .
he is a a self-proclaimed fan of techno music , who likes to follow latest trends “ i love kids and i enjoy watching them .
they are my customers , i have to know what sweets they enjoy , what they think , what language they speak , " riegel said . since 1991 , haribo has been advertised in germany by thomas gottschalk , an aging entertainer who is also a household name in germany .
the riegel-gottschalk partnership is the said to be the most successful advertising campaign in german history , although younger german entertainers , like the popular stefan raab , enjoy making fun of gottschalk 's not very convincing attempts to use slang in haribo ads . the gummy bear dynasty is in no shortage of males called hans .

in the nineties , it discovered eastern europe .
the world of gummy bears knows no borders . hans riegel , senior , confectioner from bonn , founded the family business in 1920 and gave it the exotic sounding name haribo , which was , in fact , an acronym consisting of his initials and the city of bonn .

but he does like to fly his own chopper to a business meeting . what has n't changed over the years is the soul of the family business : hans riegel sits at the top of the gummy bear pyramid and rules supreme in a somewhat antiquated managerial style .
as a patriarchic figurehead who believes more in trust and authority than focus groups and marketing departments , this active octogenarian has single-handedly turned his father 's business into a major player on the world market .
he is known to have said that " without haribo , my life has no meaning . " tradition means everything to hans riegel .
the original haribo advertising slogan - " haribo macht kinder froh , " which literally means " haribo makes children happy " and , luckily enough , rhymes in german - was sold to riegel senior in the thirties by a traveling salesman .

us officials acknowledged to the german government in 2004 that the man had been mistaken for somebody else and had been wrongly detained . foreign minister steinmeier , who already held a ministerial post in the schröder government , has vehemently denied german involvement in the affair .
he is expected to inform the german parliament and the public about the case in great detail this coming wednesday . unpleasant questions the question that el masri himself and leading german opposition figures have been asking is whether government officials assisted the abduction and detention of el masri in any way in a bid to improve german-us relations which had turned sour over the us-led war in iraq .
but german ministers at the weekend again denied any involvement by berlin in the abduction masterminded by the cia .
german deputy-chancellor franz müntefering indicated that media reports about possible government involvement were groundless . " what we are being confronted with is mere speculation , " müntefering said . " if people knew what happened as they claim , calls for a parliamentary inquiry would seem even more foolish .

the el masri case will be debated in detail in the foreign and interior parliamentary committees before the foreign minister answers questions in the bundestag on wednesday .
social democrat floor leader and former defense minister peter struck is confident the el masri affair will not bring the new german government to its knees . " there 's no doubt that the german government would have violated the law , had it assisted in the abduction of a german citizen , " stuck said . " but from what i know at present , government offices were not involved and i have no reason to believe that we 'll see a different picture emerging by the end of this week , " he said . a touchstone for the new government wolfgang bosbach , a leading christian democrat lawmaker , said that the el mari case was clearly becoming a touchstone for the new government .
he wants all the facts on the table this week to ensure that the affair does not linger on into 2006 . meanwhile , a german daily reported on sunday that el masri was already under observation by german intelligence when he was abducted by the cia .

the row comes just before nuclear talks with tehran . recent remarks by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad about the veracity of the holocaust and that israel be relocated to europe prompted a harsh reaction from german vice chancellor franz müntefering on sunday . " whatever is said will one day be desired to be done , " the employment and social welfare minister said after a meeting in berlin with paul spiegel , president of the central council of jews in germany . müntefering was referring to the iranian president 's comments in which he called on germany and austria to host a state of israel on their soil if they felt responsible for murdering jews during world war ii .

" i 'm surprised by the reaction to these comments .

asefi said on sunday that iran would stick to its demand to conduct nuclear fuel work despite fears that such activities could be diverted to make an atomic bomb . " this meeting will be very serious .

asefi said the only chance for the negotiations was if the european side compromises - even though this appears out of the question . " if the europeans are rational and act according to npt and international agreements , there is nothing to worry about and the meeting will have a good result , " asefi told reporters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.12.2005 no pipe and slippers for rejuvenated schröder großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-chancellor ; media consultant , businessman , student and beer connoisseur after running germany and sparring with some the world 's most powerful leaders for seven years , gerhard schröder could be excused for taking a rest .
but the ex-chancellor has no intention of putting his feet up . less than three weeks after leaving office , former german chancellor gerhard schröder has reinvented himself as an international businessman with concerns in russia and switzerland . schröder wasted no time in making a clean break with politics after he handed the reins of power to angela merkel on november 22 .
but his decision to delve into the world of international business has not been without a political fallout . on friday , the chairman of russian energy giant gazprom , alexei miller , announced that schröder would head the shareholders ' committee of the consortium building a controversial gas pipeline under the baltic sea from russia to germany . the announcement came just after the ceremonial launch of construction of the north european gas pipeline , in which gazprom owns a 51-percent stake and germany 's e.on and basf own 24.5-percent stakes . the appointment of schröder , who helped secure the deal for the four-billion-euro -lrb- $ 4.7-billion -rrb- pipeline earlier this year while he was still chancellor , has already sparked questions of potential conflict of interest and debate about the need for regulations for retired politicians moving into business . while newspaper commentators generally agreed the pipeline project was useful , they said schröder 's move raised fresh questions about the links between big business and politics and the cosy relations with putin when in office . questionable occupation " it stinks , " greens co-leader richard bütikofer , whose party was in power with schröder 's social democrats when the pipeline deal was struck , told tagesspiegel newspaper . " the problem is that he pursued a policy for the federal republic which he will now draw private benefit from , " argued dirk niebel of the opposition free democrats . there had long been speculation that schröder , 61 , was planning to trade in politics for the business world and more specifically that he would take on a high-level post in russia 's energy sector . close relationship with putin pays off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political counterparts and personal friends : putin and schröder .
during his seven years in office , schröder built up a close personal relationship with russian president vladimir putin , whom he often visited privately . in germany , many criticized schröder 's friendship with the russian leader , particularly his silence on moscow 's policies in the caucuses and its hard line in the yukos oil saga . the news that schröder will be sitting on the board of the gas pipeline casts a new " smudgy light " on the former government 's cool relations with poland and the baltic states , who were left out of the pipeline project , the berlin tagesspiegel wrote on saturday .

us officials acknowledged to the german government in 2004 that the man had been mistaken for somebody else and had been wrongly detained . foreign minister steinmeier , who already held a ministerial post in the schröder government , has vehemently denied german involvement in the affair .
he is expected to inform the german parliament and the public about the case in great detail this coming wednesday . unpleasant questions the question that el masri himself and leading german opposition figures have been asking is whether government officials assisted the abduction and detention of el masri in any way in a bid to improve german-us relations which had turned sour over the us-led war in iraq .
but german ministers at the weekend again denied any involvement by berlin in the abduction masterminded by the cia .
german deputy-chancellor franz müntefering indicated that media reports about possible government involvement were groundless . " what we are being confronted with is mere speculation , " müntefering said . " if people knew what happened as they claim , calls for a parliamentary inquiry would seem even more foolish .

steinmeier has repeatedly rejected opposition calls for his resignation , maintaining that the actions of the government were based on the law . but steinmeier is certainly sensing a need to inform the public about what happened in 2003 .
the el masri case will be debated in detail in the foreign and interior parliamentary committees before the foreign minister answers questions in the bundestag on wednesday .
social democrat floor leader and former defense minister peter struck is confident the el masri affair will not bring the new german government to its knees . " there 's no doubt that the german government would have violated the law , had it assisted in the abduction of a german citizen , " stuck said . " but from what i know at present , government offices were not involved and i have no reason to believe that we 'll see a different picture emerging by the end of this week , " he said . a touchstone for the new government wolfgang bosbach , a leading christian democrat lawmaker , said that the el mari case was clearly becoming a touchstone for the new government .
he wants all the facts on the table this week to ensure that the affair does not linger on into 2006 . meanwhile , a german daily reported on sunday that el masri was already under observation by german intelligence when he was abducted by the cia .

eu ministers , however , are yet to approve the expensive project . european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- officials said friday that european countries remained interested in a russian plan to build a new crew-carrying spaceship known as the clipper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : esa director dordain is pushing for eu participation in the russian project " i shall make all the efforts i can in the next few months to secure wide participation for clipper among member states , " esa director general jean-jacques dordain said after meeting russian space agency officials in moscow . dordain said he would push the project to be approved before june 2006 by the 17-member esa , which backed off a decision on approval at a ministerial meeting in berlin last week . " a final decision has not been taken but neither has a negative decision .
this is very important for us , " anatoly perminov , head of russia 's federal space agency , said . with or without europe perminov previously said that russia could push ahead with the clipper project without european backing and mentioned china as a possible alternative partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new russian spacecraft could reach the international space station in 2010 russian scientists envisage that the clipper would weigh 14.5 tons and would carry up to six people on voyages to the international space station -lrb- iss -rrb- or on interplanetary trips . they have said the craft could be launched as soon as 2010 and have estimated the cost of development at $ 1 billion dollars -lrb- 845 million euros -rrb- . " before the final decision is taken , we will work together , we will come up with an action plan for the concept and utilization and the participation of european industries in the project , " dordain said . budgetary woes despite budgetary concerns voiced at last week 's berlin meeting , european financing would go ahead , daniel sacotte , the esa 's director of human spaceflight , microgravity and exploration , said .

us officials acknowledged to the german government in 2004 that the man had been mistaken for somebody else and had been wrongly detained . foreign minister steinmeier , who already held a ministerial post in the schröder government , has vehemently denied german involvement in the affair .
he is expected to inform the german parliament and the public about the case in great detail this coming wednesday . unpleasant questions the question that el masri himself and leading german opposition figures have been asking is whether government officials assisted the abduction and detention of el masri in any way in a bid to improve german-us relations which had turned sour over the us-led war in iraq .
but german ministers at the weekend again denied any involvement by berlin in the abduction masterminded by the cia .
german deputy-chancellor franz müntefering indicated that media reports about possible government involvement were groundless . " what we are being confronted with is mere speculation , " müntefering said . " if people knew what happened as they claim , calls for a parliamentary inquiry would seem even more foolish .
it 's party politics that are behind much of the criticism being voiced right now , with the aim of discrediting the new foreign minister .
i 'm calling on all sides concerned to exercise restraint and wait for the results of the forthcoming meetings in the parliamentary committees , " he said . not our fault bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier will address the parliament on wednesday german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier says there are no signs that any mistakes were made by government members and other german officials in the el masri case .
steinmeier has repeatedly rejected opposition calls for his resignation , maintaining that the actions of the government were based on the law . but steinmeier is certainly sensing a need to inform the public about what happened in 2003 .
the el masri case will be debated in detail in the foreign and interior parliamentary committees before the foreign minister answers questions in the bundestag on wednesday .
social democrat floor leader and former defense minister peter struck is confident the el masri affair will not bring the new german government to its knees . " there 's no doubt that the german government would have violated the law , had it assisted in the abduction of a german citizen , " stuck said . " but from what i know at present , government offices were not involved and i have no reason to believe that we 'll see a different picture emerging by the end of this week , " he said . a touchstone for the new government wolfgang bosbach , a leading christian democrat lawmaker , said that the el mari case was clearly becoming a touchstone for the new government .
he wants all the facts on the table this week to ensure that the affair does not linger on into 2006 . meanwhile , a german daily reported on sunday that el masri was already under observation by german intelligence when he was abducted by the cia .
a german security official told the newspaper that masri was not considered to be an active islamic extremist .
it is known , however that he did have contacts to another man under observation .
he said the little that was known was transmitted to the americans . hardy graupner -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de questions arise over us base in kosovo while us secretary of state condoleezza rice secured a reprieve from european governments over the treatment of detainees , the suspicion of systematical abuse grows after reports of a guantanamo-like base in kosovo . -lrb- dec .

the row comes just before nuclear talks with tehran . recent remarks by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad about the veracity of the holocaust and that israel be relocated to europe prompted a harsh reaction from german vice chancellor franz müntefering on sunday . " whatever is said will one day be desired to be done , " the employment and social welfare minister said after a meeting in berlin with paul spiegel , president of the central council of jews in germany . müntefering was referring to the iranian president 's comments in which he called on germany and austria to host a state of israel on their soil if they felt responsible for murdering jews during world war ii .
ahmadinejad , who in october said israel should be " wiped off the map , " also described the jewish state as a " tumor . " " unacceptable " comments , says merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul spiegel , head of the central council of jews spiegel has described the comments as the worst anti-semitic attack by a statesman since adolf hitler and called on germany to sever diplomatic ties with iran . chancellor angela merkel described the remarks as " totally unacceptable " and the german government announced it would protest to the iranian ambassador . analysts say the comments were an attempt by ahmedinejad , an ex-member of the revolutionary guard , to woo iranian radicals in the regime who relish confrontation with the west . but tehran said it was surprised the international community had so vehemently condemned ahmedinejad 's remarks . " i 'm surprised by the reaction to these comments .
the president 's statements were clear : if the europeans have treated the jews badly , they have to compensate at their own expense , not at the expense of the region , " iran 's foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi told reporters . bad omen before nuclear talks the controversy over ahmadinejad 's verbal attacks against israel has cast a shadow over upcoming negotiations between the eu-3 , britain , france and germany , and tehran over iran 's nuclear fuel program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : photo of reported nuclear area in iran where uranium enrichment could be taking place iran has taken an increasingly hardline stance in its dialog with the international atomic energy agency and the european union over what it says is its right to produce nuclear energy for its electricity sector , but which the west fears could be secretly diverted to developing nuclear weapons . talks are intended to resume on december 21 in vienna after a four-month break .
asefi said on sunday that iran would stick to its demand to conduct nuclear fuel work despite fears that such activities could be diverted to make an atomic bomb . " this meeting will be very serious .
everything depends on this meeting , " asefi said of the planned discussions . nuclear energy " rights " at stake the iranian government has argued that as a signatory of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , it has the " right " to pursue fuel cycle work for peaceful intentions ; the eu-3 and the united states worry that the uranium enrichment process could be taken a step further and used for military purposes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is supplying fuel for iran 's bushehr nuclear power plant the eu-3 has proposed that iran 's enrichment work be carried out in russia , but tehran has rejected such a possibility .
asefi said the only chance for the negotiations was if the european side compromises - even though this appears out of the question . " if the europeans are rational and act according to npt and international agreements , there is nothing to worry about and the meeting will have a good result , " asefi told reporters .
" it all depends on the european side and whether they enter the talks and give us our rights , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran 's remarks on israel widely denounced germany reacted to iran 's suggestion of relocating the " tumor " of israel to europe by rebuking the iranian ambassador in berlin ; other nations decried the comments .

his name is hans riegel , and millions of children around the world get their first sugar rush chewing on his sticky candies . it is practically impossible to find a kid in this world that does n't have a sweet tooth .
it is this law of nature that made hans riegel , junior , one of the richest germans living today . his assets , like those of his brother paul , have been estimated to 1.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- haribo , the international sweets giant with an estimated annual turnover of 1.5 billion euros , holds a 60 % market share on licorice and fruit drops in germany , and is undisputed number one in europe .
in the eighties , it crossed the big pond and started expanding in the united states .
in the nineties , it discovered eastern europe .
the world of gummy bears knows no borders . hans riegel , senior , confectioner from bonn , founded the family business in 1920 and gave it the exotic sounding name haribo , which was , in fact , an acronym consisting of his initials and the city of bonn .
but it was really hans junior , who took over the family business after the second world war , that turned it into an international success story . tradition and change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the summer of 2005 , haribo organized a licorice-inspired fashion show it is a well-established part of the haribo corporate mythology that , at least in the first few years of developing their business , hans senior and his wife gertrud used to deliver their products on their own , by bicycle .
hans junior , who prepared himself for his later career by earning a doctorate from the university of bonn on the role of sugar in world trade , does n't have to play delivery boy anymore because haribo candies are now sold over the world .
but he does like to fly his own chopper to a business meeting . what has n't changed over the years is the soul of the family business : hans riegel sits at the top of the gummy bear pyramid and rules supreme in a somewhat antiquated managerial style .
as a patriarchic figurehead who believes more in trust and authority than focus groups and marketing departments , this active octogenarian has single-handedly turned his father 's business into a major player on the world market .
he is known to have said that " without haribo , my life has no meaning . " tradition means everything to hans riegel .
the original haribo advertising slogan - " haribo macht kinder froh , " which literally means " haribo makes children happy " and , luckily enough , rhymes in german - was sold to riegel senior in the thirties by a traveling salesman .
the slogan was updated only once , in the sixties , to welcome the paying adults into the fairy world of gum drops : " kids and grown-ups love it so , the happy world of haribo . " techno grandpa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions of gummy bear leave the haribo factories on a daily basis in 1994 , riegel was awarded the order of the federal republic of germany , 1st class , -lrb- bundesverdienstkreuz -rrb- for his services to society .
he is a a self-proclaimed fan of techno music , who likes to follow latest trends “ i love kids and i enjoy watching them .
they are my customers , i have to know what sweets they enjoy , what they think , what language they speak , " riegel said . since 1991 , haribo has been advertised in germany by thomas gottschalk , an aging entertainer who is also a household name in germany .
the riegel-gottschalk partnership is the said to be the most successful advertising campaign in german history , although younger german entertainers , like the popular stefan raab , enjoy making fun of gottschalk 's not very convincing attempts to use slang in haribo ads . the gummy bear dynasty is in no shortage of males called hans .

his name is hans riegel , and millions of children around the world get their first sugar rush chewing on his sticky candies . it is practically impossible to find a kid in this world that does n't have a sweet tooth .
it is this law of nature that made hans riegel , junior , one of the richest germans living today . his assets , like those of his brother paul , have been estimated to 1.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- haribo , the international sweets giant with an estimated annual turnover of 1.5 billion euros , holds a 60 % market share on licorice and fruit drops in germany , and is undisputed number one in europe .

in the nineties , it discovered eastern europe .
the world of gummy bears knows no borders . hans riegel , senior , confectioner from bonn , founded the family business in 1920 and gave it the exotic sounding name haribo , which was , in fact , an acronym consisting of his initials and the city of bonn .

hans junior , who prepared himself for his later career by earning a doctorate from the university of bonn on the role of sugar in world trade , does n't have to play delivery boy anymore because haribo candies are now sold over the world .
but he does like to fly his own chopper to a business meeting . what has n't changed over the years is the soul of the family business : hans riegel sits at the top of the gummy bear pyramid and rules supreme in a somewhat antiquated managerial style .
as a patriarchic figurehead who believes more in trust and authority than focus groups and marketing departments , this active octogenarian has single-handedly turned his father 's business into a major player on the world market .
he is known to have said that " without haribo , my life has no meaning . " tradition means everything to hans riegel .
the original haribo advertising slogan - " haribo macht kinder froh , " which literally means " haribo makes children happy " and , luckily enough , rhymes in german - was sold to riegel senior in the thirties by a traveling salesman .

the riegel-gottschalk partnership is the said to be the most successful advertising campaign in german history , although younger german entertainers , like the popular stefan raab , enjoy making fun of gottschalk 's not very convincing attempts to use slang in haribo ads . the gummy bear dynasty is in no shortage of males called hans .

the row comes just before nuclear talks with tehran . recent remarks by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad about the veracity of the holocaust and that israel be relocated to europe prompted a harsh reaction from german vice chancellor franz müntefering on sunday . " whatever is said will one day be desired to be done , " the employment and social welfare minister said after a meeting in berlin with paul spiegel , president of the central council of jews in germany . müntefering was referring to the iranian president 's comments in which he called on germany and austria to host a state of israel on their soil if they felt responsible for murdering jews during world war ii .
ahmadinejad , who in october said israel should be " wiped off the map , " also described the jewish state as a " tumor . " " unacceptable " comments , says merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul spiegel , head of the central council of jews spiegel has described the comments as the worst anti-semitic attack by a statesman since adolf hitler and called on germany to sever diplomatic ties with iran . chancellor angela merkel described the remarks as " totally unacceptable " and the german government announced it would protest to the iranian ambassador . analysts say the comments were an attempt by ahmedinejad , an ex-member of the revolutionary guard , to woo iranian radicals in the regime who relish confrontation with the west . but tehran said it was surprised the international community had so vehemently condemned ahmedinejad 's remarks . " i 'm surprised by the reaction to these comments .
the president 's statements were clear : if the europeans have treated the jews badly , they have to compensate at their own expense , not at the expense of the region , " iran 's foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi told reporters . bad omen before nuclear talks the controversy over ahmadinejad 's verbal attacks against israel has cast a shadow over upcoming negotiations between the eu-3 , britain , france and germany , and tehran over iran 's nuclear fuel program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : photo of reported nuclear area in iran where uranium enrichment could be taking place iran has taken an increasingly hardline stance in its dialog with the international atomic energy agency and the european union over what it says is its right to produce nuclear energy for its electricity sector , but which the west fears could be secretly diverted to developing nuclear weapons . talks are intended to resume on december 21 in vienna after a four-month break .
asefi said on sunday that iran would stick to its demand to conduct nuclear fuel work despite fears that such activities could be diverted to make an atomic bomb . " this meeting will be very serious .
everything depends on this meeting , " asefi said of the planned discussions . nuclear energy " rights " at stake the iranian government has argued that as a signatory of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , it has the " right " to pursue fuel cycle work for peaceful intentions ; the eu-3 and the united states worry that the uranium enrichment process could be taken a step further and used for military purposes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is supplying fuel for iran 's bushehr nuclear power plant the eu-3 has proposed that iran 's enrichment work be carried out in russia , but tehran has rejected such a possibility .
asefi said the only chance for the negotiations was if the european side compromises - even though this appears out of the question . " if the europeans are rational and act according to npt and international agreements , there is nothing to worry about and the meeting will have a good result , " asefi told reporters .

eu ministers , however , are yet to approve the expensive project . european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- officials said friday that european countries remained interested in a russian plan to build a new crew-carrying spaceship known as the clipper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : esa director dordain is pushing for eu participation in the russian project " i shall make all the efforts i can in the next few months to secure wide participation for clipper among member states , " esa director general jean-jacques dordain said after meeting russian space agency officials in moscow . dordain said he would push the project to be approved before june 2006 by the 17-member esa , which backed off a decision on approval at a ministerial meeting in berlin last week . " a final decision has not been taken but neither has a negative decision .
this is very important for us , " anatoly perminov , head of russia 's federal space agency , said . with or without europe perminov previously said that russia could push ahead with the clipper project without european backing and mentioned china as a possible alternative partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new russian spacecraft could reach the international space station in 2010 russian scientists envisage that the clipper would weigh 14.5 tons and would carry up to six people on voyages to the international space station -lrb- iss -rrb- or on interplanetary trips . they have said the craft could be launched as soon as 2010 and have estimated the cost of development at $ 1 billion dollars -lrb- 845 million euros -rrb- .

the esa also foresees use of soyuz rockets for a planned mission to mars , he added . the soyuz , a soviet-designed work horse , became the only means of taking personnel to and from the iss after the grounding of the us space shuttle fleet in august following a mishap on the latest mission similar to that which doomed the columbia orbiter in 2003 . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de esa meets in berlin to discuss future space programs the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- gathers in berlin monday to talk about the focus of european space exploration in coming years .

on the contrary , diplomats are still waiting on british prime minister tony blair 's promised suggestion .
this means eu foreign ministers , who were gathered monday to begin preparations for the summit that will take place on dec .
15 and 16 , have something of an empty agenda , with little to discuss .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's steinmeier wants to focus on the eu constitution german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has put pressure on the gathering to at least come up with a time frame for further " reflection " on the eu constitutional crisis .
the british presidency has simply disregarded the constitution topic , and " made a mess of it , " according to one eu worker , who spoke off the record .
in general , the british had to " be pushed to engage " with any important topics , an eu diplomat said .
a constitutional crisis ?
the ratification process for the constitution was put on ice by eu leaders in june following a rejection of the new treaty by french and dutch voters .
since the text of the constitution itself can not be changed and a second round of referenda on the same text is unlikely , the eu finds itself between a rock and a hard place . a solution must be found by next summer ; in autumn 2006 at the latest , the eu council - the heads of state who make up the union 's main decision-making body - must officially decide on the constitution 's future . eu expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigration from africa is a growing problem for the eu on the foreign-policy agendy , monday 's meeting is expected to recommend that macedonia - previously a part of yugoslavia - be allowed candidacy status for acceptance into the european union .
however , the council of ministers is expected to make it clear that concrete negotiations over eu entry are still far off , and that no specific date can be named . in a related topic , a number of member states have requested earnest debate over the future expansion plans of the current 25-member bloc , which many feel is admitting new members far too quickly .
what the union really needs is a consolidation phase , many diplomats say . fighting poverty in africa also on monday , foreign ministers are expected to adopt an overall strategy for eu relations with africa .
ministers agree that the neighboring continent needs more attention ; the goal is long-term development and economic partnership , if only as a means of staunching the flow of illegal refugees to europe .
the european union wants to enter a strategic partnership with all of africa 's approximately 50 states , in order to reach the eu millennium goals of fighting poverty by 2015 .
the foreign ministers are also very likely to vehemently reject the latest comments by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
last week , he questioned the veracity of the holocaust and suggested moving the state of israel to germany or austria .
there are no signs of progress when it comes to reanimating talks between the eu and iran over the latter 's atomic program . bernd riegert -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the eu budget stand-off : the areas of conflict as the six-month british presidency draws to a close , eu leaders embark on a critical week aimed at breaking the deadlock over the bloc 's budget .

this is very important for us , " anatoly perminov , head of russia 's federal space agency , said . with or without europe perminov previously said that russia could push ahead with the clipper project without european backing and mentioned china as a possible alternative partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new russian spacecraft could reach the international space station in 2010 russian scientists envisage that the clipper would weigh 14.5 tons and would carry up to six people on voyages to the international space station -lrb- iss -rrb- or on interplanetary trips . they have said the craft could be launched as soon as 2010 and have estimated the cost of development at $ 1 billion dollars -lrb- 845 million euros -rrb- . " before the final decision is taken , we will work together , we will come up with an action plan for the concept and utilization and the participation of european industries in the project , " dordain said . budgetary woes despite budgetary concerns voiced at last week 's berlin meeting , european financing would go ahead , daniel sacotte , the esa 's director of human spaceflight , microgravity and exploration , said . " the russians are not going to finance it , we will finance it from our side , " sacotte told afp . he added , however : " we needed the support from at least two states out of france , italy and germany .
we did n't get it . " also friday , the esa director general said russia 's soyuz space rockets , currently the only vehicles used for reaching the iss , had the full backing of the european agency . russian technology recognized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian space agency is still using the former soviet space center in baikonur , kazakhstan " based on performance , " the esa " has decided to consider soyuz as a full member of the family of launchers for esa missions , " alongside ariane and vega rockets , dordain said . a soyuz rocket will be used for the first launch in europe 's galileo satellite navigation project from kazakhstan 's baikonur cosmodrome on dec .
26 , dordoin said .
the esa also foresees use of soyuz rockets for a planned mission to mars , he added . the soyuz , a soviet-designed work horse , became the only means of taking personnel to and from the iss after the grounding of the us space shuttle fleet in august following a mishap on the latest mission similar to that which doomed the columbia orbiter in 2003 . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de esa meets in berlin to discuss future space programs the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- gathers in berlin monday to talk about the focus of european space exploration in coming years .

us officials acknowledged to the german government in 2004 that the man had been mistaken for somebody else and had been wrongly detained . foreign minister steinmeier , who already held a ministerial post in the schröder government , has vehemently denied german involvement in the affair .
he is expected to inform the german parliament and the public about the case in great detail this coming wednesday . unpleasant questions the question that el masri himself and leading german opposition figures have been asking is whether government officials assisted the abduction and detention of el masri in any way in a bid to improve german-us relations which had turned sour over the us-led war in iraq .
but german ministers at the weekend again denied any involvement by berlin in the abduction masterminded by the cia .
german deputy-chancellor franz müntefering indicated that media reports about possible government involvement were groundless . " what we are being confronted with is mere speculation , " müntefering said . " if people knew what happened as they claim , calls for a parliamentary inquiry would seem even more foolish .

steinmeier has repeatedly rejected opposition calls for his resignation , maintaining that the actions of the government were based on the law . but steinmeier is certainly sensing a need to inform the public about what happened in 2003 .
the el masri case will be debated in detail in the foreign and interior parliamentary committees before the foreign minister answers questions in the bundestag on wednesday .
social democrat floor leader and former defense minister peter struck is confident the el masri affair will not bring the new german government to its knees . " there 's no doubt that the german government would have violated the law , had it assisted in the abduction of a german citizen , " stuck said . " but from what i know at present , government offices were not involved and i have no reason to believe that we 'll see a different picture emerging by the end of this week , " he said . a touchstone for the new government wolfgang bosbach , a leading christian democrat lawmaker , said that the el mari case was clearly becoming a touchstone for the new government .
he wants all the facts on the table this week to ensure that the affair does not linger on into 2006 . meanwhile , a german daily reported on sunday that el masri was already under observation by german intelligence when he was abducted by the cia .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's steinmeier wants to focus on the eu constitution german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has put pressure on the gathering to at least come up with a time frame for further " reflection " on the eu constitutional crisis .
the british presidency has simply disregarded the constitution topic , and " made a mess of it , " according to one eu worker , who spoke off the record .
in general , the british had to " be pushed to engage " with any important topics , an eu diplomat said .
a constitutional crisis ?
the ratification process for the constitution was put on ice by eu leaders in june following a rejection of the new treaty by french and dutch voters .

however , the council of ministers is expected to make it clear that concrete negotiations over eu entry are still far off , and that no specific date can be named . in a related topic , a number of member states have requested earnest debate over the future expansion plans of the current 25-member bloc , which many feel is admitting new members far too quickly .

the european union wants to enter a strategic partnership with all of africa 's approximately 50 states , in order to reach the eu millennium goals of fighting poverty by 2015 .
the foreign ministers are also very likely to vehemently reject the latest comments by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's steinmeier wants to focus on the eu constitution german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has put pressure on the gathering to at least come up with a time frame for further " reflection " on the eu constitutional crisis .
the british presidency has simply disregarded the constitution topic , and " made a mess of it , " according to one eu worker , who spoke off the record .
in general , the british had to " be pushed to engage " with any important topics , an eu diplomat said .
a constitutional crisis ?
the ratification process for the constitution was put on ice by eu leaders in june following a rejection of the new treaty by french and dutch voters .
since the text of the constitution itself can not be changed and a second round of referenda on the same text is unlikely , the eu finds itself between a rock and a hard place . a solution must be found by next summer ; in autumn 2006 at the latest , the eu council - the heads of state who make up the union 's main decision-making body - must officially decide on the constitution 's future . eu expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigration from africa is a growing problem for the eu on the foreign-policy agendy , monday 's meeting is expected to recommend that macedonia - previously a part of yugoslavia - be allowed candidacy status for acceptance into the european union .
however , the council of ministers is expected to make it clear that concrete negotiations over eu entry are still far off , and that no specific date can be named . in a related topic , a number of member states have requested earnest debate over the future expansion plans of the current 25-member bloc , which many feel is admitting new members far too quickly .
what the union really needs is a consolidation phase , many diplomats say . fighting poverty in africa also on monday , foreign ministers are expected to adopt an overall strategy for eu relations with africa .
ministers agree that the neighboring continent needs more attention ; the goal is long-term development and economic partnership , if only as a means of staunching the flow of illegal refugees to europe .
the european union wants to enter a strategic partnership with all of africa 's approximately 50 states , in order to reach the eu millennium goals of fighting poverty by 2015 .
the foreign ministers are also very likely to vehemently reject the latest comments by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
last week , he questioned the veracity of the holocaust and suggested moving the state of israel to germany or austria .
there are no signs of progress when it comes to reanimating talks between the eu and iran over the latter 's atomic program . bernd riegert -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the eu budget stand-off : the areas of conflict as the six-month british presidency draws to a close , eu leaders embark on a critical week aimed at breaking the deadlock over the bloc 's budget .

" it lasted 45 seconds , " one said .
straw merely said london would put forward revised proposals during the week but added that london would not pay any price for an agreement . " we 're not in for a deal at any price , " straw told reporters , referring to the pressure britain has been under to relinquish more of its annual rebate to fund aid to new east european members in the budget . straw ’ s stance makes it look increasingly unlikely that that there would be any concessions on the long-term eu budget when the ministers of the 25-nation bloc convene on wednesday .
when pressed on whether there was a chance of an accord being agreed upon on thursday and friday , straw told reporters : " i ca n't say . " it was a further slap in the face for eu officials who are keen to avoid a damaging split over the budget akin to the crisis resulting from the bloc ’ s failure to ratify its own constitution . barroso appeals to blair but to little avail bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actions not words suggest that tony blair has ignored jose barroso 's appeals .
in an attempt to prevent another schism in the eu , european commission president jose manuel barroso had personally appealed to british prime minister tony blair for a rapid resolution , urging him to find a workable alternative to the existing proposals . barroso , pressing the point that britain bore a special responsibility to ensure that talks did not collapse as they did at the acrimonious constitution summit last june , also asked blair to raise overall eu spending and offer deeper and permanent cuts to britain ’ s controversial rebate . on evidence , barroso ’ s words have fallen on deaf ears and have instilled a sense of dread in the eu president ahead of the summit this week .
" as somebody put it , to fail once is unfortunate .
to fail twice would be careless , " barroso told reporters . the package britain put forward last week proposed a cut of 14 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.49 billion -rrb- or 8.5 percent in aid to poor ex-communist newcomers to the bloc and detailed a continued rise of britain ’ s own rebate over the next seven years .
it was almost unanimously rejected . newest eu members facing huge bill if talks fail bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the talks fail , come 2007 the new states will have pay up .
barroso highlighted the need to support the newest eu members when he spoke on monday .
" new member states must be offered a fairer deal .
i believe they need to be offered significantly higher levels of investment than in the current proposal . "
failure to reach a deal will immediately cost the new states cash in 2007 .
despite the ominous signs , barroso added that the " urgent , necessary " budget deal was " within reach . " not according to jack straw it isn ’ t .
the foreign secretary maintained that those members expecting big changes to the proposals would be disappointed , hinting at a set of plans not too different that were thrown out last week . " we are thinking about revisions to those proposals , and those revisions , if indeed there are any , will be made available in the course of this week .
these are difficult negotiations .
the margin for maneuver is narrow , " he said . britain thought it had the deal in the bag when it offered to forego 8 billion euros over seven years from its rebate , worth 5.6 billion euros this year , to meet what it called its fair share of the costs of the eu 's eastward enlargement last year . britain 's full share of the non-agricultural costs of enlargement would in fact be 18 billion euros , according to european union financial experts .
france put the figure at 14 billion . france wants rebate cut in return for cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french foreign minister philippe douste- blazy wants a massive cut in britain 's rebate .
the french weighed in with particular relish in the row over the british rebate , saying that it should be cut to 35-36 billion euros over the period instead of the 50 billion it would reach without reform .
french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy insisted that the reduction should be a " permanent legal commitment . " as an incentive , douste-blazy said that paris would allow a future review of the entire budget as long as the 2007-13 package , which has provisions included for the protection of french agriculture , remained guaranteed . officials close to the british contingent said that there was a fair chance that the new proposals , due on wednesday , would include a slight increase in the amount but by nothing like the amounts suggested by brussels or paris .

us officials acknowledged to the german government in 2004 that the man had been mistaken for somebody else and had been wrongly detained . foreign minister steinmeier , who already held a ministerial post in the schröder government , has vehemently denied german involvement in the affair .
he is expected to inform the german parliament and the public about the case in great detail this coming wednesday . unpleasant questions the question that el masri himself and leading german opposition figures have been asking is whether government officials assisted the abduction and detention of el masri in any way in a bid to improve german-us relations which had turned sour over the us-led war in iraq .
but german ministers at the weekend again denied any involvement by berlin in the abduction masterminded by the cia .
german deputy-chancellor franz müntefering indicated that media reports about possible government involvement were groundless . " what we are being confronted with is mere speculation , " müntefering said . " if people knew what happened as they claim , calls for a parliamentary inquiry would seem even more foolish .
it 's party politics that are behind much of the criticism being voiced right now , with the aim of discrediting the new foreign minister .
i 'm calling on all sides concerned to exercise restraint and wait for the results of the forthcoming meetings in the parliamentary committees , " he said . not our fault bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier will address the parliament on wednesday german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier says there are no signs that any mistakes were made by government members and other german officials in the el masri case .
steinmeier has repeatedly rejected opposition calls for his resignation , maintaining that the actions of the government were based on the law . but steinmeier is certainly sensing a need to inform the public about what happened in 2003 .
the el masri case will be debated in detail in the foreign and interior parliamentary committees before the foreign minister answers questions in the bundestag on wednesday .
social democrat floor leader and former defense minister peter struck is confident the el masri affair will not bring the new german government to its knees . " there 's no doubt that the german government would have violated the law , had it assisted in the abduction of a german citizen , " stuck said . " but from what i know at present , government offices were not involved and i have no reason to believe that we 'll see a different picture emerging by the end of this week , " he said . a touchstone for the new government wolfgang bosbach , a leading christian democrat lawmaker , said that the el mari case was clearly becoming a touchstone for the new government .
he wants all the facts on the table this week to ensure that the affair does not linger on into 2006 . meanwhile , a german daily reported on sunday that el masri was already under observation by german intelligence when he was abducted by the cia .
a german security official told the newspaper that masri was not considered to be an active islamic extremist .
it is known , however that he did have contacts to another man under observation .
he said the little that was known was transmitted to the americans . hardy graupner -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de questions arise over us base in kosovo while us secretary of state condoleezza rice secured a reprieve from european governments over the treatment of detainees , the suspicion of systematical abuse grows after reports of a guantanamo-like base in kosovo . -lrb- dec .

his name is hans riegel , and millions of children around the world get their first sugar rush chewing on his sticky candies . it is practically impossible to find a kid in this world that does n't have a sweet tooth .
it is this law of nature that made hans riegel , junior , one of the richest germans living today . his assets , like those of his brother paul , have been estimated to 1.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- haribo , the international sweets giant with an estimated annual turnover of 1.5 billion euros , holds a 60 % market share on licorice and fruit drops in germany , and is undisputed number one in europe .
in the eighties , it crossed the big pond and started expanding in the united states .
in the nineties , it discovered eastern europe .
the world of gummy bears knows no borders . hans riegel , senior , confectioner from bonn , founded the family business in 1920 and gave it the exotic sounding name haribo , which was , in fact , an acronym consisting of his initials and the city of bonn .
but it was really hans junior , who took over the family business after the second world war , that turned it into an international success story . tradition and change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the summer of 2005 , haribo organized a licorice-inspired fashion show it is a well-established part of the haribo corporate mythology that , at least in the first few years of developing their business , hans senior and his wife gertrud used to deliver their products on their own , by bicycle .
hans junior , who prepared himself for his later career by earning a doctorate from the university of bonn on the role of sugar in world trade , does n't have to play delivery boy anymore because haribo candies are now sold over the world .
but he does like to fly his own chopper to a business meeting . what has n't changed over the years is the soul of the family business : hans riegel sits at the top of the gummy bear pyramid and rules supreme in a somewhat antiquated managerial style .
as a patriarchic figurehead who believes more in trust and authority than focus groups and marketing departments , this active octogenarian has single-handedly turned his father 's business into a major player on the world market .
he is known to have said that " without haribo , my life has no meaning . " tradition means everything to hans riegel .
the original haribo advertising slogan - " haribo macht kinder froh , " which literally means " haribo makes children happy " and , luckily enough , rhymes in german - was sold to riegel senior in the thirties by a traveling salesman .
the slogan was updated only once , in the sixties , to welcome the paying adults into the fairy world of gum drops : " kids and grown-ups love it so , the happy world of haribo . " techno grandpa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions of gummy bear leave the haribo factories on a daily basis in 1994 , riegel was awarded the order of the federal republic of germany , 1st class , -lrb- bundesverdienstkreuz -rrb- for his services to society .
he is a a self-proclaimed fan of techno music , who likes to follow latest trends “ i love kids and i enjoy watching them .
they are my customers , i have to know what sweets they enjoy , what they think , what language they speak , " riegel said . since 1991 , haribo has been advertised in germany by thomas gottschalk , an aging entertainer who is also a household name in germany .
the riegel-gottschalk partnership is the said to be the most successful advertising campaign in german history , although younger german entertainers , like the popular stefan raab , enjoy making fun of gottschalk 's not very convincing attempts to use slang in haribo ads . the gummy bear dynasty is in no shortage of males called hans .
hans junior inherited the family business from his father , hans senior , and he is likely to leave the throne to his nephew hans-jürgen , who is currently running a haribo factory in france .

" it lasted 45 seconds , " one said .
straw merely said london would put forward revised proposals during the week but added that london would not pay any price for an agreement . " we 're not in for a deal at any price , " straw told reporters , referring to the pressure britain has been under to relinquish more of its annual rebate to fund aid to new east european members in the budget . straw ’ s stance makes it look increasingly unlikely that that there would be any concessions on the long-term eu budget when the ministers of the 25-nation bloc convene on wednesday .

in an attempt to prevent another schism in the eu , european commission president jose manuel barroso had personally appealed to british prime minister tony blair for a rapid resolution , urging him to find a workable alternative to the existing proposals . barroso , pressing the point that britain bore a special responsibility to ensure that talks did not collapse as they did at the acrimonious constitution summit last june , also asked blair to raise overall eu spending and offer deeper and permanent cuts to britain ’ s controversial rebate . on evidence , barroso ’ s words have fallen on deaf ears and have instilled a sense of dread in the eu president ahead of the summit this week .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's steinmeier wants to focus on the eu constitution german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has put pressure on the gathering to at least come up with a time frame for further " reflection " on the eu constitutional crisis .
the british presidency has simply disregarded the constitution topic , and " made a mess of it , " according to one eu worker , who spoke off the record .
in general , the british had to " be pushed to engage " with any important topics , an eu diplomat said .
a constitutional crisis ?
the ratification process for the constitution was put on ice by eu leaders in june following a rejection of the new treaty by french and dutch voters .
since the text of the constitution itself can not be changed and a second round of referenda on the same text is unlikely , the eu finds itself between a rock and a hard place . a solution must be found by next summer ; in autumn 2006 at the latest , the eu council - the heads of state who make up the union 's main decision-making body - must officially decide on the constitution 's future . eu expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigration from africa is a growing problem for the eu on the foreign-policy agendy , monday 's meeting is expected to recommend that macedonia - previously a part of yugoslavia - be allowed candidacy status for acceptance into the european union .
however , the council of ministers is expected to make it clear that concrete negotiations over eu entry are still far off , and that no specific date can be named . in a related topic , a number of member states have requested earnest debate over the future expansion plans of the current 25-member bloc , which many feel is admitting new members far too quickly .
what the union really needs is a consolidation phase , many diplomats say . fighting poverty in africa also on monday , foreign ministers are expected to adopt an overall strategy for eu relations with africa .
ministers agree that the neighboring continent needs more attention ; the goal is long-term development and economic partnership , if only as a means of staunching the flow of illegal refugees to europe .
the european union wants to enter a strategic partnership with all of africa 's approximately 50 states , in order to reach the eu millennium goals of fighting poverty by 2015 .
the foreign ministers are also very likely to vehemently reject the latest comments by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
last week , he questioned the veracity of the holocaust and suggested moving the state of israel to germany or austria .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 12.12.2005 moaning tops agenda at eu wrap-up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair is likely to attract flak as the year comes to an end the eu foreign ministers meet for the last time this year , but the usual end-of-year praise will likely be trumped by dissatisfaction over britain 's presidency . three days before eu heads of state meet for a summit to decide on a budget for 2007 to 2013 , britain , which held the eu presidency this past calendar year , still has n't come up with an acceptable concept to bring to the negotiating table .
on the contrary , diplomats are still waiting on british prime minister tony blair 's promised suggestion .
this means eu foreign ministers , who were gathered monday to begin preparations for the summit that will take place on dec .
15 and 16 , have something of an empty agenda , with little to discuss .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's steinmeier wants to focus on the eu constitution german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has put pressure on the gathering to at least come up with a time frame for further " reflection " on the eu constitutional crisis .
the british presidency has simply disregarded the constitution topic , and " made a mess of it , " according to one eu worker , who spoke off the record .
in general , the british had to " be pushed to engage " with any important topics , an eu diplomat said .
a constitutional crisis ?
the ratification process for the constitution was put on ice by eu leaders in june following a rejection of the new treaty by french and dutch voters .
since the text of the constitution itself can not be changed and a second round of referenda on the same text is unlikely , the eu finds itself between a rock and a hard place . a solution must be found by next summer ; in autumn 2006 at the latest , the eu council - the heads of state who make up the union 's main decision-making body - must officially decide on the constitution 's future . eu expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigration from africa is a growing problem for the eu on the foreign-policy agendy , monday 's meeting is expected to recommend that macedonia - previously a part of yugoslavia - be allowed candidacy status for acceptance into the european union .
however , the council of ministers is expected to make it clear that concrete negotiations over eu entry are still far off , and that no specific date can be named . in a related topic , a number of member states have requested earnest debate over the future expansion plans of the current 25-member bloc , which many feel is admitting new members far too quickly .
what the union really needs is a consolidation phase , many diplomats say . fighting poverty in africa also on monday , foreign ministers are expected to adopt an overall strategy for eu relations with africa .
ministers agree that the neighboring continent needs more attention ; the goal is long-term development and economic partnership , if only as a means of staunching the flow of illegal refugees to europe .
the european union wants to enter a strategic partnership with all of africa 's approximately 50 states , in order to reach the eu millennium goals of fighting poverty by 2015 .
the foreign ministers are also very likely to vehemently reject the latest comments by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
last week , he questioned the veracity of the holocaust and suggested moving the state of israel to germany or austria .
there are no signs of progress when it comes to reanimating talks between the eu and iran over the latter 's atomic program . bernd riegert -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the eu budget stand-off : the areas of conflict as the six-month british presidency draws to a close , eu leaders embark on a critical week aimed at breaking the deadlock over the bloc 's budget .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.12.2005 berlin under pressure in the cia abduction case großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german government must polish up its image , tainted by the cia affair alleged involvement of german officials in the cia abduction of a german citizen have been causing headaches in berlin , but the government has promised to lay its cards on the table this week . the german grand coalition government went on the offensive over the weekend to answer nagging questions as to whether german officials under the former schröder government assisted the abduction and detention of a lebanese-born german national khaled el masri . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both khaled el masri and the german public want answers in 2003 , the cia abducted german national khaled el masri in macedonia and flew him to afghanistan where he was detained for five months as a terror suspect and allegedly mistreated .
us officials acknowledged to the german government in 2004 that the man had been mistaken for somebody else and had been wrongly detained . foreign minister steinmeier , who already held a ministerial post in the schröder government , has vehemently denied german involvement in the affair .
he is expected to inform the german parliament and the public about the case in great detail this coming wednesday . unpleasant questions the question that el masri himself and leading german opposition figures have been asking is whether government officials assisted the abduction and detention of el masri in any way in a bid to improve german-us relations which had turned sour over the us-led war in iraq .
but german ministers at the weekend again denied any involvement by berlin in the abduction masterminded by the cia .
german deputy-chancellor franz müntefering indicated that media reports about possible government involvement were groundless . " what we are being confronted with is mere speculation , " müntefering said . " if people knew what happened as they claim , calls for a parliamentary inquiry would seem even more foolish .
it 's party politics that are behind much of the criticism being voiced right now , with the aim of discrediting the new foreign minister .
i 'm calling on all sides concerned to exercise restraint and wait for the results of the forthcoming meetings in the parliamentary committees , " he said . not our fault bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier will address the parliament on wednesday german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier says there are no signs that any mistakes were made by government members and other german officials in the el masri case .
steinmeier has repeatedly rejected opposition calls for his resignation , maintaining that the actions of the government were based on the law . but steinmeier is certainly sensing a need to inform the public about what happened in 2003 .
the el masri case will be debated in detail in the foreign and interior parliamentary committees before the foreign minister answers questions in the bundestag on wednesday .
social democrat floor leader and former defense minister peter struck is confident the el masri affair will not bring the new german government to its knees . " there 's no doubt that the german government would have violated the law , had it assisted in the abduction of a german citizen , " stuck said . " but from what i know at present , government offices were not involved and i have no reason to believe that we 'll see a different picture emerging by the end of this week , " he said . a touchstone for the new government wolfgang bosbach , a leading christian democrat lawmaker , said that the el mari case was clearly becoming a touchstone for the new government .
he wants all the facts on the table this week to ensure that the affair does not linger on into 2006 . meanwhile , a german daily reported on sunday that el masri was already under observation by german intelligence when he was abducted by the cia .
a german security official told the newspaper that masri was not considered to be an active islamic extremist .
it is known , however that he did have contacts to another man under observation .
he said the little that was known was transmitted to the americans . hardy graupner -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de questions arise over us base in kosovo while us secretary of state condoleezza rice secured a reprieve from european governments over the treatment of detainees , the suspicion of systematical abuse grows after reports of a guantanamo-like base in kosovo . -lrb- dec .

us officials acknowledged to the german government in 2004 that the man had been mistaken for somebody else and had been wrongly detained . foreign minister steinmeier , who already held a ministerial post in the schröder government , has vehemently denied german involvement in the affair .
he is expected to inform the german parliament and the public about the case in great detail this coming wednesday . unpleasant questions the question that el masri himself and leading german opposition figures have been asking is whether government officials assisted the abduction and detention of el masri in any way in a bid to improve german-us relations which had turned sour over the us-led war in iraq .
but german ministers at the weekend again denied any involvement by berlin in the abduction masterminded by the cia .
german deputy-chancellor franz müntefering indicated that media reports about possible government involvement were groundless . " what we are being confronted with is mere speculation , " müntefering said . " if people knew what happened as they claim , calls for a parliamentary inquiry would seem even more foolish .
it 's party politics that are behind much of the criticism being voiced right now , with the aim of discrediting the new foreign minister .
i 'm calling on all sides concerned to exercise restraint and wait for the results of the forthcoming meetings in the parliamentary committees , " he said . not our fault bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier will address the parliament on wednesday german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier says there are no signs that any mistakes were made by government members and other german officials in the el masri case .
steinmeier has repeatedly rejected opposition calls for his resignation , maintaining that the actions of the government were based on the law . but steinmeier is certainly sensing a need to inform the public about what happened in 2003 .
the el masri case will be debated in detail in the foreign and interior parliamentary committees before the foreign minister answers questions in the bundestag on wednesday .
social democrat floor leader and former defense minister peter struck is confident the el masri affair will not bring the new german government to its knees . " there 's no doubt that the german government would have violated the law , had it assisted in the abduction of a german citizen , " stuck said . " but from what i know at present , government offices were not involved and i have no reason to believe that we 'll see a different picture emerging by the end of this week , " he said . a touchstone for the new government wolfgang bosbach , a leading christian democrat lawmaker , said that the el mari case was clearly becoming a touchstone for the new government .
he wants all the facts on the table this week to ensure that the affair does not linger on into 2006 . meanwhile , a german daily reported on sunday that el masri was already under observation by german intelligence when he was abducted by the cia .
a german security official told the newspaper that masri was not considered to be an active islamic extremist .
it is known , however that he did have contacts to another man under observation .
he said the little that was known was transmitted to the americans . hardy graupner -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de questions arise over us base in kosovo while us secretary of state condoleezza rice secured a reprieve from european governments over the treatment of detainees , the suspicion of systematical abuse grows after reports of a guantanamo-like base in kosovo . -lrb- dec .

his name is hans riegel , and millions of children around the world get their first sugar rush chewing on his sticky candies . it is practically impossible to find a kid in this world that does n't have a sweet tooth .

his name is hans riegel , and millions of children around the world get their first sugar rush chewing on his sticky candies . it is practically impossible to find a kid in this world that does n't have a sweet tooth .
it is this law of nature that made hans riegel , junior , one of the richest germans living today . his assets , like those of his brother paul , have been estimated to 1.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- haribo , the international sweets giant with an estimated annual turnover of 1.5 billion euros , holds a 60 % market share on licorice and fruit drops in germany , and is undisputed number one in europe .
in the eighties , it crossed the big pond and started expanding in the united states .
in the nineties , it discovered eastern europe .
the world of gummy bears knows no borders . hans riegel , senior , confectioner from bonn , founded the family business in 1920 and gave it the exotic sounding name haribo , which was , in fact , an acronym consisting of his initials and the city of bonn .
but it was really hans junior , who took over the family business after the second world war , that turned it into an international success story . tradition and change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the summer of 2005 , haribo organized a licorice-inspired fashion show it is a well-established part of the haribo corporate mythology that , at least in the first few years of developing their business , hans senior and his wife gertrud used to deliver their products on their own , by bicycle .
hans junior , who prepared himself for his later career by earning a doctorate from the university of bonn on the role of sugar in world trade , does n't have to play delivery boy anymore because haribo candies are now sold over the world .
but he does like to fly his own chopper to a business meeting . what has n't changed over the years is the soul of the family business : hans riegel sits at the top of the gummy bear pyramid and rules supreme in a somewhat antiquated managerial style .
as a patriarchic figurehead who believes more in trust and authority than focus groups and marketing departments , this active octogenarian has single-handedly turned his father 's business into a major player on the world market .
he is known to have said that " without haribo , my life has no meaning . " tradition means everything to hans riegel .
the original haribo advertising slogan - " haribo macht kinder froh , " which literally means " haribo makes children happy " and , luckily enough , rhymes in german - was sold to riegel senior in the thirties by a traveling salesman .
the slogan was updated only once , in the sixties , to welcome the paying adults into the fairy world of gum drops : " kids and grown-ups love it so , the happy world of haribo . " techno grandpa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions of gummy bear leave the haribo factories on a daily basis in 1994 , riegel was awarded the order of the federal republic of germany , 1st class , -lrb- bundesverdienstkreuz -rrb- for his services to society .
he is a a self-proclaimed fan of techno music , who likes to follow latest trends “ i love kids and i enjoy watching them .
they are my customers , i have to know what sweets they enjoy , what they think , what language they speak , " riegel said . since 1991 , haribo has been advertised in germany by thomas gottschalk , an aging entertainer who is also a household name in germany .
the riegel-gottschalk partnership is the said to be the most successful advertising campaign in german history , although younger german entertainers , like the popular stefan raab , enjoy making fun of gottschalk 's not very convincing attempts to use slang in haribo ads . the gummy bear dynasty is in no shortage of males called hans .

following friday 's draw fans of the 32 competing nations now know where and when their teams are playing and a mad ticket rush is anticipated . " we can sense the interest from participating teams and from neighboring countries increasing enormously , " said horst r. schmidt , vice-president of the organizing committee . tickets from world and national associations fans from abroad , if they did n't try to order tickets blindly in one of the first three phases , have two paths to choose from when ordering this time . they can turn to their national teams .
the 32 countries ' individual associations all received an allocation of eight percent of the tickets for the group phase matches they are playing in .
in addition , there are " conditional tickets " that can be ordered .
these are the knockout stage matches and will be filled if your country advances to that stage . the national associations dictate the sales process in their country . the world soccer body fifa , which has alone sold tickets so far , also has more on sale .
the opening match between germany and costa rica is already sold out and there is only a limited supply for the most in-demand matches , such as the finals and semifinals . the deadline for this phase is january 15 , 2006 and the lottery will be held on january 31 .
any unsold tickets then will be offered on a first come , first served basis starting february 15 . first phases massively oversubscribed the possibility that at that point , there are any more tickets remaining in the hands of fifa or the 32 national associations must be close to nil .
when the first sales window started earlier this year , there were over eight million orders for 812,000 tickets .
up to now , 80 percent of the tickets available have been snapped up by europeans according to the world cup committee . " we assume the demand will far outstrip the contingent this time again .
there is n't a fairer method to distribute the tickets than through a lottery , " said schmidt . naturally , many tickets will be returned over the course of the next six months , for which a last minute window will be opened starting on may 1 and running to the end of the tournament on july 9 . ticket prices range from 35 euros -lrb- $ 41 -rrb- for the cheapest seats at group games -lrb- excluding the opening match -rrb- to 600 euros -lrb- $ 706 -rrb- for the best seats at the final in berlin . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de favorites wary of first round foes while the tunisia-saudi arabia game probably wo n't have many local ticket holders in munich gasping in delight , the opening round of the 2006 world cup will have a number of lively match ups .

on the contrary , diplomats are still waiting on british prime minister tony blair 's promised suggestion .
this means eu foreign ministers , who were gathered monday to begin preparations for the summit that will take place on dec .
15 and 16 , have something of an empty agenda , with little to discuss .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's steinmeier wants to focus on the eu constitution german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has put pressure on the gathering to at least come up with a time frame for further " reflection " on the eu constitutional crisis .
the british presidency has simply disregarded the constitution topic , and " made a mess of it , " according to one eu worker , who spoke off the record .
in general , the british had to " be pushed to engage " with any important topics , an eu diplomat said .
a constitutional crisis ?
the ratification process for the constitution was put on ice by eu leaders in june following a rejection of the new treaty by french and dutch voters .
since the text of the constitution itself can not be changed and a second round of referenda on the same text is unlikely , the eu finds itself between a rock and a hard place . a solution must be found by next summer ; in autumn 2006 at the latest , the eu council - the heads of state who make up the union 's main decision-making body - must officially decide on the constitution 's future . eu expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigration from africa is a growing problem for the eu on the foreign-policy agendy , monday 's meeting is expected to recommend that macedonia - previously a part of yugoslavia - be allowed candidacy status for acceptance into the european union .
however , the council of ministers is expected to make it clear that concrete negotiations over eu entry are still far off , and that no specific date can be named . in a related topic , a number of member states have requested earnest debate over the future expansion plans of the current 25-member bloc , which many feel is admitting new members far too quickly .
what the union really needs is a consolidation phase , many diplomats say . fighting poverty in africa also on monday , foreign ministers are expected to adopt an overall strategy for eu relations with africa .
ministers agree that the neighboring continent needs more attention ; the goal is long-term development and economic partnership , if only as a means of staunching the flow of illegal refugees to europe .
the european union wants to enter a strategic partnership with all of africa 's approximately 50 states , in order to reach the eu millennium goals of fighting poverty by 2015 .
the foreign ministers are also very likely to vehemently reject the latest comments by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
last week , he questioned the veracity of the holocaust and suggested moving the state of israel to germany or austria .

250,000 seats will be made available starting on monday in the fourth sales period . the organizing committee for the 2006 world cup in germany expects demand to soar when the fourth sales period of 250,000 tickets begins on monday at 12:00 noon cet -lrb- 1100 gmt -rrb- .
following friday 's draw fans of the 32 competing nations now know where and when their teams are playing and a mad ticket rush is anticipated . " we can sense the interest from participating teams and from neighboring countries increasing enormously , " said horst r. schmidt , vice-president of the organizing committee . tickets from world and national associations fans from abroad , if they did n't try to order tickets blindly in one of the first three phases , have two paths to choose from when ordering this time . they can turn to their national teams .
the 32 countries ' individual associations all received an allocation of eight percent of the tickets for the group phase matches they are playing in .
in addition , there are " conditional tickets " that can be ordered .
these are the knockout stage matches and will be filled if your country advances to that stage . the national associations dictate the sales process in their country . the world soccer body fifa , which has alone sold tickets so far , also has more on sale .
the opening match between germany and costa rica is already sold out and there is only a limited supply for the most in-demand matches , such as the finals and semifinals . the deadline for this phase is january 15 , 2006 and the lottery will be held on january 31 .
any unsold tickets then will be offered on a first come , first served basis starting february 15 . first phases massively oversubscribed the possibility that at that point , there are any more tickets remaining in the hands of fifa or the 32 national associations must be close to nil .
when the first sales window started earlier this year , there were over eight million orders for 812,000 tickets .
up to now , 80 percent of the tickets available have been snapped up by europeans according to the world cup committee . " we assume the demand will far outstrip the contingent this time again .

" it lasted 45 seconds , " one said .
straw merely said london would put forward revised proposals during the week but added that london would not pay any price for an agreement . " we 're not in for a deal at any price , " straw told reporters , referring to the pressure britain has been under to relinquish more of its annual rebate to fund aid to new east european members in the budget . straw ’ s stance makes it look increasingly unlikely that that there would be any concessions on the long-term eu budget when the ministers of the 25-nation bloc convene on wednesday .
when pressed on whether there was a chance of an accord being agreed upon on thursday and friday , straw told reporters : " i ca n't say . " it was a further slap in the face for eu officials who are keen to avoid a damaging split over the budget akin to the crisis resulting from the bloc ’ s failure to ratify its own constitution . barroso appeals to blair but to little avail bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actions not words suggest that tony blair has ignored jose barroso 's appeals .
in an attempt to prevent another schism in the eu , european commission president jose manuel barroso had personally appealed to british prime minister tony blair for a rapid resolution , urging him to find a workable alternative to the existing proposals . barroso , pressing the point that britain bore a special responsibility to ensure that talks did not collapse as they did at the acrimonious constitution summit last june , also asked blair to raise overall eu spending and offer deeper and permanent cuts to britain ’ s controversial rebate . on evidence , barroso ’ s words have fallen on deaf ears and have instilled a sense of dread in the eu president ahead of the summit this week .
" as somebody put it , to fail once is unfortunate .
to fail twice would be careless , " barroso told reporters . the package britain put forward last week proposed a cut of 14 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.49 billion -rrb- or 8.5 percent in aid to poor ex-communist newcomers to the bloc and detailed a continued rise of britain ’ s own rebate over the next seven years .
it was almost unanimously rejected . newest eu members facing huge bill if talks fail bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the talks fail , come 2007 the new states will have pay up .
barroso highlighted the need to support the newest eu members when he spoke on monday .
" new member states must be offered a fairer deal .
i believe they need to be offered significantly higher levels of investment than in the current proposal . "
failure to reach a deal will immediately cost the new states cash in 2007 .
despite the ominous signs , barroso added that the " urgent , necessary " budget deal was " within reach . " not according to jack straw it isn ’ t .
the foreign secretary maintained that those members expecting big changes to the proposals would be disappointed , hinting at a set of plans not too different that were thrown out last week . " we are thinking about revisions to those proposals , and those revisions , if indeed there are any , will be made available in the course of this week .
these are difficult negotiations .
the margin for maneuver is narrow , " he said . britain thought it had the deal in the bag when it offered to forego 8 billion euros over seven years from its rebate , worth 5.6 billion euros this year , to meet what it called its fair share of the costs of the eu 's eastward enlargement last year . britain 's full share of the non-agricultural costs of enlargement would in fact be 18 billion euros , according to european union financial experts .
france put the figure at 14 billion . france wants rebate cut in return for cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french foreign minister philippe douste- blazy wants a massive cut in britain 's rebate .
the french weighed in with particular relish in the row over the british rebate , saying that it should be cut to 35-36 billion euros over the period instead of the 50 billion it would reach without reform .
french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy insisted that the reduction should be a " permanent legal commitment . " as an incentive , douste-blazy said that paris would allow a future review of the entire budget as long as the 2007-13 package , which has provisions included for the protection of french agriculture , remained guaranteed . officials close to the british contingent said that there was a fair chance that the new proposals , due on wednesday , would include a slight increase in the amount but by nothing like the amounts suggested by brussels or paris .

dw-world looks at the major areas of conflict . with the clock ticking down to the final days before the next budget needs to be signed and sealed , the european union is locked in a major dispute over who pays how much into the eu pot - and , just as important , who receives what over the seven years from 2007-2013 . key sticking points are britain 's refusal to give ground on its budget rebate , and french resistance to surrendering support for eu farmers , which swallows about 40 percent of spending . but the stakes are also high for the eu 's newer member states , desperate to get hold of eu aid for infrastructure such as motorway and train links , left lagging behind western europe by decades of communism . more broadly , failure to agree on a budget would leave the eu scuffling over its budget on a year-by-year basis , threatening regular deadlock in a bloc already hobbled by the rejection of its constitution this year . britain , which holds the eu 's presidency , is set to make modified proposals after talks among foreign ministers monday , as preparation for a summit of the bloc 's leaders starting on thursday . london is still hopeful a deal can be struck . here are some basic facts about the eu budget : global spending the six main contributors to the budget - austria , britain , france , germany , the netherlands and sweden - want spending limited to about 1.0 percent of eu gross national income , or 815 billion euros -lrb- 954 billion dollars -rrb- . but the european commission wants a robust budget to pay for ambitious programs sought by member states and has called for payments of 943 billion euros -lrb- 1.14 percent of gni -rrb- over the 2007-2013 period , while the parliament suggests 883 billion euros would be enough . luxembourg , which tried to negotiate a budget deal in june when it held the eu 's presidency , offered a compromise of 875 billion euros but it was rejected by britain , finland , the netherlands , spain and sweden . london argued last week that the budget should be smaller and proposed an estimated 846.8 billion euros , an offer which has largely been rejected . net contributors the member states often concentrate on how much they pay into the budget and how little they get back - their net outlay .

but the ex-chancellor has no intention of putting his feet up . less than three weeks after leaving office , former german chancellor gerhard schröder has reinvented himself as an international businessman with concerns in russia and switzerland . schröder wasted no time in making a clean break with politics after he handed the reins of power to angela merkel on november 22 .
but his decision to delve into the world of international business has not been without a political fallout . on friday , the chairman of russian energy giant gazprom , alexei miller , announced that schröder would head the shareholders ' committee of the consortium building a controversial gas pipeline under the baltic sea from russia to germany . the announcement came just after the ceremonial launch of construction of the north european gas pipeline , in which gazprom owns a 51-percent stake and germany 's e.on and basf own 24.5-percent stakes . the appointment of schröder , who helped secure the deal for the four-billion-euro -lrb- $ 4.7-billion -rrb- pipeline earlier this year while he was still chancellor , has already sparked questions of potential conflict of interest and debate about the need for regulations for retired politicians moving into business . while newspaper commentators generally agreed the pipeline project was useful , they said schröder 's move raised fresh questions about the links between big business and politics and the cosy relations with putin when in office . questionable occupation " it stinks , " greens co-leader richard bütikofer , whose party was in power with schröder 's social democrats when the pipeline deal was struck , told tagesspiegel newspaper .

during his seven years in office , schröder built up a close personal relationship with russian president vladimir putin , whom he often visited privately . in germany , many criticized schröder 's friendship with the russian leader , particularly his silence on moscow 's policies in the caucuses and its hard line in the yukos oil saga . the news that schröder will be sitting on the board of the gas pipeline casts a new " smudgy light " on the former government 's cool relations with poland and the baltic states , who were left out of the pipeline project , the berlin tagesspiegel wrote on saturday .
however , the german chairman of corruption watchdog transparency international said there was no reason for alarm . " a supervisory board post is in our view certainly something that a former prominent politician can take up , " hansjoerg elshorst told tagesspiegel . " one can only talk of abuse if schröder receives excessive reward , " he said . media chancellor turns media consultant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder was equally at home in front of the camera as he was the lecturn .

the man often called the media chancellor for his skill in playing to the cameras has accepted a job as an advisor to leading swiss media group , ringier . the group publishes the blick tabloid , switzerland 's top-selling newspaper , and also has interests in eastern europe , china and vietnam . the post at zurich-based ringier came as something of a surprise as schröder had told the german press he intended to return to his first profession of practicing law . english lessons to broaden future horizons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " what did tony say ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's steinmeier wants to focus on the eu constitution german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has put pressure on the gathering to at least come up with a time frame for further " reflection " on the eu constitutional crisis .

a constitutional crisis ?
the ratification process for the constitution was put on ice by eu leaders in june following a rejection of the new treaty by french and dutch voters .
since the text of the constitution itself can not be changed and a second round of referenda on the same text is unlikely , the eu finds itself between a rock and a hard place . a solution must be found by next summer ; in autumn 2006 at the latest , the eu council - the heads of state who make up the union 's main decision-making body - must officially decide on the constitution 's future . eu expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigration from africa is a growing problem for the eu on the foreign-policy agendy , monday 's meeting is expected to recommend that macedonia - previously a part of yugoslavia - be allowed candidacy status for acceptance into the european union .
however , the council of ministers is expected to make it clear that concrete negotiations over eu entry are still far off , and that no specific date can be named . in a related topic , a number of member states have requested earnest debate over the future expansion plans of the current 25-member bloc , which many feel is admitting new members far too quickly .
what the union really needs is a consolidation phase , many diplomats say . fighting poverty in africa also on monday , foreign ministers are expected to adopt an overall strategy for eu relations with africa .
ministers agree that the neighboring continent needs more attention ; the goal is long-term development and economic partnership , if only as a means of staunching the flow of illegal refugees to europe .
the european union wants to enter a strategic partnership with all of africa 's approximately 50 states , in order to reach the eu millennium goals of fighting poverty by 2015 .
the foreign ministers are also very likely to vehemently reject the latest comments by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .

the row comes just before nuclear talks with tehran . recent remarks by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad about the veracity of the holocaust and that israel be relocated to europe prompted a harsh reaction from german vice chancellor franz müntefering on sunday . " whatever is said will one day be desired to be done , " the employment and social welfare minister said after a meeting in berlin with paul spiegel , president of the central council of jews in germany . müntefering was referring to the iranian president 's comments in which he called on germany and austria to host a state of israel on their soil if they felt responsible for murdering jews during world war ii .
ahmadinejad , who in october said israel should be " wiped off the map , " also described the jewish state as a " tumor . " " unacceptable " comments , says merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul spiegel , head of the central council of jews spiegel has described the comments as the worst anti-semitic attack by a statesman since adolf hitler and called on germany to sever diplomatic ties with iran . chancellor angela merkel described the remarks as " totally unacceptable " and the german government announced it would protest to the iranian ambassador . analysts say the comments were an attempt by ahmedinejad , an ex-member of the revolutionary guard , to woo iranian radicals in the regime who relish confrontation with the west . but tehran said it was surprised the international community had so vehemently condemned ahmedinejad 's remarks . " i 'm surprised by the reaction to these comments .
the president 's statements were clear : if the europeans have treated the jews badly , they have to compensate at their own expense , not at the expense of the region , " iran 's foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi told reporters . bad omen before nuclear talks the controversy over ahmadinejad 's verbal attacks against israel has cast a shadow over upcoming negotiations between the eu-3 , britain , france and germany , and tehran over iran 's nuclear fuel program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : photo of reported nuclear area in iran where uranium enrichment could be taking place iran has taken an increasingly hardline stance in its dialog with the international atomic energy agency and the european union over what it says is its right to produce nuclear energy for its electricity sector , but which the west fears could be secretly diverted to developing nuclear weapons . talks are intended to resume on december 21 in vienna after a four-month break .
asefi said on sunday that iran would stick to its demand to conduct nuclear fuel work despite fears that such activities could be diverted to make an atomic bomb . " this meeting will be very serious .
everything depends on this meeting , " asefi said of the planned discussions . nuclear energy " rights " at stake the iranian government has argued that as a signatory of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , it has the " right " to pursue fuel cycle work for peaceful intentions ; the eu-3 and the united states worry that the uranium enrichment process could be taken a step further and used for military purposes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is supplying fuel for iran 's bushehr nuclear power plant the eu-3 has proposed that iran 's enrichment work be carried out in russia , but tehran has rejected such a possibility .
asefi said the only chance for the negotiations was if the european side compromises - even though this appears out of the question . " if the europeans are rational and act according to npt and international agreements , there is nothing to worry about and the meeting will have a good result , " asefi told reporters .

the row comes just before nuclear talks with tehran . recent remarks by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad about the veracity of the holocaust and that israel be relocated to europe prompted a harsh reaction from german vice chancellor franz müntefering on sunday . " whatever is said will one day be desired to be done , " the employment and social welfare minister said after a meeting in berlin with paul spiegel , president of the central council of jews in germany . müntefering was referring to the iranian president 's comments in which he called on germany and austria to host a state of israel on their soil if they felt responsible for murdering jews during world war ii .
ahmadinejad , who in october said israel should be " wiped off the map , " also described the jewish state as a " tumor . " " unacceptable " comments , says merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul spiegel , head of the central council of jews spiegel has described the comments as the worst anti-semitic attack by a statesman since adolf hitler and called on germany to sever diplomatic ties with iran . chancellor angela merkel described the remarks as " totally unacceptable " and the german government announced it would protest to the iranian ambassador . analysts say the comments were an attempt by ahmedinejad , an ex-member of the revolutionary guard , to woo iranian radicals in the regime who relish confrontation with the west . but tehran said it was surprised the international community had so vehemently condemned ahmedinejad 's remarks . " i 'm surprised by the reaction to these comments .
the president 's statements were clear : if the europeans have treated the jews badly , they have to compensate at their own expense , not at the expense of the region , " iran 's foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi told reporters . bad omen before nuclear talks the controversy over ahmadinejad 's verbal attacks against israel has cast a shadow over upcoming negotiations between the eu-3 , britain , france and germany , and tehran over iran 's nuclear fuel program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : photo of reported nuclear area in iran where uranium enrichment could be taking place iran has taken an increasingly hardline stance in its dialog with the international atomic energy agency and the european union over what it says is its right to produce nuclear energy for its electricity sector , but which the west fears could be secretly diverted to developing nuclear weapons . talks are intended to resume on december 21 in vienna after a four-month break .
asefi said on sunday that iran would stick to its demand to conduct nuclear fuel work despite fears that such activities could be diverted to make an atomic bomb . " this meeting will be very serious .
everything depends on this meeting , " asefi said of the planned discussions . nuclear energy " rights " at stake the iranian government has argued that as a signatory of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , it has the " right " to pursue fuel cycle work for peaceful intentions ; the eu-3 and the united states worry that the uranium enrichment process could be taken a step further and used for military purposes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is supplying fuel for iran 's bushehr nuclear power plant the eu-3 has proposed that iran 's enrichment work be carried out in russia , but tehran has rejected such a possibility .
asefi said the only chance for the negotiations was if the european side compromises - even though this appears out of the question . " if the europeans are rational and act according to npt and international agreements , there is nothing to worry about and the meeting will have a good result , " asefi told reporters .
" it all depends on the european side and whether they enter the talks and give us our rights , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran 's remarks on israel widely denounced germany reacted to iran 's suggestion of relocating the " tumor " of israel to europe by rebuking the iranian ambassador in berlin ; other nations decried the comments .

us officials acknowledged to the german government in 2004 that the man had been mistaken for somebody else and had been wrongly detained . foreign minister steinmeier , who already held a ministerial post in the schröder government , has vehemently denied german involvement in the affair .
he is expected to inform the german parliament and the public about the case in great detail this coming wednesday . unpleasant questions the question that el masri himself and leading german opposition figures have been asking is whether government officials assisted the abduction and detention of el masri in any way in a bid to improve german-us relations which had turned sour over the us-led war in iraq .
but german ministers at the weekend again denied any involvement by berlin in the abduction masterminded by the cia .
german deputy-chancellor franz müntefering indicated that media reports about possible government involvement were groundless . " what we are being confronted with is mere speculation , " müntefering said . " if people knew what happened as they claim , calls for a parliamentary inquiry would seem even more foolish .
it 's party politics that are behind much of the criticism being voiced right now , with the aim of discrediting the new foreign minister .
i 'm calling on all sides concerned to exercise restraint and wait for the results of the forthcoming meetings in the parliamentary committees , " he said . not our fault bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier will address the parliament on wednesday german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier says there are no signs that any mistakes were made by government members and other german officials in the el masri case .
steinmeier has repeatedly rejected opposition calls for his resignation , maintaining that the actions of the government were based on the law . but steinmeier is certainly sensing a need to inform the public about what happened in 2003 .
the el masri case will be debated in detail in the foreign and interior parliamentary committees before the foreign minister answers questions in the bundestag on wednesday .
social democrat floor leader and former defense minister peter struck is confident the el masri affair will not bring the new german government to its knees . " there 's no doubt that the german government would have violated the law , had it assisted in the abduction of a german citizen , " stuck said . " but from what i know at present , government offices were not involved and i have no reason to believe that we 'll see a different picture emerging by the end of this week , " he said . a touchstone for the new government wolfgang bosbach , a leading christian democrat lawmaker , said that the el mari case was clearly becoming a touchstone for the new government .
he wants all the facts on the table this week to ensure that the affair does not linger on into 2006 . meanwhile , a german daily reported on sunday that el masri was already under observation by german intelligence when he was abducted by the cia .
a german security official told the newspaper that masri was not considered to be an active islamic extremist .

his name is hans riegel , and millions of children around the world get their first sugar rush chewing on his sticky candies . it is practically impossible to find a kid in this world that does n't have a sweet tooth .
it is this law of nature that made hans riegel , junior , one of the richest germans living today . his assets , like those of his brother paul , have been estimated to 1.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- haribo , the international sweets giant with an estimated annual turnover of 1.5 billion euros , holds a 60 % market share on licorice and fruit drops in germany , and is undisputed number one in europe .
in the eighties , it crossed the big pond and started expanding in the united states .
in the nineties , it discovered eastern europe .
the world of gummy bears knows no borders . hans riegel , senior , confectioner from bonn , founded the family business in 1920 and gave it the exotic sounding name haribo , which was , in fact , an acronym consisting of his initials and the city of bonn .
but it was really hans junior , who took over the family business after the second world war , that turned it into an international success story . tradition and change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the summer of 2005 , haribo organized a licorice-inspired fashion show it is a well-established part of the haribo corporate mythology that , at least in the first few years of developing their business , hans senior and his wife gertrud used to deliver their products on their own , by bicycle .
hans junior , who prepared himself for his later career by earning a doctorate from the university of bonn on the role of sugar in world trade , does n't have to play delivery boy anymore because haribo candies are now sold over the world .
but he does like to fly his own chopper to a business meeting . what has n't changed over the years is the soul of the family business : hans riegel sits at the top of the gummy bear pyramid and rules supreme in a somewhat antiquated managerial style .

he is known to have said that " without haribo , my life has no meaning . " tradition means everything to hans riegel .
the original haribo advertising slogan - " haribo macht kinder froh , " which literally means " haribo makes children happy " and , luckily enough , rhymes in german - was sold to riegel senior in the thirties by a traveling salesman .

they are my customers , i have to know what sweets they enjoy , what they think , what language they speak , " riegel said . since 1991 , haribo has been advertised in germany by thomas gottschalk , an aging entertainer who is also a household name in germany .
the riegel-gottschalk partnership is the said to be the most successful advertising campaign in german history , although younger german entertainers , like the popular stefan raab , enjoy making fun of gottschalk 's not very convincing attempts to use slang in haribo ads . the gummy bear dynasty is in no shortage of males called hans .

his name is hans riegel , and millions of children around the world get their first sugar rush chewing on his sticky candies . it is practically impossible to find a kid in this world that does n't have a sweet tooth .
it is this law of nature that made hans riegel , junior , one of the richest germans living today . his assets , like those of his brother paul , have been estimated to 1.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- haribo , the international sweets giant with an estimated annual turnover of 1.5 billion euros , holds a 60 % market share on licorice and fruit drops in germany , and is undisputed number one in europe .
in the eighties , it crossed the big pond and started expanding in the united states .
in the nineties , it discovered eastern europe .
the world of gummy bears knows no borders . hans riegel , senior , confectioner from bonn , founded the family business in 1920 and gave it the exotic sounding name haribo , which was , in fact , an acronym consisting of his initials and the city of bonn .

on the contrary , diplomats are still waiting on british prime minister tony blair 's promised suggestion .
this means eu foreign ministers , who were gathered monday to begin preparations for the summit that will take place on dec .
15 and 16 , have something of an empty agenda , with little to discuss .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's steinmeier wants to focus on the eu constitution german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has put pressure on the gathering to at least come up with a time frame for further " reflection " on the eu constitutional crisis .
the british presidency has simply disregarded the constitution topic , and " made a mess of it , " according to one eu worker , who spoke off the record .
in general , the british had to " be pushed to engage " with any important topics , an eu diplomat said .
a constitutional crisis ?
the ratification process for the constitution was put on ice by eu leaders in june following a rejection of the new treaty by french and dutch voters .
since the text of the constitution itself can not be changed and a second round of referenda on the same text is unlikely , the eu finds itself between a rock and a hard place . a solution must be found by next summer ; in autumn 2006 at the latest , the eu council - the heads of state who make up the union 's main decision-making body - must officially decide on the constitution 's future . eu expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigration from africa is a growing problem for the eu on the foreign-policy agendy , monday 's meeting is expected to recommend that macedonia - previously a part of yugoslavia - be allowed candidacy status for acceptance into the european union .
however , the council of ministers is expected to make it clear that concrete negotiations over eu entry are still far off , and that no specific date can be named . in a related topic , a number of member states have requested earnest debate over the future expansion plans of the current 25-member bloc , which many feel is admitting new members far too quickly .
what the union really needs is a consolidation phase , many diplomats say . fighting poverty in africa also on monday , foreign ministers are expected to adopt an overall strategy for eu relations with africa .
ministers agree that the neighboring continent needs more attention ; the goal is long-term development and economic partnership , if only as a means of staunching the flow of illegal refugees to europe .
the european union wants to enter a strategic partnership with all of africa 's approximately 50 states , in order to reach the eu millennium goals of fighting poverty by 2015 .
the foreign ministers are also very likely to vehemently reject the latest comments by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
last week , he questioned the veracity of the holocaust and suggested moving the state of israel to germany or austria .
there are no signs of progress when it comes to reanimating talks between the eu and iran over the latter 's atomic program . bernd riegert -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the eu budget stand-off : the areas of conflict as the six-month british presidency draws to a close , eu leaders embark on a critical week aimed at breaking the deadlock over the bloc 's budget .

" it lasted 45 seconds , " one said .
straw merely said london would put forward revised proposals during the week but added that london would not pay any price for an agreement . " we 're not in for a deal at any price , " straw told reporters , referring to the pressure britain has been under to relinquish more of its annual rebate to fund aid to new east european members in the budget . straw ’ s stance makes it look increasingly unlikely that that there would be any concessions on the long-term eu budget when the ministers of the 25-nation bloc convene on wednesday .

in an attempt to prevent another schism in the eu , european commission president jose manuel barroso had personally appealed to british prime minister tony blair for a rapid resolution , urging him to find a workable alternative to the existing proposals . barroso , pressing the point that britain bore a special responsibility to ensure that talks did not collapse as they did at the acrimonious constitution summit last june , also asked blair to raise overall eu spending and offer deeper and permanent cuts to britain ’ s controversial rebate . on evidence , barroso ’ s words have fallen on deaf ears and have instilled a sense of dread in the eu president ahead of the summit this week .
" as somebody put it , to fail once is unfortunate .
to fail twice would be careless , " barroso told reporters . the package britain put forward last week proposed a cut of 14 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.49 billion -rrb- or 8.5 percent in aid to poor ex-communist newcomers to the bloc and detailed a continued rise of britain ’ s own rebate over the next seven years .

these are difficult negotiations .
the margin for maneuver is narrow , " he said . britain thought it had the deal in the bag when it offered to forego 8 billion euros over seven years from its rebate , worth 5.6 billion euros this year , to meet what it called its fair share of the costs of the eu 's eastward enlargement last year . britain 's full share of the non-agricultural costs of enlargement would in fact be 18 billion euros , according to european union financial experts .

french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy insisted that the reduction should be a " permanent legal commitment .

" it lasted 45 seconds , " one said .
straw merely said london would put forward revised proposals during the week but added that london would not pay any price for an agreement . " we 're not in for a deal at any price , " straw told reporters , referring to the pressure britain has been under to relinquish more of its annual rebate to fund aid to new east european members in the budget . straw ’ s stance makes it look increasingly unlikely that that there would be any concessions on the long-term eu budget when the ministers of the 25-nation bloc convene on wednesday .
when pressed on whether there was a chance of an accord being agreed upon on thursday and friday , straw told reporters : " i ca n't say . " it was a further slap in the face for eu officials who are keen to avoid a damaging split over the budget akin to the crisis resulting from the bloc ’ s failure to ratify its own constitution . barroso appeals to blair but to little avail bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actions not words suggest that tony blair has ignored jose barroso 's appeals .
in an attempt to prevent another schism in the eu , european commission president jose manuel barroso had personally appealed to british prime minister tony blair for a rapid resolution , urging him to find a workable alternative to the existing proposals . barroso , pressing the point that britain bore a special responsibility to ensure that talks did not collapse as they did at the acrimonious constitution summit last june , also asked blair to raise overall eu spending and offer deeper and permanent cuts to britain ’ s controversial rebate . on evidence , barroso ’ s words have fallen on deaf ears and have instilled a sense of dread in the eu president ahead of the summit this week .
" as somebody put it , to fail once is unfortunate .
to fail twice would be careless , " barroso told reporters . the package britain put forward last week proposed a cut of 14 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.49 billion -rrb- or 8.5 percent in aid to poor ex-communist newcomers to the bloc and detailed a continued rise of britain ’ s own rebate over the next seven years .
it was almost unanimously rejected . newest eu members facing huge bill if talks fail bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the talks fail , come 2007 the new states will have pay up .
barroso highlighted the need to support the newest eu members when he spoke on monday .
" new member states must be offered a fairer deal .
i believe they need to be offered significantly higher levels of investment than in the current proposal . "
failure to reach a deal will immediately cost the new states cash in 2007 .
despite the ominous signs , barroso added that the " urgent , necessary " budget deal was " within reach . " not according to jack straw it isn ’ t .
the foreign secretary maintained that those members expecting big changes to the proposals would be disappointed , hinting at a set of plans not too different that were thrown out last week . " we are thinking about revisions to those proposals , and those revisions , if indeed there are any , will be made available in the course of this week .
these are difficult negotiations .
the margin for maneuver is narrow , " he said . britain thought it had the deal in the bag when it offered to forego 8 billion euros over seven years from its rebate , worth 5.6 billion euros this year , to meet what it called its fair share of the costs of the eu 's eastward enlargement last year . britain 's full share of the non-agricultural costs of enlargement would in fact be 18 billion euros , according to european union financial experts .
france put the figure at 14 billion . france wants rebate cut in return for cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french foreign minister philippe douste- blazy wants a massive cut in britain 's rebate .
the french weighed in with particular relish in the row over the british rebate , saying that it should be cut to 35-36 billion euros over the period instead of the 50 billion it would reach without reform .
french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy insisted that the reduction should be a " permanent legal commitment . " as an incentive , douste-blazy said that paris would allow a future review of the entire budget as long as the 2007-13 package , which has provisions included for the protection of french agriculture , remained guaranteed . officials close to the british contingent said that there was a fair chance that the new proposals , due on wednesday , would include a slight increase in the amount but by nothing like the amounts suggested by brussels or paris .

his name is hans riegel , and millions of children around the world get their first sugar rush chewing on his sticky candies . it is practically impossible to find a kid in this world that does n't have a sweet tooth .
it is this law of nature that made hans riegel , junior , one of the richest germans living today . his assets , like those of his brother paul , have been estimated to 1.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- haribo , the international sweets giant with an estimated annual turnover of 1.5 billion euros , holds a 60 % market share on licorice and fruit drops in germany , and is undisputed number one in europe .
in the eighties , it crossed the big pond and started expanding in the united states .
in the nineties , it discovered eastern europe .
the world of gummy bears knows no borders . hans riegel , senior , confectioner from bonn , founded the family business in 1920 and gave it the exotic sounding name haribo , which was , in fact , an acronym consisting of his initials and the city of bonn .
but it was really hans junior , who took over the family business after the second world war , that turned it into an international success story . tradition and change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the summer of 2005 , haribo organized a licorice-inspired fashion show it is a well-established part of the haribo corporate mythology that , at least in the first few years of developing their business , hans senior and his wife gertrud used to deliver their products on their own , by bicycle .
hans junior , who prepared himself for his later career by earning a doctorate from the university of bonn on the role of sugar in world trade , does n't have to play delivery boy anymore because haribo candies are now sold over the world .
but he does like to fly his own chopper to a business meeting . what has n't changed over the years is the soul of the family business : hans riegel sits at the top of the gummy bear pyramid and rules supreme in a somewhat antiquated managerial style .
as a patriarchic figurehead who believes more in trust and authority than focus groups and marketing departments , this active octogenarian has single-handedly turned his father 's business into a major player on the world market .
he is known to have said that " without haribo , my life has no meaning . " tradition means everything to hans riegel .
the original haribo advertising slogan - " haribo macht kinder froh , " which literally means " haribo makes children happy " and , luckily enough , rhymes in german - was sold to riegel senior in the thirties by a traveling salesman .
the slogan was updated only once , in the sixties , to welcome the paying adults into the fairy world of gum drops : " kids and grown-ups love it so , the happy world of haribo . " techno grandpa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions of gummy bear leave the haribo factories on a daily basis in 1994 , riegel was awarded the order of the federal republic of germany , 1st class , -lrb- bundesverdienstkreuz -rrb- for his services to society .
he is a a self-proclaimed fan of techno music , who likes to follow latest trends “ i love kids and i enjoy watching them .
they are my customers , i have to know what sweets they enjoy , what they think , what language they speak , " riegel said . since 1991 , haribo has been advertised in germany by thomas gottschalk , an aging entertainer who is also a household name in germany .
the riegel-gottschalk partnership is the said to be the most successful advertising campaign in german history , although younger german entertainers , like the popular stefan raab , enjoy making fun of gottschalk 's not very convincing attempts to use slang in haribo ads . the gummy bear dynasty is in no shortage of males called hans .
hans junior inherited the family business from his father , hans senior , and he is likely to leave the throne to his nephew hans-jürgen , who is currently running a haribo factory in france .

but the ex-chancellor has no intention of putting his feet up . less than three weeks after leaving office , former german chancellor gerhard schröder has reinvented himself as an international businessman with concerns in russia and switzerland . schröder wasted no time in making a clean break with politics after he handed the reins of power to angela merkel on november 22 .
but his decision to delve into the world of international business has not been without a political fallout . on friday , the chairman of russian energy giant gazprom , alexei miller , announced that schröder would head the shareholders ' committee of the consortium building a controversial gas pipeline under the baltic sea from russia to germany . the announcement came just after the ceremonial launch of construction of the north european gas pipeline , in which gazprom owns a 51-percent stake and germany 's e.on and basf own 24.5-percent stakes . the appointment of schröder , who helped secure the deal for the four-billion-euro -lrb- $ 4.7-billion -rrb- pipeline earlier this year while he was still chancellor , has already sparked questions of potential conflict of interest and debate about the need for regulations for retired politicians moving into business . while newspaper commentators generally agreed the pipeline project was useful , they said schröder 's move raised fresh questions about the links between big business and politics and the cosy relations with putin when in office . questionable occupation " it stinks , " greens co-leader richard bütikofer , whose party was in power with schröder 's social democrats when the pipeline deal was struck , told tagesspiegel newspaper . " the problem is that he pursued a policy for the federal republic which he will now draw private benefit from , " argued dirk niebel of the opposition free democrats . there had long been speculation that schröder , 61 , was planning to trade in politics for the business world and more specifically that he would take on a high-level post in russia 's energy sector . close relationship with putin pays off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political counterparts and personal friends : putin and schröder .
during his seven years in office , schröder built up a close personal relationship with russian president vladimir putin , whom he often visited privately . in germany , many criticized schröder 's friendship with the russian leader , particularly his silence on moscow 's policies in the caucuses and its hard line in the yukos oil saga . the news that schröder will be sitting on the board of the gas pipeline casts a new " smudgy light " on the former government 's cool relations with poland and the baltic states , who were left out of the pipeline project , the berlin tagesspiegel wrote on saturday .
however , the german chairman of corruption watchdog transparency international said there was no reason for alarm . " a supervisory board post is in our view certainly something that a former prominent politician can take up , " hansjoerg elshorst told tagesspiegel . " one can only talk of abuse if schröder receives excessive reward , " he said . media chancellor turns media consultant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder was equally at home in front of the camera as he was the lecturn .
far less critical was schröder 's decision to dabble in media .
the man often called the media chancellor for his skill in playing to the cameras has accepted a job as an advisor to leading swiss media group , ringier . the group publishes the blick tabloid , switzerland 's top-selling newspaper , and also has interests in eastern europe , china and vietnam . the post at zurich-based ringier came as something of a surprise as schröder had told the german press he intended to return to his first profession of practicing law . english lessons to broaden future horizons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " what did tony say ? "
perhaps to smooth his way in the business world , the former chancellor has started brushing up on his english , which he has always freely admitted to be poor .
according to german press reports , he has recently been improving his english skills in the small town of montgomery on the border of england and wales . they said schröder was taking private courses aimed at " business and professional people " at park house school , situated in an 18th century country house in montgomery , and had been seen enjoying a few glasses of wine at the local pub , the dragon hotel , in his free time . the social-democrat has never made a secret of enjoying the good life and is an ardent soccer fan , something which has now also found a mention on his curriculum vitae . soccer fanaticism honored by dfb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nasty tracksuit , good technique : schröder on the ball .
the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- on friday made him an honorary member for his support for germany 's successful bid to host the 2006 world cup and for the organization of the tournament , which will be played in 12 german cities from june 9 to july 9 next year . in the meanwhile , schröder is also writing his political memoirs , which he hopes to publish next autumn . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder ponders life after chancellery now that germany has a new leader , there is much speculation about the future of outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder .

dw-world looks at the major areas of conflict . with the clock ticking down to the final days before the next budget needs to be signed and sealed , the european union is locked in a major dispute over who pays how much into the eu pot - and , just as important , who receives what over the seven years from 2007-2013 . key sticking points are britain 's refusal to give ground on its budget rebate , and french resistance to surrendering support for eu farmers , which swallows about 40 percent of spending . but the stakes are also high for the eu 's newer member states , desperate to get hold of eu aid for infrastructure such as motorway and train links , left lagging behind western europe by decades of communism . more broadly , failure to agree on a budget would leave the eu scuffling over its budget on a year-by-year basis , threatening regular deadlock in a bloc already hobbled by the rejection of its constitution this year . britain , which holds the eu 's presidency , is set to make modified proposals after talks among foreign ministers monday , as preparation for a summit of the bloc 's leaders starting on thursday . london is still hopeful a deal can be struck . here are some basic facts about the eu budget : global spending the six main contributors to the budget - austria , britain , france , germany , the netherlands and sweden - want spending limited to about 1.0 percent of eu gross national income , or 815 billion euros -lrb- 954 billion dollars -rrb- . but the european commission wants a robust budget to pay for ambitious programs sought by member states and has called for payments of 943 billion euros -lrb- 1.14 percent of gni -rrb- over the 2007-2013 period , while the parliament suggests 883 billion euros would be enough . luxembourg , which tried to negotiate a budget deal in june when it held the eu 's presidency , offered a compromise of 875 billion euros but it was rejected by britain , finland , the netherlands , spain and sweden . london argued last week that the budget should be smaller and proposed an estimated 846.8 billion euros , an offer which has largely been rejected . net contributors the member states often concentrate on how much they pay into the budget and how little they get back - their net outlay .
in 2001 , an average german citizen " paid " 114 euros a year to the budget while the average spaniard " received " 180 euros . the three biggest net contributors , germany , the netherlands and sweden would like to see their burden reduced . farm aid : the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- under a franco-german initiative , farm spending was set in 2002 at a summit aimed at preparing for eu enlargement .
cap spending will stabilize from 2006 at around 45.5 billion euros annually , plus around one percent each year . france , the system 's major beneficiary as the union 's biggest agricultural producer , has so far refused to renegotiate the agreement , which is hotly contested by britain . britain 's rebate the british rebate , a jealously-guarded mechanism for reducing its financial burden because it profits little from subsidies , averaged 4.6 billion euros -lrb- 5.4 billion dollars , 3.1 billion pounds -rrb- annually between 1997 and 2003 . by last year , the rebate , which grows in proportion to eu spending , had reached 5.3 billion euros and is projected to average 7.1 billion euros annually for the 2007-2013 budget period . regional aid the 10 members who joined in may 2004 are waiting impatiently for eu regional funding , but until now it has been greece , ireland , italy , portugal and spain which have benefited most . despite fierce opposition , britain has proposed a cut in such aid to new member states on the grounds that newcomers are rarely able to absorb all of the eu money put in front of them . research and transport : eu 's future ? to help improve the eu 's competitiveness , the commission has proposed trebling the budgets for research and trans-european transport links .
britain has argued that the budget needs to be focused on more future-oriented programs such as research and education and less on agriculture . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de criticism prompts britain to promise new proposals eu leaders are trying to break a deadlock over the budget before a summit next week .

his name is hans riegel , and millions of children around the world get their first sugar rush chewing on his sticky candies . it is practically impossible to find a kid in this world that does n't have a sweet tooth .
it is this law of nature that made hans riegel , junior , one of the richest germans living today . his assets , like those of his brother paul , have been estimated to 1.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- haribo , the international sweets giant with an estimated annual turnover of 1.5 billion euros , holds a 60 % market share on licorice and fruit drops in germany , and is undisputed number one in europe .
in the eighties , it crossed the big pond and started expanding in the united states .
in the nineties , it discovered eastern europe .
the world of gummy bears knows no borders . hans riegel , senior , confectioner from bonn , founded the family business in 1920 and gave it the exotic sounding name haribo , which was , in fact , an acronym consisting of his initials and the city of bonn .
but it was really hans junior , who took over the family business after the second world war , that turned it into an international success story . tradition and change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the summer of 2005 , haribo organized a licorice-inspired fashion show it is a well-established part of the haribo corporate mythology that , at least in the first few years of developing their business , hans senior and his wife gertrud used to deliver their products on their own , by bicycle .
hans junior , who prepared himself for his later career by earning a doctorate from the university of bonn on the role of sugar in world trade , does n't have to play delivery boy anymore because haribo candies are now sold over the world .
but he does like to fly his own chopper to a business meeting . what has n't changed over the years is the soul of the family business : hans riegel sits at the top of the gummy bear pyramid and rules supreme in a somewhat antiquated managerial style .
as a patriarchic figurehead who believes more in trust and authority than focus groups and marketing departments , this active octogenarian has single-handedly turned his father 's business into a major player on the world market .
he is known to have said that " without haribo , my life has no meaning . " tradition means everything to hans riegel .
the original haribo advertising slogan - " haribo macht kinder froh , " which literally means " haribo makes children happy " and , luckily enough , rhymes in german - was sold to riegel senior in the thirties by a traveling salesman .
the slogan was updated only once , in the sixties , to welcome the paying adults into the fairy world of gum drops : " kids and grown-ups love it so , the happy world of haribo .

they are my customers , i have to know what sweets they enjoy , what they think , what language they speak , " riegel said . since 1991 , haribo has been advertised in germany by thomas gottschalk , an aging entertainer who is also a household name in germany .
the riegel-gottschalk partnership is the said to be the most successful advertising campaign in german history , although younger german entertainers , like the popular stefan raab , enjoy making fun of gottschalk 's not very convincing attempts to use slang in haribo ads . the gummy bear dynasty is in no shortage of males called hans .

250,000 seats will be made available starting on monday in the fourth sales period . the organizing committee for the 2006 world cup in germany expects demand to soar when the fourth sales period of 250,000 tickets begins on monday at 12:00 noon cet -lrb- 1100 gmt -rrb- .
following friday 's draw fans of the 32 competing nations now know where and when their teams are playing and a mad ticket rush is anticipated . " we can sense the interest from participating teams and from neighboring countries increasing enormously , " said horst r. schmidt , vice-president of the organizing committee . tickets from world and national associations fans from abroad , if they did n't try to order tickets blindly in one of the first three phases , have two paths to choose from when ordering this time . they can turn to their national teams .
the 32 countries ' individual associations all received an allocation of eight percent of the tickets for the group phase matches they are playing in .
in addition , there are " conditional tickets " that can be ordered .
these are the knockout stage matches and will be filled if your country advances to that stage . the national associations dictate the sales process in their country . the world soccer body fifa , which has alone sold tickets so far , also has more on sale .
the opening match between germany and costa rica is already sold out and there is only a limited supply for the most in-demand matches , such as the finals and semifinals . the deadline for this phase is january 15 , 2006 and the lottery will be held on january 31 .
any unsold tickets then will be offered on a first come , first served basis starting february 15 . first phases massively oversubscribed the possibility that at that point , there are any more tickets remaining in the hands of fifa or the 32 national associations must be close to nil .
when the first sales window started earlier this year , there were over eight million orders for 812,000 tickets .
up to now , 80 percent of the tickets available have been snapped up by europeans according to the world cup committee . " we assume the demand will far outstrip the contingent this time again .
there is n't a fairer method to distribute the tickets than through a lottery , " said schmidt . naturally , many tickets will be returned over the course of the next six months , for which a last minute window will be opened starting on may 1 and running to the end of the tournament on july 9 . ticket prices range from 35 euros -lrb- $ 41 -rrb- for the cheapest seats at group games -lrb- excluding the opening match -rrb- to 600 euros -lrb- $ 706 -rrb- for the best seats at the final in berlin . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de favorites wary of first round foes while the tunisia-saudi arabia game probably wo n't have many local ticket holders in munich gasping in delight , the opening round of the 2006 world cup will have a number of lively match ups .

dw-world looks at the major areas of conflict . with the clock ticking down to the final days before the next budget needs to be signed and sealed , the european union is locked in a major dispute over who pays how much into the eu pot - and , just as important , who receives what over the seven years from 2007-2013 . key sticking points are britain 's refusal to give ground on its budget rebate , and french resistance to surrendering support for eu farmers , which swallows about 40 percent of spending . but the stakes are also high for the eu 's newer member states , desperate to get hold of eu aid for infrastructure such as motorway and train links , left lagging behind western europe by decades of communism . more broadly , failure to agree on a budget would leave the eu scuffling over its budget on a year-by-year basis , threatening regular deadlock in a bloc already hobbled by the rejection of its constitution this year . britain , which holds the eu 's presidency , is set to make modified proposals after talks among foreign ministers monday , as preparation for a summit of the bloc 's leaders starting on thursday . london is still hopeful a deal can be struck . here are some basic facts about the eu budget : global spending the six main contributors to the budget - austria , britain , france , germany , the netherlands and sweden - want spending limited to about 1.0 percent of eu gross national income , or 815 billion euros -lrb- 954 billion dollars -rrb- . but the european commission wants a robust budget to pay for ambitious programs sought by member states and has called for payments of 943 billion euros -lrb- 1.14 percent of gni -rrb- over the 2007-2013 period , while the parliament suggests 883 billion euros would be enough . luxembourg , which tried to negotiate a budget deal in june when it held the eu 's presidency , offered a compromise of 875 billion euros but it was rejected by britain , finland , the netherlands , spain and sweden . london argued last week that the budget should be smaller and proposed an estimated 846.8 billion euros , an offer which has largely been rejected . net contributors the member states often concentrate on how much they pay into the budget and how little they get back - their net outlay .

but the ex-chancellor has no intention of putting his feet up . less than three weeks after leaving office , former german chancellor gerhard schröder has reinvented himself as an international businessman with concerns in russia and switzerland . schröder wasted no time in making a clean break with politics after he handed the reins of power to angela merkel on november 22 .
but his decision to delve into the world of international business has not been without a political fallout . on friday , the chairman of russian energy giant gazprom , alexei miller , announced that schröder would head the shareholders ' committee of the consortium building a controversial gas pipeline under the baltic sea from russia to germany . the announcement came just after the ceremonial launch of construction of the north european gas pipeline , in which gazprom owns a 51-percent stake and germany 's e.on and basf own 24.5-percent stakes . the appointment of schröder , who helped secure the deal for the four-billion-euro -lrb- $ 4.7-billion -rrb- pipeline earlier this year while he was still chancellor , has already sparked questions of potential conflict of interest and debate about the need for regulations for retired politicians moving into business . while newspaper commentators generally agreed the pipeline project was useful , they said schröder 's move raised fresh questions about the links between big business and politics and the cosy relations with putin when in office . questionable occupation " it stinks , " greens co-leader richard bütikofer , whose party was in power with schröder 's social democrats when the pipeline deal was struck , told tagesspiegel newspaper . " the problem is that he pursued a policy for the federal republic which he will now draw private benefit from , " argued dirk niebel of the opposition free democrats . there had long been speculation that schröder , 61 , was planning to trade in politics for the business world and more specifically that he would take on a high-level post in russia 's energy sector . close relationship with putin pays off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : political counterparts and personal friends : putin and schröder .
during his seven years in office , schröder built up a close personal relationship with russian president vladimir putin , whom he often visited privately . in germany , many criticized schröder 's friendship with the russian leader , particularly his silence on moscow 's policies in the caucuses and its hard line in the yukos oil saga . the news that schröder will be sitting on the board of the gas pipeline casts a new " smudgy light " on the former government 's cool relations with poland and the baltic states , who were left out of the pipeline project , the berlin tagesspiegel wrote on saturday .
however , the german chairman of corruption watchdog transparency international said there was no reason for alarm . " a supervisory board post is in our view certainly something that a former prominent politician can take up , " hansjoerg elshorst told tagesspiegel . " one can only talk of abuse if schröder receives excessive reward , " he said . media chancellor turns media consultant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder was equally at home in front of the camera as he was the lecturn .
far less critical was schröder 's decision to dabble in media .
the man often called the media chancellor for his skill in playing to the cameras has accepted a job as an advisor to leading swiss media group , ringier . the group publishes the blick tabloid , switzerland 's top-selling newspaper , and also has interests in eastern europe , china and vietnam . the post at zurich-based ringier came as something of a surprise as schröder had told the german press he intended to return to his first profession of practicing law . english lessons to broaden future horizons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " what did tony say ?

on the contrary , diplomats are still waiting on british prime minister tony blair 's promised suggestion .
this means eu foreign ministers , who were gathered monday to begin preparations for the summit that will take place on dec .
15 and 16 , have something of an empty agenda , with little to discuss .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's steinmeier wants to focus on the eu constitution german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has put pressure on the gathering to at least come up with a time frame for further " reflection " on the eu constitutional crisis .
the british presidency has simply disregarded the constitution topic , and " made a mess of it , " according to one eu worker , who spoke off the record .
in general , the british had to " be pushed to engage " with any important topics , an eu diplomat said .
a constitutional crisis ?
the ratification process for the constitution was put on ice by eu leaders in june following a rejection of the new treaty by french and dutch voters .
since the text of the constitution itself can not be changed and a second round of referenda on the same text is unlikely , the eu finds itself between a rock and a hard place . a solution must be found by next summer ; in autumn 2006 at the latest , the eu council - the heads of state who make up the union 's main decision-making body - must officially decide on the constitution 's future . eu expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigration from africa is a growing problem for the eu on the foreign-policy agendy , monday 's meeting is expected to recommend that macedonia - previously a part of yugoslavia - be allowed candidacy status for acceptance into the european union .
however , the council of ministers is expected to make it clear that concrete negotiations over eu entry are still far off , and that no specific date can be named . in a related topic , a number of member states have requested earnest debate over the future expansion plans of the current 25-member bloc , which many feel is admitting new members far too quickly .
what the union really needs is a consolidation phase , many diplomats say . fighting poverty in africa also on monday , foreign ministers are expected to adopt an overall strategy for eu relations with africa .
ministers agree that the neighboring continent needs more attention ; the goal is long-term development and economic partnership , if only as a means of staunching the flow of illegal refugees to europe .
the european union wants to enter a strategic partnership with all of africa 's approximately 50 states , in order to reach the eu millennium goals of fighting poverty by 2015 .
the foreign ministers are also very likely to vehemently reject the latest comments by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
last week , he questioned the veracity of the holocaust and suggested moving the state of israel to germany or austria .

the engineers who repair household boilers are holding a 24-hour strike , with further ones planned for 19 and 21 december , and 6 and 9 january .
a total of 6,000 workers , members of the gmb union , are taking part .
at the weekend british gas management said they were " disappointed and frustrated " after a breakdown in talks .
pension package the company said it had contingency plans to prioritise the needs of vulnerable people who might need urgent help .
gmb national secretary brian strutton said members had " fully co-operated " to ensure the contingency plans would work .
the union said it had asked the company , which trades as scottish gas in scotland , to suspend closing the pension scheme to new entrants for a year while the scheme was re-evaluated .

attacking people " on the basis of their race , their appearance -lsb- and -rsb- their ethnicity " was unacceptable , he said .
thousands of young white men attacked people of arabic and mediterranean background on cronulla beach on sunday .
the fighting injured more than 30 people , including police officers , and at least 16 people were arrested .
the clashes follow an assault on two lifeguards last week , reportedly by youths of middle eastern origin .
mobile phone text messages began circulating after the incident , encouraging people to retaliate .
in pictures : violence at the beach their revenge began on sunday afternoon , when thousands of white youths converged on cronulla beach .
chanting " no more lebs -lsb- lebanese -rsb- " and " aussie , aussie , aussie ...
oi , oi , oi , " mobs of drunken young men attacked anyone who looked like they might have come from the middle east .
one muslim woman had her headscarf ripped off , local media reported .
the violence then spread to other parts of sydney , with retaliatory attacks by groups of youths of middle east appearance , who stabbed one man and damaged dozens of cars .
police have set up a special unit to track down those responsible .
new south wales police minister carl scully said the trouble had been caused by a group of neo-nazis and white supremacists , who had stirred up the drunken crowd .
" those sort of characters are best placed in berlin 1930s , not in cronulla 2005 , " mr scully told reporters .
' sickening ' " mob violence is always sickening and always to be unconditionally condemned , " mr howard told reporters on monday .
but he insisted that the weekend 's violence did not signal a deeper problem within australian society .
" i do not accept that there is underlying racism in this country , " he said .
" this nation of ours has been able to absorb millions of people from different parts of the world over a period of some 40 years and we have done so with remarkable success . "
mr howard also denied that government warnings of home-grown islamic militants had fuelled the riots .
" it is impossible to know how individuals react , but everything this government 's said about home-grown terrorism has been totally justified , " he said .
the australian government has repeatedly warned about the risk of terrorism on australian soil .
so far there has not been a major attack directly on the country , but australians have been targets for militant attacks overseas in recent years , and last month 18 muslim men were arrested in sydney and melbourne on terrorist charges .

one muslim woman had her headscarf ripped off , local media reported .
the violence then spread to other parts of sydney , with retaliatory attacks by groups of youths of middle east appearance , who stabbed one man and damaged dozens of cars .
police have set up a special unit to track down those responsible .
new south wales police minister carl scully said the trouble had been caused by a group of neo-nazis and white supremacists , who had stirred up the drunken crowd .
" those sort of characters are best placed in berlin 1930s , not in cronulla 2005 , " mr scully told reporters .
' sickening ' " mob violence is always sickening and always to be unconditionally condemned , " mr howard told reporters on monday .
but he insisted that the weekend 's violence did not signal a deeper problem within australian society .
" i do not accept that there is underlying racism in this country , " he said .
" this nation of ours has been able to absorb millions of people from different parts of the world over a period of some 40 years and we have done so with remarkable success . "
mr howard also denied that government warnings of home-grown islamic militants had fuelled the riots .
" it is impossible to know how individuals react , but everything this government 's said about home-grown terrorism has been totally justified , " he said .
the australian government has repeatedly warned about the risk of terrorism on australian soil .
so far there has not been a major attack directly on the country , but australians have been targets for militant attacks overseas in recent years , and last month 18 muslim men were arrested in sydney and melbourne on terrorist charges .

conservationists are warning that enterprising sellers , keen to make festive pocket money , could be wiping out the plant in some areas .
mistletoe was once widespread throughout most of wales , but is particularly scarce this year .
gemma bode , conservation manager with gwent wildlife trust , said greedy sellers were taking too much .
if people have mistletoe on trees they should obviously not take the whole plant gemma bode , gwent wildlife trust areas like monmouthshire , torfaen , and newport - which are covered by the trust - used to be excellent areas to find the seasonal parasitic plant , which particularly likes living on old apple trees .
however , mistletoe is being taken in large quantities from orchards , hedgerows and ancient trees , and sold at markets .
part of the problem is that too much is being torn off , leaving little left on the host tree to produce future plants .
" there are cases of mistletoe rustling , and once the whole plant has been removed from its host tree it wo n't grow back again because of its quite complex life cycle , " ms bode said .
" we are not sure how much mistletoe is affected by its annual cut , but if people have mistletoe on trees they should obviously not take the whole plant - just little cuttings .
" we want people to appreciate how mistletoe got on to the tree and the fact that it is becoming less common now . "
felling trees another threat to mistletoe is the loss of its favourite habitat - old orchards .
" apple trees are the plant 's favourite hosts and we have lost a lot of old orchards either due to individual landowners clearing them , seeing no value to them anymore , or to make way for new houses and roads , " ms bode added .
mistletoe grows as a parasite on the soft bark of certain trees , but particularly favours apple .
mistletoe can be propagated but the success rate is low , meaning the industry relies heavily on supplies from the wild .
good crops of mistletoe can still be found in parts of monmouthshire .
gwent wildlife trust is urging land-owners and farmers to work with the ecologists employed by their local councils to help protect mistletoe from the threats it faces - and help wildlife at the same time .

the plesiosaur , which means " near reptile " , has a prominent small head on a long neck and a round body .
the fossil is the first skeleton of the reptile to be sold on the open market .
unearthed in lyme regis , dorset , about 20 years ago , the creature is thought to be " the most popular explanation for the mythical loch ness monster " .
the first well-preserved fish-eating plesiosaur fossil was discovered in the county in 1824 , by fossil collector mary anning .
snapping jaws the creatures , which would have been 5-6m in length and about a tonne in weight , thrust themselves through the water with four flippers and steered with their tail .
they had sharp teeth and snapping jaws , which set a deadly trap for small aquatic animals .
plesiosaurs were thought to have caught their prey by lashing out with their long necks and then snatching at victims with sharp teeth .
they were thought to be hunters of fish , squid and other free-swimming prey ; but recent research has also indicated they would feed on bottom-dwelling animals such as clams and snails , too .
