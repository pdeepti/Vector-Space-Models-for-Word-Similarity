program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 22.02.2005 tough talking behind the smiles großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " do n't squeeze so hard ... " : bush and barroso president george w. bush continued his hectic schedule in brussels on tuesday when he met with european union officials to tackle a number of thorny issues . a special summit between the united states and the european union was taking place in brussels throughout tuesday with us president george w. bush in attendance and several unpalatable issues on the menu . the summit with the 25-nation eu began after morning talks with the leaders of the north atlantic treaty organisation -lrb- nato -rrb- , with bush aiming to revive transatlantic ties which nosedived over the conflict in iraq . the discussions were due to continue into the evening with president bush dining with european commission president jose barroso and the eu foreign affairs chief , javier solana . welcomed by luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , bush said he was " very happy " to be meeting with his 25 counterparts , most of whom also attended the nato talks . the us president faced several thorny topics in his discussions with the eu including the middle east peace process and the on-going negotiations with iran .
while europe favors discussions , the us is skeptical that talking will get results . bush : attack on iran " ridiculous " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all options are on the table , said bush .
however , bush said that reports that the united states was preparing to attack iran was " ridiculous , " but reiterated that no options could be ruled out . " this notion that the united states is getting ready to attack iran is simply ridiculous , " he told reporters at the evening press conference during the summit .
" having said that , all options are on the table . " bush then voiced support for an ongoing attempt by british , french and german diplomats to get tehran to renounce its feared pursuit of nuclear weapons in return for trade and economic incentives . " you know , we 've talked about iran , " said bush , referring to his two days of discussions in brussels .
" that 's a place where i 'm getting good advice from european partners .
" after all , great britain , germany and france are negotiating with the ayatollahs with a common objective , something we all want , and that is for them not to have a nuclear weapon , " he said .
" it 's in our interests for them not to have a nuclear weapon .
" it 's also in our interest for them not to continue to fund terrorist organizations like hezbollah , which has the desire to stop the middle east peace process from going forward , " bush continued .
iraq conference announced bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg 's jean-claude juncker .
it was also announced that the eu and the us had agreed to co-host an international conference on iraq 's reconstruction .
juncker told reporters the conference would be organized if the incoming iraqi government agrees to it .
" should the new iraqi government request it , the united states and the european union are prepared to co-host an international conference to provide a forum to encourage and coordinate international support for iraq , " he said . barroso said the eu 's executive branch " is , and will remain , committed to a stable and democratic " iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose manuel barroso .
" we continue to offer substantial political and financial support to the process of democratic transition , and we hope that if the new iraqi government makes concrete proposals for joint action we will be ready to assist , " the eu commission president said . china embargo plan creates waves the positive noises coming from the talks were overshadowed to a point by eu plans to lift a 16-year european arms embargo on china after bush reiterated washington 's deep concern at the project . " this is a question which is being examined , " juncker told journalists .
" we still have n't reached a final result . " juncker added that for him bush 's visit represented the " start of a new relationship " between europe and the united states . " we have had lots of differences in the past , but it is clear that differences of opinion can not divide us , " he said . leaders welcome talks so far bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder with nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer .
german chancellor gerhard schröder hailed the earlier talks with nato saying they were " good discussions . " they were very focused on the issues , " said schröder , who caused a stir before bush arrived in europe by suggesting nato was in need of reform , implying that the eu may be a better defense partner .
" we concerned ourselves with the real problems facing us , especially in the middle east but also in afghanistan . " italian prime minister silvio berlusconi also welcomed tuesday 's landmark meetings and stressed the need to speed up training in iraq " to be able to leave the country in conditions able to ensure its security .

" the nato training mission is an important mission , " said bush . " every life is precious and we are thankful for the efforts , " being made by nato to help restore democracy in iraq , bush told a press conference at the military alliance 's headquarters , adding he was sincerely grateful . " nato is providing a training mission which is vital ... every country should be proud of the fact that they are contributing to the world 's newest democracy , " bush said at the press conference with nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer . bush asks europe and the us to move on bush acknowledged the divisions caused by the us-led march 2003 invasion of iraq to topple leader saddam hussein but said : " the key now is to put that behind us and to focus on helping the new democracy to succeed .
it 's in our interest , it 's in your countries ' interest , to let democracy take hold in iraq . " while nato officials trumpeted the agreement of all 26 allies to make some contribution to the iraq training mission as a token of the alliance 's rediscovered unity , the unanimous agreement hid discrepancies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we have the 26 .
as far as we are concerned , that is everyone working in the same direction , " a nato official told reporters .
but in reality it was unity in name only . the united states agreed to provide around 60 trainers out of a total close to 160 while france , the most vocal european critic of the us-led invasion in iraq , agreed for just one of its officers at nato headquarters to help coordinate offers of equipment to the iraqi military . the french , along with the germans and belgians , also reiterated their decisions not to send their personnel to serve inside iraq . chirac endorses schröder 's plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac also reminded president bush that conciliatory language would not mend all the broken fences between them by endorsing a call by german chancellor gerhard schröder for a reform of nato , initially rebuffed by washington , to take into account new realities such as the rise of an enlarged and increasingly integrated eu . " europe and the united states are real partners , " chirac told the nato leaders .
" so we need dialogue and to listen to each other more . " " we must also , as the german chancellor has underlined , continue to take account of the changes that have occurred on the european continent , " chirac said , referring explicitly to europe 's growing defense integration and implying that the eu , rather than nato , should become the main partner in transatlantic cooperation .
this idea would be in direct contrast to the us view of the primacy of the defense alliance which it founded in 1949 and still dominates . a strong europe is important , bush says earlier in the day , bush underlined this view but continued with his current line of wooing the europeans at every opportunity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. president george w. bush , right , meets ukraine president viktor yushchenko at the nato meeting in brussels , belgium , tuesday , feb .

behind all the talk of harmony are some major differences on how much political power the organization should have . in the days after he made them , german chancellor gerhard schröder 's comments that nato was no longer the " primary venue " for discussing global strategy offered a cue for every one to jump into an increasingly controversial debate . us president george w. bush saw in them a threat to sideline the security organization and told german television that he " looked forward to reminding gerhard schröder that nato is an active institution . " nato head jan hoop de schaeffer , while rejecting schröder 's call to set up a panel of experts to look at rehauling the organization , said it reflected efforts he has made in recent years to make nato more politically active . behind the semantics are very real questions about what shape the 26-nation institution will take as europe grows closer to forging a security and defense policy that could supplement some of nato 's tasks .
it is an issue on which parts of europe and the united states are still divided . france , for example , favors making the european union ever stronger in defense matters , part of a grander strategy of providing a counterweight to the united states in the world . us : no nato competition the united states , encouraging but at the same time wary of the european union 's military ambitions , is on edge when talk of changing the alliance comes up .
thierry balzacq at the center for european policy studies said the paranoia stems from plans belgium , france , germany and luxembourg drew up at a summit last year calling for a military planning council that washington saw as competition to nato .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato headquarters in brussels " every time one of these countries says something , even if they 're supporting nato , the other side will always come and say ' oh , they are trying to undermine nato 's policy ' , " he said . when he meets with president bush in mainz on wednesday , schröder will take care to distance himself from the french position without selling out completely on europe , said henning riecke , a transatlantic security expert .
a certain ambiguity " i think nato is very important for the germans , but they are n't able to issue this nato first principle the americans would like to hear , " said riecke , who works for the berlin-based council on foreign relations .
" so there has to be a certain ambiguity . " schröder himself left nothing to doubt when he defended his remarks two days after his defense minister read them out at the munich security conference on feb .
14 .
he lobbied again for an expert panel to look for ways to expand the organization 's involvement in policy discussions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's comments on nato prompted a curt reply from bush " i really believe that it contributes to a strengthening of nato and transatlantic relations if we speak more openly on political issues than we have tended to in the past , " he said .
providing troops - and strategic direction ? at issue is whether nato , an organization that provides the troops , weaponry and logistical support for peacekeeping missions from afghanistan to sarajevo , will have a greater say on how that weaponry and manpower gets used . since the attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , the organization has made great strides in increasing its military prowess , investing in technology and creating a rapid response force which is able to deploy anywhere in the world within a few days .
but differences between some nato allies - like france and the us - over the iraq war , kept the alliance from discussing ways to increase nato 's say in strategic planning , said riecke .
" what is lacking is a strategic understanding of what these troops should be used for , " he said . while nato improved its capabilites , the eu for the first time got serious about developing a military wing .
they pledged to develop a military response force simliar to nato 's and took over the organization 's policing mission in bosnia . no clear resolution some in washington worry that the steps taken both by nato and the european union are on a collision course .
in the best of both worlds , the nato would serve as the big stick to the european union 's well-intentioned diplomacy , say some observers . but nato , and its biggest member , america , will not always have the same interests in a crisis region as the european union . the europeans " might need -lrb- military -rrb- capabilities to keep the neighborhood in order , like in the balkans , " said riecke . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hand-over ceremony in skopje , as eu soldiers take over responsibility for peacekeeping in the country from the nato . no one expects any clear position to emerge from the nato discussions tuesday .
most analysts agree that bush 's visit will be a charm offensive designed to show european allies that the united states still cares .
but many do n't expect a more substantive indication on how their differences on nato will get resolved . the visits by condoleezza rice and bush are " clear signals that europe is being taken seriously as a strong partner , " said reicke .

the european union announced on tuesday that it intends to bring its 16-year arms embargo against china to an end , much to the regret of visiting us president george w. bush . us president george w. bush expressed " deep concern " on tuesday about european union plans to lift an arms embargo on china , saying that it might upset relations between beijing and taiwan .
his concerns alone are unlikely to be enough to stop the eu from pursuing its goal of ending its ban on arms sales to the people 's republic . " with regard to china , europe intends to remove the last obstacles to its relations with this important country , " french president jacques chirac announced after talks with president bush . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac and bush already met on monday as well chirac maintained that the embargo , imposed in 1989 after the brutal suppression of the tiananmen square democracy movement , was no longer justified but the eu would ensure its abolition did not change the strategic balance in asia .
he noted that us allies canada and australia did not have such restrictions on arms sales to beijing . bush fears a change in asian power balance the president made the concerns of the united states known . " there is deep concern in our country that a transfer of weapons would be a transfer of technology to china which would change the balance of relations between china and taiwan , " he said after the nato summit in brussels . " i am told that -lrb- the europeans -rrb- have heard the concerns of the us and ... they know the congress is concerned and they will try to develop a plan that will ease concern , " bush said .

france has agreed to spare just one member of staff from their nato team while the french , germans and belgians continue to oppose sending any of their military personnel to iraq . bush is also likely to face heat on other subjects such as the kyoto protocol on climate change , the international criminal court and disputes over transatlantic trade . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to work toward ending china arms ban at an eu-china summit on wednesday , the eu said now was not the time to lift its arms embargo on china .

behind all the talk of harmony are some major differences on how much political power the organization should have . in the days after he made them , german chancellor gerhard schröder 's comments that nato was no longer the " primary venue " for discussing global strategy offered a cue for every one to jump into an increasingly controversial debate . us president george w. bush saw in them a threat to sideline the security organization and told german television that he " looked forward to reminding gerhard schröder that nato is an active institution . " nato head jan hoop de schaeffer , while rejecting schröder 's call to set up a panel of experts to look at rehauling the organization , said it reflected efforts he has made in recent years to make nato more politically active . behind the semantics are very real questions about what shape the 26-nation institution will take as europe grows closer to forging a security and defense policy that could supplement some of nato 's tasks .
it is an issue on which parts of europe and the united states are still divided . france , for example , favors making the european union ever stronger in defense matters , part of a grander strategy of providing a counterweight to the united states in the world . us : no nato competition the united states , encouraging but at the same time wary of the european union 's military ambitions , is on edge when talk of changing the alliance comes up .
thierry balzacq at the center for european policy studies said the paranoia stems from plans belgium , france , germany and luxembourg drew up at a summit last year calling for a military planning council that washington saw as competition to nato .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato headquarters in brussels " every time one of these countries says something , even if they 're supporting nato , the other side will always come and say ' oh , they are trying to undermine nato 's policy ' , " he said . when he meets with president bush in mainz on wednesday , schröder will take care to distance himself from the french position without selling out completely on europe , said henning riecke , a transatlantic security expert .
a certain ambiguity " i think nato is very important for the germans , but they are n't able to issue this nato first principle the americans would like to hear , " said riecke , who works for the berlin-based council on foreign relations .
" so there has to be a certain ambiguity . " schröder himself left nothing to doubt when he defended his remarks two days after his defense minister read them out at the munich security conference on feb .
14 .
he lobbied again for an expert panel to look for ways to expand the organization 's involvement in policy discussions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's comments on nato prompted a curt reply from bush " i really believe that it contributes to a strengthening of nato and transatlantic relations if we speak more openly on political issues than we have tended to in the past , " he said .
providing troops - and strategic direction ? at issue is whether nato , an organization that provides the troops , weaponry and logistical support for peacekeeping missions from afghanistan to sarajevo , will have a greater say on how that weaponry and manpower gets used . since the attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , the organization has made great strides in increasing its military prowess , investing in technology and creating a rapid response force which is able to deploy anywhere in the world within a few days .
but differences between some nato allies - like france and the us - over the iraq war , kept the alliance from discussing ways to increase nato 's say in strategic planning , said riecke .
" what is lacking is a strategic understanding of what these troops should be used for , " he said . while nato improved its capabilites , the eu for the first time got serious about developing a military wing .
they pledged to develop a military response force simliar to nato 's and took over the organization 's policing mission in bosnia . no clear resolution some in washington worry that the steps taken both by nato and the european union are on a collision course .
in the best of both worlds , the nato would serve as the big stick to the european union 's well-intentioned diplomacy , say some observers . but nato , and its biggest member , america , will not always have the same interests in a crisis region as the european union . the europeans " might need -lrb- military -rrb- capabilities to keep the neighborhood in order , like in the balkans , " said riecke . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hand-over ceremony in skopje , as eu soldiers take over responsibility for peacekeeping in the country from the nato . no one expects any clear position to emerge from the nato discussions tuesday .
most analysts agree that bush 's visit will be a charm offensive designed to show european allies that the united states still cares .
but many do n't expect a more substantive indication on how their differences on nato will get resolved . the visits by condoleezza rice and bush are " clear signals that europe is being taken seriously as a strong partner , " said reicke .

behind all the talk of harmony are some major differences on how much political power the organization should have . in the days after he made them , german chancellor gerhard schröder 's comments that nato was no longer the " primary venue " for discussing global strategy offered a cue for every one to jump into an increasingly controversial debate . us president george w. bush saw in them a threat to sideline the security organization and told german television that he " looked forward to reminding gerhard schröder that nato is an active institution . " nato head jan hoop de schaeffer , while rejecting schröder 's call to set up a panel of experts to look at rehauling the organization , said it reflected efforts he has made in recent years to make nato more politically active . behind the semantics are very real questions about what shape the 26-nation institution will take as europe grows closer to forging a security and defense policy that could supplement some of nato 's tasks .
it is an issue on which parts of europe and the united states are still divided . france , for example , favors making the european union ever stronger in defense matters , part of a grander strategy of providing a counterweight to the united states in the world . us : no nato competition the united states , encouraging but at the same time wary of the european union 's military ambitions , is on edge when talk of changing the alliance comes up .
thierry balzacq at the center for european policy studies said the paranoia stems from plans belgium , france , germany and luxembourg drew up at a summit last year calling for a military planning council that washington saw as competition to nato .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato headquarters in brussels " every time one of these countries says something , even if they 're supporting nato , the other side will always come and say ' oh , they are trying to undermine nato 's policy ' , " he said . when he meets with president bush in mainz on wednesday , schröder will take care to distance himself from the french position without selling out completely on europe , said henning riecke , a transatlantic security expert .
a certain ambiguity " i think nato is very important for the germans , but they are n't able to issue this nato first principle the americans would like to hear , " said riecke , who works for the berlin-based council on foreign relations .
" so there has to be a certain ambiguity . " schröder himself left nothing to doubt when he defended his remarks two days after his defense minister read them out at the munich security conference on feb .
14 .
he lobbied again for an expert panel to look for ways to expand the organization 's involvement in policy discussions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's comments on nato prompted a curt reply from bush " i really believe that it contributes to a strengthening of nato and transatlantic relations if we speak more openly on political issues than we have tended to in the past , " he said .
providing troops - and strategic direction ? at issue is whether nato , an organization that provides the troops , weaponry and logistical support for peacekeeping missions from afghanistan to sarajevo , will have a greater say on how that weaponry and manpower gets used . since the attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , the organization has made great strides in increasing its military prowess , investing in technology and creating a rapid response force which is able to deploy anywhere in the world within a few days .
but differences between some nato allies - like france and the us - over the iraq war , kept the alliance from discussing ways to increase nato 's say in strategic planning , said riecke .
" what is lacking is a strategic understanding of what these troops should be used for , " he said . while nato improved its capabilites , the eu for the first time got serious about developing a military wing .
they pledged to develop a military response force simliar to nato 's and took over the organization 's policing mission in bosnia . no clear resolution some in washington worry that the steps taken both by nato and the european union are on a collision course .
in the best of both worlds , the nato would serve as the big stick to the european union 's well-intentioned diplomacy , say some observers . but nato , and its biggest member , america , will not always have the same interests in a crisis region as the european union . the europeans " might need -lrb- military -rrb- capabilities to keep the neighborhood in order , like in the balkans , " said riecke . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hand-over ceremony in skopje , as eu soldiers take over responsibility for peacekeeping in the country from the nato . no one expects any clear position to emerge from the nato discussions tuesday .
most analysts agree that bush 's visit will be a charm offensive designed to show european allies that the united states still cares .
but many do n't expect a more substantive indication on how their differences on nato will get resolved . the visits by condoleezza rice and bush are " clear signals that europe is being taken seriously as a strong partner , " said reicke .
we 'll have to see what the wrangling on the working level will turn out to be , how this might poison the picture a bit .

he noted that us allies canada and australia did not have such restrictions on arms sales to beijing . bush fears a change in asian power balance the president made the concerns of the united states known . " there is deep concern in our country that a transfer of weapons would be a transfer of technology to china which would change the balance of relations between china and taiwan , " he said after the nato summit in brussels . " i am told that -lrb- the europeans -rrb- have heard the concerns of the us and ... they know the congress is concerned and they will try to develop a plan that will ease concern , " bush said .
but he added : " we will see . " earlier a spokesman for british prime minister tony blair said britain and the other eu members were striving to allay us jitters about the lifting of an eu arms embargo on china . europe taking us concerns into account " on china , we recognize that the united states has concerns , and along with our european partners we are working to address those concerns , " the spokesman told reporters after a morning meeting between the two leaders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and blair " i think the americans have said that they are here in listening mode on that issue , " he added .
" we welcome that .
it is a question of ' discussions continue . " ' it looks increasingly like some europeans have been lying in wait for bush .

france has agreed to spare just one member of staff from their nato team while the french , germans and belgians continue to oppose sending any of their military personnel to iraq . bush is also likely to face heat on other subjects such as the kyoto protocol on climate change , the international criminal court and disputes over transatlantic trade . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to work toward ending china arms ban at an eu-china summit on wednesday , the eu said now was not the time to lift its arms embargo on china .

mutual support in middle east politics can be decisive in spurring the peace process . but also when it comes to topics such as the future of nato , the international criminal court and climate change , where no agreement is in sight , there is a need for serious , thorough discussion .
the europe that is currently growing together owes itself that . us needs europe again it would be wrong to assume that george w. bush is not prepared to make any concessions because he is only concerned with asserting american interests .

under the terms of the stability and growth pact eurozone countries are not allowed to chalk up deficits in excess of 3.0 percent of gdp .
originally , destatis had estimated that the 2004 deficit ratio stood at 3.9 percent , but as more detailed tax estimates for the fourth quarter were received , this preliminary estimate was revised downwards , the statisticians explained .
tax revenues were € 1.5 billion -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- higher than originally calculated in the period from october to december and expenditures were down by € 2.6 billion on the preliminary estimate .
in concrete terms , tax revenues totaled € 953.6 billion in the whole of 2004 , destatis said .
with expenditure totaling € 1.034 trillion , the shortfall amounted to € 80.3 billion , measured against total gdp of € 2.177 trillion , the office reported . dw-world.de germany and eu divided over 2005 deficit the european commission says germany will be violating deficit limits in 2005 for the fourth year .
but german finance minister eichel disputes the forecast .

providing troops - and strategic direction ? at issue is whether nato , an organization that provides the troops , weaponry and logistical support for peacekeeping missions from afghanistan to sarajevo , will have a greater say on how that weaponry and manpower gets used . since the attacks of sept .

but differences between some nato allies - like france and the us - over the iraq war , kept the alliance from discussing ways to increase nato 's say in strategic planning , said riecke .
" what is lacking is a strategic understanding of what these troops should be used for , " he said . while nato improved its capabilites , the eu for the first time got serious about developing a military wing .
they pledged to develop a military response force simliar to nato 's and took over the organization 's policing mission in bosnia . no clear resolution some in washington worry that the steps taken both by nato and the european union are on a collision course .
in the best of both worlds , the nato would serve as the big stick to the european union 's well-intentioned diplomacy , say some observers . but nato , and its biggest member , america , will not always have the same interests in a crisis region as the european union . the europeans " might need -lrb- military -rrb- capabilities to keep the neighborhood in order , like in the balkans , " said riecke . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hand-over ceremony in skopje , as eu soldiers take over responsibility for peacekeeping in the country from the nato . no one expects any clear position to emerge from the nato discussions tuesday .

behind all the talk of harmony are some major differences on how much political power the organization should have . in the days after he made them , german chancellor gerhard schröder 's comments that nato was no longer the " primary venue " for discussing global strategy offered a cue for every one to jump into an increasingly controversial debate . us president george w. bush saw in them a threat to sideline the security organization and told german television that he " looked forward to reminding gerhard schröder that nato is an active institution . " nato head jan hoop de schaeffer , while rejecting schröder 's call to set up a panel of experts to look at rehauling the organization , said it reflected efforts he has made in recent years to make nato more politically active . behind the semantics are very real questions about what shape the 26-nation institution will take as europe grows closer to forging a security and defense policy that could supplement some of nato 's tasks .
it is an issue on which parts of europe and the united states are still divided . france , for example , favors making the european union ever stronger in defense matters , part of a grander strategy of providing a counterweight to the united states in the world . us : no nato competition the united states , encouraging but at the same time wary of the european union 's military ambitions , is on edge when talk of changing the alliance comes up .
thierry balzacq at the center for european policy studies said the paranoia stems from plans belgium , france , germany and luxembourg drew up at a summit last year calling for a military planning council that washington saw as competition to nato .

" there is deep concern in our country that a transfer of weapons would be a transfer of technology to china which would change the balance of relations between china and taiwan , " he said after the nato summit in brussels .

" the nato training mission is an important mission , " said bush . " every life is precious and we are thankful for the efforts , " being made by nato to help restore democracy in iraq , bush told a press conference at the military alliance 's headquarters , adding he was sincerely grateful . " nato is providing a training mission which is vital ... every country should be proud of the fact that they are contributing to the world 's newest democracy , " bush said at the press conference with nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer . bush asks europe and the us to move on bush acknowledged the divisions caused by the us-led march 2003 invasion of iraq to topple leader saddam hussein but said : " the key now is to put that behind us and to focus on helping the new democracy to succeed .
it 's in our interest , it 's in your countries ' interest , to let democracy take hold in iraq . " while nato officials trumpeted the agreement of all 26 allies to make some contribution to the iraq training mission as a token of the alliance 's rediscovered unity , the unanimous agreement hid discrepancies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we have the 26 .
as far as we are concerned , that is everyone working in the same direction , " a nato official told reporters .
but in reality it was unity in name only . the united states agreed to provide around 60 trainers out of a total close to 160 while france , the most vocal european critic of the us-led invasion in iraq , agreed for just one of its officers at nato headquarters to help coordinate offers of equipment to the iraqi military . the french , along with the germans and belgians , also reiterated their decisions not to send their personnel to serve inside iraq . chirac endorses schröder 's plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac also reminded president bush that conciliatory language would not mend all the broken fences between them by endorsing a call by german chancellor gerhard schröder for a reform of nato , initially rebuffed by washington , to take into account new realities such as the rise of an enlarged and increasingly integrated eu . " europe and the united states are real partners , " chirac told the nato leaders .
" so we need dialogue and to listen to each other more . " " we must also , as the german chancellor has underlined , continue to take account of the changes that have occurred on the european continent , " chirac said , referring explicitly to europe 's growing defense integration and implying that the eu , rather than nato , should become the main partner in transatlantic cooperation .
this idea would be in direct contrast to the us view of the primacy of the defense alliance which it founded in 1949 and still dominates . a strong europe is important , bush says earlier in the day , bush underlined this view but continued with his current line of wooing the europeans at every opportunity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. president george w. bush , right , meets ukraine president viktor yushchenko at the nato meeting in brussels , belgium , tuesday , feb .

" : bush and barroso president george w. bush continued his hectic schedule in brussels on tuesday when he met with european union officials to tackle a number of thorny issues . a special summit between the united states and the european union was taking place in brussels throughout tuesday with us president george w. bush in attendance and several unpalatable issues on the menu . the summit with the 25-nation eu began after morning talks with the leaders of the north atlantic treaty organisation -lrb- nato -rrb- , with bush aiming to revive transatlantic ties which nosedived over the conflict in iraq . the discussions were due to continue into the evening with president bush dining with european commission president jose barroso and the eu foreign affairs chief , javier solana . welcomed by luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , bush said he was " very happy " to be meeting with his 25 counterparts , most of whom also attended the nato talks . the us president faced several thorny topics in his discussions with the eu including the middle east peace process and the on-going negotiations with iran .
while europe favors discussions , the us is skeptical that talking will get results . bush : attack on iran " ridiculous " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all options are on the table , said bush .
however , bush said that reports that the united states was preparing to attack iran was " ridiculous , " but reiterated that no options could be ruled out . " this notion that the united states is getting ready to attack iran is simply ridiculous , " he told reporters at the evening press conference during the summit .
" having said that , all options are on the table . " bush then voiced support for an ongoing attempt by british , french and german diplomats to get tehran to renounce its feared pursuit of nuclear weapons in return for trade and economic incentives . " you know , we 've talked about iran , " said bush , referring to his two days of discussions in brussels .
" that 's a place where i 'm getting good advice from european partners .
" after all , great britain , germany and france are negotiating with the ayatollahs with a common objective , something we all want , and that is for them not to have a nuclear weapon , " he said .
" it 's in our interests for them not to have a nuclear weapon .
" it 's also in our interest for them not to continue to fund terrorist organizations like hezbollah , which has the desire to stop the middle east peace process from going forward , " bush continued .
iraq conference announced bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg 's jean-claude juncker .
it was also announced that the eu and the us had agreed to co-host an international conference on iraq 's reconstruction .
juncker told reporters the conference would be organized if the incoming iraqi government agrees to it .
" should the new iraqi government request it , the united states and the european union are prepared to co-host an international conference to provide a forum to encourage and coordinate international support for iraq , " he said . barroso said the eu 's executive branch " is , and will remain , committed to a stable and democratic " iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose manuel barroso .
" we continue to offer substantial political and financial support to the process of democratic transition , and we hope that if the new iraqi government makes concrete proposals for joint action we will be ready to assist , " the eu commission president said . china embargo plan creates waves the positive noises coming from the talks were overshadowed to a point by eu plans to lift a 16-year european arms embargo on china after bush reiterated washington 's deep concern at the project . " this is a question which is being examined , " juncker told journalists .
" we still have n't reached a final result . " juncker added that for him bush 's visit represented the " start of a new relationship " between europe and the united states . " we have had lots of differences in the past , but it is clear that differences of opinion can not divide us , " he said . leaders welcome talks so far bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder with nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer .
german chancellor gerhard schröder hailed the earlier talks with nato saying they were " good discussions . " they were very focused on the issues , " said schröder , who caused a stir before bush arrived in europe by suggesting nato was in need of reform , implying that the eu may be a better defense partner .
" we concerned ourselves with the real problems facing us , especially in the middle east but also in afghanistan .

" the nato training mission is an important mission , " said bush . " every life is precious and we are thankful for the efforts , " being made by nato to help restore democracy in iraq , bush told a press conference at the military alliance 's headquarters , adding he was sincerely grateful . " nato is providing a training mission which is vital ... every country should be proud of the fact that they are contributing to the world 's newest democracy , " bush said at the press conference with nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer . bush asks europe and the us to move on bush acknowledged the divisions caused by the us-led march 2003 invasion of iraq to topple leader saddam hussein but said : " the key now is to put that behind us and to focus on helping the new democracy to succeed .
it 's in our interest , it 's in your countries ' interest , to let democracy take hold in iraq . " while nato officials trumpeted the agreement of all 26 allies to make some contribution to the iraq training mission as a token of the alliance 's rediscovered unity , the unanimous agreement hid discrepancies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we have the 26 .
as far as we are concerned , that is everyone working in the same direction , " a nato official told reporters .
but in reality it was unity in name only . the united states agreed to provide around 60 trainers out of a total close to 160 while france , the most vocal european critic of the us-led invasion in iraq , agreed for just one of its officers at nato headquarters to help coordinate offers of equipment to the iraqi military . the french , along with the germans and belgians , also reiterated their decisions not to send their personnel to serve inside iraq . chirac endorses schröder 's plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac also reminded president bush that conciliatory language would not mend all the broken fences between them by endorsing a call by german chancellor gerhard schröder for a reform of nato , initially rebuffed by washington , to take into account new realities such as the rise of an enlarged and increasingly integrated eu . " europe and the united states are real partners , " chirac told the nato leaders .
" so we need dialogue and to listen to each other more . " " we must also , as the german chancellor has underlined , continue to take account of the changes that have occurred on the european continent , " chirac said , referring explicitly to europe 's growing defense integration and implying that the eu , rather than nato , should become the main partner in transatlantic cooperation .
this idea would be in direct contrast to the us view of the primacy of the defense alliance which it founded in 1949 and still dominates . a strong europe is important , bush says earlier in the day , bush underlined this view but continued with his current line of wooing the europeans at every opportunity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. president george w. bush , right , meets ukraine president viktor yushchenko at the nato meeting in brussels , belgium , tuesday , feb .

" : bush and barroso president george w. bush continued his hectic schedule in brussels on tuesday when he met with european union officials to tackle a number of thorny issues . a special summit between the united states and the european union was taking place in brussels throughout tuesday with us president george w. bush in attendance and several unpalatable issues on the menu . the summit with the 25-nation eu began after morning talks with the leaders of the north atlantic treaty organisation -lrb- nato -rrb- , with bush aiming to revive transatlantic ties which nosedived over the conflict in iraq . the discussions were due to continue into the evening with president bush dining with european commission president jose barroso and the eu foreign affairs chief , javier solana . welcomed by luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , bush said he was " very happy " to be meeting with his 25 counterparts , most of whom also attended the nato talks . the us president faced several thorny topics in his discussions with the eu including the middle east peace process and the on-going negotiations with iran .
while europe favors discussions , the us is skeptical that talking will get results . bush : attack on iran " ridiculous " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all options are on the table , said bush .
however , bush said that reports that the united states was preparing to attack iran was " ridiculous , " but reiterated that no options could be ruled out . " this notion that the united states is getting ready to attack iran is simply ridiculous , " he told reporters at the evening press conference during the summit .
" having said that , all options are on the table . " bush then voiced support for an ongoing attempt by british , french and german diplomats to get tehran to renounce its feared pursuit of nuclear weapons in return for trade and economic incentives . " you know , we 've talked about iran , " said bush , referring to his two days of discussions in brussels .
" that 's a place where i 'm getting good advice from european partners .
" after all , great britain , germany and france are negotiating with the ayatollahs with a common objective , something we all want , and that is for them not to have a nuclear weapon , " he said .
" it 's in our interests for them not to have a nuclear weapon .
" it 's also in our interest for them not to continue to fund terrorist organizations like hezbollah , which has the desire to stop the middle east peace process from going forward , " bush continued .
iraq conference announced bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg 's jean-claude juncker .
it was also announced that the eu and the us had agreed to co-host an international conference on iraq 's reconstruction .
juncker told reporters the conference would be organized if the incoming iraqi government agrees to it .
" should the new iraqi government request it , the united states and the european union are prepared to co-host an international conference to provide a forum to encourage and coordinate international support for iraq , " he said . barroso said the eu 's executive branch " is , and will remain , committed to a stable and democratic " iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose manuel barroso .
" we continue to offer substantial political and financial support to the process of democratic transition , and we hope that if the new iraqi government makes concrete proposals for joint action we will be ready to assist , " the eu commission president said . china embargo plan creates waves the positive noises coming from the talks were overshadowed to a point by eu plans to lift a 16-year european arms embargo on china after bush reiterated washington 's deep concern at the project . " this is a question which is being examined , " juncker told journalists .
" we still have n't reached a final result . " juncker added that for him bush 's visit represented the " start of a new relationship " between europe and the united states . " we have had lots of differences in the past , but it is clear that differences of opinion can not divide us , " he said . leaders welcome talks so far bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder with nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer .
german chancellor gerhard schröder hailed the earlier talks with nato saying they were " good discussions .

" we concerned ourselves with the real problems facing us , especially in the middle east but also in afghanistan .

the european union announced on tuesday that it intends to bring its 16-year arms embargo against china to an end , much to the regret of visiting us president george w. bush . us president george w. bush expressed " deep concern " on tuesday about european union plans to lift an arms embargo on china , saying that it might upset relations between beijing and taiwan .
his concerns alone are unlikely to be enough to stop the eu from pursuing its goal of ending its ban on arms sales to the people 's republic . " with regard to china , europe intends to remove the last obstacles to its relations with this important country , " french president jacques chirac announced after talks with president bush . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac and bush already met on monday as well chirac maintained that the embargo , imposed in 1989 after the brutal suppression of the tiananmen square democracy movement , was no longer justified but the eu would ensure its abolition did not change the strategic balance in asia .
he noted that us allies canada and australia did not have such restrictions on arms sales to beijing . bush fears a change in asian power balance the president made the concerns of the united states known . " there is deep concern in our country that a transfer of weapons would be a transfer of technology to china which would change the balance of relations between china and taiwan , " he said after the nato summit in brussels . " i am told that -lrb- the europeans -rrb- have heard the concerns of the us and ... they know the congress is concerned and they will try to develop a plan that will ease concern , " bush said .
but he added : " we will see . " earlier a spokesman for british prime minister tony blair said britain and the other eu members were striving to allay us jitters about the lifting of an eu arms embargo on china . europe taking us concerns into account " on china , we recognize that the united states has concerns , and along with our european partners we are working to address those concerns , " the spokesman told reporters after a morning meeting between the two leaders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and blair " i think the americans have said that they are here in listening mode on that issue , " he added .
" we welcome that .
it is a question of ' discussions continue . " ' it looks increasingly like some europeans have been lying in wait for bush .
after the relaxed smiles and cordiality offered to us secretary of state condoleezza rice during her tour earlier this month , the president looks to be having a rougher ride since arriving two days ago . more opposition ahead for visiting president bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors across germany also voiced their opposition against bush .
" we do n't care for bush , " reads the sign .
as well as the china issue , bush has faced behind-closed-doors opposition to aspects of his iraq plan concerning nato members and the training of security forces in the country .
france has agreed to spare just one member of staff from their nato team while the french , germans and belgians continue to oppose sending any of their military personnel to iraq . bush is also likely to face heat on other subjects such as the kyoto protocol on climate change , the international criminal court and disputes over transatlantic trade . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to work toward ending china arms ban at an eu-china summit on wednesday , the eu said now was not the time to lift its arms embargo on china .

it was a speech that europeans would do well to see as an earnest offer of cooperation . there 's no doubt about it : george w. bush ruffles some serious feathers in germany and europe .
it 's easy to criticize the re-elected us president .
at first glance , he fits wonderfully in the role of the cowboy who shoots first and asks questions later . from this point of view , it 's just a matter of time before the next war is launched against iran or north korea .
because , as we so often hear , in today 's unipolar world , the us wants to assert its interests everywhere as quickly as possible - if necessary , with military force .
securing oil reserves and maintaining military supremacy is what it 's really all about .
this is currently the predominant view in europe , represented also in the opinion pages of reputable newspapers . what 's often forgotten is that the evil with which the european left associates bush - namely the iraq war - was a direct consequence of the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks on the united states .
the us government remains convinced that radical islamic terrorism can only be defeated if the conflict in the middle east is resolved .
that 's why it attacked saddam hussein , the hero of the palestinians - despite all the claims that bush was really concerned about saddam 's supposed ties to al qaeda . importance of dialogue it 's precisely because the starting positions are so different that the transatlantic dialogue is so important .
washington 's recognition that the us could really use europe 's help with iraq has created a window of opportunity for a rapprochement .
the europeans are beginning to understand that american military pressure is beneficial to the eu 's diplomatic efforts to convince tehran to abandon its nuclear program . at the junctures where european and american interests overlap , brussels should use the opportunity to closely consult with washington on its policy .
with regard to syria , this appears to have worked well .
both sides are now increasing pressure on damascus to pull syrian troops out of lebanon .
mutual support in middle east politics can be decisive in spurring the peace process . but also when it comes to topics such as the future of nato , the international criminal court and climate change , where no agreement is in sight , there is a need for serious , thorough discussion .
the europe that is currently growing together owes itself that . us needs europe again it would be wrong to assume that george w. bush is not prepared to make any concessions because he is only concerned with asserting american interests .
other us presidents who were demonized in europe in a way similar to bush showed that they enjoyed considerably more room to move in their second terms , when they could no longer be re-elected . the fact that bush is visiting europe at the start of his second term is a sign that , three and a half years after sept .
11 , 2001 , the us needs the support of the europeans again .
bush made this clear in the speech he gave in brussels .
the europeans should take him at his word . grahame lucas -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us , europe still split on nato 's role at the nato summit on tuesday , europe and the us will discuss the direction the alliance will take .

while europe favors discussions , the us is skeptical that talking will get results . bush : attack on iran " ridiculous " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all options are on the table , said bush .
however , bush said that reports that the united states was preparing to attack iran was " ridiculous , " but reiterated that no options could be ruled out . " this notion that the united states is getting ready to attack iran is simply ridiculous , " he told reporters at the evening press conference during the summit .
" having said that , all options are on the table . " bush then voiced support for an ongoing attempt by british , french and german diplomats to get tehran to renounce its feared pursuit of nuclear weapons in return for trade and economic incentives . " you know , we 've talked about iran , " said bush , referring to his two days of discussions in brussels .
" that 's a place where i 'm getting good advice from european partners .

" every life is precious and we are thankful for the efforts , " being made by nato to help restore democracy in iraq , bush told a press conference at the military alliance 's headquarters , adding he was sincerely grateful . " nato is providing a training mission which is vital ... every country should be proud of the fact that they are contributing to the world 's newest democracy , " bush said at the press conference with nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer . bush asks europe and the us to move on bush acknowledged the divisions caused by the us-led march 2003 invasion of iraq to topple leader saddam hussein but said : " the key now is to put that behind us and to focus on helping the new democracy to succeed .
it 's in our interest , it 's in your countries ' interest , to let democracy take hold in iraq . " while nato officials trumpeted the agreement of all 26 allies to make some contribution to the iraq training mission as a token of the alliance 's rediscovered unity , the unanimous agreement hid discrepancies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we have the 26 .
as far as we are concerned , that is everyone working in the same direction , " a nato official told reporters .
but in reality it was unity in name only . the united states agreed to provide around 60 trainers out of a total close to 160 while france , the most vocal european critic of the us-led invasion in iraq , agreed for just one of its officers at nato headquarters to help coordinate offers of equipment to the iraqi military . the french , along with the germans and belgians , also reiterated their decisions not to send their personnel to serve inside iraq . chirac endorses schröder 's plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac also reminded president bush that conciliatory language would not mend all the broken fences between them by endorsing a call by german chancellor gerhard schröder for a reform of nato , initially rebuffed by washington , to take into account new realities such as the rise of an enlarged and increasingly integrated eu . " europe and the united states are real partners , " chirac told the nato leaders .
" so we need dialogue and to listen to each other more . " " we must also , as the german chancellor has underlined , continue to take account of the changes that have occurred on the european continent , " chirac said , referring explicitly to europe 's growing defense integration and implying that the eu , rather than nato , should become the main partner in transatlantic cooperation .
this idea would be in direct contrast to the us view of the primacy of the defense alliance which it founded in 1949 and still dominates . a strong europe is important , bush says earlier in the day , bush underlined this view but continued with his current line of wooing the europeans at every opportunity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. president george w. bush , right , meets ukraine president viktor yushchenko at the nato meeting in brussels , belgium , tuesday , feb .

" : bush and barroso president george w. bush continued his hectic schedule in brussels on tuesday when he met with european union officials to tackle a number of thorny issues . a special summit between the united states and the european union was taking place in brussels throughout tuesday with us president george w. bush in attendance and several unpalatable issues on the menu . the summit with the 25-nation eu began after morning talks with the leaders of the north atlantic treaty organisation -lrb- nato -rrb- , with bush aiming to revive transatlantic ties which nosedived over the conflict in iraq . the discussions were due to continue into the evening with president bush dining with european commission president jose barroso and the eu foreign affairs chief , javier solana . welcomed by luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , bush said he was " very happy " to be meeting with his 25 counterparts , most of whom also attended the nato talks . the us president faced several thorny topics in his discussions with the eu including the middle east peace process and the on-going negotiations with iran .
while europe favors discussions , the us is skeptical that talking will get results . bush : attack on iran " ridiculous " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all options are on the table , said bush .
however , bush said that reports that the united states was preparing to attack iran was " ridiculous , " but reiterated that no options could be ruled out . " this notion that the united states is getting ready to attack iran is simply ridiculous , " he told reporters at the evening press conference during the summit .
" having said that , all options are on the table . " bush then voiced support for an ongoing attempt by british , french and german diplomats to get tehran to renounce its feared pursuit of nuclear weapons in return for trade and economic incentives . " you know , we 've talked about iran , " said bush , referring to his two days of discussions in brussels .
" that 's a place where i 'm getting good advice from european partners .
" after all , great britain , germany and france are negotiating with the ayatollahs with a common objective , something we all want , and that is for them not to have a nuclear weapon , " he said .
" it 's in our interests for them not to have a nuclear weapon .
" it 's also in our interest for them not to continue to fund terrorist organizations like hezbollah , which has the desire to stop the middle east peace process from going forward , " bush continued .
iraq conference announced bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg 's jean-claude juncker .
it was also announced that the eu and the us had agreed to co-host an international conference on iraq 's reconstruction .
juncker told reporters the conference would be organized if the incoming iraqi government agrees to it .
" should the new iraqi government request it , the united states and the european union are prepared to co-host an international conference to provide a forum to encourage and coordinate international support for iraq , " he said . barroso said the eu 's executive branch " is , and will remain , committed to a stable and democratic " iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose manuel barroso .
" we continue to offer substantial political and financial support to the process of democratic transition , and we hope that if the new iraqi government makes concrete proposals for joint action we will be ready to assist , " the eu commission president said . china embargo plan creates waves the positive noises coming from the talks were overshadowed to a point by eu plans to lift a 16-year european arms embargo on china after bush reiterated washington 's deep concern at the project . " this is a question which is being examined , " juncker told journalists .
" we still have n't reached a final result . " juncker added that for him bush 's visit represented the " start of a new relationship " between europe and the united states . " we have had lots of differences in the past , but it is clear that differences of opinion can not divide us , " he said . leaders welcome talks so far bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder with nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer .
german chancellor gerhard schröder hailed the earlier talks with nato saying they were " good discussions . " they were very focused on the issues , " said schröder , who caused a stir before bush arrived in europe by suggesting nato was in need of reform , implying that the eu may be a better defense partner .
" we concerned ourselves with the real problems facing us , especially in the middle east but also in afghanistan . " italian prime minister silvio berlusconi also welcomed tuesday 's landmark meetings and stressed the need to speed up training in iraq " to be able to leave the country in conditions able to ensure its security .

the european union announced on tuesday that it intends to bring its 16-year arms embargo against china to an end , much to the regret of visiting us president george w. bush . us president george w. bush expressed " deep concern " on tuesday about european union plans to lift an arms embargo on china , saying that it might upset relations between beijing and taiwan .
his concerns alone are unlikely to be enough to stop the eu from pursuing its goal of ending its ban on arms sales to the people 's republic .

behind all the talk of harmony are some major differences on how much political power the organization should have . in the days after he made them , german chancellor gerhard schröder 's comments that nato was no longer the " primary venue " for discussing global strategy offered a cue for every one to jump into an increasingly controversial debate . us president george w. bush saw in them a threat to sideline the security organization and told german television that he " looked forward to reminding gerhard schröder that nato is an active institution . " nato head jan hoop de schaeffer , while rejecting schröder 's call to set up a panel of experts to look at rehauling the organization , said it reflected efforts he has made in recent years to make nato more politically active . behind the semantics are very real questions about what shape the 26-nation institution will take as europe grows closer to forging a security and defense policy that could supplement some of nato 's tasks .
it is an issue on which parts of europe and the united states are still divided . france , for example , favors making the european union ever stronger in defense matters , part of a grander strategy of providing a counterweight to the united states in the world . us : no nato competition the united states , encouraging but at the same time wary of the european union 's military ambitions , is on edge when talk of changing the alliance comes up .
thierry balzacq at the center for european policy studies said the paranoia stems from plans belgium , france , germany and luxembourg drew up at a summit last year calling for a military planning council that washington saw as competition to nato .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato headquarters in brussels " every time one of these countries says something , even if they 're supporting nato , the other side will always come and say ' oh , they are trying to undermine nato 's policy ' , " he said . when he meets with president bush in mainz on wednesday , schröder will take care to distance himself from the french position without selling out completely on europe , said henning riecke , a transatlantic security expert .
a certain ambiguity " i think nato is very important for the germans , but they are n't able to issue this nato first principle the americans would like to hear , " said riecke , who works for the berlin-based council on foreign relations .
" so there has to be a certain ambiguity . " schröder himself left nothing to doubt when he defended his remarks two days after his defense minister read them out at the munich security conference on feb .
14 .
he lobbied again for an expert panel to look for ways to expand the organization 's involvement in policy discussions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's comments on nato prompted a curt reply from bush " i really believe that it contributes to a strengthening of nato and transatlantic relations if we speak more openly on political issues than we have tended to in the past , " he said .
providing troops - and strategic direction ? at issue is whether nato , an organization that provides the troops , weaponry and logistical support for peacekeeping missions from afghanistan to sarajevo , will have a greater say on how that weaponry and manpower gets used . since the attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , the organization has made great strides in increasing its military prowess , investing in technology and creating a rapid response force which is able to deploy anywhere in the world within a few days .
but differences between some nato allies - like france and the us - over the iraq war , kept the alliance from discussing ways to increase nato 's say in strategic planning , said riecke .
" what is lacking is a strategic understanding of what these troops should be used for , " he said . while nato improved its capabilites , the eu for the first time got serious about developing a military wing .
they pledged to develop a military response force simliar to nato 's and took over the organization 's policing mission in bosnia . no clear resolution some in washington worry that the steps taken both by nato and the european union are on a collision course .
in the best of both worlds , the nato would serve as the big stick to the european union 's well-intentioned diplomacy , say some observers . but nato , and its biggest member , america , will not always have the same interests in a crisis region as the european union . the europeans " might need -lrb- military -rrb- capabilities to keep the neighborhood in order , like in the balkans , " said riecke . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hand-over ceremony in skopje , as eu soldiers take over responsibility for peacekeeping in the country from the nato . no one expects any clear position to emerge from the nato discussions tuesday .
most analysts agree that bush 's visit will be a charm offensive designed to show european allies that the united states still cares .
but many do n't expect a more substantive indication on how their differences on nato will get resolved . the visits by condoleezza rice and bush are " clear signals that europe is being taken seriously as a strong partner , " said reicke .

it was a speech that europeans would do well to see as an earnest offer of cooperation . there 's no doubt about it : george w. bush ruffles some serious feathers in germany and europe .
it 's easy to criticize the re-elected us president .
at first glance , he fits wonderfully in the role of the cowboy who shoots first and asks questions later . from this point of view , it 's just a matter of time before the next war is launched against iran or north korea .
because , as we so often hear , in today 's unipolar world , the us wants to assert its interests everywhere as quickly as possible - if necessary , with military force .
securing oil reserves and maintaining military supremacy is what it 's really all about .
this is currently the predominant view in europe , represented also in the opinion pages of reputable newspapers . what 's often forgotten is that the evil with which the european left associates bush - namely the iraq war - was a direct consequence of the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks on the united states .
the us government remains convinced that radical islamic terrorism can only be defeated if the conflict in the middle east is resolved .
that 's why it attacked saddam hussein , the hero of the palestinians - despite all the claims that bush was really concerned about saddam 's supposed ties to al qaeda . importance of dialogue it 's precisely because the starting positions are so different that the transatlantic dialogue is so important .
washington 's recognition that the us could really use europe 's help with iraq has created a window of opportunity for a rapprochement .
the europeans are beginning to understand that american military pressure is beneficial to the eu 's diplomatic efforts to convince tehran to abandon its nuclear program . at the junctures where european and american interests overlap , brussels should use the opportunity to closely consult with washington on its policy .
with regard to syria , this appears to have worked well .
both sides are now increasing pressure on damascus to pull syrian troops out of lebanon .
mutual support in middle east politics can be decisive in spurring the peace process . but also when it comes to topics such as the future of nato , the international criminal court and climate change , where no agreement is in sight , there is a need for serious , thorough discussion .
the europe that is currently growing together owes itself that . us needs europe again it would be wrong to assume that george w. bush is not prepared to make any concessions because he is only concerned with asserting american interests .
other us presidents who were demonized in europe in a way similar to bush showed that they enjoyed considerably more room to move in their second terms , when they could no longer be re-elected . the fact that bush is visiting europe at the start of his second term is a sign that , three and a half years after sept .
11 , 2001 , the us needs the support of the europeans again .
bush made this clear in the speech he gave in brussels .
the europeans should take him at his word . grahame lucas -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us , europe still split on nato 's role at the nato summit on tuesday , europe and the us will discuss the direction the alliance will take .

" : bush and barroso president george w. bush continued his hectic schedule in brussels on tuesday when he met with european union officials to tackle a number of thorny issues . a special summit between the united states and the european union was taking place in brussels throughout tuesday with us president george w. bush in attendance and several unpalatable issues on the menu . the summit with the 25-nation eu began after morning talks with the leaders of the north atlantic treaty organisation -lrb- nato -rrb- , with bush aiming to revive transatlantic ties which nosedived over the conflict in iraq . the discussions were due to continue into the evening with president bush dining with european commission president jose barroso and the eu foreign affairs chief , javier solana . welcomed by luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , bush said he was " very happy " to be meeting with his 25 counterparts , most of whom also attended the nato talks . the us president faced several thorny topics in his discussions with the eu including the middle east peace process and the on-going negotiations with iran .
while europe favors discussions , the us is skeptical that talking will get results . bush : attack on iran " ridiculous " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all options are on the table , said bush .
however , bush said that reports that the united states was preparing to attack iran was " ridiculous , " but reiterated that no options could be ruled out . " this notion that the united states is getting ready to attack iran is simply ridiculous , " he told reporters at the evening press conference during the summit .
" having said that , all options are on the table . " bush then voiced support for an ongoing attempt by british , french and german diplomats to get tehran to renounce its feared pursuit of nuclear weapons in return for trade and economic incentives . " you know , we 've talked about iran , " said bush , referring to his two days of discussions in brussels .
" that 's a place where i 'm getting good advice from european partners .
" after all , great britain , germany and france are negotiating with the ayatollahs with a common objective , something we all want , and that is for them not to have a nuclear weapon , " he said .
" it 's in our interests for them not to have a nuclear weapon .
" it 's also in our interest for them not to continue to fund terrorist organizations like hezbollah , which has the desire to stop the middle east peace process from going forward , " bush continued .
iraq conference announced bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg 's jean-claude juncker .
it was also announced that the eu and the us had agreed to co-host an international conference on iraq 's reconstruction .
juncker told reporters the conference would be organized if the incoming iraqi government agrees to it .
" should the new iraqi government request it , the united states and the european union are prepared to co-host an international conference to provide a forum to encourage and coordinate international support for iraq , " he said . barroso said the eu 's executive branch " is , and will remain , committed to a stable and democratic " iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose manuel barroso .
" we continue to offer substantial political and financial support to the process of democratic transition , and we hope that if the new iraqi government makes concrete proposals for joint action we will be ready to assist , " the eu commission president said . china embargo plan creates waves the positive noises coming from the talks were overshadowed to a point by eu plans to lift a 16-year european arms embargo on china after bush reiterated washington 's deep concern at the project . " this is a question which is being examined , " juncker told journalists .
" we still have n't reached a final result . " juncker added that for him bush 's visit represented the " start of a new relationship " between europe and the united states . " we have had lots of differences in the past , but it is clear that differences of opinion can not divide us , " he said . leaders welcome talks so far bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder with nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer .
german chancellor gerhard schröder hailed the earlier talks with nato saying they were " good discussions . " they were very focused on the issues , " said schröder , who caused a stir before bush arrived in europe by suggesting nato was in need of reform , implying that the eu may be a better defense partner .
" we concerned ourselves with the real problems facing us , especially in the middle east but also in afghanistan . " italian prime minister silvio berlusconi also welcomed tuesday 's landmark meetings and stressed the need to speed up training in iraq " to be able to leave the country in conditions able to ensure its security .

behind all the talk of harmony are some major differences on how much political power the organization should have . in the days after he made them , german chancellor gerhard schröder 's comments that nato was no longer the " primary venue " for discussing global strategy offered a cue for every one to jump into an increasingly controversial debate . us president george w. bush saw in them a threat to sideline the security organization and told german television that he " looked forward to reminding gerhard schröder that nato is an active institution . " nato head jan hoop de schaeffer , while rejecting schröder 's call to set up a panel of experts to look at rehauling the organization , said it reflected efforts he has made in recent years to make nato more politically active . behind the semantics are very real questions about what shape the 26-nation institution will take as europe grows closer to forging a security and defense policy that could supplement some of nato 's tasks .
it is an issue on which parts of europe and the united states are still divided . france , for example , favors making the european union ever stronger in defense matters , part of a grander strategy of providing a counterweight to the united states in the world . us : no nato competition the united states , encouraging but at the same time wary of the european union 's military ambitions , is on edge when talk of changing the alliance comes up .
thierry balzacq at the center for european policy studies said the paranoia stems from plans belgium , france , germany and luxembourg drew up at a summit last year calling for a military planning council that washington saw as competition to nato .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato headquarters in brussels " every time one of these countries says something , even if they 're supporting nato , the other side will always come and say ' oh , they are trying to undermine nato 's policy ' , " he said . when he meets with president bush in mainz on wednesday , schröder will take care to distance himself from the french position without selling out completely on europe , said henning riecke , a transatlantic security expert .
a certain ambiguity " i think nato is very important for the germans , but they are n't able to issue this nato first principle the americans would like to hear , " said riecke , who works for the berlin-based council on foreign relations .
" so there has to be a certain ambiguity . " schröder himself left nothing to doubt when he defended his remarks two days after his defense minister read them out at the munich security conference on feb .
14 .
he lobbied again for an expert panel to look for ways to expand the organization 's involvement in policy discussions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's comments on nato prompted a curt reply from bush " i really believe that it contributes to a strengthening of nato and transatlantic relations if we speak more openly on political issues than we have tended to in the past , " he said .
providing troops - and strategic direction ? at issue is whether nato , an organization that provides the troops , weaponry and logistical support for peacekeeping missions from afghanistan to sarajevo , will have a greater say on how that weaponry and manpower gets used . since the attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , the organization has made great strides in increasing its military prowess , investing in technology and creating a rapid response force which is able to deploy anywhere in the world within a few days .
but differences between some nato allies - like france and the us - over the iraq war , kept the alliance from discussing ways to increase nato 's say in strategic planning , said riecke .
" what is lacking is a strategic understanding of what these troops should be used for , " he said . while nato improved its capabilites , the eu for the first time got serious about developing a military wing .
they pledged to develop a military response force simliar to nato 's and took over the organization 's policing mission in bosnia . no clear resolution some in washington worry that the steps taken both by nato and the european union are on a collision course .
in the best of both worlds , the nato would serve as the big stick to the european union 's well-intentioned diplomacy , say some observers . but nato , and its biggest member , america , will not always have the same interests in a crisis region as the european union . the europeans " might need -lrb- military -rrb- capabilities to keep the neighborhood in order , like in the balkans , " said riecke . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hand-over ceremony in skopje , as eu soldiers take over responsibility for peacekeeping in the country from the nato . no one expects any clear position to emerge from the nato discussions tuesday .
most analysts agree that bush 's visit will be a charm offensive designed to show european allies that the united states still cares .
but many do n't expect a more substantive indication on how their differences on nato will get resolved . the visits by condoleezza rice and bush are " clear signals that europe is being taken seriously as a strong partner , " said reicke .

behind all the talk of harmony are some major differences on how much political power the organization should have . in the days after he made them , german chancellor gerhard schröder 's comments that nato was no longer the " primary venue " for discussing global strategy offered a cue for every one to jump into an increasingly controversial debate . us president george w. bush saw in them a threat to sideline the security organization and told german television that he " looked forward to reminding gerhard schröder that nato is an active institution . " nato head jan hoop de schaeffer , while rejecting schröder 's call to set up a panel of experts to look at rehauling the organization , said it reflected efforts he has made in recent years to make nato more politically active . behind the semantics are very real questions about what shape the 26-nation institution will take as europe grows closer to forging a security and defense policy that could supplement some of nato 's tasks .
it is an issue on which parts of europe and the united states are still divided . france , for example , favors making the european union ever stronger in defense matters , part of a grander strategy of providing a counterweight to the united states in the world . us : no nato competition the united states , encouraging but at the same time wary of the european union 's military ambitions , is on edge when talk of changing the alliance comes up .
thierry balzacq at the center for european policy studies said the paranoia stems from plans belgium , france , germany and luxembourg drew up at a summit last year calling for a military planning council that washington saw as competition to nato .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato headquarters in brussels " every time one of these countries says something , even if they 're supporting nato , the other side will always come and say ' oh , they are trying to undermine nato 's policy ' , " he said . when he meets with president bush in mainz on wednesday , schröder will take care to distance himself from the french position without selling out completely on europe , said henning riecke , a transatlantic security expert .
a certain ambiguity " i think nato is very important for the germans , but they are n't able to issue this nato first principle the americans would like to hear , " said riecke , who works for the berlin-based council on foreign relations .
" so there has to be a certain ambiguity . " schröder himself left nothing to doubt when he defended his remarks two days after his defense minister read them out at the munich security conference on feb .
14 .
he lobbied again for an expert panel to look for ways to expand the organization 's involvement in policy discussions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's comments on nato prompted a curt reply from bush " i really believe that it contributes to a strengthening of nato and transatlantic relations if we speak more openly on political issues than we have tended to in the past , " he said .
providing troops - and strategic direction ? at issue is whether nato , an organization that provides the troops , weaponry and logistical support for peacekeeping missions from afghanistan to sarajevo , will have a greater say on how that weaponry and manpower gets used . since the attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , the organization has made great strides in increasing its military prowess , investing in technology and creating a rapid response force which is able to deploy anywhere in the world within a few days .
but differences between some nato allies - like france and the us - over the iraq war , kept the alliance from discussing ways to increase nato 's say in strategic planning , said riecke .
" what is lacking is a strategic understanding of what these troops should be used for , " he said . while nato improved its capabilites , the eu for the first time got serious about developing a military wing .
they pledged to develop a military response force simliar to nato 's and took over the organization 's policing mission in bosnia . no clear resolution some in washington worry that the steps taken both by nato and the european union are on a collision course .
in the best of both worlds , the nato would serve as the big stick to the european union 's well-intentioned diplomacy , say some observers . but nato , and its biggest member , america , will not always have the same interests in a crisis region as the european union . the europeans " might need -lrb- military -rrb- capabilities to keep the neighborhood in order , like in the balkans , " said riecke . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hand-over ceremony in skopje , as eu soldiers take over responsibility for peacekeeping in the country from the nato . no one expects any clear position to emerge from the nato discussions tuesday .
most analysts agree that bush 's visit will be a charm offensive designed to show european allies that the united states still cares .
but many do n't expect a more substantive indication on how their differences on nato will get resolved . the visits by condoleezza rice and bush are " clear signals that europe is being taken seriously as a strong partner , " said reicke .

it was a speech that europeans would do well to see as an earnest offer of cooperation . there 's no doubt about it : george w. bush ruffles some serious feathers in germany and europe .
it 's easy to criticize the re-elected us president .
at first glance , he fits wonderfully in the role of the cowboy who shoots first and asks questions later . from this point of view , it 's just a matter of time before the next war is launched against iran or north korea .
because , as we so often hear , in today 's unipolar world , the us wants to assert its interests everywhere as quickly as possible - if necessary , with military force .
securing oil reserves and maintaining military supremacy is what it 's really all about .
this is currently the predominant view in europe , represented also in the opinion pages of reputable newspapers . what 's often forgotten is that the evil with which the european left associates bush - namely the iraq war - was a direct consequence of the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks on the united states .
the us government remains convinced that radical islamic terrorism can only be defeated if the conflict in the middle east is resolved .
that 's why it attacked saddam hussein , the hero of the palestinians - despite all the claims that bush was really concerned about saddam 's supposed ties to al qaeda . importance of dialogue it 's precisely because the starting positions are so different that the transatlantic dialogue is so important .
washington 's recognition that the us could really use europe 's help with iraq has created a window of opportunity for a rapprochement .
the europeans are beginning to understand that american military pressure is beneficial to the eu 's diplomatic efforts to convince tehran to abandon its nuclear program . at the junctures where european and american interests overlap , brussels should use the opportunity to closely consult with washington on its policy .
with regard to syria , this appears to have worked well .
both sides are now increasing pressure on damascus to pull syrian troops out of lebanon .
mutual support in middle east politics can be decisive in spurring the peace process . but also when it comes to topics such as the future of nato , the international criminal court and climate change , where no agreement is in sight , there is a need for serious , thorough discussion .
the europe that is currently growing together owes itself that . us needs europe again it would be wrong to assume that george w. bush is not prepared to make any concessions because he is only concerned with asserting american interests .
other us presidents who were demonized in europe in a way similar to bush showed that they enjoyed considerably more room to move in their second terms , when they could no longer be re-elected . the fact that bush is visiting europe at the start of his second term is a sign that , three and a half years after sept .

" nato head jan hoop de schaeffer , while rejecting schröder 's call to set up a panel of experts to look at rehauling the organization , said it reflected efforts he has made in recent years to make nato more politically active . behind the semantics are very real questions about what shape the 26-nation institution will take as europe grows closer to forging a security and defense policy that could supplement some of nato 's tasks .

thierry balzacq at the center for european policy studies said the paranoia stems from plans belgium , france , germany and luxembourg drew up at a summit last year calling for a military planning council that washington saw as competition to nato .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato headquarters in brussels " every time one of these countries says something , even if they 're supporting nato , the other side will always come and say ' oh , they are trying to undermine nato 's policy ' , " he said . when he meets with president bush in mainz on wednesday , schröder will take care to distance himself from the french position without selling out completely on europe , said henning riecke , a transatlantic security expert .
a certain ambiguity " i think nato is very important for the germans , but they are n't able to issue this nato first principle the americans would like to hear , " said riecke , who works for the berlin-based council on foreign relations .
" so there has to be a certain ambiguity . " schröder himself left nothing to doubt when he defended his remarks two days after his defense minister read them out at the munich security conference on feb .

providing troops - and strategic direction ? at issue is whether nato , an organization that provides the troops , weaponry and logistical support for peacekeeping missions from afghanistan to sarajevo , will have a greater say on how that weaponry and manpower gets used . since the attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , the organization has made great strides in increasing its military prowess , investing in technology and creating a rapid response force which is able to deploy anywhere in the world within a few days .
but differences between some nato allies - like france and the us - over the iraq war , kept the alliance from discussing ways to increase nato 's say in strategic planning , said riecke .
" what is lacking is a strategic understanding of what these troops should be used for , " he said . while nato improved its capabilites , the eu for the first time got serious about developing a military wing .
they pledged to develop a military response force simliar to nato 's and took over the organization 's policing mission in bosnia . no clear resolution some in washington worry that the steps taken both by nato and the european union are on a collision course .
in the best of both worlds , the nato would serve as the big stick to the european union 's well-intentioned diplomacy , say some observers . but nato , and its biggest member , america , will not always have the same interests in a crisis region as the european union . the europeans " might need -lrb- military -rrb- capabilities to keep the neighborhood in order , like in the balkans , " said riecke . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hand-over ceremony in skopje , as eu soldiers take over responsibility for peacekeeping in the country from the nato . no one expects any clear position to emerge from the nato discussions tuesday .

the european union announced on tuesday that it intends to bring its 16-year arms embargo against china to an end , much to the regret of visiting us president george w. bush . us president george w. bush expressed " deep concern " on tuesday about european union plans to lift an arms embargo on china , saying that it might upset relations between beijing and taiwan .
his concerns alone are unlikely to be enough to stop the eu from pursuing its goal of ending its ban on arms sales to the people 's republic . " with regard to china , europe intends to remove the last obstacles to its relations with this important country , " french president jacques chirac announced after talks with president bush . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac and bush already met on monday as well chirac maintained that the embargo , imposed in 1989 after the brutal suppression of the tiananmen square democracy movement , was no longer justified but the eu would ensure its abolition did not change the strategic balance in asia .
he noted that us allies canada and australia did not have such restrictions on arms sales to beijing . bush fears a change in asian power balance the president made the concerns of the united states known . " there is deep concern in our country that a transfer of weapons would be a transfer of technology to china which would change the balance of relations between china and taiwan , " he said after the nato summit in brussels .

" the nato training mission is an important mission , " said bush . " every life is precious and we are thankful for the efforts , " being made by nato to help restore democracy in iraq , bush told a press conference at the military alliance 's headquarters , adding he was sincerely grateful . " nato is providing a training mission which is vital ... every country should be proud of the fact that they are contributing to the world 's newest democracy , " bush said at the press conference with nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer . bush asks europe and the us to move on bush acknowledged the divisions caused by the us-led march 2003 invasion of iraq to topple leader saddam hussein but said : " the key now is to put that behind us and to focus on helping the new democracy to succeed .
it 's in our interest , it 's in your countries ' interest , to let democracy take hold in iraq . " while nato officials trumpeted the agreement of all 26 allies to make some contribution to the iraq training mission as a token of the alliance 's rediscovered unity , the unanimous agreement hid discrepancies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we have the 26 .
as far as we are concerned , that is everyone working in the same direction , " a nato official told reporters .
but in reality it was unity in name only . the united states agreed to provide around 60 trainers out of a total close to 160 while france , the most vocal european critic of the us-led invasion in iraq , agreed for just one of its officers at nato headquarters to help coordinate offers of equipment to the iraqi military . the french , along with the germans and belgians , also reiterated their decisions not to send their personnel to serve inside iraq . chirac endorses schröder 's plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac also reminded president bush that conciliatory language would not mend all the broken fences between them by endorsing a call by german chancellor gerhard schröder for a reform of nato , initially rebuffed by washington , to take into account new realities such as the rise of an enlarged and increasingly integrated eu . " europe and the united states are real partners , " chirac told the nato leaders .
" so we need dialogue and to listen to each other more . " " we must also , as the german chancellor has underlined , continue to take account of the changes that have occurred on the european continent , " chirac said , referring explicitly to europe 's growing defense integration and implying that the eu , rather than nato , should become the main partner in transatlantic cooperation .
this idea would be in direct contrast to the us view of the primacy of the defense alliance which it founded in 1949 and still dominates . a strong europe is important , bush says earlier in the day , bush underlined this view but continued with his current line of wooing the europeans at every opportunity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. president george w. bush , right , meets ukraine president viktor yushchenko at the nato meeting in brussels , belgium , tuesday , feb .

chirac spoke in favor of the german chancellor 's plans on tuesday at a nato summit attended by president bush .
chirac echoed schröder 's view that nato was " no longer the primary venue where transatlantic partners discuss and coordinate strategies , " saying : " europe and the united states are real partners .
so we need to dialogue and listen to each other more . "
he added : " we must also , as the german chancellor has underlined , continue to take account of the changes that have occurred on the european continent , " chirac said , referring to the end of the cold war and the rise of an enlarged and increasingly integrated european union .
schröder said in a speech delivered to the munich security conference 10 days ago that a high-level panel should recommend how nato could be reformed .

" : bush and barroso president george w. bush continued his hectic schedule in brussels on tuesday when he met with european union officials to tackle a number of thorny issues . a special summit between the united states and the european union was taking place in brussels throughout tuesday with us president george w. bush in attendance and several unpalatable issues on the menu . the summit with the 25-nation eu began after morning talks with the leaders of the north atlantic treaty organisation -lrb- nato -rrb- , with bush aiming to revive transatlantic ties which nosedived over the conflict in iraq . the discussions were due to continue into the evening with president bush dining with european commission president jose barroso and the eu foreign affairs chief , javier solana . welcomed by luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , bush said he was " very happy " to be meeting with his 25 counterparts , most of whom also attended the nato talks . the us president faced several thorny topics in his discussions with the eu including the middle east peace process and the on-going negotiations with iran .
while europe favors discussions , the us is skeptical that talking will get results . bush : attack on iran " ridiculous " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all options are on the table , said bush .
however , bush said that reports that the united states was preparing to attack iran was " ridiculous , " but reiterated that no options could be ruled out . " this notion that the united states is getting ready to attack iran is simply ridiculous , " he told reporters at the evening press conference during the summit .
" having said that , all options are on the table . " bush then voiced support for an ongoing attempt by british , french and german diplomats to get tehran to renounce its feared pursuit of nuclear weapons in return for trade and economic incentives . " you know , we 've talked about iran , " said bush , referring to his two days of discussions in brussels .
" that 's a place where i 'm getting good advice from european partners .
" after all , great britain , germany and france are negotiating with the ayatollahs with a common objective , something we all want , and that is for them not to have a nuclear weapon , " he said .
" it 's in our interests for them not to have a nuclear weapon .
" it 's also in our interest for them not to continue to fund terrorist organizations like hezbollah , which has the desire to stop the middle east peace process from going forward , " bush continued .
iraq conference announced bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg 's jean-claude juncker .
it was also announced that the eu and the us had agreed to co-host an international conference on iraq 's reconstruction .
juncker told reporters the conference would be organized if the incoming iraqi government agrees to it .
" should the new iraqi government request it , the united states and the european union are prepared to co-host an international conference to provide a forum to encourage and coordinate international support for iraq , " he said . barroso said the eu 's executive branch " is , and will remain , committed to a stable and democratic " iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose manuel barroso .
" we continue to offer substantial political and financial support to the process of democratic transition , and we hope that if the new iraqi government makes concrete proposals for joint action we will be ready to assist , " the eu commission president said . china embargo plan creates waves the positive noises coming from the talks were overshadowed to a point by eu plans to lift a 16-year european arms embargo on china after bush reiterated washington 's deep concern at the project . " this is a question which is being examined , " juncker told journalists .
" we still have n't reached a final result . " juncker added that for him bush 's visit represented the " start of a new relationship " between europe and the united states . " we have had lots of differences in the past , but it is clear that differences of opinion can not divide us , " he said . leaders welcome talks so far bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder with nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer .
german chancellor gerhard schröder hailed the earlier talks with nato saying they were " good discussions . " they were very focused on the issues , " said schröder , who caused a stir before bush arrived in europe by suggesting nato was in need of reform , implying that the eu may be a better defense partner .
" we concerned ourselves with the real problems facing us , especially in the middle east but also in afghanistan . " italian prime minister silvio berlusconi also welcomed tuesday 's landmark meetings and stressed the need to speed up training in iraq " to be able to leave the country in conditions able to ensure its security .

" : bush and barroso president george w. bush continued his hectic schedule in brussels on tuesday when he met with european union officials to tackle a number of thorny issues . a special summit between the united states and the european union was taking place in brussels throughout tuesday with us president george w. bush in attendance and several unpalatable issues on the menu . the summit with the 25-nation eu began after morning talks with the leaders of the north atlantic treaty organisation -lrb- nato -rrb- , with bush aiming to revive transatlantic ties which nosedived over the conflict in iraq . the discussions were due to continue into the evening with president bush dining with european commission president jose barroso and the eu foreign affairs chief , javier solana . welcomed by luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , bush said he was " very happy " to be meeting with his 25 counterparts , most of whom also attended the nato talks . the us president faced several thorny topics in his discussions with the eu including the middle east peace process and the on-going negotiations with iran .
while europe favors discussions , the us is skeptical that talking will get results . bush : attack on iran " ridiculous " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all options are on the table , said bush .
however , bush said that reports that the united states was preparing to attack iran was " ridiculous , " but reiterated that no options could be ruled out . " this notion that the united states is getting ready to attack iran is simply ridiculous , " he told reporters at the evening press conference during the summit .
" having said that , all options are on the table . " bush then voiced support for an ongoing attempt by british , french and german diplomats to get tehran to renounce its feared pursuit of nuclear weapons in return for trade and economic incentives . " you know , we 've talked about iran , " said bush , referring to his two days of discussions in brussels .
" that 's a place where i 'm getting good advice from european partners .
" after all , great britain , germany and france are negotiating with the ayatollahs with a common objective , something we all want , and that is for them not to have a nuclear weapon , " he said .
" it 's in our interests for them not to have a nuclear weapon .
" it 's also in our interest for them not to continue to fund terrorist organizations like hezbollah , which has the desire to stop the middle east peace process from going forward , " bush continued .
iraq conference announced bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg 's jean-claude juncker .
it was also announced that the eu and the us had agreed to co-host an international conference on iraq 's reconstruction .
juncker told reporters the conference would be organized if the incoming iraqi government agrees to it .
" should the new iraqi government request it , the united states and the european union are prepared to co-host an international conference to provide a forum to encourage and coordinate international support for iraq , " he said . barroso said the eu 's executive branch " is , and will remain , committed to a stable and democratic " iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose manuel barroso .
" we continue to offer substantial political and financial support to the process of democratic transition , and we hope that if the new iraqi government makes concrete proposals for joint action we will be ready to assist , " the eu commission president said . china embargo plan creates waves the positive noises coming from the talks were overshadowed to a point by eu plans to lift a 16-year european arms embargo on china after bush reiterated washington 's deep concern at the project . " this is a question which is being examined , " juncker told journalists .
" we still have n't reached a final result . " juncker added that for him bush 's visit represented the " start of a new relationship " between europe and the united states . " we have had lots of differences in the past , but it is clear that differences of opinion can not divide us , " he said . leaders welcome talks so far bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder with nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer .
german chancellor gerhard schröder hailed the earlier talks with nato saying they were " good discussions . " they were very focused on the issues , " said schröder , who caused a stir before bush arrived in europe by suggesting nato was in need of reform , implying that the eu may be a better defense partner .
" we concerned ourselves with the real problems facing us , especially in the middle east but also in afghanistan . " italian prime minister silvio berlusconi also welcomed tuesday 's landmark meetings and stressed the need to speed up training in iraq " to be able to leave the country in conditions able to ensure its security .

the european union announced on tuesday that it intends to bring its 16-year arms embargo against china to an end , much to the regret of visiting us president george w. bush . us president george w. bush expressed " deep concern " on tuesday about european union plans to lift an arms embargo on china , saying that it might upset relations between beijing and taiwan .
his concerns alone are unlikely to be enough to stop the eu from pursuing its goal of ending its ban on arms sales to the people 's republic . " with regard to china , europe intends to remove the last obstacles to its relations with this important country , " french president jacques chirac announced after talks with president bush . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac and bush already met on monday as well chirac maintained that the embargo , imposed in 1989 after the brutal suppression of the tiananmen square democracy movement , was no longer justified but the eu would ensure its abolition did not change the strategic balance in asia .
he noted that us allies canada and australia did not have such restrictions on arms sales to beijing . bush fears a change in asian power balance the president made the concerns of the united states known . " there is deep concern in our country that a transfer of weapons would be a transfer of technology to china which would change the balance of relations between china and taiwan , " he said after the nato summit in brussels . " i am told that -lrb- the europeans -rrb- have heard the concerns of the us and ... they know the congress is concerned and they will try to develop a plan that will ease concern , " bush said .
but he added : " we will see .

" we welcome that .
it is a question of ' discussions continue . " ' it looks increasingly like some europeans have been lying in wait for bush .
after the relaxed smiles and cordiality offered to us secretary of state condoleezza rice during her tour earlier this month , the president looks to be having a rougher ride since arriving two days ago . more opposition ahead for visiting president bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors across germany also voiced their opposition against bush .

as well as the china issue , bush has faced behind-closed-doors opposition to aspects of his iraq plan concerning nato members and the training of security forces in the country .
france has agreed to spare just one member of staff from their nato team while the french , germans and belgians continue to oppose sending any of their military personnel to iraq . bush is also likely to face heat on other subjects such as the kyoto protocol on climate change , the international criminal court and disputes over transatlantic trade . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to work toward ending china arms ban at an eu-china summit on wednesday , the eu said now was not the time to lift its arms embargo on china .

" : bush and barroso president george w. bush continued his hectic schedule in brussels on tuesday when he met with european union officials to tackle a number of thorny issues . a special summit between the united states and the european union was taking place in brussels throughout tuesday with us president george w. bush in attendance and several unpalatable issues on the menu . the summit with the 25-nation eu began after morning talks with the leaders of the north atlantic treaty organisation -lrb- nato -rrb- , with bush aiming to revive transatlantic ties which nosedived over the conflict in iraq . the discussions were due to continue into the evening with president bush dining with european commission president jose barroso and the eu foreign affairs chief , javier solana . welcomed by luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , bush said he was " very happy " to be meeting with his 25 counterparts , most of whom also attended the nato talks . the us president faced several thorny topics in his discussions with the eu including the middle east peace process and the on-going negotiations with iran .
while europe favors discussions , the us is skeptical that talking will get results . bush : attack on iran " ridiculous " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all options are on the table , said bush .
however , bush said that reports that the united states was preparing to attack iran was " ridiculous , " but reiterated that no options could be ruled out . " this notion that the united states is getting ready to attack iran is simply ridiculous , " he told reporters at the evening press conference during the summit .
" having said that , all options are on the table . " bush then voiced support for an ongoing attempt by british , french and german diplomats to get tehran to renounce its feared pursuit of nuclear weapons in return for trade and economic incentives . " you know , we 've talked about iran , " said bush , referring to his two days of discussions in brussels .
" that 's a place where i 'm getting good advice from european partners .

" we continue to offer substantial political and financial support to the process of democratic transition , and we hope that if the new iraqi government makes concrete proposals for joint action we will be ready to assist , " the eu commission president said . china embargo plan creates waves the positive noises coming from the talks were overshadowed to a point by eu plans to lift a 16-year european arms embargo on china after bush reiterated washington 's deep concern at the project .

while europe favors discussions , the us is skeptical that talking will get results . bush : attack on iran " ridiculous " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all options are on the table , said bush .
however , bush said that reports that the united states was preparing to attack iran was " ridiculous , " but reiterated that no options could be ruled out . " this notion that the united states is getting ready to attack iran is simply ridiculous , " he told reporters at the evening press conference during the summit .
" having said that , all options are on the table . " bush then voiced support for an ongoing attempt by british , french and german diplomats to get tehran to renounce its feared pursuit of nuclear weapons in return for trade and economic incentives . " you know , we 've talked about iran , " said bush , referring to his two days of discussions in brussels .
" that 's a place where i 'm getting good advice from european partners .
" after all , great britain , germany and france are negotiating with the ayatollahs with a common objective , something we all want , and that is for them not to have a nuclear weapon , " he said .
" it 's in our interests for them not to have a nuclear weapon .
" it 's also in our interest for them not to continue to fund terrorist organizations like hezbollah , which has the desire to stop the middle east peace process from going forward , " bush continued .
iraq conference announced bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg 's jean-claude juncker .
it was also announced that the eu and the us had agreed to co-host an international conference on iraq 's reconstruction .
juncker told reporters the conference would be organized if the incoming iraqi government agrees to it .
" should the new iraqi government request it , the united states and the european union are prepared to co-host an international conference to provide a forum to encourage and coordinate international support for iraq , " he said . barroso said the eu 's executive branch " is , and will remain , committed to a stable and democratic " iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose manuel barroso .
" we continue to offer substantial political and financial support to the process of democratic transition , and we hope that if the new iraqi government makes concrete proposals for joint action we will be ready to assist , " the eu commission president said . china embargo plan creates waves the positive noises coming from the talks were overshadowed to a point by eu plans to lift a 16-year european arms embargo on china after bush reiterated washington 's deep concern at the project . " this is a question which is being examined , " juncker told journalists .
" we still have n't reached a final result . " juncker added that for him bush 's visit represented the " start of a new relationship " between europe and the united states . " we have had lots of differences in the past , but it is clear that differences of opinion can not divide us , " he said . leaders welcome talks so far bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder with nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer .
german chancellor gerhard schröder hailed the earlier talks with nato saying they were " good discussions . " they were very focused on the issues , " said schröder , who caused a stir before bush arrived in europe by suggesting nato was in need of reform , implying that the eu may be a better defense partner .
" we concerned ourselves with the real problems facing us , especially in the middle east but also in afghanistan . " italian prime minister silvio berlusconi also welcomed tuesday 's landmark meetings and stressed the need to speed up training in iraq " to be able to leave the country in conditions able to ensure its security .

" : bush and barroso president george w. bush continued his hectic schedule in brussels on tuesday when he met with european union officials to tackle a number of thorny issues . a special summit between the united states and the european union was taking place in brussels throughout tuesday with us president george w. bush in attendance and several unpalatable issues on the menu . the summit with the 25-nation eu began after morning talks with the leaders of the north atlantic treaty organisation -lrb- nato -rrb- , with bush aiming to revive transatlantic ties which nosedived over the conflict in iraq . the discussions were due to continue into the evening with president bush dining with european commission president jose barroso and the eu foreign affairs chief , javier solana . welcomed by luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , bush said he was " very happy " to be meeting with his 25 counterparts , most of whom also attended the nato talks . the us president faced several thorny topics in his discussions with the eu including the middle east peace process and the on-going negotiations with iran .
while europe favors discussions , the us is skeptical that talking will get results . bush : attack on iran " ridiculous " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all options are on the table , said bush .
however , bush said that reports that the united states was preparing to attack iran was " ridiculous , " but reiterated that no options could be ruled out . " this notion that the united states is getting ready to attack iran is simply ridiculous , " he told reporters at the evening press conference during the summit .
" having said that , all options are on the table . " bush then voiced support for an ongoing attempt by british , french and german diplomats to get tehran to renounce its feared pursuit of nuclear weapons in return for trade and economic incentives . " you know , we 've talked about iran , " said bush , referring to his two days of discussions in brussels .

" : bush and barroso president george w. bush continued his hectic schedule in brussels on tuesday when he met with european union officials to tackle a number of thorny issues . a special summit between the united states and the european union was taking place in brussels throughout tuesday with us president george w. bush in attendance and several unpalatable issues on the menu . the summit with the 25-nation eu began after morning talks with the leaders of the north atlantic treaty organisation -lrb- nato -rrb- , with bush aiming to revive transatlantic ties which nosedived over the conflict in iraq . the discussions were due to continue into the evening with president bush dining with european commission president jose barroso and the eu foreign affairs chief , javier solana . welcomed by luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , bush said he was " very happy " to be meeting with his 25 counterparts , most of whom also attended the nato talks . the us president faced several thorny topics in his discussions with the eu including the middle east peace process and the on-going negotiations with iran .
while europe favors discussions , the us is skeptical that talking will get results . bush : attack on iran " ridiculous " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all options are on the table , said bush .
however , bush said that reports that the united states was preparing to attack iran was " ridiculous , " but reiterated that no options could be ruled out . " this notion that the united states is getting ready to attack iran is simply ridiculous , " he told reporters at the evening press conference during the summit .
" having said that , all options are on the table . " bush then voiced support for an ongoing attempt by british , french and german diplomats to get tehran to renounce its feared pursuit of nuclear weapons in return for trade and economic incentives . " you know , we 've talked about iran , " said bush , referring to his two days of discussions in brussels .
" that 's a place where i 'm getting good advice from european partners .
" after all , great britain , germany and france are negotiating with the ayatollahs with a common objective , something we all want , and that is for them not to have a nuclear weapon , " he said .
" it 's in our interests for them not to have a nuclear weapon .
" it 's also in our interest for them not to continue to fund terrorist organizations like hezbollah , which has the desire to stop the middle east peace process from going forward , " bush continued .
iraq conference announced bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg 's jean-claude juncker .
it was also announced that the eu and the us had agreed to co-host an international conference on iraq 's reconstruction .
juncker told reporters the conference would be organized if the incoming iraqi government agrees to it .
" should the new iraqi government request it , the united states and the european union are prepared to co-host an international conference to provide a forum to encourage and coordinate international support for iraq , " he said . barroso said the eu 's executive branch " is , and will remain , committed to a stable and democratic " iraq .

" we continue to offer substantial political and financial support to the process of democratic transition , and we hope that if the new iraqi government makes concrete proposals for joint action we will be ready to assist , " the eu commission president said . china embargo plan creates waves the positive noises coming from the talks were overshadowed to a point by eu plans to lift a 16-year european arms embargo on china after bush reiterated washington 's deep concern at the project . " this is a question which is being examined , " juncker told journalists .
" we still have n't reached a final result . " juncker added that for him bush 's visit represented the " start of a new relationship " between europe and the united states .

behind all the talk of harmony are some major differences on how much political power the organization should have . in the days after he made them , german chancellor gerhard schröder 's comments that nato was no longer the " primary venue " for discussing global strategy offered a cue for every one to jump into an increasingly controversial debate . us president george w. bush saw in them a threat to sideline the security organization and told german television that he " looked forward to reminding gerhard schröder that nato is an active institution .

" the nato training mission is an important mission , " said bush . " every life is precious and we are thankful for the efforts , " being made by nato to help restore democracy in iraq , bush told a press conference at the military alliance 's headquarters , adding he was sincerely grateful . " nato is providing a training mission which is vital ... every country should be proud of the fact that they are contributing to the world 's newest democracy , " bush said at the press conference with nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer . bush asks europe and the us to move on bush acknowledged the divisions caused by the us-led march 2003 invasion of iraq to topple leader saddam hussein but said : " the key now is to put that behind us and to focus on helping the new democracy to succeed .
it 's in our interest , it 's in your countries ' interest , to let democracy take hold in iraq . " while nato officials trumpeted the agreement of all 26 allies to make some contribution to the iraq training mission as a token of the alliance 's rediscovered unity , the unanimous agreement hid discrepancies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we have the 26 .
as far as we are concerned , that is everyone working in the same direction , " a nato official told reporters .
but in reality it was unity in name only . the united states agreed to provide around 60 trainers out of a total close to 160 while france , the most vocal european critic of the us-led invasion in iraq , agreed for just one of its officers at nato headquarters to help coordinate offers of equipment to the iraqi military . the french , along with the germans and belgians , also reiterated their decisions not to send their personnel to serve inside iraq . chirac endorses schröder 's plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac also reminded president bush that conciliatory language would not mend all the broken fences between them by endorsing a call by german chancellor gerhard schröder for a reform of nato , initially rebuffed by washington , to take into account new realities such as the rise of an enlarged and increasingly integrated eu . " europe and the united states are real partners , " chirac told the nato leaders .
" so we need dialogue and to listen to each other more . " " we must also , as the german chancellor has underlined , continue to take account of the changes that have occurred on the european continent , " chirac said , referring explicitly to europe 's growing defense integration and implying that the eu , rather than nato , should become the main partner in transatlantic cooperation .

the european union announced on tuesday that it intends to bring its 16-year arms embargo against china to an end , much to the regret of visiting us president george w. bush . us president george w. bush expressed " deep concern " on tuesday about european union plans to lift an arms embargo on china , saying that it might upset relations between beijing and taiwan .
his concerns alone are unlikely to be enough to stop the eu from pursuing its goal of ending its ban on arms sales to the people 's republic . " with regard to china , europe intends to remove the last obstacles to its relations with this important country , " french president jacques chirac announced after talks with president bush . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac and bush already met on monday as well chirac maintained that the embargo , imposed in 1989 after the brutal suppression of the tiananmen square democracy movement , was no longer justified but the eu would ensure its abolition did not change the strategic balance in asia .
he noted that us allies canada and australia did not have such restrictions on arms sales to beijing . bush fears a change in asian power balance the president made the concerns of the united states known . " there is deep concern in our country that a transfer of weapons would be a transfer of technology to china which would change the balance of relations between china and taiwan , " he said after the nato summit in brussels . " i am told that -lrb- the europeans -rrb- have heard the concerns of the us and ... they know the congress is concerned and they will try to develop a plan that will ease concern , " bush said .
but he added : " we will see .

" we welcome that .
it is a question of ' discussions continue . " ' it looks increasingly like some europeans have been lying in wait for bush .

" we do n't care for bush , " reads the sign .
as well as the china issue , bush has faced behind-closed-doors opposition to aspects of his iraq plan concerning nato members and the training of security forces in the country .
france has agreed to spare just one member of staff from their nato team while the french , germans and belgians continue to oppose sending any of their military personnel to iraq . bush is also likely to face heat on other subjects such as the kyoto protocol on climate change , the international criminal court and disputes over transatlantic trade . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to work toward ending china arms ban at an eu-china summit on wednesday , the eu said now was not the time to lift its arms embargo on china .

" : bush and barroso president george w. bush continued his hectic schedule in brussels on tuesday when he met with european union officials to tackle a number of thorny issues . a special summit between the united states and the european union was taking place in brussels throughout tuesday with us president george w. bush in attendance and several unpalatable issues on the menu . the summit with the 25-nation eu began after morning talks with the leaders of the north atlantic treaty organisation -lrb- nato -rrb- , with bush aiming to revive transatlantic ties which nosedived over the conflict in iraq . the discussions were due to continue into the evening with president bush dining with european commission president jose barroso and the eu foreign affairs chief , javier solana . welcomed by luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , bush said he was " very happy " to be meeting with his 25 counterparts , most of whom also attended the nato talks . the us president faced several thorny topics in his discussions with the eu including the middle east peace process and the on-going negotiations with iran .
while europe favors discussions , the us is skeptical that talking will get results . bush : attack on iran " ridiculous " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all options are on the table , said bush .
however , bush said that reports that the united states was preparing to attack iran was " ridiculous , " but reiterated that no options could be ruled out . " this notion that the united states is getting ready to attack iran is simply ridiculous , " he told reporters at the evening press conference during the summit .
" having said that , all options are on the table . " bush then voiced support for an ongoing attempt by british , french and german diplomats to get tehran to renounce its feared pursuit of nuclear weapons in return for trade and economic incentives . " you know , we 've talked about iran , " said bush , referring to his two days of discussions in brussels .
" that 's a place where i 'm getting good advice from european partners .
" after all , great britain , germany and france are negotiating with the ayatollahs with a common objective , something we all want , and that is for them not to have a nuclear weapon , " he said .
" it 's in our interests for them not to have a nuclear weapon .
" it 's also in our interest for them not to continue to fund terrorist organizations like hezbollah , which has the desire to stop the middle east peace process from going forward , " bush continued .
iraq conference announced bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg 's jean-claude juncker .
it was also announced that the eu and the us had agreed to co-host an international conference on iraq 's reconstruction .
juncker told reporters the conference would be organized if the incoming iraqi government agrees to it .
" should the new iraqi government request it , the united states and the european union are prepared to co-host an international conference to provide a forum to encourage and coordinate international support for iraq , " he said . barroso said the eu 's executive branch " is , and will remain , committed to a stable and democratic " iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose manuel barroso .
" we continue to offer substantial political and financial support to the process of democratic transition , and we hope that if the new iraqi government makes concrete proposals for joint action we will be ready to assist , " the eu commission president said . china embargo plan creates waves the positive noises coming from the talks were overshadowed to a point by eu plans to lift a 16-year european arms embargo on china after bush reiterated washington 's deep concern at the project . " this is a question which is being examined , " juncker told journalists .
" we still have n't reached a final result . " juncker added that for him bush 's visit represented the " start of a new relationship " between europe and the united states . " we have had lots of differences in the past , but it is clear that differences of opinion can not divide us , " he said . leaders welcome talks so far bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder with nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer .
german chancellor gerhard schröder hailed the earlier talks with nato saying they were " good discussions . " they were very focused on the issues , " said schröder , who caused a stir before bush arrived in europe by suggesting nato was in need of reform , implying that the eu may be a better defense partner .
" we concerned ourselves with the real problems facing us , especially in the middle east but also in afghanistan .

" : bush and barroso president george w. bush continued his hectic schedule in brussels on tuesday when he met with european union officials to tackle a number of thorny issues . a special summit between the united states and the european union was taking place in brussels throughout tuesday with us president george w. bush in attendance and several unpalatable issues on the menu . the summit with the 25-nation eu began after morning talks with the leaders of the north atlantic treaty organisation -lrb- nato -rrb- , with bush aiming to revive transatlantic ties which nosedived over the conflict in iraq . the discussions were due to continue into the evening with president bush dining with european commission president jose barroso and the eu foreign affairs chief , javier solana . welcomed by luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , bush said he was " very happy " to be meeting with his 25 counterparts , most of whom also attended the nato talks . the us president faced several thorny topics in his discussions with the eu including the middle east peace process and the on-going negotiations with iran .
while europe favors discussions , the us is skeptical that talking will get results . bush : attack on iran " ridiculous " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all options are on the table , said bush .
however , bush said that reports that the united states was preparing to attack iran was " ridiculous , " but reiterated that no options could be ruled out . " this notion that the united states is getting ready to attack iran is simply ridiculous , " he told reporters at the evening press conference during the summit .
" having said that , all options are on the table . " bush then voiced support for an ongoing attempt by british , french and german diplomats to get tehran to renounce its feared pursuit of nuclear weapons in return for trade and economic incentives . " you know , we 've talked about iran , " said bush , referring to his two days of discussions in brussels .
" that 's a place where i 'm getting good advice from european partners .
" after all , great britain , germany and france are negotiating with the ayatollahs with a common objective , something we all want , and that is for them not to have a nuclear weapon , " he said .
" it 's in our interests for them not to have a nuclear weapon .
" it 's also in our interest for them not to continue to fund terrorist organizations like hezbollah , which has the desire to stop the middle east peace process from going forward , " bush continued .
iraq conference announced bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg 's jean-claude juncker .
it was also announced that the eu and the us had agreed to co-host an international conference on iraq 's reconstruction .
juncker told reporters the conference would be organized if the incoming iraqi government agrees to it .
" should the new iraqi government request it , the united states and the european union are prepared to co-host an international conference to provide a forum to encourage and coordinate international support for iraq , " he said . barroso said the eu 's executive branch " is , and will remain , committed to a stable and democratic " iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose manuel barroso .
" we continue to offer substantial political and financial support to the process of democratic transition , and we hope that if the new iraqi government makes concrete proposals for joint action we will be ready to assist , " the eu commission president said . china embargo plan creates waves the positive noises coming from the talks were overshadowed to a point by eu plans to lift a 16-year european arms embargo on china after bush reiterated washington 's deep concern at the project . " this is a question which is being examined , " juncker told journalists .
" we still have n't reached a final result . " juncker added that for him bush 's visit represented the " start of a new relationship " between europe and the united states . " we have had lots of differences in the past , but it is clear that differences of opinion can not divide us , " he said . leaders welcome talks so far bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder with nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer .
german chancellor gerhard schröder hailed the earlier talks with nato saying they were " good discussions . " they were very focused on the issues , " said schröder , who caused a stir before bush arrived in europe by suggesting nato was in need of reform , implying that the eu may be a better defense partner .
" we concerned ourselves with the real problems facing us , especially in the middle east but also in afghanistan . " italian prime minister silvio berlusconi also welcomed tuesday 's landmark meetings and stressed the need to speed up training in iraq " to be able to leave the country in conditions able to ensure its security .

" the nato training mission is an important mission , " said bush . " every life is precious and we are thankful for the efforts , " being made by nato to help restore democracy in iraq , bush told a press conference at the military alliance 's headquarters , adding he was sincerely grateful .

" so we need dialogue and to listen to each other more .

it was a speech that europeans would do well to see as an earnest offer of cooperation . there 's no doubt about it : george w. bush ruffles some serious feathers in germany and europe .
it 's easy to criticize the re-elected us president .
at first glance , he fits wonderfully in the role of the cowboy who shoots first and asks questions later . from this point of view , it 's just a matter of time before the next war is launched against iran or north korea .
because , as we so often hear , in today 's unipolar world , the us wants to assert its interests everywhere as quickly as possible - if necessary , with military force .
securing oil reserves and maintaining military supremacy is what it 's really all about .
this is currently the predominant view in europe , represented also in the opinion pages of reputable newspapers . what 's often forgotten is that the evil with which the european left associates bush - namely the iraq war - was a direct consequence of the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks on the united states .
the us government remains convinced that radical islamic terrorism can only be defeated if the conflict in the middle east is resolved .
that 's why it attacked saddam hussein , the hero of the palestinians - despite all the claims that bush was really concerned about saddam 's supposed ties to al qaeda . importance of dialogue it 's precisely because the starting positions are so different that the transatlantic dialogue is so important .
washington 's recognition that the us could really use europe 's help with iraq has created a window of opportunity for a rapprochement .
the europeans are beginning to understand that american military pressure is beneficial to the eu 's diplomatic efforts to convince tehran to abandon its nuclear program . at the junctures where european and american interests overlap , brussels should use the opportunity to closely consult with washington on its policy .
with regard to syria , this appears to have worked well .
both sides are now increasing pressure on damascus to pull syrian troops out of lebanon .
mutual support in middle east politics can be decisive in spurring the peace process . but also when it comes to topics such as the future of nato , the international criminal court and climate change , where no agreement is in sight , there is a need for serious , thorough discussion .
the europe that is currently growing together owes itself that . us needs europe again it would be wrong to assume that george w. bush is not prepared to make any concessions because he is only concerned with asserting american interests .
other us presidents who were demonized in europe in a way similar to bush showed that they enjoyed considerably more room to move in their second terms , when they could no longer be re-elected . the fact that bush is visiting europe at the start of his second term is a sign that , three and a half years after sept .
11 , 2001 , the us needs the support of the europeans again .
bush made this clear in the speech he gave in brussels .
the europeans should take him at his word . grahame lucas -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us , europe still split on nato 's role at the nato summit on tuesday , europe and the us will discuss the direction the alliance will take .

it was a speech that europeans would do well to see as an earnest offer of cooperation . there 's no doubt about it : george w. bush ruffles some serious feathers in germany and europe .
it 's easy to criticize the re-elected us president .
at first glance , he fits wonderfully in the role of the cowboy who shoots first and asks questions later . from this point of view , it 's just a matter of time before the next war is launched against iran or north korea .
because , as we so often hear , in today 's unipolar world , the us wants to assert its interests everywhere as quickly as possible - if necessary , with military force .
securing oil reserves and maintaining military supremacy is what it 's really all about .
this is currently the predominant view in europe , represented also in the opinion pages of reputable newspapers . what 's often forgotten is that the evil with which the european left associates bush - namely the iraq war - was a direct consequence of the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks on the united states .
the us government remains convinced that radical islamic terrorism can only be defeated if the conflict in the middle east is resolved .
that 's why it attacked saddam hussein , the hero of the palestinians - despite all the claims that bush was really concerned about saddam 's supposed ties to al qaeda . importance of dialogue it 's precisely because the starting positions are so different that the transatlantic dialogue is so important .
washington 's recognition that the us could really use europe 's help with iraq has created a window of opportunity for a rapprochement .
the europeans are beginning to understand that american military pressure is beneficial to the eu 's diplomatic efforts to convince tehran to abandon its nuclear program . at the junctures where european and american interests overlap , brussels should use the opportunity to closely consult with washington on its policy .
with regard to syria , this appears to have worked well .
both sides are now increasing pressure on damascus to pull syrian troops out of lebanon .
mutual support in middle east politics can be decisive in spurring the peace process . but also when it comes to topics such as the future of nato , the international criminal court and climate change , where no agreement is in sight , there is a need for serious , thorough discussion .
the europe that is currently growing together owes itself that . us needs europe again it would be wrong to assume that george w. bush is not prepared to make any concessions because he is only concerned with asserting american interests .
other us presidents who were demonized in europe in a way similar to bush showed that they enjoyed considerably more room to move in their second terms , when they could no longer be re-elected . the fact that bush is visiting europe at the start of his second term is a sign that , three and a half years after sept .
11 , 2001 , the us needs the support of the europeans again .
bush made this clear in the speech he gave in brussels .
the europeans should take him at his word . grahame lucas -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us , europe still split on nato 's role at the nato summit on tuesday , europe and the us will discuss the direction the alliance will take .

behind all the talk of harmony are some major differences on how much political power the organization should have . in the days after he made them , german chancellor gerhard schröder 's comments that nato was no longer the " primary venue " for discussing global strategy offered a cue for every one to jump into an increasingly controversial debate . us president george w. bush saw in them a threat to sideline the security organization and told german television that he " looked forward to reminding gerhard schröder that nato is an active institution . " nato head jan hoop de schaeffer , while rejecting schröder 's call to set up a panel of experts to look at rehauling the organization , said it reflected efforts he has made in recent years to make nato more politically active . behind the semantics are very real questions about what shape the 26-nation institution will take as europe grows closer to forging a security and defense policy that could supplement some of nato 's tasks .
it is an issue on which parts of europe and the united states are still divided . france , for example , favors making the european union ever stronger in defense matters , part of a grander strategy of providing a counterweight to the united states in the world . us : no nato competition the united states , encouraging but at the same time wary of the european union 's military ambitions , is on edge when talk of changing the alliance comes up .
thierry balzacq at the center for european policy studies said the paranoia stems from plans belgium , france , germany and luxembourg drew up at a summit last year calling for a military planning council that washington saw as competition to nato .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato headquarters in brussels " every time one of these countries says something , even if they 're supporting nato , the other side will always come and say ' oh , they are trying to undermine nato 's policy ' , " he said . when he meets with president bush in mainz on wednesday , schröder will take care to distance himself from the french position without selling out completely on europe , said henning riecke , a transatlantic security expert .
a certain ambiguity " i think nato is very important for the germans , but they are n't able to issue this nato first principle the americans would like to hear , " said riecke , who works for the berlin-based council on foreign relations .
" so there has to be a certain ambiguity . " schröder himself left nothing to doubt when he defended his remarks two days after his defense minister read them out at the munich security conference on feb .
14 .
he lobbied again for an expert panel to look for ways to expand the organization 's involvement in policy discussions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's comments on nato prompted a curt reply from bush " i really believe that it contributes to a strengthening of nato and transatlantic relations if we speak more openly on political issues than we have tended to in the past , " he said .
providing troops - and strategic direction ? at issue is whether nato , an organization that provides the troops , weaponry and logistical support for peacekeeping missions from afghanistan to sarajevo , will have a greater say on how that weaponry and manpower gets used . since the attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , the organization has made great strides in increasing its military prowess , investing in technology and creating a rapid response force which is able to deploy anywhere in the world within a few days .
but differences between some nato allies - like france and the us - over the iraq war , kept the alliance from discussing ways to increase nato 's say in strategic planning , said riecke .
" what is lacking is a strategic understanding of what these troops should be used for , " he said . while nato improved its capabilites , the eu for the first time got serious about developing a military wing .
they pledged to develop a military response force simliar to nato 's and took over the organization 's policing mission in bosnia . no clear resolution some in washington worry that the steps taken both by nato and the european union are on a collision course .
in the best of both worlds , the nato would serve as the big stick to the european union 's well-intentioned diplomacy , say some observers . but nato , and its biggest member , america , will not always have the same interests in a crisis region as the european union . the europeans " might need -lrb- military -rrb- capabilities to keep the neighborhood in order , like in the balkans , " said riecke . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hand-over ceremony in skopje , as eu soldiers take over responsibility for peacekeeping in the country from the nato . no one expects any clear position to emerge from the nato discussions tuesday .
most analysts agree that bush 's visit will be a charm offensive designed to show european allies that the united states still cares .
but many do n't expect a more substantive indication on how their differences on nato will get resolved . the visits by condoleezza rice and bush are " clear signals that europe is being taken seriously as a strong partner , " said reicke .
we 'll have to see what the wrangling on the working level will turn out to be , how this might poison the picture a bit .

providing troops - and strategic direction ? at issue is whether nato , an organization that provides the troops , weaponry and logistical support for peacekeeping missions from afghanistan to sarajevo , will have a greater say on how that weaponry and manpower gets used . since the attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , the organization has made great strides in increasing its military prowess , investing in technology and creating a rapid response force which is able to deploy anywhere in the world within a few days .
but differences between some nato allies - like france and the us - over the iraq war , kept the alliance from discussing ways to increase nato 's say in strategic planning , said riecke .
" what is lacking is a strategic understanding of what these troops should be used for , " he said . while nato improved its capabilites , the eu for the first time got serious about developing a military wing .
they pledged to develop a military response force simliar to nato 's and took over the organization 's policing mission in bosnia . no clear resolution some in washington worry that the steps taken both by nato and the european union are on a collision course .
in the best of both worlds , the nato would serve as the big stick to the european union 's well-intentioned diplomacy , say some observers . but nato , and its biggest member , america , will not always have the same interests in a crisis region as the european union . the europeans " might need -lrb- military -rrb- capabilities to keep the neighborhood in order , like in the balkans , " said riecke . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hand-over ceremony in skopje , as eu soldiers take over responsibility for peacekeeping in the country from the nato . no one expects any clear position to emerge from the nato discussions tuesday .

bbc washington correspondent justin webb is travelling with the president .
here is his diary .
21 february odd couple was the president warmly received today ?
that was an issue at the post-speech briefing and it brought a wonderful response from a senior administration official who has spent time in europe .
europeans , he explained , do n't believe in audience participation at these events - it 's a cultural thing .
they really were having a good time .
lame excuse or reasonable point ?
an odd moment just before the big dinner this evening with mr bush and mr chirac .
the president appeared to have gone overboard with his new touchy-feely social worker persona - talking of himself and jacques " working together to help spread medicines necessary to cure illness " .
they would make an odd couple of nurses .
now the much-heralded meal is over - chirac and bush have broken bread .
it was all over by half past eight local time - more shopping mall fast food joint than french style feast .
i asked the white house briefer whether there was any chance of chirac and bush going off to a club afterwards .
no , he said .
and that was all .
this meeting mattered .
it was not a joking matter .
addressing europe president bush 's speech to eu and nato leaders was a solid performance - no vaulting rhetoric but no slips either and a properly presidential feel .
in fact it began with a very good joke about how lauded benjamin franklin was when he came to europe and how " surprised " the president was not to receive the same accolades .
there 's a new spring in the president 's step since his re-election .
he is no longer the slightly chippy defensive character he was in his first term .
he has been through fire and been proven .
even his political enemies in the us admit that .
-lrb- it 's worth noting that no democrat has won as large a percentage of the popular vote in a us poll since 1964 -rrb- .
one of those enemies - democratic senator joe biden - told me the other day that the europeans must " get over it " , learn to live with and work with this guy .
the assembled worthies applauded warmly enough at the end of the speech but ... was i alone in thinking the whole occasion was a touch flat and devoid of real warmth .
nobody from either side is reaching out and saying we were wrong , nobody is saying sorry .
first impressions to travel with the white house is to see the world in style .
even gloomy belgium is a pleasure to arrive in .
in the early morning drizzle , we sweep across to a corner of the airport - no passport control , no baggage pick-up .
at the bottom of the steps of the plane , a rather industrial-looking trolley has been placed , loaded with waffles and hot chocolate to soothe our entrance to the european union - and capture the hearts and minds of america 's opinion formers .
it works .
too well .
the buses are delayed while portly white house correspondents indulge in a binge on the local delicacies .
the place itself is little changed from when i lived here years ago .
the journey in from the airport - past the squat prefabricated-looking nato building , down through winding shuttered streets , past pallid early morning shoppers - is not exactly a grand entrance to the glories of europe .
washington dc it is n't .

bbc washington correspondent justin webb is travelling with the president .
here is his diary .
21 february odd couple was the president warmly received today ?
that was an issue at the post-speech briefing and it brought a wonderful response from a senior administration official who has spent time in europe .
europeans , he explained , do n't believe in audience participation at these events - it 's a cultural thing .
they really were having a good time .
lame excuse or reasonable point ?
an odd moment just before the big dinner this evening with mr bush and mr chirac .
the president appeared to have gone overboard with his new touchy-feely social worker persona - talking of himself and jacques " working together to help spread medicines necessary to cure illness " .
they would make an odd couple of nurses .
now the much-heralded meal is over - chirac and bush have broken bread .
it was all over by half past eight local time - more shopping mall fast food joint than french style feast .
i asked the white house briefer whether there was any chance of chirac and bush going off to a club afterwards .
no , he said .
and that was all .
this meeting mattered .
it was not a joking matter .
addressing europe president bush 's speech to eu and nato leaders was a solid performance - no vaulting rhetoric but no slips either and a properly presidential feel .
in fact it began with a very good joke about how lauded benjamin franklin was when he came to europe and how " surprised " the president was not to receive the same accolades .
there 's a new spring in the president 's step since his re-election .
he is no longer the slightly chippy defensive character he was in his first term .
he has been through fire and been proven .
even his political enemies in the us admit that .
-lrb- it 's worth noting that no democrat has won as large a percentage of the popular vote in a us poll since 1964 -rrb- .
one of those enemies - democratic senator joe biden - told me the other day that the europeans must " get over it " , learn to live with and work with this guy .
the assembled worthies applauded warmly enough at the end of the speech but ... was i alone in thinking the whole occasion was a touch flat and devoid of real warmth .
nobody from either side is reaching out and saying we were wrong , nobody is saying sorry .
first impressions to travel with the white house is to see the world in style .
even gloomy belgium is a pleasure to arrive in .
in the early morning drizzle , we sweep across to a corner of the airport - no passport control , no baggage pick-up .
at the bottom of the steps of the plane , a rather industrial-looking trolley has been placed , loaded with waffles and hot chocolate to soothe our entrance to the european union - and capture the hearts and minds of america 's opinion formers .
it works .
too well .
the buses are delayed while portly white house correspondents indulge in a binge on the local delicacies .
the place itself is little changed from when i lived here years ago .
the journey in from the airport - past the squat prefabricated-looking nato building , down through winding shuttered streets , past pallid early morning shoppers - is not exactly a grand entrance to the glories of europe .
washington dc it is n't .
but the president is not here to admire the view .
he means business and that business starts now ...

the documents have been made public by the national archives in kew , london .
documents released earlier this year showed harold wilson 's government almost scrapped plans for concorde in 1974 , because it would be too costly .
the project was continued by heath 's government so as not to risk antagonising the french president and jeopardising britain 's entry to the european economic community -lrb- eec -rrb- , according to a report of the documents in the independent .
according to the document , the french thought between 125 and 175 of the passenger jets would be made , and hoped other countries would snap them up .
' hopeless project ' but officials were concerned the uk , and france , would find it difficult to sell more than 10 concordes because of a lack of interest beyond the two national airlines .
twenty of the supersonic jets were eventually made .
mr heseltine backed the report written for advisory group the central policy review staff -lrb- cprs -rrb- , saying the idea was not economically viable and added that he thought it was a " hopeless project " .
but , said the cprs report , the french president georges pompidou has " personal commitment to the project " and the french were unlikely to let it go .

by alison freeman bbc news , london anyone who has been for a night out in london will know how difficult it can be to get home .
not long after midnight the tubes have stopped running and the chances of finding a black cab with its yellow " for hire " light on seem slim to none .
the warnings about illegal mini-cabs are constant , but they can seem an attractive option if getting a night bus home means a change in the centre of the capital .
so surely the latest proposals for a tube service which runs past 0100 gmt at the weekend should be welcomed ?
but , according to transport for london -lrb- tfl -rrb- the issue is not straightforward because the tube , as well as the revellers it has ferried home , will need a lie-in the following morning .
the reason , tfl says , is that maintenance work that would be carried out on a friday and saturday night must be still be done .
this would mean later start times of 0700 gmt on a saturday and 0830 gmt on a sunday .
unison , britain 's biggest trade union representing public service workers , says it could cause problems for a variety of essential staff .
a unison spokesperson said : " how is a hospital going to survive when you have people who need to get there early to get breakfast , to do the cleaning ? "
i find it hard to believe that in the 21st century working practices can not be improved so that we have engineering works five nights out of seven " transport writer and broadcaster christian wolmar " housing is expensive in london so naturally people tend to live further away from their place of work . "
he added : " it 's -lrb- later tube times -rrb- for people 's pleasure , and without being a killjoy about it , i think the workers have to be seen as more important . "
rufus barnes , director of the london transport users committee , says the schedule of maintenance work can not be shortened at this stage of the tube 's development .
" we do know that the underground has been short of money for decades and now that the money is going in through ppp -lrb- public private partnership -rrb- we are seeing more engineering work that 's needed to bring the tube up to standard .
" a lot of engineering work is long overdue -lsb- but -rsb- do we want to make sure the underground runs properly day to day or do we want to provide for the 21st century city that london is ?
" ideally we want to provide both but there has to be some order in the work to make up for years of underinvestment . "
transport writer and broadcaster christian wolmar does not agree .
he said : " i find it hard to believe that in the 21st century working practices can not be improved so that we have engineering works five nights out of seven .
" admittedly working in a tube tunnel is difficult but do we really need to close every line every night of the week ? "
mr barnes believes the mayor and tfl now need to decide whether clubbers or workers take priority on the tube .
" there are buses that run throughout the night and the service has expanded over the years but it 's possible it may need to expand even more , " he says .
" is the tube for service workers or clubbers or should we have more buses to meet the need ? "
tfl says these issues are why it is holding a public consultation on the proposal .

by alison freeman bbc news , london many early morning workers rely on the tube anyone who has been for a night out in london will know how difficult it can be to get home .
not long after midnight the tubes have stopped running and the chances of finding a black cab with its yellow " for hire " light on seem slim to none .
the warnings about illegal mini-cabs are constant , but they can seem an attractive option if getting a night bus home means a change in the centre of the capital .
so surely the latest proposals for a tube service which runs past 0100 gmt at the weekend should be welcomed ?
late-night tubes is getting home at night more important than going to work in the morning ?
in pictures but , according to transport for london -lrb- tfl -rrb- the issue is not straightforward because the tube , as well as the revellers it has ferried home , will need a lie-in the following morning .
the reason , tfl says , is that maintenance work that would be carried out on a friday and saturday night must be still be done .
this would mean later start times of 0700 gmt on a saturday and 0830 gmt on a sunday .
unison , britain 's biggest trade union representing public service workers , says it could cause problems for a variety of essential staff .
a unison spokesperson said : " how is a hospital going to survive when you have people who need to get there early to get breakfast , to do the cleaning ?
i find it hard to believe that in the 21st century working practices can not be improved so that we have engineering works five nights out of seven transport writer and broadcaster christian wolmar " housing is expensive in london so naturally people tend to live further away from their place of work . "
he added : " it 's -lrb- later tube times -rrb- for people 's pleasure , and without being a killjoy about it , i think the workers have to be seen as more important . "
rufus barnes , director of the london transport users committee , says the schedule of maintenance work can not be shortened at this stage of the tube 's development .
" we do know that the underground has been short of money for decades and now that the money is going in through ppp -lrb- public private partnership -rrb- we are seeing more engineering work that 's needed to bring the tube up to standard .
" a lot of engineering work is long overdue -lsb- but -rsb- do we want to make sure the underground runs properly day to day or do we want to provide for the 21st century city that london is ?
" ideally we want to provide both but there has to be some order in the work to make up for years of underinvestment . "
should buses take the strain in the hours the tubes is shut ?
transport writer and broadcaster christian wolmar does not agree .
he said : " i find it hard to believe that in the 21st century working practices can not be improved so that we have engineering works five nights out of seven .
" admittedly working in a tube tunnel is difficult but do we really need to close every line every night of the week ? "
mr barnes believes the mayor and tfl now need to decide whether clubbers or workers take priority on the tube .
" there are buses that run throughout the night and the service has expanded over the years but it 's possible it may need to expand even more , " he says .
" is the tube for service workers or clubbers or should we have more buses to meet the need ? "
tfl says these issues are why it is holding a public consultation on the proposal .

by alison freeman bbc news , london many early morning workers rely on the tube anyone who has been for a night out in london will know how difficult it can be to get home .
not long after midnight the tubes have stopped running and the chances of finding a black cab with its yellow " for hire " light on seem slim to none .
the warnings about illegal mini-cabs are constant , but they can seem an attractive option if getting a night bus home means a change in the centre of the capital .
so surely the latest proposals for a tube service which runs past 0100 gmt at the weekend should be welcomed ?
late-night tubes is getting home at night more important than going to work in the morning ?
in pictures but , according to transport for london -lrb- tfl -rrb- the issue is not straightforward because the tube , as well as the revellers it has ferried home , will need a lie-in the following morning .
the reason , tfl says , is that maintenance work that would be carried out on a friday and saturday night must be still be done .
this would mean later start times of 0700 gmt on a saturday and 0830 gmt on a sunday .
unison , britain 's biggest trade union representing public service workers , says it could cause problems for a variety of essential staff .
a unison spokesperson said : " how is a hospital going to survive when you have people who need to get there early to get breakfast , to do the cleaning ?
i find it hard to believe that in the 21st century working practices can not be improved so that we have engineering works five nights out of seven transport writer and broadcaster christian wolmar " housing is expensive in london so naturally people tend to live further away from their place of work . "
he added : " it 's -lrb- later tube times -rrb- for people 's pleasure , and without being a killjoy about it , i think the workers have to be seen as more important . "
rufus barnes , director of the london transport users committee , says the schedule of maintenance work can not be shortened at this stage of the tube 's development .
" we do know that the underground has been short of money for decades and now that the money is going in through ppp -lrb- public private partnership -rrb- we are seeing more engineering work that 's needed to bring the tube up to standard .
" a lot of engineering work is long overdue -lsb- but -rsb- do we want to make sure the underground runs properly day to day or do we want to provide for the 21st century city that london is ?
" ideally we want to provide both but there has to be some order in the work to make up for years of underinvestment . "
should buses take the strain in the hours the tubes is shut ?
transport writer and broadcaster christian wolmar does not agree .
he said : " i find it hard to believe that in the 21st century working practices can not be improved so that we have engineering works five nights out of seven .
" admittedly working in a tube tunnel is difficult but do we really need to close every line every night of the week ? "
mr barnes believes the mayor and tfl now need to decide whether clubbers or workers take priority on the tube .
" there are buses that run throughout the night and the service has expanded over the years but it 's possible it may need to expand even more , " he says .
" is the tube for service workers or clubbers or should we have more buses to meet the need ? "
tfl says these issues are why it is holding a public consultation on the proposal .

by alison freeman bbc news , london many early morning workers rely on the tube anyone who has been for a night out in london will know how difficult it can be to get home .
not long after midnight the tubes have stopped running and the chances of finding a black cab with its yellow " for hire " light on seem slim to none .
the warnings about illegal mini-cabs are constant , but they can seem an attractive option if getting a night bus home means a change in the centre of the capital .
so surely the latest proposals for a tube service which runs past 0100 gmt at the weekend should be welcomed ?
late-night tubes is getting home at night more important than going to work in the morning ?
in pictures but , according to transport for london -lrb- tfl -rrb- the issue is not straightforward because the tube , as well as the revellers it has ferried home , will need a lie-in the following morning .
the reason , tfl says , is that maintenance work that would be carried out on a friday and saturday night must be still be done .
this would mean later start times of 0700 gmt on a saturday and 0830 gmt on a sunday .
unison , britain 's biggest trade union representing public service workers , says it could cause problems for a variety of essential staff .
a unison spokesperson said : " how is a hospital going to survive when you have people who need to get there early to get breakfast , to do the cleaning ?
i find it hard to believe that in the 21st century working practices can not be improved so that we have engineering works five nights out of seven transport writer and broadcaster christian wolmar " housing is expensive in london so naturally people tend to live further away from their place of work . "
he added : " it 's -lrb- later tube times -rrb- for people 's pleasure , and without being a killjoy about it , i think the workers have to be seen as more important . "
rufus barnes , director of the london transport users committee , says the schedule of maintenance work can not be shortened at this stage of the tube 's development .
" we do know that the underground has been short of money for decades and now that the money is going in through ppp -lrb- public private partnership -rrb- we are seeing more engineering work that 's needed to bring the tube up to standard .
" a lot of engineering work is long overdue -lsb- but -rsb- do we want to make sure the underground runs properly day to day or do we want to provide for the 21st century city that london is ?
" ideally we want to provide both but there has to be some order in the work to make up for years of underinvestment . "
should buses take the strain in the hours the tubes is shut ?
transport writer and broadcaster christian wolmar does not agree .
he said : " i find it hard to believe that in the 21st century working practices can not be improved so that we have engineering works five nights out of seven .
" admittedly working in a tube tunnel is difficult but do we really need to close every line every night of the week ? "
mr barnes believes the mayor and tfl now need to decide whether clubbers or workers take priority on the tube .
" there are buses that run throughout the night and the service has expanded over the years but it 's possible it may need to expand even more , " he says .
" is the tube for service workers or clubbers or should we have more buses to meet the need ? "
tfl says these issues are why it is holding a public consultation on the proposal .

the discussion comes just months after a court ruling that a young raf serviceman was unlawfully killed through being exposed to sarin .
the wiltshire-based chemical warfare laboratories were used over many decades to develop weapons and britain 's defences against them .
ronald maddison from county durham died after exposure to sarin liquid in 1953 .
the official inquest at the time ruled death was by misadventure although the coroner ruled he died of asphyxia .
fifty years on , the maddison family is asking for an apology from the ministry of defence after the historic verdict by a wiltshire jury last november that mr maddison was unlawfully killed .
the hundreds of other servicemen who took part in similar nerve gas experiments are now demanding a fully independent public inquiry .
but the mod is seeking to overturn the coroner 's ruling .
on tuesday mps will debate the matter in the house of commons .

the aircraft , a twin-engined casa 212 , was coming into land near the town of sarmi when the pilot reported that one of the engines had failed .
the plane crashed 500 metres short of the runway , scattering wreckage along the shoreline .
the four crew members , all indonesian police officers , were among the dead .
the rest of the victims were civilian passengers , including local officials .
national police chief general da 'i bachtiar said a team had begun to investigate the accident .
planes are often the only means of transport in the dense jungles of papua , and bad weather and rough terrain can create hazardous flying conditions .
more than 50 people were killed in a total of four air accidents last year - three involving military aircraft .

he said the new soldiers would replace a departing contingent of dutch troops and protect japanese troops doing humanitarian work in southern iraq .
australia already has about 950 troops stationed in and around iraq .
prime minister john howard , a firm ally of us president george w bush , said he knew the surprise announcement would be unpopular with many australians .

the australian soldiers will help replace troops 1,400 dutch troops , who are being withdrawn after their government decided against renewing their mission .
shia nomination in iraq , the shia-dominated coalition that won the most votes in last month 's election is expected to meet on tuesday to name its nominee for prime minister , officials say .
the dawa party 's ibrahim jaafari is thought to be a favourite for the nomination - but he will face a challenge from ahmed chalabi , a former protege of the pentagon , whose relations with the us soured last year over claims he spied for iran .
the results of the nomination process , which was suspended to mark the shia festival of ashura , were not expected to be known until wednesday at the earliest , officials said .

" the japanese element of this is quite crucial because japan is a major regional partner of australia , " he said .
the leader of the green party in australia , bob brown , criticised the announcement , accusing mr howard of having misled voters during his re-election campaign last year .
" mr howard never told voters he would send more australians to iraq , " mr brown said .
the latest deployment will include a cavalry squadron , an infantry company and a team to train local forces and will be ready to leave for iraq in 10 weeks , mr howard said .
he said the two batches of troops would each be sent to iraq for six months , totalling a one-year deployment .
about 2,000 australian troops joined in the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq - a decision that sparked the biggest anti-war protests in the country since the vietnam war .

he said the new soldiers would replace a departing contingent of dutch troops and protect japanese troops doing humanitarian work in southern iraq .
australia already has about 950 troops stationed in and around iraq .
prime minister john howard , a firm ally of us president george w bush , said he knew the surprise announcement would be unpopular with many australians .
but , he said , australian help was needed to aid reconstruction and prevent insurgents from gaining the upper hand over democracy at a critical juncture in iraq 's history .
the australian soldiers will help replace troops 1,400 dutch troops , who are being withdrawn after their government decided against renewing their mission .
shia nomination in iraq , the shia-dominated coalition that won the most votes in last month 's election is expected to meet on tuesday to name its nominee for prime minister , officials say .
the dawa party 's ibrahim jaafari is thought to be a favourite for the nomination - but he will face a challenge from ahmed chalabi , a former protege of the pentagon , whose relations with the us soured last year over claims he spied for iran .
the results of the nomination process , which was suspended to mark the shia festival of ashura , were not expected to be known until wednesday at the earliest , officials said .
iraq 's interim prime minister , iyad allawi , whose party polled third in the elections , also announced on monday that he would try for the office of prime minister .
japan factor mr howard said his country will maintain troops in iraq as long as they are needed .
" i believe this is the right decision .
it will make a significant contribution to the coalition effort .
it will make a significant contribution to the rebuilding of iraq . "
he acknowledged it would be an unpopular decision with many at home but said he was responding to requests from prime minister junichiro koizumi of japan and the british forces operating in southern iraq .
" the japanese element of this is quite crucial because japan is a major regional partner of australia , " he said .
the leader of the green party in australia , bob brown , criticised the announcement , accusing mr howard of having misled voters during his re-election campaign last year .
