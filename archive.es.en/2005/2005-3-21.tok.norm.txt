" you have to be able to separate one from the other , " he told journalists while visiting kiev on monday . the investigation into whether or not relaxed visa criteria allowed organized crime , black market businesses and prostitution to flow into germany unchecked was an internal matter , fischer said , and one that he was prepared to deal with . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko appealed for closer eu ties during a recent speech at the german bundestag .

a former high-ranking german ambassador said on saturday that german authorities were not checking visa applications thoroughly enough . " it was clear that we were not examining the files enough and that many people were passing through the loopholes for unknown reasons , " ernst-jörg von studnitz , former ambassador to russia from 1995 to 2002 , told the german news agency dpa . " green ideology " fischer , whose standing as the most popular politician in germany has taken a hammering over the visa affair , did not pay enough attention to the visa policy , von studnitz charged . the former ambassador said fischer 's policy was " the attempt to put into practice the green ideology . " von studnitz said the ministry took too long to react to the abuse of the liberalized visa regulations introduced under fischer . " apparently , we just shut our eyes .
this happens often when ideological elements are slipped into political practice , " von studnitz told der spiegel weekly in an interviewed published on monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting outside the german consulate in kiev , december 2004 der spiegel also reported that the ministry acknowledged that the visa policy had led to illegal immigration in an internal memo dated july 2004 . fischer has acknowledged making mistakes but has refused to resign .

" germany , the eu 's biggest economy , has for the past three years violated the stability and growth pact 's rules that stipulate that no eurozone member 's public debt should exceed 3 percent of gross domestic product . at the same time , germany , the largest net contributor to the eu budget , has spent hundreds of billions of euros on reunification .
it is also the eu 's poorest performing economy , having narrowly escaped its third recession in four years and having an unemployment rate of 12.6 percent .

" germany , the eu 's biggest economy , has for the past three years violated the stability and growth pact 's rules that stipulate that no eurozone member 's public debt should exceed 3 percent of gross domestic product . at the same time , germany , the largest net contributor to the eu budget , has spent hundreds of billions of euros on reunification .
it is also the eu 's poorest performing economy , having narrowly escaped its third recession in four years and having an unemployment rate of 12.6 percent .
the agreement will allow germany to discount about 4 percent of its gdp when tallying its deficit . still , not all german officials were happy with the agreement . " we are leaving future generations with more debt and higher taxes , " cdu financial expert michael meister told german television channel ard .
" and this is not going to be good for employment creation . " strained credibility the 1997 budget pact was all but suspended in november 2003 when eu heavyweights france and germany were let off the hook despite repeatedly breaching a key requirement .
since then nearly half the eu 's 25 states have also triggered disciplinary measures under the pact , while the system 's already-strained credibility has also suffered after it emerged that greece had submitted wrong data for years .
until now an agreement had been kept at bay by deep divisions between countries wanting more flexibility , led by france and germany , and other , mostly smaller , nations such as austria and the netherlands wanting the principles of budgetary discipline to be upheld . now the eu is determined to renew the budget rules in a way that will not threaten economic recovery and will strike the right balance between budgetary rigor and fiscal flexibility . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an agreement looms eu leaders maintain that the pact 's two key rules - public deficits should not exceed 3 percent of gross domestic product and public debt should not surpass 60 percent of gdp - were not compromised .
they are " neither in question nor threatened " by the agreement , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , whose country holds the eu 's presidency , told afp .
" i am satisfied with the agreement , the fundamental rules ... have not been changed . " instead , the deal boosted measures aimed at preventing countries from overspending as well as reinforced the authority of eu 's executive commission to police the deficits , he said . the agreement also allows countries more time to rein in their deficits when they overshoot the three percent limit and it requires the european commission to take into account extraordinary circumstances when judging a member 's deficit . final approval is expected during the summit this week . not a free ride the european commission , which polices deficits , voiced satisfaction with the outcome of the talks with eu economic affairs commissioner joaquin almunia saying he had a " very positive view of the final result . " however , austrian finance minister karl-heinz grasser , who has led a campaign against watering down the pact , expressed muted satisfaction . " it is not the best solution i can imagine , but i am confident that it is a result that can guarantee stability-oriented fiscal policy in the european future , " he said .
" but it is not a free ride , it is not carte blanche for deficit spending .

3 , 2005 as scheduled .
the date had been put into some doubt after martin schulz , a social democratic representative in the european parliament , had questioned whether enough progress had been made in turkey for negotiations to begin later this year .
schulz told the berliner zeitung newspaper that turkey still needed to enact further reforms and recognize cyprus before accession talks could begin .
but schröder defended the oct .
3 date , saying he was confident that ankara would meet all of the eu 's requirements by then .
karamanlis said that athens considers it imperative that turkey sign a protocol expanding the eu customs union to 10 new member states , including cyprus .
ankara had given assurances earlier this month that it would do so .
turkey has been an associate member of the eu since 1963 and an official candidate since 1999 . dw-world.de eu scolds turkey over police clampdown the highest-level visit to turkey by eu leaders since ankara was given the go-ahead for accession talks began with european officials condemning police violence against women protestors in istanbul .

some 50 organisations marched under the slogan of " all colours but brown , " in reference to the nazi brown shirts , as the neo-nazi national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- marked the march 16 , 1945 bombardment of this small bavarian town by allied forces during world war ii .
no incidents were reported .
" the npd slogan of ' never forgive , never forget ' is ridiculous , " said josef schuster , a member of the local jewish community .
" we will never forget what was done in germany and around europe by the criminals they are honouring , " he added .
the marches followed new legislation passed by the german upper house of parliament friday to curb neo-nazi marches amid concerns the extreme-right will target celebrations to mark the end of the war in europe .
the far right , led by the npd , is planning to march past the new holocaust memorial in berlin and to the brandenburg gate on may 8 , the 60th anniversary of germany 's capitulation .
last month , 4,000 right-wing extremists rallied in dresden on the 60th anniversary of the allied bombing that devastated the city . dw-world.de germany moves to curb neo-nazi protests germany 's lower house of parliament friday voted by a large majority to tighten the right of assembly , thus making it easier in future to ban neo-nazi demonstrations at historic landmarks .

france is the world 's largest manufacturer of luxury goods ; 250,000 people are employed by the sector .
but 38,000 jobs are lost every year due to counterfeiting .
designer brands spend millions annually fighting fakes . fshion labels like hermès , chanel and louis vuitton may have made france the world leader when it comes to luxury products . but , the country is also the global loser from illegal competition from fakes .
in france , according to the customs service , the counterfeit business is booming . at a freight depot at orly airport , just outside of paris , a customs officer slits open a box of socks as he settles in to another day 's work protecting the biggest luxury industry in the world .
last year , he and his colleagues found and destroyed some three million fakes , double what they had taken in the previous year .
in one seizure in january , they found enough louis vuitton fabric to cover 54 tennis courts . " there are hundreds of millions of fake products out there , " said marc-antoine jamet , secretary-general of louis vuitton 's parent company , lvmh .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 21.03.2005 germany leads pack of pact assassins großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the germans consider the pact their own frankenstein 's monster germany , one of the main architects of the eu 's stability and growth pact , heads a list of potential assassins who want to kill off the bloc 's tattered fiscal rules . in a remarkable twist of irony as eu ministers prepare to gather in brussels this week to talk about reform of the stability and growth pact , the main architect germany is a leading voice in calls for the tattered fiscal rules to be taken apart . shackled by low growth and crippling high unemployment , the euro zone 's biggest but worst-performing economy has effectively found itself caught in a trap of its own making . originally designed in 1997 by then german finance minister theo waigel to prevent spendthrift economies from hitching a free ride on the coat-tails of standard-bearers of financial rigor such as germany , the pact stipulates that no euro zone country is allowed to let public finances run too deeply into the red . the pact sets a limit on each country 's public deficit of 3.0 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , while overall debt is not allowed to exceed 60 percent of gdp .
countries are expected to head for public surpluses in times of growth .
breaches of the limits are to be punished with stiff financial penalties . reality shows a long list of repeat offenders so much for the theory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder : " you pay . "
chirac : " no , you pay . "
in reality , nearly half the eu 's 25 members have since run up so-called excessive deficits , with france and germany topping the list of offenders . indeed , the euro zone heavyweights ' deficit ratios have been well above the 3.0-percent limit for the past three years and there is every indication that , with growth expected to remain sluggish at best , they will break the rules again this year . while smaller euro zone countries have swallowed the pact 's bitter medicine and managed to get their finances in order , laggards france and germany have long campaigned for a softening of the rules . they want special mitigating factors to be taken into account when evaluating the state of a country 's public finances , with germany particularly vocal in arguing that the astronomic costs of unification and its massive net contribution to the eu budget form part of the equation . generous germany on the ropes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel indicates the deficit to the german bundestag .
germany has ploughed hundreds of billions of euros into unification and is the biggest net contributor to the eu budget .
but the euro zone 's biggest economy also narrowly escaped its third recession in four years at the end of last year and unemployment in germany currently stands at a post-war high of 5.2 million or 12.6 percent of the population . and even current finance minister hans eichel , who originally presented himself as an iron-fisted and merciless cutter of costs and public-spending , now argues that tightening germany 's purse strings will only make matters worse .
it seems to be germany 's intransigence that is the main hurdle to eu-wide agreement being reached on a reform of the pact , analysts said . " the sticking point seems to be germany 's insistence that some allowance should be made for unification costs and the net contribution to the eu budget , " said dresdner kleinwort wasserstein economist anthony thomas in an interview with afp .
" although the german government is unlikely to be permitted such clear allowances , the question is whether finance ministers or government chiefs will be able to come up with appropriate wording to satisfy all parties , " thomas said . there was no sign friday of the stalemate being broken .
in fact , both sides appeared to be digging their heels in . pact struggles divide the european union bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder finds himself in the opposite camp to austrian counterpart and pact supporter wolfgang schüssel .
austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel insisted that the stability pact should be applied to the letter , while five big member states - namely germany , france , italy , spain and britain - had reportedly reached tacit agreement to block what they deemed to be an all too mechanistic or rigid implementation of the rules . addressing a press conference in schüssel 's home city of vienna on friday , german chancellor gerhard schroeder said berlin was not pushing for a modification of the pact " but an interpretation that makes economic sense " . " we want an interpretation that takes into account both stability and growth , " the german leader added . optimism remains despite sharpened knives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker .
luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , downplayed the lack of progress .
" if we do n't reach an agreement on sunday it will not be a catastrophe .
it will not prevent us finding an accord at the summit . " as things stand , it looks as if a general list will simply be drawn up of factors justifying an excessive deficit .
and " the danger is that the list could be so vague that it could be used to justify any overrun , " thomas said . in the end , the choice facing eu leaders would be to hold on to a stability pact that effectively remains suspended in its current form " or to reform it so that it is virtually toothless " , the economist said .
" so it wo n't really matter whether agreement is reached or not , at least for the moment , " thomas concluded . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu moves to renew battered fiscal rules the eu hopes to hammer out the main points of a revised budget rule book this week , 16 months after the pact meant to protect the euro was left in tatters by eu heavyweight states bent on reviving their ailing economies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.03.2005 -pipe- 16:00 utc schröder : no delay in turkey eu talks german chancellor gerhard schröder told greek prime minister kostas karamanlis , who was in berlin on monday , that eu membership negotiations with turkey would begin on oct .
3 , 2005 as scheduled .
the date had been put into some doubt after martin schulz , a social democratic representative in the european parliament , had questioned whether enough progress had been made in turkey for negotiations to begin later this year .
schulz told the berliner zeitung newspaper that turkey still needed to enact further reforms and recognize cyprus before accession talks could begin .
but schröder defended the oct .

the share prices fell to 52.63 euros -lrb- $ 69.38 -rrb- after the company said that it would seek approval in the united states for the treatment , called ptk / zk , at the beginning of 2007 .
until now it had counted on obtaining approval this year .
the company said that clinical trials , now in stage three of the development process , were not satisfactory .
the announcement means that the launch of the treatment has been delayed until 2008 at the earliest .
the company had expected to market the drug in 2006 .
brokerage house equinet commented that even if the treatment were marketed in 2008 , it might have difficulty in winning substantial market share because competing products would have gained a lead . dw-world.de schering posts record profit in 2004 german pharmaceuticals specialist schering , a world leader in fertility drugs , said wednesday that it booked a record net profit of € 503 million -lrb- $ 644 million -rrb- in 2004 , thanks to the strong performance of its gynecology division and to cost-cutting efforts .

there are also plans by the un to start final negotiations on the status of kosovo this summer - a decision struck said was needed as soon as possible . " we can only help our troops make sense of their mission as long as there is political progress , " the german defense minister said .
over the long term , military engagement in kosovo would be hard to justify if serbian enclaves were protected without any will on the part of serbs and ethnic albanians in kosovo to live together in peace , he added . possible reduction in bosnia in bosnia , where struck will meet with political leaders on tuesday , the situation is much more stable .
that has already led to calls for a substantial reduction in the number of foreign troops stationed there . the eu took over the bosnian mission from nato in december last year .
it has maintained troop levels at around 7,000 in what is the eu ’ s largest such operation to date .
but eu officials are reviewing whether troop numbers can be reduced to around 5,000 . the leaders of the eu force , which also includes troops from non-eu countries , describe conditions as peaceful .

france is the world 's largest manufacturer of luxury goods ; 250,000 people are employed by the sector .
but 38,000 jobs are lost every year due to counterfeiting .
designer brands spend millions annually fighting fakes . fshion labels like hermès , chanel and louis vuitton may have made france the world leader when it comes to luxury products . but , the country is also the global loser from illegal competition from fakes .
in france , according to the customs service , the counterfeit business is booming . at a freight depot at orly airport , just outside of paris , a customs officer slits open a box of socks as he settles in to another day 's work protecting the biggest luxury industry in the world .
last year , he and his colleagues found and destroyed some three million fakes , double what they had taken in the previous year .
in one seizure in january , they found enough louis vuitton fabric to cover 54 tennis courts . " there are hundreds of millions of fake products out there , " said marc-antoine jamet , secretary-general of louis vuitton 's parent company , lvmh .
he said counterfeiting has become a colossal world industry representing more than five percent of all world trade . " look what companies spend fighting fakes : three million euros a year for lacoste , 15 million for vuitton , " he said .
" this is a problem on an industrial scale . " everyday people although organized crime plays a role in the matter , normally law-abiding people are also part of the problem .
people on holiday , for example , who see good copies which look like amazing bargains that ca n't be passed up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at orly airport , people returning from holidays abroad are greeted with posters of the lacoste crocodile and a chanel handbag warning them that bringing fakes into france is a criminal offense . " we 've been to turkey several times on holiday with the children and , i can tell you , when you 're with teenagers and you see designer labels for a fifth of what you 'd pay back home , it 's tempting , " said one woman returning for vacation who did n't want to give her name . she said during the summers , she would get a new wardrobe for her kids with fake goods , mostly jeans , t-shirts and sweatshirts , always with a little designer logo and never in any doubt that she was buying fakes . " for me , there 's a bit of getting our own back on companies who , as soon as they get a brand that sells well , charge astronomical prices , " she said . but her purchasing patterns could be risky .
people who are discovered bringing in fake goods can get hefty fines .
generally if there are one or two fake goods , people are let off .
but with higher quantities , people can pay fines that are more than double what the goods are actually worth . the shame of it all for some , though , buying or wearing counterfeit goods is , well , simply l 'horreur . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fake chanel watch " i 'm used to seeing all these fake vuitton or prada bags in asia , " said marion dufour , a fashion editor at the women 's magazine group marie-claire international . " i imagine myself wearing it and arriving at a famous fashion party with all of these beautiful people and all of a sudden a pr or a fashion editor will arrive and she will discover and find out that it is a fake one .
and i think i would really feel shame ! " but the big names of the luxury industry along paris ' avenue montaigne want counterfeiters to feel more than shame .
in the sixteenth century , people would get their hand cut off for making a fake .
today they might have to pay nearly $ 500,000 -lrb- 375,800 euros -rrb- : the maximum fine was doubled last year .
that high amount shows that for france there 's much at stake - not just money , but the image of the country itself . john laurenson -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lagerfeld has world domination all sewn-up a hard-to-miss presence at the paris ready-to-wear week , karl lagerfeld hit the headlines with his hemlines , presenting his new pret-a-porter collection .

but with three weeks left and little progress to date , mutual recriminations have begun . the dispute flared up again on friday when us negotiator robert zoellick decided to step up the pressure after meeting with his european counterpart , eu trade commissioner peter mandelson .
zoellick 's spokesman said " the europeans are clearly unwilling to eliminate the subsidies , " and said if necessary the united states was ready to return to litigation at the wto . this triggered a warning saturday from brussels that it would also make claims against washington .
" if the us decides to move to the wto approach , which we hope they will not , obviously we would launch our own counter-case , " said a european commission official who spoke to afp on condition of anonymity . complaints traded across the atlantic the united states lodged a complaint against eu subsidies to france-based airbus with the wto in october , which brought a counteraction from brussels against what it termed indirect us government aid for chicago-based boeing . but the agreement in january to try to resolve the dispute by renegotiating a 1992 bilateral accord that set the terms of assistance to aircraft makers effectively froze the wto procedure , which eu officials had said would have been a " disastrous " legal clash .
the two sides agreed to freeze subsidies while they negotiate the new agreement . washington tones down fighting talk washington on saturday dropped the saber rattling , and said it was ready to extend the deadline for reaching an agreement .
" we are very willing to continue talking , using the january 11 agreement as the basis - and we are willing to extend the terms of the january agreement , " us trade representative spokesman richard mills told afp . but " the problem is that over the last two months the eu has been focused more on maneuvering than on negotiating the core substance , " mills said by telephone from washington .

" we have n't changed positions or made specific demands , " said the eu official , adding that " we 've indicated we want pertinent questions added " to the discussions . the eu believes that no comprehensive deal can be reached by april 11 given the complexities of the issues .
instead it has proposed cutting the negotiations into two and reaching by the deadline next month " a more modest package that creates confidence " to reach a comprehensive deal at a later date . but if the eu is ready to put on the table the launch aid for airbus aircraft it expects " an equivalent contribution " from the united states , said the official . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus , boeing dispute could become us-eu problem a massive dispute is brewing between airbus and its archrival , chicago-based boeing .

zoellick 's spokesman said " the europeans are clearly unwilling to eliminate the subsidies , " and said if necessary the united states was ready to return to litigation at the wto . this triggered a warning saturday from brussels that it would also make claims against washington .
" if the us decides to move to the wto approach , which we hope they will not , obviously we would launch our own counter-case , " said a european commission official who spoke to afp on condition of anonymity . complaints traded across the atlantic the united states lodged a complaint against eu subsidies to france-based airbus with the wto in october , which brought a counteraction from brussels against what it termed indirect us government aid for chicago-based boeing . but the agreement in january to try to resolve the dispute by renegotiating a 1992 bilateral accord that set the terms of assistance to aircraft makers effectively froze the wto procedure , which eu officials had said would have been a " disastrous " legal clash .
the two sides agreed to freeze subsidies while they negotiate the new agreement . washington tones down fighting talk washington on saturday dropped the saber rattling , and said it was ready to extend the deadline for reaching an agreement .
" we are very willing to continue talking , using the january 11 agreement as the basis - and we are willing to extend the terms of the january agreement , " us trade representative spokesman richard mills told afp . but " the problem is that over the last two months the eu has been focused more on maneuvering than on negotiating the core substance , " mills said by telephone from washington .
" as far as we are concerned , we 're ready to continue the negotiations , " the eu official said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the boeing dreamliner .
however , should no agreement be reached , " nothing would prevent the eu governments to put up the launch aid for the a350 , " the eu official warned , referring to the long-haul jet which would rival boeing 's 787 " dreamliner " . europe wants " pertinent " questions answered part of the difficulties in the negotiations is that the europeans are trying to reach agreements on two issues that were not included as part of the january agreement : japanese aid for development of boeing 's 787 and the foreign sales corporations -lrb- fscs -rrb- that us companies use to lower their taxes . " we have n't changed positions or made specific demands , " said the eu official , adding that " we 've indicated we want pertinent questions added " to the discussions . the eu believes that no comprehensive deal can be reached by april 11 given the complexities of the issues .
instead it has proposed cutting the negotiations into two and reaching by the deadline next month " a more modest package that creates confidence " to reach a comprehensive deal at a later date . but if the eu is ready to put on the table the launch aid for airbus aircraft it expects " an equivalent contribution " from the united states , said the official . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus , boeing dispute could become us-eu problem a massive dispute is brewing between airbus and its archrival , chicago-based boeing .

it is also the eu 's poorest performing economy , having narrowly escaped its third recession in four years and having an unemployment rate of 12.6 percent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 21.03.2005 mixed reactions to stability pact rewrite großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro just got a little less stable , say critics of the change in the wake of sunday 's decision to loosen the rules of the stability and growth pact which underpins the euro , opposition voices in germany are crying foul .
but some economists say more flexibility was needed . germany was one of the prime architects of the stability pact , worried that the profligate ways of smaller eu members would weaken the common currency 's strength .
germany was , at the time of the pact 's adoption , about to leave behind its beloved deutschmark , which had been a steady , stable friend of the country for decades . but over the past months , germany , along with france and italy , has been at the forefront of the drive to water down the pact . on sunday , its efforts bore fruit , and eu ministers agreed on a plan that includes giving germany special treatment because of the high costs of reunification , which germany has said is largely to blame for its inability over the past three years to keep its deficit under the three-percent mark required by the original stability pact . germany has breached the stability pact rules for the last three years and looks on its way to doing it again . there 's a definite sense of satisfaction coming from german finance minister hans eichel , who said the reworked pact is " more rational economically -lsb- and -rsb- more growth friendly , " since it takes into consideration the country 's economic growth and phases of stagnation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eating away at the euro ?
but germany 's opposition is calling the compromise set forth by the 25 eu ministers nothing short of disastrous . " we 've all received a clear signal that the euro will not be as strong as the former deutschmark , " said michael meister , finance spokesman for the conservative christian democrats .
" what 's worse , confidence and trust in the reliability of the european union is being destroyed on a massive scale only because a few countries – germany included – are not willing to display budgetary discipline . ” a " sin " theo waigel , finance minister under former chancellor helmut kohl and member of the bavarian-based christian social union , called the loosening of the pact a " sin against our children " who he said will be left to shoulder the debt of their parents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former finance minister theo waigel , left , with his boss , former chancellor helmut kohl .
waigel , who was finance minister when the stability and growth pact was adopted in 1997 , said the government then had purposefully left out considerations of the cost of reunification in drawing up the agreement . " because then we knew we 'd have every country citing their own special problems , " he said , adding that germany had now abandoned its position as a leading advocate of euro stability in europe . there was criticism on the european level as well .
othmar karas , an austrian who represents the european people 's party in strasburg , said it was a grave mistake to bow to the german government 's demand for special treatment over reunification .
he called the reunification justification for changing the pact 's rules just an excuse , since the financial burden of german reunification started far before the year 2000 , when germany exceeded deficit limits for the first time . " no , it started 15 years ago , and for most of the time germany had enough discipline not to let the financial situation get out of control despite the additional burden , " he said .
" in other words , there ’ s no justification whatsoever to insist on special treatment now . ” a few voices in favor despite the reproaches of opposition politicians and other experts , some german economists have a more sanguine outlook regarding the relaxation of the pact .
most currency analysts said they did not fear a substantial weakening of the euro because of the new rules . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : balloon euro .
will it deflate soon ?
manfred kurz of the bavarian state bank said adding more flexibility to the stability agreement could give countries like germany more room to develop growth-oriented economic policies . the president of the halle institute for economic research , ulrich blum , told the reuters news agency that taking the particular economic difficulties of a country into consideration is not bad policy .
" after all , we are shouldering the entire weight of german reunification , " he said . german spends four percent of its gross domestic product on transfers to the former communist eastern part of the country .
the government estimates it has transferred 1.5 trillion euros -lrb- $ 2 trillion -rrb- since the berlin wall fell 15 years ago . finance minister hans eichel said german reunification was a " unique problem " that needed to be adequately addressed .
he said the agreement did not mean german was abandoning the goal of keeping its deficit under three percent of gdp . " of course i want to stick to it , " he said . boost for schröder the move by the eu 's finance ministers has given chancellor gerhard schröder an economic and political boost at a time when he badly needs it .
the government in berlin is struggling to overcome years of economic stagnation and an unemployment rate that has reached 12.6 percent , a rate not seen since the 1930s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder , left , with french president jacques chirac , another advocate of changing the euro rules .
the pact decision will lessen the likelihood that germany will face punitive action from brussels for not keeping its deficit down .
the change could inspire hope that the government will have room to spend and perhaps bring the unemployment rate down below the psychologically important number of five million . schröder 's party , the social democrats , is facing an important state election on may 22 in its traditional stronghold of north rhine-westphalia .
it is currently trailing the opposition in opinion polls .

but some economists say more flexibility was needed . germany was one of the prime architects of the stability pact , worried that the profligate ways of smaller eu members would weaken the common currency 's strength .
germany was , at the time of the pact 's adoption , about to leave behind its beloved deutschmark , which had been a steady , stable friend of the country for decades . but over the past months , germany , along with france and italy , has been at the forefront of the drive to water down the pact . on sunday , its efforts bore fruit , and eu ministers agreed on a plan that includes giving germany special treatment because of the high costs of reunification , which germany has said is largely to blame for its inability over the past three years to keep its deficit under the three-percent mark required by the original stability pact . germany has breached the stability pact rules for the last three years and looks on its way to doing it again . there 's a definite sense of satisfaction coming from german finance minister hans eichel , who said the reworked pact is " more rational economically -lsb- and -rsb- more growth friendly , " since it takes into consideration the country 's economic growth and phases of stagnation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eating away at the euro ?
but germany 's opposition is calling the compromise set forth by the 25 eu ministers nothing short of disastrous . " we 've all received a clear signal that the euro will not be as strong as the former deutschmark , " said michael meister , finance spokesman for the conservative christian democrats .
" what 's worse , confidence and trust in the reliability of the european union is being destroyed on a massive scale only because a few countries – germany included – are not willing to display budgetary discipline . ” a " sin " theo waigel , finance minister under former chancellor helmut kohl and member of the bavarian-based christian social union , called the loosening of the pact a " sin against our children " who he said will be left to shoulder the debt of their parents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former finance minister theo waigel , left , with his boss , former chancellor helmut kohl .
waigel , who was finance minister when the stability and growth pact was adopted in 1997 , said the government then had purposefully left out considerations of the cost of reunification in drawing up the agreement . " because then we knew we 'd have every country citing their own special problems , " he said , adding that germany had now abandoned its position as a leading advocate of euro stability in europe . there was criticism on the european level as well .
othmar karas , an austrian who represents the european people 's party in strasburg , said it was a grave mistake to bow to the german government 's demand for special treatment over reunification .
he called the reunification justification for changing the pact 's rules just an excuse , since the financial burden of german reunification started far before the year 2000 , when germany exceeded deficit limits for the first time . " no , it started 15 years ago , and for most of the time germany had enough discipline not to let the financial situation get out of control despite the additional burden , " he said .
" in other words , there ’ s no justification whatsoever to insist on special treatment now . ” a few voices in favor despite the reproaches of opposition politicians and other experts , some german economists have a more sanguine outlook regarding the relaxation of the pact .

" after all , we are shouldering the entire weight of german reunification , " he said . german spends four percent of its gross domestic product on transfers to the former communist eastern part of the country .
the government estimates it has transferred 1.5 trillion euros -lrb- $ 2 trillion -rrb- since the berlin wall fell 15 years ago . finance minister hans eichel said german reunification was a " unique problem " that needed to be adequately addressed .
he said the agreement did not mean german was abandoning the goal of keeping its deficit under three percent of gdp . " of course i want to stick to it , " he said . boost for schröder the move by the eu 's finance ministers has given chancellor gerhard schröder an economic and political boost at a time when he badly needs it .

but some economists say more flexibility was needed . germany was one of the prime architects of the stability pact , worried that the profligate ways of smaller eu members would weaken the common currency 's strength .
germany was , at the time of the pact 's adoption , about to leave behind its beloved deutschmark , which had been a steady , stable friend of the country for decades . but over the past months , germany , along with france and italy , has been at the forefront of the drive to water down the pact . on sunday , its efforts bore fruit , and eu ministers agreed on a plan that includes giving germany special treatment because of the high costs of reunification , which germany has said is largely to blame for its inability over the past three years to keep its deficit under the three-percent mark required by the original stability pact . germany has breached the stability pact rules for the last three years and looks on its way to doing it again . there 's a definite sense of satisfaction coming from german finance minister hans eichel , who said the reworked pact is " more rational economically -lsb- and -rsb- more growth friendly , " since it takes into consideration the country 's economic growth and phases of stagnation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eating away at the euro ?
but germany 's opposition is calling the compromise set forth by the 25 eu ministers nothing short of disastrous . " we 've all received a clear signal that the euro will not be as strong as the former deutschmark , " said michael meister , finance spokesman for the conservative christian democrats .

waigel , who was finance minister when the stability and growth pact was adopted in 1997 , said the government then had purposefully left out considerations of the cost of reunification in drawing up the agreement . " because then we knew we 'd have every country citing their own special problems , " he said , adding that germany had now abandoned its position as a leading advocate of euro stability in europe . there was criticism on the european level as well .
othmar karas , an austrian who represents the european people 's party in strasburg , said it was a grave mistake to bow to the german government 's demand for special treatment over reunification .
he called the reunification justification for changing the pact 's rules just an excuse , since the financial burden of german reunification started far before the year 2000 , when germany exceeded deficit limits for the first time . " no , it started 15 years ago , and for most of the time germany had enough discipline not to let the financial situation get out of control despite the additional burden , " he said .
" in other words , there ’ s no justification whatsoever to insist on special treatment now . ” a few voices in favor despite the reproaches of opposition politicians and other experts , some german economists have a more sanguine outlook regarding the relaxation of the pact .

a former high-ranking german ambassador said on saturday that german authorities were not checking visa applications thoroughly enough . " it was clear that we were not examining the files enough and that many people were passing through the loopholes for unknown reasons , " ernst-jörg von studnitz , former ambassador to russia from 1995 to 2002 , told the german news agency dpa . " green ideology " fischer , whose standing as the most popular politician in germany has taken a hammering over the visa affair , did not pay enough attention to the visa policy , von studnitz charged . the former ambassador said fischer 's policy was " the attempt to put into practice the green ideology . " von studnitz said the ministry took too long to react to the abuse of the liberalized visa regulations introduced under fischer . " apparently , we just shut our eyes .
this happens often when ideological elements are slipped into political practice , " von studnitz told der spiegel weekly in an interviewed published on monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting outside the german consulate in kiev , december 2004 der spiegel also reported that the ministry acknowledged that the visa policy had led to illegal immigration in an internal memo dated july 2004 . fischer has acknowledged making mistakes but has refused to resign .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 21.03.2005 mixed reactions to stability pact rewrite großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro just got a little less stable , say critics of the change in the wake of sunday 's decision to loosen the rules of the stability and growth pact which underpins the euro , opposition voices in germany are crying foul .
but some economists say more flexibility was needed . germany was one of the prime architects of the stability pact , worried that the profligate ways of smaller eu members would weaken the common currency 's strength .
germany was , at the time of the pact 's adoption , about to leave behind its beloved deutschmark , which had been a steady , stable friend of the country for decades . but over the past months , germany , along with france and italy , has been at the forefront of the drive to water down the pact . on sunday , its efforts bore fruit , and eu ministers agreed on a plan that includes giving germany special treatment because of the high costs of reunification , which germany has said is largely to blame for its inability over the past three years to keep its deficit under the three-percent mark required by the original stability pact . germany has breached the stability pact rules for the last three years and looks on its way to doing it again . there 's a definite sense of satisfaction coming from german finance minister hans eichel , who said the reworked pact is " more rational economically -lsb- and -rsb- more growth friendly , " since it takes into consideration the country 's economic growth and phases of stagnation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eating away at the euro ?
but germany 's opposition is calling the compromise set forth by the 25 eu ministers nothing short of disastrous . " we 've all received a clear signal that the euro will not be as strong as the former deutschmark , " said michael meister , finance spokesman for the conservative christian democrats .
" what 's worse , confidence and trust in the reliability of the european union is being destroyed on a massive scale only because a few countries – germany included – are not willing to display budgetary discipline . ” a " sin " theo waigel , finance minister under former chancellor helmut kohl and member of the bavarian-based christian social union , called the loosening of the pact a " sin against our children " who he said will be left to shoulder the debt of their parents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former finance minister theo waigel , left , with his boss , former chancellor helmut kohl .
waigel , who was finance minister when the stability and growth pact was adopted in 1997 , said the government then had purposefully left out considerations of the cost of reunification in drawing up the agreement . " because then we knew we 'd have every country citing their own special problems , " he said , adding that germany had now abandoned its position as a leading advocate of euro stability in europe . there was criticism on the european level as well .
othmar karas , an austrian who represents the european people 's party in strasburg , said it was a grave mistake to bow to the german government 's demand for special treatment over reunification .
he called the reunification justification for changing the pact 's rules just an excuse , since the financial burden of german reunification started far before the year 2000 , when germany exceeded deficit limits for the first time . " no , it started 15 years ago , and for most of the time germany had enough discipline not to let the financial situation get out of control despite the additional burden , " he said .
" in other words , there ’ s no justification whatsoever to insist on special treatment now . ” a few voices in favor despite the reproaches of opposition politicians and other experts , some german economists have a more sanguine outlook regarding the relaxation of the pact .
most currency analysts said they did not fear a substantial weakening of the euro because of the new rules . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : balloon euro .
will it deflate soon ?
manfred kurz of the bavarian state bank said adding more flexibility to the stability agreement could give countries like germany more room to develop growth-oriented economic policies . the president of the halle institute for economic research , ulrich blum , told the reuters news agency that taking the particular economic difficulties of a country into consideration is not bad policy .
" after all , we are shouldering the entire weight of german reunification , " he said . german spends four percent of its gross domestic product on transfers to the former communist eastern part of the country .
the government estimates it has transferred 1.5 trillion euros -lrb- $ 2 trillion -rrb- since the berlin wall fell 15 years ago . finance minister hans eichel said german reunification was a " unique problem " that needed to be adequately addressed .
he said the agreement did not mean german was abandoning the goal of keeping its deficit under three percent of gdp . " of course i want to stick to it , " he said . boost for schröder the move by the eu 's finance ministers has given chancellor gerhard schröder an economic and political boost at a time when he badly needs it .
the government in berlin is struggling to overcome years of economic stagnation and an unemployment rate that has reached 12.6 percent , a rate not seen since the 1930s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder , left , with french president jacques chirac , another advocate of changing the euro rules .

" you have to be able to separate one from the other , " he told journalists while visiting kiev on monday . the investigation into whether or not relaxed visa criteria allowed organized crime , black market businesses and prostitution to flow into germany unchecked was an internal matter , fischer said , and one that he was prepared to deal with . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko appealed for closer eu ties during a recent speech at the german bundestag .

a former high-ranking german ambassador said on saturday that german authorities were not checking visa applications thoroughly enough . " it was clear that we were not examining the files enough and that many people were passing through the loopholes for unknown reasons , " ernst-jörg von studnitz , former ambassador to russia from 1995 to 2002 , told the german news agency dpa . " green ideology " fischer , whose standing as the most popular politician in germany has taken a hammering over the visa affair , did not pay enough attention to the visa policy , von studnitz charged . the former ambassador said fischer 's policy was " the attempt to put into practice the green ideology . " von studnitz said the ministry took too long to react to the abuse of the liberalized visa regulations introduced under fischer . " apparently , we just shut our eyes .
this happens often when ideological elements are slipped into political practice , " von studnitz told der spiegel weekly in an interviewed published on monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting outside the german consulate in kiev , december 2004 der spiegel also reported that the ministry acknowledged that the visa policy had led to illegal immigration in an internal memo dated july 2004 . fischer has acknowledged making mistakes but has refused to resign .

countries are expected to head for public surpluses in times of growth .
breaches of the limits are to be punished with stiff financial penalties . reality shows a long list of repeat offenders so much for the theory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder : " you pay . "
chirac : " no , you pay . "
in reality , nearly half the eu 's 25 members have since run up so-called excessive deficits , with france and germany topping the list of offenders . indeed , the euro zone heavyweights ' deficit ratios have been well above the 3.0-percent limit for the past three years and there is every indication that , with growth expected to remain sluggish at best , they will break the rules again this year . while smaller euro zone countries have swallowed the pact 's bitter medicine and managed to get their finances in order , laggards france and germany have long campaigned for a softening of the rules . they want special mitigating factors to be taken into account when evaluating the state of a country 's public finances , with germany particularly vocal in arguing that the astronomic costs of unification and its massive net contribution to the eu budget form part of the equation . generous germany on the ropes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel indicates the deficit to the german bundestag .
germany has ploughed hundreds of billions of euros into unification and is the biggest net contributor to the eu budget .
but the euro zone 's biggest economy also narrowly escaped its third recession in four years at the end of last year and unemployment in germany currently stands at a post-war high of 5.2 million or 12.6 percent of the population . and even current finance minister hans eichel , who originally presented himself as an iron-fisted and merciless cutter of costs and public-spending , now argues that tightening germany 's purse strings will only make matters worse .
it seems to be germany 's intransigence that is the main hurdle to eu-wide agreement being reached on a reform of the pact , analysts said . " the sticking point seems to be germany 's insistence that some allowance should be made for unification costs and the net contribution to the eu budget , " said dresdner kleinwort wasserstein economist anthony thomas in an interview with afp .
" although the german government is unlikely to be permitted such clear allowances , the question is whether finance ministers or government chiefs will be able to come up with appropriate wording to satisfy all parties , " thomas said . there was no sign friday of the stalemate being broken .
in fact , both sides appeared to be digging their heels in . pact struggles divide the european union bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder finds himself in the opposite camp to austrian counterpart and pact supporter wolfgang schüssel .
austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel insisted that the stability pact should be applied to the letter , while five big member states - namely germany , france , italy , spain and britain - had reportedly reached tacit agreement to block what they deemed to be an all too mechanistic or rigid implementation of the rules . addressing a press conference in schüssel 's home city of vienna on friday , german chancellor gerhard schroeder said berlin was not pushing for a modification of the pact " but an interpretation that makes economic sense " . " we want an interpretation that takes into account both stability and growth , " the german leader added . optimism remains despite sharpened knives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker .
luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , downplayed the lack of progress .
" if we do n't reach an agreement on sunday it will not be a catastrophe .
it will not prevent us finding an accord at the summit . " as things stand , it looks as if a general list will simply be drawn up of factors justifying an excessive deficit .
and " the danger is that the list could be so vague that it could be used to justify any overrun , " thomas said . in the end , the choice facing eu leaders would be to hold on to a stability pact that effectively remains suspended in its current form " or to reform it so that it is virtually toothless " , the economist said .
" so it wo n't really matter whether agreement is reached or not , at least for the moment , " thomas concluded . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu moves to renew battered fiscal rules the eu hopes to hammer out the main points of a revised budget rule book this week , 16 months after the pact meant to protect the euro was left in tatters by eu heavyweight states bent on reviving their ailing economies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 21.03.2005 mixed reactions to stability pact rewrite großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro just got a little less stable , say critics of the change in the wake of sunday 's decision to loosen the rules of the stability and growth pact which underpins the euro , opposition voices in germany are crying foul .
but some economists say more flexibility was needed . germany was one of the prime architects of the stability pact , worried that the profligate ways of smaller eu members would weaken the common currency 's strength .
germany was , at the time of the pact 's adoption , about to leave behind its beloved deutschmark , which had been a steady , stable friend of the country for decades . but over the past months , germany , along with france and italy , has been at the forefront of the drive to water down the pact . on sunday , its efforts bore fruit , and eu ministers agreed on a plan that includes giving germany special treatment because of the high costs of reunification , which germany has said is largely to blame for its inability over the past three years to keep its deficit under the three-percent mark required by the original stability pact . germany has breached the stability pact rules for the last three years and looks on its way to doing it again . there 's a definite sense of satisfaction coming from german finance minister hans eichel , who said the reworked pact is " more rational economically -lsb- and -rsb- more growth friendly , " since it takes into consideration the country 's economic growth and phases of stagnation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eating away at the euro ?
but germany 's opposition is calling the compromise set forth by the 25 eu ministers nothing short of disastrous . " we 've all received a clear signal that the euro will not be as strong as the former deutschmark , " said michael meister , finance spokesman for the conservative christian democrats .
" what 's worse , confidence and trust in the reliability of the european union is being destroyed on a massive scale only because a few countries – germany included – are not willing to display budgetary discipline . ” a " sin " theo waigel , finance minister under former chancellor helmut kohl and member of the bavarian-based christian social union , called the loosening of the pact a " sin against our children " who he said will be left to shoulder the debt of their parents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former finance minister theo waigel , left , with his boss , former chancellor helmut kohl .
waigel , who was finance minister when the stability and growth pact was adopted in 1997 , said the government then had purposefully left out considerations of the cost of reunification in drawing up the agreement . " because then we knew we 'd have every country citing their own special problems , " he said , adding that germany had now abandoned its position as a leading advocate of euro stability in europe . there was criticism on the european level as well .
othmar karas , an austrian who represents the european people 's party in strasburg , said it was a grave mistake to bow to the german government 's demand for special treatment over reunification .
he called the reunification justification for changing the pact 's rules just an excuse , since the financial burden of german reunification started far before the year 2000 , when germany exceeded deficit limits for the first time . " no , it started 15 years ago , and for most of the time germany had enough discipline not to let the financial situation get out of control despite the additional burden , " he said .
" in other words , there ’ s no justification whatsoever to insist on special treatment now . ” a few voices in favor despite the reproaches of opposition politicians and other experts , some german economists have a more sanguine outlook regarding the relaxation of the pact .
most currency analysts said they did not fear a substantial weakening of the euro because of the new rules . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : balloon euro .
will it deflate soon ?
manfred kurz of the bavarian state bank said adding more flexibility to the stability agreement could give countries like germany more room to develop growth-oriented economic policies . the president of the halle institute for economic research , ulrich blum , told the reuters news agency that taking the particular economic difficulties of a country into consideration is not bad policy .
" after all , we are shouldering the entire weight of german reunification , " he said . german spends four percent of its gross domestic product on transfers to the former communist eastern part of the country .
the government estimates it has transferred 1.5 trillion euros -lrb- $ 2 trillion -rrb- since the berlin wall fell 15 years ago . finance minister hans eichel said german reunification was a " unique problem " that needed to be adequately addressed .
he said the agreement did not mean german was abandoning the goal of keeping its deficit under three percent of gdp . " of course i want to stick to it , " he said . boost for schröder the move by the eu 's finance ministers has given chancellor gerhard schröder an economic and political boost at a time when he badly needs it .
the government in berlin is struggling to overcome years of economic stagnation and an unemployment rate that has reached 12.6 percent , a rate not seen since the 1930s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder , left , with french president jacques chirac , another advocate of changing the euro rules .
the pact decision will lessen the likelihood that germany will face punitive action from brussels for not keeping its deficit down .
the change could inspire hope that the government will have room to spend and perhaps bring the unemployment rate down below the psychologically important number of five million . schröder 's party , the social democrats , is facing an important state election on may 22 in its traditional stronghold of north rhine-westphalia .
it is currently trailing the opposition in opinion polls .

but with three weeks left and little progress to date , mutual recriminations have begun . the dispute flared up again on friday when us negotiator robert zoellick decided to step up the pressure after meeting with his european counterpart , eu trade commissioner peter mandelson .
zoellick 's spokesman said " the europeans are clearly unwilling to eliminate the subsidies , " and said if necessary the united states was ready to return to litigation at the wto . this triggered a warning saturday from brussels that it would also make claims against washington .
" if the us decides to move to the wto approach , which we hope they will not , obviously we would launch our own counter-case , " said a european commission official who spoke to afp on condition of anonymity . complaints traded across the atlantic the united states lodged a complaint against eu subsidies to france-based airbus with the wto in october , which brought a counteraction from brussels against what it termed indirect us government aid for chicago-based boeing . but the agreement in january to try to resolve the dispute by renegotiating a 1992 bilateral accord that set the terms of assistance to aircraft makers effectively froze the wto procedure , which eu officials had said would have been a " disastrous " legal clash .
the two sides agreed to freeze subsidies while they negotiate the new agreement . washington tones down fighting talk washington on saturday dropped the saber rattling , and said it was ready to extend the deadline for reaching an agreement .
" we are very willing to continue talking , using the january 11 agreement as the basis - and we are willing to extend the terms of the january agreement , " us trade representative spokesman richard mills told afp . but " the problem is that over the last two months the eu has been focused more on maneuvering than on negotiating the core substance , " mills said by telephone from washington .

however , should no agreement be reached , " nothing would prevent the eu governments to put up the launch aid for the a350 , " the eu official warned , referring to the long-haul jet which would rival boeing 's 787 " dreamliner " . europe wants " pertinent " questions answered part of the difficulties in the negotiations is that the europeans are trying to reach agreements on two issues that were not included as part of the january agreement : japanese aid for development of boeing 's 787 and the foreign sales corporations -lrb- fscs -rrb- that us companies use to lower their taxes . " we have n't changed positions or made specific demands , " said the eu official , adding that " we 've indicated we want pertinent questions added " to the discussions . the eu believes that no comprehensive deal can be reached by april 11 given the complexities of the issues .
instead it has proposed cutting the negotiations into two and reaching by the deadline next month " a more modest package that creates confidence " to reach a comprehensive deal at a later date . but if the eu is ready to put on the table the launch aid for airbus aircraft it expects " an equivalent contribution " from the united states , said the official . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus , boeing dispute could become us-eu problem a massive dispute is brewing between airbus and its archrival , chicago-based boeing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 21.03.2005 mixed reactions to stability pact rewrite großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro just got a little less stable , say critics of the change in the wake of sunday 's decision to loosen the rules of the stability and growth pact which underpins the euro , opposition voices in germany are crying foul .
but some economists say more flexibility was needed . germany was one of the prime architects of the stability pact , worried that the profligate ways of smaller eu members would weaken the common currency 's strength .
germany was , at the time of the pact 's adoption , about to leave behind its beloved deutschmark , which had been a steady , stable friend of the country for decades . but over the past months , germany , along with france and italy , has been at the forefront of the drive to water down the pact . on sunday , its efforts bore fruit , and eu ministers agreed on a plan that includes giving germany special treatment because of the high costs of reunification , which germany has said is largely to blame for its inability over the past three years to keep its deficit under the three-percent mark required by the original stability pact . germany has breached the stability pact rules for the last three years and looks on its way to doing it again . there 's a definite sense of satisfaction coming from german finance minister hans eichel , who said the reworked pact is " more rational economically -lsb- and -rsb- more growth friendly , " since it takes into consideration the country 's economic growth and phases of stagnation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eating away at the euro ?

but some economists say more flexibility was needed . germany was one of the prime architects of the stability pact , worried that the profligate ways of smaller eu members would weaken the common currency 's strength .
germany was , at the time of the pact 's adoption , about to leave behind its beloved deutschmark , which had been a steady , stable friend of the country for decades . but over the past months , germany , along with france and italy , has been at the forefront of the drive to water down the pact . on sunday , its efforts bore fruit , and eu ministers agreed on a plan that includes giving germany special treatment because of the high costs of reunification , which germany has said is largely to blame for its inability over the past three years to keep its deficit under the three-percent mark required by the original stability pact . germany has breached the stability pact rules for the last three years and looks on its way to doing it again . there 's a definite sense of satisfaction coming from german finance minister hans eichel , who said the reworked pact is " more rational economically -lsb- and -rsb- more growth friendly , " since it takes into consideration the country 's economic growth and phases of stagnation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eating away at the euro ?

" germany , the eu 's biggest economy , has for the past three years violated the stability and growth pact 's rules that stipulate that no eurozone member 's public debt should exceed 3 percent of gross domestic product . at the same time , germany , the largest net contributor to the eu budget , has spent hundreds of billions of euros on reunification .
it is also the eu 's poorest performing economy , having narrowly escaped its third recession in four years and having an unemployment rate of 12.6 percent .
the agreement will allow germany to discount about 4 percent of its gdp when tallying its deficit . still , not all german officials were happy with the agreement . " we are leaving future generations with more debt and higher taxes , " cdu financial expert michael meister told german television channel ard .
" and this is not going to be good for employment creation . " strained credibility the 1997 budget pact was all but suspended in november 2003 when eu heavyweights france and germany were let off the hook despite repeatedly breaching a key requirement .
since then nearly half the eu 's 25 states have also triggered disciplinary measures under the pact , while the system 's already-strained credibility has also suffered after it emerged that greece had submitted wrong data for years .
until now an agreement had been kept at bay by deep divisions between countries wanting more flexibility , led by france and germany , and other , mostly smaller , nations such as austria and the netherlands wanting the principles of budgetary discipline to be upheld . now the eu is determined to renew the budget rules in a way that will not threaten economic recovery and will strike the right balance between budgetary rigor and fiscal flexibility . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an agreement looms eu leaders maintain that the pact 's two key rules - public deficits should not exceed 3 percent of gross domestic product and public debt should not surpass 60 percent of gdp - were not compromised .
they are " neither in question nor threatened " by the agreement , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , whose country holds the eu 's presidency , told afp .
" i am satisfied with the agreement , the fundamental rules ... have not been changed . " instead , the deal boosted measures aimed at preventing countries from overspending as well as reinforced the authority of eu 's executive commission to police the deficits , he said . the agreement also allows countries more time to rein in their deficits when they overshoot the three percent limit and it requires the european commission to take into account extraordinary circumstances when judging a member 's deficit . final approval is expected during the summit this week . not a free ride the european commission , which polices deficits , voiced satisfaction with the outcome of the talks with eu economic affairs commissioner joaquin almunia saying he had a " very positive view of the final result . " however , austrian finance minister karl-heinz grasser , who has led a campaign against watering down the pact , expressed muted satisfaction . " it is not the best solution i can imagine , but i am confident that it is a result that can guarantee stability-oriented fiscal policy in the european future , " he said .

but with three weeks left and little progress to date , mutual recriminations have begun . the dispute flared up again on friday when us negotiator robert zoellick decided to step up the pressure after meeting with his european counterpart , eu trade commissioner peter mandelson .
zoellick 's spokesman said " the europeans are clearly unwilling to eliminate the subsidies , " and said if necessary the united states was ready to return to litigation at the wto . this triggered a warning saturday from brussels that it would also make claims against washington .
" if the us decides to move to the wto approach , which we hope they will not , obviously we would launch our own counter-case , " said a european commission official who spoke to afp on condition of anonymity . complaints traded across the atlantic the united states lodged a complaint against eu subsidies to france-based airbus with the wto in october , which brought a counteraction from brussels against what it termed indirect us government aid for chicago-based boeing . but the agreement in january to try to resolve the dispute by renegotiating a 1992 bilateral accord that set the terms of assistance to aircraft makers effectively froze the wto procedure , which eu officials had said would have been a " disastrous " legal clash .
the two sides agreed to freeze subsidies while they negotiate the new agreement . washington tones down fighting talk washington on saturday dropped the saber rattling , and said it was ready to extend the deadline for reaching an agreement .
" we are very willing to continue talking , using the january 11 agreement as the basis - and we are willing to extend the terms of the january agreement , " us trade representative spokesman richard mills told afp . but " the problem is that over the last two months the eu has been focused more on maneuvering than on negotiating the core substance , " mills said by telephone from washington .
" as far as we are concerned , we 're ready to continue the negotiations , " the eu official said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the boeing dreamliner .
however , should no agreement be reached , " nothing would prevent the eu governments to put up the launch aid for the a350 , " the eu official warned , referring to the long-haul jet which would rival boeing 's 787 " dreamliner " . europe wants " pertinent " questions answered part of the difficulties in the negotiations is that the europeans are trying to reach agreements on two issues that were not included as part of the january agreement : japanese aid for development of boeing 's 787 and the foreign sales corporations -lrb- fscs -rrb- that us companies use to lower their taxes . " we have n't changed positions or made specific demands , " said the eu official , adding that " we 've indicated we want pertinent questions added " to the discussions . the eu believes that no comprehensive deal can be reached by april 11 given the complexities of the issues .
instead it has proposed cutting the negotiations into two and reaching by the deadline next month " a more modest package that creates confidence " to reach a comprehensive deal at a later date . but if the eu is ready to put on the table the launch aid for airbus aircraft it expects " an equivalent contribution " from the united states , said the official . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus , boeing dispute could become us-eu problem a massive dispute is brewing between airbus and its archrival , chicago-based boeing .

" you have to be able to separate one from the other , " he told journalists while visiting kiev on monday . the investigation into whether or not relaxed visa criteria allowed organized crime , black market businesses and prostitution to flow into germany unchecked was an internal matter , fischer said , and one that he was prepared to deal with . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko appealed for closer eu ties during a recent speech at the german bundestag .

a former high-ranking german ambassador said on saturday that german authorities were not checking visa applications thoroughly enough . " it was clear that we were not examining the files enough and that many people were passing through the loopholes for unknown reasons , " ernst-jörg von studnitz , former ambassador to russia from 1995 to 2002 , told the german news agency dpa . " green ideology " fischer , whose standing as the most popular politician in germany has taken a hammering over the visa affair , did not pay enough attention to the visa policy , von studnitz charged . the former ambassador said fischer 's policy was " the attempt to put into practice the green ideology . " von studnitz said the ministry took too long to react to the abuse of the liberalized visa regulations introduced under fischer . " apparently , we just shut our eyes .
this happens often when ideological elements are slipped into political practice , " von studnitz told der spiegel weekly in an interviewed published on monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting outside the german consulate in kiev , december 2004 der spiegel also reported that the ministry acknowledged that the visa policy had led to illegal immigration in an internal memo dated july 2004 . fischer has acknowledged making mistakes but has refused to resign .

countries are expected to head for public surpluses in times of growth .
breaches of the limits are to be punished with stiff financial penalties . reality shows a long list of repeat offenders so much for the theory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder : " you pay . "
chirac : " no , you pay . "
in reality , nearly half the eu 's 25 members have since run up so-called excessive deficits , with france and germany topping the list of offenders . indeed , the euro zone heavyweights ' deficit ratios have been well above the 3.0-percent limit for the past three years and there is every indication that , with growth expected to remain sluggish at best , they will break the rules again this year . while smaller euro zone countries have swallowed the pact 's bitter medicine and managed to get their finances in order , laggards france and germany have long campaigned for a softening of the rules . they want special mitigating factors to be taken into account when evaluating the state of a country 's public finances , with germany particularly vocal in arguing that the astronomic costs of unification and its massive net contribution to the eu budget form part of the equation . generous germany on the ropes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel indicates the deficit to the german bundestag .
germany has ploughed hundreds of billions of euros into unification and is the biggest net contributor to the eu budget .
but the euro zone 's biggest economy also narrowly escaped its third recession in four years at the end of last year and unemployment in germany currently stands at a post-war high of 5.2 million or 12.6 percent of the population . and even current finance minister hans eichel , who originally presented himself as an iron-fisted and merciless cutter of costs and public-spending , now argues that tightening germany 's purse strings will only make matters worse .
it seems to be germany 's intransigence that is the main hurdle to eu-wide agreement being reached on a reform of the pact , analysts said . " the sticking point seems to be germany 's insistence that some allowance should be made for unification costs and the net contribution to the eu budget , " said dresdner kleinwort wasserstein economist anthony thomas in an interview with afp .
" although the german government is unlikely to be permitted such clear allowances , the question is whether finance ministers or government chiefs will be able to come up with appropriate wording to satisfy all parties , " thomas said . there was no sign friday of the stalemate being broken .
in fact , both sides appeared to be digging their heels in . pact struggles divide the european union bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder finds himself in the opposite camp to austrian counterpart and pact supporter wolfgang schüssel .
austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel insisted that the stability pact should be applied to the letter , while five big member states - namely germany , france , italy , spain and britain - had reportedly reached tacit agreement to block what they deemed to be an all too mechanistic or rigid implementation of the rules . addressing a press conference in schüssel 's home city of vienna on friday , german chancellor gerhard schroeder said berlin was not pushing for a modification of the pact " but an interpretation that makes economic sense " . " we want an interpretation that takes into account both stability and growth , " the german leader added . optimism remains despite sharpened knives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker .
luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , downplayed the lack of progress .
" if we do n't reach an agreement on sunday it will not be a catastrophe .
it will not prevent us finding an accord at the summit . " as things stand , it looks as if a general list will simply be drawn up of factors justifying an excessive deficit .
and " the danger is that the list could be so vague that it could be used to justify any overrun , " thomas said . in the end , the choice facing eu leaders would be to hold on to a stability pact that effectively remains suspended in its current form " or to reform it so that it is virtually toothless " , the economist said .
" so it wo n't really matter whether agreement is reached or not , at least for the moment , " thomas concluded . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu moves to renew battered fiscal rules the eu hopes to hammer out the main points of a revised budget rule book this week , 16 months after the pact meant to protect the euro was left in tatters by eu heavyweight states bent on reviving their ailing economies .

germany increased troop numbers there recently as part of a european union effort to maintain a fragile peace . struck 's visit to the southern serb province of kosovo comes almost exactly a year after an outbreak of anti-serb violence there left 19 dead and hundreds injured .
then , serb villages were attacked by ethnic albanians for three days - while nato peacekeepers , including those from germany , did nothing to stop them . the defense minister 's two-day encounter with about 3,000 german troops in kosovo is primarily meant to boost morale in what many experts say is a hopeless mission .
general klaus reinhardt , commander of the nato-led kosovo force in 1999 , said the international community would not be able to end the violence simply sending more troops to the province . root causes remain " three additional brigades have been sent down there , but the root causes for the riots have not been tackled , " reinhardt said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 21.03.2005 mixed reactions to stability pact rewrite großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro just got a little less stable , say critics of the change in the wake of sunday 's decision to loosen the rules of the stability and growth pact which underpins the euro , opposition voices in germany are crying foul .
but some economists say more flexibility was needed . germany was one of the prime architects of the stability pact , worried that the profligate ways of smaller eu members would weaken the common currency 's strength .
germany was , at the time of the pact 's adoption , about to leave behind its beloved deutschmark , which had been a steady , stable friend of the country for decades . but over the past months , germany , along with france and italy , has been at the forefront of the drive to water down the pact . on sunday , its efforts bore fruit , and eu ministers agreed on a plan that includes giving germany special treatment because of the high costs of reunification , which germany has said is largely to blame for its inability over the past three years to keep its deficit under the three-percent mark required by the original stability pact . germany has breached the stability pact rules for the last three years and looks on its way to doing it again . there 's a definite sense of satisfaction coming from german finance minister hans eichel , who said the reworked pact is " more rational economically -lsb- and -rsb- more growth friendly , " since it takes into consideration the country 's economic growth and phases of stagnation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eating away at the euro ?
but germany 's opposition is calling the compromise set forth by the 25 eu ministers nothing short of disastrous . " we 've all received a clear signal that the euro will not be as strong as the former deutschmark , " said michael meister , finance spokesman for the conservative christian democrats .
" what 's worse , confidence and trust in the reliability of the european union is being destroyed on a massive scale only because a few countries – germany included – are not willing to display budgetary discipline . ” a " sin " theo waigel , finance minister under former chancellor helmut kohl and member of the bavarian-based christian social union , called the loosening of the pact a " sin against our children " who he said will be left to shoulder the debt of their parents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former finance minister theo waigel , left , with his boss , former chancellor helmut kohl .
waigel , who was finance minister when the stability and growth pact was adopted in 1997 , said the government then had purposefully left out considerations of the cost of reunification in drawing up the agreement . " because then we knew we 'd have every country citing their own special problems , " he said , adding that germany had now abandoned its position as a leading advocate of euro stability in europe . there was criticism on the european level as well .
othmar karas , an austrian who represents the european people 's party in strasburg , said it was a grave mistake to bow to the german government 's demand for special treatment over reunification .
he called the reunification justification for changing the pact 's rules just an excuse , since the financial burden of german reunification started far before the year 2000 , when germany exceeded deficit limits for the first time . " no , it started 15 years ago , and for most of the time germany had enough discipline not to let the financial situation get out of control despite the additional burden , " he said .
" in other words , there ’ s no justification whatsoever to insist on special treatment now . ” a few voices in favor despite the reproaches of opposition politicians and other experts , some german economists have a more sanguine outlook regarding the relaxation of the pact .
most currency analysts said they did not fear a substantial weakening of the euro because of the new rules . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : balloon euro .
will it deflate soon ?
manfred kurz of the bavarian state bank said adding more flexibility to the stability agreement could give countries like germany more room to develop growth-oriented economic policies . the president of the halle institute for economic research , ulrich blum , told the reuters news agency that taking the particular economic difficulties of a country into consideration is not bad policy .
" after all , we are shouldering the entire weight of german reunification , " he said . german spends four percent of its gross domestic product on transfers to the former communist eastern part of the country .
the government estimates it has transferred 1.5 trillion euros -lrb- $ 2 trillion -rrb- since the berlin wall fell 15 years ago . finance minister hans eichel said german reunification was a " unique problem " that needed to be adequately addressed .
he said the agreement did not mean german was abandoning the goal of keeping its deficit under three percent of gdp . " of course i want to stick to it , " he said . boost for schröder the move by the eu 's finance ministers has given chancellor gerhard schröder an economic and political boost at a time when he badly needs it .
the government in berlin is struggling to overcome years of economic stagnation and an unemployment rate that has reached 12.6 percent , a rate not seen since the 1930s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder , left , with french president jacques chirac , another advocate of changing the euro rules .
the pact decision will lessen the likelihood that germany will face punitive action from brussels for not keeping its deficit down .
the change could inspire hope that the government will have room to spend and perhaps bring the unemployment rate down below the psychologically important number of five million . schröder 's party , the social democrats , is facing an important state election on may 22 in its traditional stronghold of north rhine-westphalia .
it is currently trailing the opposition in opinion polls .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 21.03.2005 mixed reactions to stability pact rewrite großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro just got a little less stable , say critics of the change in the wake of sunday 's decision to loosen the rules of the stability and growth pact which underpins the euro , opposition voices in germany are crying foul .
but some economists say more flexibility was needed . germany was one of the prime architects of the stability pact , worried that the profligate ways of smaller eu members would weaken the common currency 's strength .
germany was , at the time of the pact 's adoption , about to leave behind its beloved deutschmark , which had been a steady , stable friend of the country for decades . but over the past months , germany , along with france and italy , has been at the forefront of the drive to water down the pact . on sunday , its efforts bore fruit , and eu ministers agreed on a plan that includes giving germany special treatment because of the high costs of reunification , which germany has said is largely to blame for its inability over the past three years to keep its deficit under the three-percent mark required by the original stability pact . germany has breached the stability pact rules for the last three years and looks on its way to doing it again . there 's a definite sense of satisfaction coming from german finance minister hans eichel , who said the reworked pact is " more rational economically -lsb- and -rsb- more growth friendly , " since it takes into consideration the country 's economic growth and phases of stagnation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eating away at the euro ?
but germany 's opposition is calling the compromise set forth by the 25 eu ministers nothing short of disastrous . " we 've all received a clear signal that the euro will not be as strong as the former deutschmark , " said michael meister , finance spokesman for the conservative christian democrats .
" what 's worse , confidence and trust in the reliability of the european union is being destroyed on a massive scale only because a few countries – germany included – are not willing to display budgetary discipline . ” a " sin " theo waigel , finance minister under former chancellor helmut kohl and member of the bavarian-based christian social union , called the loosening of the pact a " sin against our children " who he said will be left to shoulder the debt of their parents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former finance minister theo waigel , left , with his boss , former chancellor helmut kohl .
waigel , who was finance minister when the stability and growth pact was adopted in 1997 , said the government then had purposefully left out considerations of the cost of reunification in drawing up the agreement . " because then we knew we 'd have every country citing their own special problems , " he said , adding that germany had now abandoned its position as a leading advocate of euro stability in europe . there was criticism on the european level as well .
othmar karas , an austrian who represents the european people 's party in strasburg , said it was a grave mistake to bow to the german government 's demand for special treatment over reunification .
he called the reunification justification for changing the pact 's rules just an excuse , since the financial burden of german reunification started far before the year 2000 , when germany exceeded deficit limits for the first time . " no , it started 15 years ago , and for most of the time germany had enough discipline not to let the financial situation get out of control despite the additional burden , " he said .
" in other words , there ’ s no justification whatsoever to insist on special treatment now . ” a few voices in favor despite the reproaches of opposition politicians and other experts , some german economists have a more sanguine outlook regarding the relaxation of the pact .
most currency analysts said they did not fear a substantial weakening of the euro because of the new rules . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : balloon euro .
will it deflate soon ?
manfred kurz of the bavarian state bank said adding more flexibility to the stability agreement could give countries like germany more room to develop growth-oriented economic policies . the president of the halle institute for economic research , ulrich blum , told the reuters news agency that taking the particular economic difficulties of a country into consideration is not bad policy .
" after all , we are shouldering the entire weight of german reunification , " he said . german spends four percent of its gross domestic product on transfers to the former communist eastern part of the country .
the government estimates it has transferred 1.5 trillion euros -lrb- $ 2 trillion -rrb- since the berlin wall fell 15 years ago . finance minister hans eichel said german reunification was a " unique problem " that needed to be adequately addressed .
he said the agreement did not mean german was abandoning the goal of keeping its deficit under three percent of gdp . " of course i want to stick to it , " he said . boost for schröder the move by the eu 's finance ministers has given chancellor gerhard schröder an economic and political boost at a time when he badly needs it .
the government in berlin is struggling to overcome years of economic stagnation and an unemployment rate that has reached 12.6 percent , a rate not seen since the 1930s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder , left , with french president jacques chirac , another advocate of changing the euro rules .
the pact decision will lessen the likelihood that germany will face punitive action from brussels for not keeping its deficit down .
the change could inspire hope that the government will have room to spend and perhaps bring the unemployment rate down below the psychologically important number of five million . schröder 's party , the social democrats , is facing an important state election on may 22 in its traditional stronghold of north rhine-westphalia .
it is currently trailing the opposition in opinion polls .

but with three weeks left and little progress to date , mutual recriminations have begun . the dispute flared up again on friday when us negotiator robert zoellick decided to step up the pressure after meeting with his european counterpart , eu trade commissioner peter mandelson .
zoellick 's spokesman said " the europeans are clearly unwilling to eliminate the subsidies , " and said if necessary the united states was ready to return to litigation at the wto . this triggered a warning saturday from brussels that it would also make claims against washington .
" if the us decides to move to the wto approach , which we hope they will not , obviously we would launch our own counter-case , " said a european commission official who spoke to afp on condition of anonymity . complaints traded across the atlantic the united states lodged a complaint against eu subsidies to france-based airbus with the wto in october , which brought a counteraction from brussels against what it termed indirect us government aid for chicago-based boeing . but the agreement in january to try to resolve the dispute by renegotiating a 1992 bilateral accord that set the terms of assistance to aircraft makers effectively froze the wto procedure , which eu officials had said would have been a " disastrous " legal clash .
the two sides agreed to freeze subsidies while they negotiate the new agreement . washington tones down fighting talk washington on saturday dropped the saber rattling , and said it was ready to extend the deadline for reaching an agreement .
" we are very willing to continue talking , using the january 11 agreement as the basis - and we are willing to extend the terms of the january agreement , " us trade representative spokesman richard mills told afp . but " the problem is that over the last two months the eu has been focused more on maneuvering than on negotiating the core substance , " mills said by telephone from washington .
" as far as we are concerned , we 're ready to continue the negotiations , " the eu official said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the boeing dreamliner .
however , should no agreement be reached , " nothing would prevent the eu governments to put up the launch aid for the a350 , " the eu official warned , referring to the long-haul jet which would rival boeing 's 787 " dreamliner " . europe wants " pertinent " questions answered part of the difficulties in the negotiations is that the europeans are trying to reach agreements on two issues that were not included as part of the january agreement : japanese aid for development of boeing 's 787 and the foreign sales corporations -lrb- fscs -rrb- that us companies use to lower their taxes . " we have n't changed positions or made specific demands , " said the eu official , adding that " we 've indicated we want pertinent questions added " to the discussions . the eu believes that no comprehensive deal can be reached by april 11 given the complexities of the issues .
instead it has proposed cutting the negotiations into two and reaching by the deadline next month " a more modest package that creates confidence " to reach a comprehensive deal at a later date . but if the eu is ready to put on the table the launch aid for airbus aircraft it expects " an equivalent contribution " from the united states , said the official . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus , boeing dispute could become us-eu problem a massive dispute is brewing between airbus and its archrival , chicago-based boeing .

germany increased troop numbers there recently as part of a european union effort to maintain a fragile peace . struck 's visit to the southern serb province of kosovo comes almost exactly a year after an outbreak of anti-serb violence there left 19 dead and hundreds injured .
then , serb villages were attacked by ethnic albanians for three days - while nato peacekeepers , including those from germany , did nothing to stop them . the defense minister 's two-day encounter with about 3,000 german troops in kosovo is primarily meant to boost morale in what many experts say is a hopeless mission .
general klaus reinhardt , commander of the nato-led kosovo force in 1999 , said the international community would not be able to end the violence simply sending more troops to the province . root causes remain " three additional brigades have been sent down there , but the root causes for the riots have not been tackled , " reinhardt said .
" since political and social disenchantment remain , there is bound to be a repeat of the ethnic clashes .
for many , it ’ s one year on and nothing has changed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramush haradinaj earlier this month , germany sent an additional 600 troops to kosovo to calm tensions after ethnic albanian prime minister ramush haradinaj -lrb- photo -rrb- resigned and surrendered to the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia in the hague . nato has around 18,000 peacekeepers in the province and a united nations mission spokesman claimed last week that the security situation had improved substantially .
there are also plans by the un to start final negotiations on the status of kosovo this summer - a decision struck said was needed as soon as possible . " we can only help our troops make sense of their mission as long as there is political progress , " the german defense minister said .
over the long term , military engagement in kosovo would be hard to justify if serbian enclaves were protected without any will on the part of serbs and ethnic albanians in kosovo to live together in peace , he added . possible reduction in bosnia in bosnia , where struck will meet with political leaders on tuesday , the situation is much more stable .
that has already led to calls for a substantial reduction in the number of foreign troops stationed there . the eu took over the bosnian mission from nato in december last year .
it has maintained troop levels at around 7,000 in what is the eu ’ s largest such operation to date .
but eu officials are reviewing whether troop numbers can be reduced to around 5,000 . the leaders of the eu force , which also includes troops from non-eu countries , describe conditions as peaceful .
but they also say that , a decade after the end of the bosnian war , it 's proved impossible to stamp out the ethnic tensions that fuelled the balkans wars . uwe hessler -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de foreign missions trouble soldiers although germany has handed over the reins of the international security assistance force to canada , 1,700 german soldiers remain in afghanistan .

it is also the eu 's poorest performing economy , having narrowly escaped its third recession in four years and having an unemployment rate of 12.6 percent .

until now an agreement had been kept at bay by deep divisions between countries wanting more flexibility , led by france and germany , and other , mostly smaller , nations such as austria and the netherlands wanting the principles of budgetary discipline to be upheld . now the eu is determined to renew the budget rules in a way that will not threaten economic recovery and will strike the right balance between budgetary rigor and fiscal flexibility . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an agreement looms eu leaders maintain that the pact 's two key rules - public deficits should not exceed 3 percent of gross domestic product and public debt should not surpass 60 percent of gdp - were not compromised .

" germany , the eu 's biggest economy , has for the past three years violated the stability and growth pact 's rules that stipulate that no eurozone member 's public debt should exceed 3 percent of gross domestic product . at the same time , germany , the largest net contributor to the eu budget , has spent hundreds of billions of euros on reunification .
it is also the eu 's poorest performing economy , having narrowly escaped its third recession in four years and having an unemployment rate of 12.6 percent .
the agreement will allow germany to discount about 4 percent of its gdp when tallying its deficit . still , not all german officials were happy with the agreement . " we are leaving future generations with more debt and higher taxes , " cdu financial expert michael meister told german television channel ard .
" and this is not going to be good for employment creation . " strained credibility the 1997 budget pact was all but suspended in november 2003 when eu heavyweights france and germany were let off the hook despite repeatedly breaching a key requirement .
since then nearly half the eu 's 25 states have also triggered disciplinary measures under the pact , while the system 's already-strained credibility has also suffered after it emerged that greece had submitted wrong data for years .
until now an agreement had been kept at bay by deep divisions between countries wanting more flexibility , led by france and germany , and other , mostly smaller , nations such as austria and the netherlands wanting the principles of budgetary discipline to be upheld . now the eu is determined to renew the budget rules in a way that will not threaten economic recovery and will strike the right balance between budgetary rigor and fiscal flexibility . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an agreement looms eu leaders maintain that the pact 's two key rules - public deficits should not exceed 3 percent of gross domestic product and public debt should not surpass 60 percent of gdp - were not compromised .
they are " neither in question nor threatened " by the agreement , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , whose country holds the eu 's presidency , told afp .
" i am satisfied with the agreement , the fundamental rules ... have not been changed . " instead , the deal boosted measures aimed at preventing countries from overspending as well as reinforced the authority of eu 's executive commission to police the deficits , he said . the agreement also allows countries more time to rein in their deficits when they overshoot the three percent limit and it requires the european commission to take into account extraordinary circumstances when judging a member 's deficit . final approval is expected during the summit this week . not a free ride the european commission , which polices deficits , voiced satisfaction with the outcome of the talks with eu economic affairs commissioner joaquin almunia saying he had a " very positive view of the final result . " however , austrian finance minister karl-heinz grasser , who has led a campaign against watering down the pact , expressed muted satisfaction . " it is not the best solution i can imagine , but i am confident that it is a result that can guarantee stability-oriented fiscal policy in the european future , " he said .
" but it is not a free ride , it is not carte blanche for deficit spending .

but singles are a very heterogeneous group and therefore pose a particular challenge as consumers . in germany , the bestseller “ bridget jones ’ s diary ” was translated into “ schokolade zum frühstück ” or “ chocolate for breakfast . ”
for many , bridget jones personifies the stereotypical image of a single : having chocolate for breakfast and a glass -lrb- or more -rrb- of chardonnay for dinner . but the reality looks quite different . “ studies on one-person households show that particularly young professionals who earn good money are very interested in fresh products and are more likely to buy brand goods , ” said doris rosenkranz , a sociology professor at the university of applied sciences in würzburg and author of several publications on consumer habits . making single life more convenient according to figures from the federal statistics office , 20.7 percent of germany ’ s adult population - or 13.8 million people - live in one-person households .
in cities , this figure can reach over 50 percent . retailers are aware that they have to address all consumers , including singles , said olaf roik from the german retailers ’ association hde .
“ we try to do this through well-targeted marketing , especially in cities which have a higher number of one-person households , ” he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pizza is n't the only alternative for singles anymore german supermarkets have in fact come a long way since frozen pizza was the only option for a quick meal after work .
but fast , healthy meals for one-person households are a more recent development in germany , compared to these markets in the united states or britain . rewe , one of the leading groups in the european grocery trade , said it particularly addresses singles ’ needs in city stores . “ we especially offer a lot in the convenience sector , that is food that is ready-to-eat , ” said press spokeswoman astrid ohletz .
“ for example , we have fresh soups , sushi or pre-prepared fruit . ” singles : hip or fate ? rosenkranz points out that singles are not just students living alone or young professionals , though .
“ singles are a very heterogeneous group , ” she said .
“ what is a hip lifestyle for some is fate for another .
if you define singles as one-person households , half of them are senior citizens over the age of 55 . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senior citizens make up half of one-person households in germany and it is precisely this group of older singles that feel overlooked as consumers .
older singles , who usually only shop for themselves , suffer from the fact that packaging is so large , for example . “ smaller portions are disproportionately more expensive and many older singles only have their pension at their disposal , ” said rosenkranz . as a matter of fact , smaller single-friendly sizes are more expensive .
take your average major supermarket in cologne : 250 grams of regular butter costs between 0.99 euros and 1.29 euros -lrb- $ 1.31-1.70 -rrb- , depending on the brand .
but 125 grams costs 0.79 euro . another example is philadelphia cream cheese .
the regular size of 200 grams costs 1.49 euros .
but the single-friendly sized six-pack of 16.7 grams each , which comes to about half of the regular size , costs 1.19 euros . hde explained that this price difference is not discriminatory against singles .
it ’ s simply due to packaging and logistics costs , which are not necessarily half as great as for a big package .
“ large volumes are also less expensive , ” said roik .
“ that ’ s just the way it is . ” the “ living-alone-together ” single the larger packaging is not necessarily a problem for many younger singles aged between 25 and 35 .
“ these are so-called lats or ‘ living-alone-together ’ singles , who live alone , but often have a partner , ” rosenkranz explained .
“ in terms of consumption , this group often buys for the partner , too . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : singles prefer to eat their pizza in the restaurant in addition , lats spend above-average amounts on eating outside of their home , either in restaurants or with take-away food , she said . this group of singles is also not interested in the frozen dinners and mini-sized pizzas available on the market .
“ our research showed that this type of food mostly appeals to working mothers rather than singles , ” said rosenkranz . the internet ’ s potential for singles in his book “ consumer behavior in one-person households , ” the economic sociologist wilhelm ott wrote that eating well is important for the majority of singles . “ for many , eating and drinking express a certain lifestyle , ” said ott .
“ especially younger people living alone want to underline the particular quality of their way of life . ” in this sense , the internet holds a great potential for the singles ’ consumer market , said rosenkranz . “ it would be especially interesting for working singles if they could do their shopping online during the day , ” she said .

for many , bridget jones personifies the stereotypical image of a single : having chocolate for breakfast and a glass -lrb- or more -rrb- of chardonnay for dinner . but the reality looks quite different . “ studies on one-person households show that particularly young professionals who earn good money are very interested in fresh products and are more likely to buy brand goods , ” said doris rosenkranz , a sociology professor at the university of applied sciences in würzburg and author of several publications on consumer habits . making single life more convenient according to figures from the federal statistics office , 20.7 percent of germany ’ s adult population - or 13.8 million people - live in one-person households .
in cities , this figure can reach over 50 percent . retailers are aware that they have to address all consumers , including singles , said olaf roik from the german retailers ’ association hde .
“ we try to do this through well-targeted marketing , especially in cities which have a higher number of one-person households , ” he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pizza is n't the only alternative for singles anymore german supermarkets have in fact come a long way since frozen pizza was the only option for a quick meal after work .
but fast , healthy meals for one-person households are a more recent development in germany , compared to these markets in the united states or britain . rewe , one of the leading groups in the european grocery trade , said it particularly addresses singles ’ needs in city stores . “ we especially offer a lot in the convenience sector , that is food that is ready-to-eat , ” said press spokeswoman astrid ohletz .
“ for example , we have fresh soups , sushi or pre-prepared fruit . ” singles : hip or fate ? rosenkranz points out that singles are not just students living alone or young professionals , though .
“ singles are a very heterogeneous group , ” she said .
“ what is a hip lifestyle for some is fate for another .
if you define singles as one-person households , half of them are senior citizens over the age of 55 . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senior citizens make up half of one-person households in germany and it is precisely this group of older singles that feel overlooked as consumers .
older singles , who usually only shop for themselves , suffer from the fact that packaging is so large , for example . “ smaller portions are disproportionately more expensive and many older singles only have their pension at their disposal , ” said rosenkranz . as a matter of fact , smaller single-friendly sizes are more expensive .
take your average major supermarket in cologne : 250 grams of regular butter costs between 0.99 euros and 1.29 euros -lrb- $ 1.31-1.70 -rrb- , depending on the brand .
but 125 grams costs 0.79 euro . another example is philadelphia cream cheese .
the regular size of 200 grams costs 1.49 euros .
but the single-friendly sized six-pack of 16.7 grams each , which comes to about half of the regular size , costs 1.19 euros . hde explained that this price difference is not discriminatory against singles .
it ’ s simply due to packaging and logistics costs , which are not necessarily half as great as for a big package .
“ large volumes are also less expensive , ” said roik .
“ that ’ s just the way it is . ” the “ living-alone-together ” single the larger packaging is not necessarily a problem for many younger singles aged between 25 and 35 .
“ these are so-called lats or ‘ living-alone-together ’ singles , who live alone , but often have a partner , ” rosenkranz explained .
“ in terms of consumption , this group often buys for the partner , too . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : singles prefer to eat their pizza in the restaurant in addition , lats spend above-average amounts on eating outside of their home , either in restaurants or with take-away food , she said . this group of singles is also not interested in the frozen dinners and mini-sized pizzas available on the market .
“ our research showed that this type of food mostly appeals to working mothers rather than singles , ” said rosenkranz . the internet ’ s potential for singles in his book “ consumer behavior in one-person households , ” the economic sociologist wilhelm ott wrote that eating well is important for the majority of singles . “ for many , eating and drinking express a certain lifestyle , ” said ott .
“ especially younger people living alone want to underline the particular quality of their way of life . ” in this sense , the internet holds a great potential for the singles ’ consumer market , said rosenkranz . “ it would be especially interesting for working singles if they could do their shopping online during the day , ” she said .
then , after work , they could simply pay for their groceries and head home . “ then , there would be more time for cooking good food with your partner or friends , ” she said . sabina casagrande , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de single and loving it in germany most german single women say they 're doing just fine without a man in their lives .

germany was , at the time of the pact 's adoption , about to leave behind its beloved deutschmark , which had been a steady , stable friend of the country for decades . but over the past months , germany , along with france and italy , has been at the forefront of the drive to water down the pact . on sunday , its efforts bore fruit , and eu ministers agreed on a plan that includes giving germany special treatment because of the high costs of reunification , which germany has said is largely to blame for its inability over the past three years to keep its deficit under the three-percent mark required by the original stability pact . germany has breached the stability pact rules for the last three years and looks on its way to doing it again . there 's a definite sense of satisfaction coming from german finance minister hans eichel , who said the reworked pact is " more rational economically -lsb- and -rsb- more growth friendly , " since it takes into consideration the country 's economic growth and phases of stagnation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eating away at the euro ?
but germany 's opposition is calling the compromise set forth by the 25 eu ministers nothing short of disastrous . " we 've all received a clear signal that the euro will not be as strong as the former deutschmark , " said michael meister , finance spokesman for the conservative christian democrats .

othmar karas , an austrian who represents the european people 's party in strasburg , said it was a grave mistake to bow to the german government 's demand for special treatment over reunification .
he called the reunification justification for changing the pact 's rules just an excuse , since the financial burden of german reunification started far before the year 2000 , when germany exceeded deficit limits for the first time . " no , it started 15 years ago , and for most of the time germany had enough discipline not to let the financial situation get out of control despite the additional burden , " he said .
" in other words , there ’ s no justification whatsoever to insist on special treatment now . ” a few voices in favor despite the reproaches of opposition politicians and other experts , some german economists have a more sanguine outlook regarding the relaxation of the pact .
most currency analysts said they did not fear a substantial weakening of the euro because of the new rules . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : balloon euro .

manfred kurz of the bavarian state bank said adding more flexibility to the stability agreement could give countries like germany more room to develop growth-oriented economic policies . the president of the halle institute for economic research , ulrich blum , told the reuters news agency that taking the particular economic difficulties of a country into consideration is not bad policy .
" after all , we are shouldering the entire weight of german reunification , " he said . german spends four percent of its gross domestic product on transfers to the former communist eastern part of the country .
the government estimates it has transferred 1.5 trillion euros -lrb- $ 2 trillion -rrb- since the berlin wall fell 15 years ago . finance minister hans eichel said german reunification was a " unique problem " that needed to be adequately addressed .
he said the agreement did not mean german was abandoning the goal of keeping its deficit under three percent of gdp . " of course i want to stick to it , " he said . boost for schröder the move by the eu 's finance ministers has given chancellor gerhard schröder an economic and political boost at a time when he badly needs it .

the pact decision will lessen the likelihood that germany will face punitive action from brussels for not keeping its deficit down .
the change could inspire hope that the government will have room to spend and perhaps bring the unemployment rate down below the psychologically important number of five million . schröder 's party , the social democrats , is facing an important state election on may 22 in its traditional stronghold of north rhine-westphalia .

" you have to be able to separate one from the other , " he told journalists while visiting kiev on monday . the investigation into whether or not relaxed visa criteria allowed organized crime , black market businesses and prostitution to flow into germany unchecked was an internal matter , fischer said , and one that he was prepared to deal with . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko appealed for closer eu ties during a recent speech at the german bundestag .

" green ideology " fischer , whose standing as the most popular politician in germany has taken a hammering over the visa affair , did not pay enough attention to the visa policy , von studnitz charged . the former ambassador said fischer 's policy was " the attempt to put into practice the green ideology . " von studnitz said the ministry took too long to react to the abuse of the liberalized visa regulations introduced under fischer . " apparently , we just shut our eyes .
this happens often when ideological elements are slipped into political practice , " von studnitz told der spiegel weekly in an interviewed published on monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting outside the german consulate in kiev , december 2004 der spiegel also reported that the ministry acknowledged that the visa policy had led to illegal immigration in an internal memo dated july 2004 . fischer has acknowledged making mistakes but has refused to resign .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 21.03.2005 mixed reactions to stability pact rewrite großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro just got a little less stable , say critics of the change in the wake of sunday 's decision to loosen the rules of the stability and growth pact which underpins the euro , opposition voices in germany are crying foul .
but some economists say more flexibility was needed . germany was one of the prime architects of the stability pact , worried that the profligate ways of smaller eu members would weaken the common currency 's strength .
germany was , at the time of the pact 's adoption , about to leave behind its beloved deutschmark , which had been a steady , stable friend of the country for decades . but over the past months , germany , along with france and italy , has been at the forefront of the drive to water down the pact . on sunday , its efforts bore fruit , and eu ministers agreed on a plan that includes giving germany special treatment because of the high costs of reunification , which germany has said is largely to blame for its inability over the past three years to keep its deficit under the three-percent mark required by the original stability pact . germany has breached the stability pact rules for the last three years and looks on its way to doing it again . there 's a definite sense of satisfaction coming from german finance minister hans eichel , who said the reworked pact is " more rational economically -lsb- and -rsb- more growth friendly , " since it takes into consideration the country 's economic growth and phases of stagnation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eating away at the euro ?
but germany 's opposition is calling the compromise set forth by the 25 eu ministers nothing short of disastrous . " we 've all received a clear signal that the euro will not be as strong as the former deutschmark , " said michael meister , finance spokesman for the conservative christian democrats .
" what 's worse , confidence and trust in the reliability of the european union is being destroyed on a massive scale only because a few countries – germany included – are not willing to display budgetary discipline . ” a " sin " theo waigel , finance minister under former chancellor helmut kohl and member of the bavarian-based christian social union , called the loosening of the pact a " sin against our children " who he said will be left to shoulder the debt of their parents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former finance minister theo waigel , left , with his boss , former chancellor helmut kohl .
waigel , who was finance minister when the stability and growth pact was adopted in 1997 , said the government then had purposefully left out considerations of the cost of reunification in drawing up the agreement . " because then we knew we 'd have every country citing their own special problems , " he said , adding that germany had now abandoned its position as a leading advocate of euro stability in europe . there was criticism on the european level as well .

germany increased troop numbers there recently as part of a european union effort to maintain a fragile peace . struck 's visit to the southern serb province of kosovo comes almost exactly a year after an outbreak of anti-serb violence there left 19 dead and hundreds injured .
then , serb villages were attacked by ethnic albanians for three days - while nato peacekeepers , including those from germany , did nothing to stop them . the defense minister 's two-day encounter with about 3,000 german troops in kosovo is primarily meant to boost morale in what many experts say is a hopeless mission .
general klaus reinhardt , commander of the nato-led kosovo force in 1999 , said the international community would not be able to end the violence simply sending more troops to the province . root causes remain " three additional brigades have been sent down there , but the root causes for the riots have not been tackled , " reinhardt said .
" since political and social disenchantment remain , there is bound to be a repeat of the ethnic clashes .
for many , it ’ s one year on and nothing has changed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramush haradinaj earlier this month , germany sent an additional 600 troops to kosovo to calm tensions after ethnic albanian prime minister ramush haradinaj -lrb- photo -rrb- resigned and surrendered to the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia in the hague . nato has around 18,000 peacekeepers in the province and a united nations mission spokesman claimed last week that the security situation had improved substantially .
there are also plans by the un to start final negotiations on the status of kosovo this summer - a decision struck said was needed as soon as possible . " we can only help our troops make sense of their mission as long as there is political progress , " the german defense minister said .
over the long term , military engagement in kosovo would be hard to justify if serbian enclaves were protected without any will on the part of serbs and ethnic albanians in kosovo to live together in peace , he added . possible reduction in bosnia in bosnia , where struck will meet with political leaders on tuesday , the situation is much more stable .
that has already led to calls for a substantial reduction in the number of foreign troops stationed there . the eu took over the bosnian mission from nato in december last year .
it has maintained troop levels at around 7,000 in what is the eu ’ s largest such operation to date .
but eu officials are reviewing whether troop numbers can be reduced to around 5,000 . the leaders of the eu force , which also includes troops from non-eu countries , describe conditions as peaceful .
but they also say that , a decade after the end of the bosnian war , it 's proved impossible to stamp out the ethnic tensions that fuelled the balkans wars . uwe hessler -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de foreign missions trouble soldiers although germany has handed over the reins of the international security assistance force to canada , 1,700 german soldiers remain in afghanistan .

" germany , the eu 's biggest economy , has for the past three years violated the stability and growth pact 's rules that stipulate that no eurozone member 's public debt should exceed 3 percent of gross domestic product . at the same time , germany , the largest net contributor to the eu budget , has spent hundreds of billions of euros on reunification .
it is also the eu 's poorest performing economy , having narrowly escaped its third recession in four years and having an unemployment rate of 12.6 percent .
the agreement will allow germany to discount about 4 percent of its gdp when tallying its deficit . still , not all german officials were happy with the agreement . " we are leaving future generations with more debt and higher taxes , " cdu financial expert michael meister told german television channel ard .
" and this is not going to be good for employment creation . " strained credibility the 1997 budget pact was all but suspended in november 2003 when eu heavyweights france and germany were let off the hook despite repeatedly breaching a key requirement .
since then nearly half the eu 's 25 states have also triggered disciplinary measures under the pact , while the system 's already-strained credibility has also suffered after it emerged that greece had submitted wrong data for years .
until now an agreement had been kept at bay by deep divisions between countries wanting more flexibility , led by france and germany , and other , mostly smaller , nations such as austria and the netherlands wanting the principles of budgetary discipline to be upheld . now the eu is determined to renew the budget rules in a way that will not threaten economic recovery and will strike the right balance between budgetary rigor and fiscal flexibility . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an agreement looms eu leaders maintain that the pact 's two key rules - public deficits should not exceed 3 percent of gross domestic product and public debt should not surpass 60 percent of gdp - were not compromised .
they are " neither in question nor threatened " by the agreement , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , whose country holds the eu 's presidency , told afp .
" i am satisfied with the agreement , the fundamental rules ... have not been changed . " instead , the deal boosted measures aimed at preventing countries from overspending as well as reinforced the authority of eu 's executive commission to police the deficits , he said . the agreement also allows countries more time to rein in their deficits when they overshoot the three percent limit and it requires the european commission to take into account extraordinary circumstances when judging a member 's deficit . final approval is expected during the summit this week . not a free ride the european commission , which polices deficits , voiced satisfaction with the outcome of the talks with eu economic affairs commissioner joaquin almunia saying he had a " very positive view of the final result . " however , austrian finance minister karl-heinz grasser , who has led a campaign against watering down the pact , expressed muted satisfaction . " it is not the best solution i can imagine , but i am confident that it is a result that can guarantee stability-oriented fiscal policy in the european future , " he said .
" but it is not a free ride , it is not carte blanche for deficit spending .

germany increased troop numbers there recently as part of a european union effort to maintain a fragile peace . struck 's visit to the southern serb province of kosovo comes almost exactly a year after an outbreak of anti-serb violence there left 19 dead and hundreds injured .
then , serb villages were attacked by ethnic albanians for three days - while nato peacekeepers , including those from germany , did nothing to stop them . the defense minister 's two-day encounter with about 3,000 german troops in kosovo is primarily meant to boost morale in what many experts say is a hopeless mission .
general klaus reinhardt , commander of the nato-led kosovo force in 1999 , said the international community would not be able to end the violence simply sending more troops to the province . root causes remain " three additional brigades have been sent down there , but the root causes for the riots have not been tackled , " reinhardt said .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramush haradinaj earlier this month , germany sent an additional 600 troops to kosovo to calm tensions after ethnic albanian prime minister ramush haradinaj -lrb- photo -rrb- resigned and surrendered to the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia in the hague . nato has around 18,000 peacekeepers in the province and a united nations mission spokesman claimed last week that the security situation had improved substantially .
there are also plans by the un to start final negotiations on the status of kosovo this summer - a decision struck said was needed as soon as possible . " we can only help our troops make sense of their mission as long as there is political progress , " the german defense minister said .

but some economists say more flexibility was needed . germany was one of the prime architects of the stability pact , worried that the profligate ways of smaller eu members would weaken the common currency 's strength .
germany was , at the time of the pact 's adoption , about to leave behind its beloved deutschmark , which had been a steady , stable friend of the country for decades . but over the past months , germany , along with france and italy , has been at the forefront of the drive to water down the pact . on sunday , its efforts bore fruit , and eu ministers agreed on a plan that includes giving germany special treatment because of the high costs of reunification , which germany has said is largely to blame for its inability over the past three years to keep its deficit under the three-percent mark required by the original stability pact . germany has breached the stability pact rules for the last three years and looks on its way to doing it again . there 's a definite sense of satisfaction coming from german finance minister hans eichel , who said the reworked pact is " more rational economically -lsb- and -rsb- more growth friendly , " since it takes into consideration the country 's economic growth and phases of stagnation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eating away at the euro ?
but germany 's opposition is calling the compromise set forth by the 25 eu ministers nothing short of disastrous . " we 've all received a clear signal that the euro will not be as strong as the former deutschmark , " said michael meister , finance spokesman for the conservative christian democrats .
" what 's worse , confidence and trust in the reliability of the european union is being destroyed on a massive scale only because a few countries – germany included – are not willing to display budgetary discipline . ” a " sin " theo waigel , finance minister under former chancellor helmut kohl and member of the bavarian-based christian social union , called the loosening of the pact a " sin against our children " who he said will be left to shoulder the debt of their parents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former finance minister theo waigel , left , with his boss , former chancellor helmut kohl .
waigel , who was finance minister when the stability and growth pact was adopted in 1997 , said the government then had purposefully left out considerations of the cost of reunification in drawing up the agreement . " because then we knew we 'd have every country citing their own special problems , " he said , adding that germany had now abandoned its position as a leading advocate of euro stability in europe . there was criticism on the european level as well .
othmar karas , an austrian who represents the european people 's party in strasburg , said it was a grave mistake to bow to the german government 's demand for special treatment over reunification .
he called the reunification justification for changing the pact 's rules just an excuse , since the financial burden of german reunification started far before the year 2000 , when germany exceeded deficit limits for the first time . " no , it started 15 years ago , and for most of the time germany had enough discipline not to let the financial situation get out of control despite the additional burden , " he said .
" in other words , there ’ s no justification whatsoever to insist on special treatment now . ” a few voices in favor despite the reproaches of opposition politicians and other experts , some german economists have a more sanguine outlook regarding the relaxation of the pact .
most currency analysts said they did not fear a substantial weakening of the euro because of the new rules . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : balloon euro .

manfred kurz of the bavarian state bank said adding more flexibility to the stability agreement could give countries like germany more room to develop growth-oriented economic policies . the president of the halle institute for economic research , ulrich blum , told the reuters news agency that taking the particular economic difficulties of a country into consideration is not bad policy .
" after all , we are shouldering the entire weight of german reunification , " he said . german spends four percent of its gross domestic product on transfers to the former communist eastern part of the country .
the government estimates it has transferred 1.5 trillion euros -lrb- $ 2 trillion -rrb- since the berlin wall fell 15 years ago . finance minister hans eichel said german reunification was a " unique problem " that needed to be adequately addressed .
he said the agreement did not mean german was abandoning the goal of keeping its deficit under three percent of gdp . " of course i want to stick to it , " he said . boost for schröder the move by the eu 's finance ministers has given chancellor gerhard schröder an economic and political boost at a time when he badly needs it .
the government in berlin is struggling to overcome years of economic stagnation and an unemployment rate that has reached 12.6 percent , a rate not seen since the 1930s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder , left , with french president jacques chirac , another advocate of changing the euro rules .
the pact decision will lessen the likelihood that germany will face punitive action from brussels for not keeping its deficit down .
the change could inspire hope that the government will have room to spend and perhaps bring the unemployment rate down below the psychologically important number of five million . schröder 's party , the social democrats , is facing an important state election on may 22 in its traditional stronghold of north rhine-westphalia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 21.03.2005 germany leads pack of pact assassins großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the germans consider the pact their own frankenstein 's monster germany , one of the main architects of the eu 's stability and growth pact , heads a list of potential assassins who want to kill off the bloc 's tattered fiscal rules . in a remarkable twist of irony as eu ministers prepare to gather in brussels this week to talk about reform of the stability and growth pact , the main architect germany is a leading voice in calls for the tattered fiscal rules to be taken apart . shackled by low growth and crippling high unemployment , the euro zone 's biggest but worst-performing economy has effectively found itself caught in a trap of its own making . originally designed in 1997 by then german finance minister theo waigel to prevent spendthrift economies from hitching a free ride on the coat-tails of standard-bearers of financial rigor such as germany , the pact stipulates that no euro zone country is allowed to let public finances run too deeply into the red . the pact sets a limit on each country 's public deficit of 3.0 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , while overall debt is not allowed to exceed 60 percent of gdp .
countries are expected to head for public surpluses in times of growth .
breaches of the limits are to be punished with stiff financial penalties . reality shows a long list of repeat offenders so much for the theory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder : " you pay . "
chirac : " no , you pay . "
in reality , nearly half the eu 's 25 members have since run up so-called excessive deficits , with france and germany topping the list of offenders . indeed , the euro zone heavyweights ' deficit ratios have been well above the 3.0-percent limit for the past three years and there is every indication that , with growth expected to remain sluggish at best , they will break the rules again this year . while smaller euro zone countries have swallowed the pact 's bitter medicine and managed to get their finances in order , laggards france and germany have long campaigned for a softening of the rules . they want special mitigating factors to be taken into account when evaluating the state of a country 's public finances , with germany particularly vocal in arguing that the astronomic costs of unification and its massive net contribution to the eu budget form part of the equation . generous germany on the ropes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel indicates the deficit to the german bundestag .
germany has ploughed hundreds of billions of euros into unification and is the biggest net contributor to the eu budget .
but the euro zone 's biggest economy also narrowly escaped its third recession in four years at the end of last year and unemployment in germany currently stands at a post-war high of 5.2 million or 12.6 percent of the population . and even current finance minister hans eichel , who originally presented himself as an iron-fisted and merciless cutter of costs and public-spending , now argues that tightening germany 's purse strings will only make matters worse .
it seems to be germany 's intransigence that is the main hurdle to eu-wide agreement being reached on a reform of the pact , analysts said . " the sticking point seems to be germany 's insistence that some allowance should be made for unification costs and the net contribution to the eu budget , " said dresdner kleinwort wasserstein economist anthony thomas in an interview with afp .
" although the german government is unlikely to be permitted such clear allowances , the question is whether finance ministers or government chiefs will be able to come up with appropriate wording to satisfy all parties , " thomas said . there was no sign friday of the stalemate being broken .
in fact , both sides appeared to be digging their heels in . pact struggles divide the european union bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder finds himself in the opposite camp to austrian counterpart and pact supporter wolfgang schüssel .
austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel insisted that the stability pact should be applied to the letter , while five big member states - namely germany , france , italy , spain and britain - had reportedly reached tacit agreement to block what they deemed to be an all too mechanistic or rigid implementation of the rules . addressing a press conference in schüssel 's home city of vienna on friday , german chancellor gerhard schroeder said berlin was not pushing for a modification of the pact " but an interpretation that makes economic sense " . " we want an interpretation that takes into account both stability and growth , " the german leader added . optimism remains despite sharpened knives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker .
luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , downplayed the lack of progress .
" if we do n't reach an agreement on sunday it will not be a catastrophe .
it will not prevent us finding an accord at the summit . " as things stand , it looks as if a general list will simply be drawn up of factors justifying an excessive deficit .
and " the danger is that the list could be so vague that it could be used to justify any overrun , " thomas said . in the end , the choice facing eu leaders would be to hold on to a stability pact that effectively remains suspended in its current form " or to reform it so that it is virtually toothless " , the economist said .
" so it wo n't really matter whether agreement is reached or not , at least for the moment , " thomas concluded . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu moves to renew battered fiscal rules the eu hopes to hammer out the main points of a revised budget rule book this week , 16 months after the pact meant to protect the euro was left in tatters by eu heavyweight states bent on reviving their ailing economies .

" you have to be able to separate one from the other , " he told journalists while visiting kiev on monday . the investigation into whether or not relaxed visa criteria allowed organized crime , black market businesses and prostitution to flow into germany unchecked was an internal matter , fischer said , and one that he was prepared to deal with . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko appealed for closer eu ties during a recent speech at the german bundestag .
" the other is the development of a democratic ukraine , " fischer said .
" and that has great significance for europe . " the way to the west , he said , should not only be a valid prospect on an institutional level , but also for the average citizen . former ambassador joins critics in germany , meanwhile , another voice has joined the chorus of criticism aimed at fischer for his involvement in the visa affair .
a former high-ranking german ambassador said on saturday that german authorities were not checking visa applications thoroughly enough . " it was clear that we were not examining the files enough and that many people were passing through the loopholes for unknown reasons , " ernst-jörg von studnitz , former ambassador to russia from 1995 to 2002 , told the german news agency dpa . " green ideology " fischer , whose standing as the most popular politician in germany has taken a hammering over the visa affair , did not pay enough attention to the visa policy , von studnitz charged . the former ambassador said fischer 's policy was " the attempt to put into practice the green ideology . " von studnitz said the ministry took too long to react to the abuse of the liberalized visa regulations introduced under fischer . " apparently , we just shut our eyes .
this happens often when ideological elements are slipped into political practice , " von studnitz told der spiegel weekly in an interviewed published on monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting outside the german consulate in kiev , december 2004 der spiegel also reported that the ministry acknowledged that the visa policy had led to illegal immigration in an internal memo dated july 2004 . fischer has acknowledged making mistakes but has refused to resign .

but some economists say more flexibility was needed . germany was one of the prime architects of the stability pact , worried that the profligate ways of smaller eu members would weaken the common currency 's strength .
germany was , at the time of the pact 's adoption , about to leave behind its beloved deutschmark , which had been a steady , stable friend of the country for decades . but over the past months , germany , along with france and italy , has been at the forefront of the drive to water down the pact . on sunday , its efforts bore fruit , and eu ministers agreed on a plan that includes giving germany special treatment because of the high costs of reunification , which germany has said is largely to blame for its inability over the past three years to keep its deficit under the three-percent mark required by the original stability pact . germany has breached the stability pact rules for the last three years and looks on its way to doing it again . there 's a definite sense of satisfaction coming from german finance minister hans eichel , who said the reworked pact is " more rational economically -lsb- and -rsb- more growth friendly , " since it takes into consideration the country 's economic growth and phases of stagnation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eating away at the euro ?
but germany 's opposition is calling the compromise set forth by the 25 eu ministers nothing short of disastrous . " we 've all received a clear signal that the euro will not be as strong as the former deutschmark , " said michael meister , finance spokesman for the conservative christian democrats .
" what 's worse , confidence and trust in the reliability of the european union is being destroyed on a massive scale only because a few countries – germany included – are not willing to display budgetary discipline . ” a " sin " theo waigel , finance minister under former chancellor helmut kohl and member of the bavarian-based christian social union , called the loosening of the pact a " sin against our children " who he said will be left to shoulder the debt of their parents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former finance minister theo waigel , left , with his boss , former chancellor helmut kohl .
waigel , who was finance minister when the stability and growth pact was adopted in 1997 , said the government then had purposefully left out considerations of the cost of reunification in drawing up the agreement . " because then we knew we 'd have every country citing their own special problems , " he said , adding that germany had now abandoned its position as a leading advocate of euro stability in europe . there was criticism on the european level as well .
othmar karas , an austrian who represents the european people 's party in strasburg , said it was a grave mistake to bow to the german government 's demand for special treatment over reunification .
he called the reunification justification for changing the pact 's rules just an excuse , since the financial burden of german reunification started far before the year 2000 , when germany exceeded deficit limits for the first time . " no , it started 15 years ago , and for most of the time germany had enough discipline not to let the financial situation get out of control despite the additional burden , " he said .
" in other words , there ’ s no justification whatsoever to insist on special treatment now . ” a few voices in favor despite the reproaches of opposition politicians and other experts , some german economists have a more sanguine outlook regarding the relaxation of the pact .

" after all , we are shouldering the entire weight of german reunification , " he said . german spends four percent of its gross domestic product on transfers to the former communist eastern part of the country .
the government estimates it has transferred 1.5 trillion euros -lrb- $ 2 trillion -rrb- since the berlin wall fell 15 years ago . finance minister hans eichel said german reunification was a " unique problem " that needed to be adequately addressed .
he said the agreement did not mean german was abandoning the goal of keeping its deficit under three percent of gdp . " of course i want to stick to it , " he said . boost for schröder the move by the eu 's finance ministers has given chancellor gerhard schröder an economic and political boost at a time when he badly needs it .

but some economists say more flexibility was needed . germany was one of the prime architects of the stability pact , worried that the profligate ways of smaller eu members would weaken the common currency 's strength .
germany was , at the time of the pact 's adoption , about to leave behind its beloved deutschmark , which had been a steady , stable friend of the country for decades . but over the past months , germany , along with france and italy , has been at the forefront of the drive to water down the pact . on sunday , its efforts bore fruit , and eu ministers agreed on a plan that includes giving germany special treatment because of the high costs of reunification , which germany has said is largely to blame for its inability over the past three years to keep its deficit under the three-percent mark required by the original stability pact . germany has breached the stability pact rules for the last three years and looks on its way to doing it again . there 's a definite sense of satisfaction coming from german finance minister hans eichel , who said the reworked pact is " more rational economically -lsb- and -rsb- more growth friendly , " since it takes into consideration the country 's economic growth and phases of stagnation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eating away at the euro ?
but germany 's opposition is calling the compromise set forth by the 25 eu ministers nothing short of disastrous . " we 've all received a clear signal that the euro will not be as strong as the former deutschmark , " said michael meister , finance spokesman for the conservative christian democrats .
" what 's worse , confidence and trust in the reliability of the european union is being destroyed on a massive scale only because a few countries – germany included – are not willing to display budgetary discipline . ” a " sin " theo waigel , finance minister under former chancellor helmut kohl and member of the bavarian-based christian social union , called the loosening of the pact a " sin against our children " who he said will be left to shoulder the debt of their parents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former finance minister theo waigel , left , with his boss , former chancellor helmut kohl .
waigel , who was finance minister when the stability and growth pact was adopted in 1997 , said the government then had purposefully left out considerations of the cost of reunification in drawing up the agreement . " because then we knew we 'd have every country citing their own special problems , " he said , adding that germany had now abandoned its position as a leading advocate of euro stability in europe . there was criticism on the european level as well .
othmar karas , an austrian who represents the european people 's party in strasburg , said it was a grave mistake to bow to the german government 's demand for special treatment over reunification .
he called the reunification justification for changing the pact 's rules just an excuse , since the financial burden of german reunification started far before the year 2000 , when germany exceeded deficit limits for the first time . " no , it started 15 years ago , and for most of the time germany had enough discipline not to let the financial situation get out of control despite the additional burden , " he said .
" in other words , there ’ s no justification whatsoever to insist on special treatment now . ” a few voices in favor despite the reproaches of opposition politicians and other experts , some german economists have a more sanguine outlook regarding the relaxation of the pact .
most currency analysts said they did not fear a substantial weakening of the euro because of the new rules . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : balloon euro .
will it deflate soon ?
manfred kurz of the bavarian state bank said adding more flexibility to the stability agreement could give countries like germany more room to develop growth-oriented economic policies . the president of the halle institute for economic research , ulrich blum , told the reuters news agency that taking the particular economic difficulties of a country into consideration is not bad policy .
" after all , we are shouldering the entire weight of german reunification , " he said . german spends four percent of its gross domestic product on transfers to the former communist eastern part of the country .
the government estimates it has transferred 1.5 trillion euros -lrb- $ 2 trillion -rrb- since the berlin wall fell 15 years ago . finance minister hans eichel said german reunification was a " unique problem " that needed to be adequately addressed .
he said the agreement did not mean german was abandoning the goal of keeping its deficit under three percent of gdp . " of course i want to stick to it , " he said . boost for schröder the move by the eu 's finance ministers has given chancellor gerhard schröder an economic and political boost at a time when he badly needs it .
the government in berlin is struggling to overcome years of economic stagnation and an unemployment rate that has reached 12.6 percent , a rate not seen since the 1930s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder , left , with french president jacques chirac , another advocate of changing the euro rules .
the pact decision will lessen the likelihood that germany will face punitive action from brussels for not keeping its deficit down .
the change could inspire hope that the government will have room to spend and perhaps bring the unemployment rate down below the psychologically important number of five million . schröder 's party , the social democrats , is facing an important state election on may 22 in its traditional stronghold of north rhine-westphalia .
it is currently trailing the opposition in opinion polls .

germany increased troop numbers there recently as part of a european union effort to maintain a fragile peace . struck 's visit to the southern serb province of kosovo comes almost exactly a year after an outbreak of anti-serb violence there left 19 dead and hundreds injured .
then , serb villages were attacked by ethnic albanians for three days - while nato peacekeepers , including those from germany , did nothing to stop them . the defense minister 's two-day encounter with about 3,000 german troops in kosovo is primarily meant to boost morale in what many experts say is a hopeless mission .
general klaus reinhardt , commander of the nato-led kosovo force in 1999 , said the international community would not be able to end the violence simply sending more troops to the province . root causes remain " three additional brigades have been sent down there , but the root causes for the riots have not been tackled , " reinhardt said .
" since political and social disenchantment remain , there is bound to be a repeat of the ethnic clashes .
for many , it ’ s one year on and nothing has changed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramush haradinaj earlier this month , germany sent an additional 600 troops to kosovo to calm tensions after ethnic albanian prime minister ramush haradinaj -lrb- photo -rrb- resigned and surrendered to the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia in the hague . nato has around 18,000 peacekeepers in the province and a united nations mission spokesman claimed last week that the security situation had improved substantially .
there are also plans by the un to start final negotiations on the status of kosovo this summer - a decision struck said was needed as soon as possible . " we can only help our troops make sense of their mission as long as there is political progress , " the german defense minister said .
over the long term , military engagement in kosovo would be hard to justify if serbian enclaves were protected without any will on the part of serbs and ethnic albanians in kosovo to live together in peace , he added . possible reduction in bosnia in bosnia , where struck will meet with political leaders on tuesday , the situation is much more stable .
that has already led to calls for a substantial reduction in the number of foreign troops stationed there . the eu took over the bosnian mission from nato in december last year .
it has maintained troop levels at around 7,000 in what is the eu ’ s largest such operation to date .
but eu officials are reviewing whether troop numbers can be reduced to around 5,000 . the leaders of the eu force , which also includes troops from non-eu countries , describe conditions as peaceful .
but they also say that , a decade after the end of the bosnian war , it 's proved impossible to stamp out the ethnic tensions that fuelled the balkans wars . uwe hessler -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de foreign missions trouble soldiers although germany has handed over the reins of the international security assistance force to canada , 1,700 german soldiers remain in afghanistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 21.03.2005 learning to be single-friendly großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shopping for the right amount for one person is n't easy over 20 percent of german homes are one-person households .
but singles are a very heterogeneous group and therefore pose a particular challenge as consumers . in germany , the bestseller “ bridget jones ’ s diary ” was translated into “ schokolade zum frühstück ” or “ chocolate for breakfast . ”
for many , bridget jones personifies the stereotypical image of a single : having chocolate for breakfast and a glass -lrb- or more -rrb- of chardonnay for dinner . but the reality looks quite different . “ studies on one-person households show that particularly young professionals who earn good money are very interested in fresh products and are more likely to buy brand goods , ” said doris rosenkranz , a sociology professor at the university of applied sciences in würzburg and author of several publications on consumer habits . making single life more convenient according to figures from the federal statistics office , 20.7 percent of germany ’ s adult population - or 13.8 million people - live in one-person households .
in cities , this figure can reach over 50 percent . retailers are aware that they have to address all consumers , including singles , said olaf roik from the german retailers ’ association hde .
“ we try to do this through well-targeted marketing , especially in cities which have a higher number of one-person households , ” he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pizza is n't the only alternative for singles anymore german supermarkets have in fact come a long way since frozen pizza was the only option for a quick meal after work .
but fast , healthy meals for one-person households are a more recent development in germany , compared to these markets in the united states or britain . rewe , one of the leading groups in the european grocery trade , said it particularly addresses singles ’ needs in city stores . “ we especially offer a lot in the convenience sector , that is food that is ready-to-eat , ” said press spokeswoman astrid ohletz .
“ for example , we have fresh soups , sushi or pre-prepared fruit . ” singles : hip or fate ? rosenkranz points out that singles are not just students living alone or young professionals , though .

take your average major supermarket in cologne : 250 grams of regular butter costs between 0.99 euros and 1.29 euros -lrb- $ 1.31-1.70 -rrb- , depending on the brand .
but 125 grams costs 0.79 euro . another example is philadelphia cream cheese .
the regular size of 200 grams costs 1.49 euros .
but the single-friendly sized six-pack of 16.7 grams each , which comes to about half of the regular size , costs 1.19 euros . hde explained that this price difference is not discriminatory against singles .
it ’ s simply due to packaging and logistics costs , which are not necessarily half as great as for a big package .
“ large volumes are also less expensive , ” said roik .
“ that ’ s just the way it is . ” the “ living-alone-together ” single the larger packaging is not necessarily a problem for many younger singles aged between 25 and 35 .
“ these are so-called lats or ‘ living-alone-together ’ singles , who live alone , but often have a partner , ” rosenkranz explained .
“ in terms of consumption , this group often buys for the partner , too . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : singles prefer to eat their pizza in the restaurant in addition , lats spend above-average amounts on eating outside of their home , either in restaurants or with take-away food , she said . this group of singles is also not interested in the frozen dinners and mini-sized pizzas available on the market .
“ our research showed that this type of food mostly appeals to working mothers rather than singles , ” said rosenkranz . the internet ’ s potential for singles in his book “ consumer behavior in one-person households , ” the economic sociologist wilhelm ott wrote that eating well is important for the majority of singles . “ for many , eating and drinking express a certain lifestyle , ” said ott .
“ especially younger people living alone want to underline the particular quality of their way of life . ” in this sense , the internet holds a great potential for the singles ’ consumer market , said rosenkranz . “ it would be especially interesting for working singles if they could do their shopping online during the day , ” she said .

but singles are a very heterogeneous group and therefore pose a particular challenge as consumers . in germany , the bestseller “ bridget jones ’ s diary ” was translated into “ schokolade zum frühstück ” or “ chocolate for breakfast . ”
for many , bridget jones personifies the stereotypical image of a single : having chocolate for breakfast and a glass -lrb- or more -rrb- of chardonnay for dinner . but the reality looks quite different . “ studies on one-person households show that particularly young professionals who earn good money are very interested in fresh products and are more likely to buy brand goods , ” said doris rosenkranz , a sociology professor at the university of applied sciences in würzburg and author of several publications on consumer habits . making single life more convenient according to figures from the federal statistics office , 20.7 percent of germany ’ s adult population - or 13.8 million people - live in one-person households .
in cities , this figure can reach over 50 percent . retailers are aware that they have to address all consumers , including singles , said olaf roik from the german retailers ’ association hde .
“ we try to do this through well-targeted marketing , especially in cities which have a higher number of one-person households , ” he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pizza is n't the only alternative for singles anymore german supermarkets have in fact come a long way since frozen pizza was the only option for a quick meal after work .
but fast , healthy meals for one-person households are a more recent development in germany , compared to these markets in the united states or britain . rewe , one of the leading groups in the european grocery trade , said it particularly addresses singles ’ needs in city stores . “ we especially offer a lot in the convenience sector , that is food that is ready-to-eat , ” said press spokeswoman astrid ohletz .
“ for example , we have fresh soups , sushi or pre-prepared fruit . ” singles : hip or fate ? rosenkranz points out that singles are not just students living alone or young professionals , though .
“ singles are a very heterogeneous group , ” she said .
“ what is a hip lifestyle for some is fate for another .

but with three weeks left and little progress to date , mutual recriminations have begun . the dispute flared up again on friday when us negotiator robert zoellick decided to step up the pressure after meeting with his european counterpart , eu trade commissioner peter mandelson .
zoellick 's spokesman said " the europeans are clearly unwilling to eliminate the subsidies , " and said if necessary the united states was ready to return to litigation at the wto . this triggered a warning saturday from brussels that it would also make claims against washington .
" if the us decides to move to the wto approach , which we hope they will not , obviously we would launch our own counter-case , " said a european commission official who spoke to afp on condition of anonymity . complaints traded across the atlantic the united states lodged a complaint against eu subsidies to france-based airbus with the wto in october , which brought a counteraction from brussels against what it termed indirect us government aid for chicago-based boeing . but the agreement in january to try to resolve the dispute by renegotiating a 1992 bilateral accord that set the terms of assistance to aircraft makers effectively froze the wto procedure , which eu officials had said would have been a " disastrous " legal clash .

" we have n't changed positions or made specific demands , " said the eu official , adding that " we 've indicated we want pertinent questions added " to the discussions . the eu believes that no comprehensive deal can be reached by april 11 given the complexities of the issues .
instead it has proposed cutting the negotiations into two and reaching by the deadline next month " a more modest package that creates confidence " to reach a comprehensive deal at a later date . but if the eu is ready to put on the table the launch aid for airbus aircraft it expects " an equivalent contribution " from the united states , said the official . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus , boeing dispute could become us-eu problem a massive dispute is brewing between airbus and its archrival , chicago-based boeing .

france is the world 's largest manufacturer of luxury goods ; 250,000 people are employed by the sector .
but 38,000 jobs are lost every year due to counterfeiting .
designer brands spend millions annually fighting fakes . fshion labels like hermès , chanel and louis vuitton may have made france the world leader when it comes to luxury products . but , the country is also the global loser from illegal competition from fakes .
in france , according to the customs service , the counterfeit business is booming . at a freight depot at orly airport , just outside of paris , a customs officer slits open a box of socks as he settles in to another day 's work protecting the biggest luxury industry in the world .
last year , he and his colleagues found and destroyed some three million fakes , double what they had taken in the previous year .
in one seizure in january , they found enough louis vuitton fabric to cover 54 tennis courts . " there are hundreds of millions of fake products out there , " said marc-antoine jamet , secretary-general of louis vuitton 's parent company , lvmh .
he said counterfeiting has become a colossal world industry representing more than five percent of all world trade . " look what companies spend fighting fakes : three million euros a year for lacoste , 15 million for vuitton , " he said .
" this is a problem on an industrial scale . " everyday people although organized crime plays a role in the matter , normally law-abiding people are also part of the problem .
people on holiday , for example , who see good copies which look like amazing bargains that ca n't be passed up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at orly airport , people returning from holidays abroad are greeted with posters of the lacoste crocodile and a chanel handbag warning them that bringing fakes into france is a criminal offense . " we 've been to turkey several times on holiday with the children and , i can tell you , when you 're with teenagers and you see designer labels for a fifth of what you 'd pay back home , it 's tempting , " said one woman returning for vacation who did n't want to give her name . she said during the summers , she would get a new wardrobe for her kids with fake goods , mostly jeans , t-shirts and sweatshirts , always with a little designer logo and never in any doubt that she was buying fakes . " for me , there 's a bit of getting our own back on companies who , as soon as they get a brand that sells well , charge astronomical prices , " she said . but her purchasing patterns could be risky .
people who are discovered bringing in fake goods can get hefty fines .
generally if there are one or two fake goods , people are let off .
but with higher quantities , people can pay fines that are more than double what the goods are actually worth . the shame of it all for some , though , buying or wearing counterfeit goods is , well , simply l 'horreur . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fake chanel watch " i 'm used to seeing all these fake vuitton or prada bags in asia , " said marion dufour , a fashion editor at the women 's magazine group marie-claire international . " i imagine myself wearing it and arriving at a famous fashion party with all of these beautiful people and all of a sudden a pr or a fashion editor will arrive and she will discover and find out that it is a fake one .
and i think i would really feel shame ! " but the big names of the luxury industry along paris ' avenue montaigne want counterfeiters to feel more than shame .
in the sixteenth century , people would get their hand cut off for making a fake .
today they might have to pay nearly $ 500,000 -lrb- 375,800 euros -rrb- : the maximum fine was doubled last year .
that high amount shows that for france there 's much at stake - not just money , but the image of the country itself . john laurenson -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lagerfeld has world domination all sewn-up a hard-to-miss presence at the paris ready-to-wear week , karl lagerfeld hit the headlines with his hemlines , presenting his new pret-a-porter collection .

but with three weeks left and little progress to date , mutual recriminations have begun . the dispute flared up again on friday when us negotiator robert zoellick decided to step up the pressure after meeting with his european counterpart , eu trade commissioner peter mandelson .
zoellick 's spokesman said " the europeans are clearly unwilling to eliminate the subsidies , " and said if necessary the united states was ready to return to litigation at the wto . this triggered a warning saturday from brussels that it would also make claims against washington .
" if the us decides to move to the wto approach , which we hope they will not , obviously we would launch our own counter-case , " said a european commission official who spoke to afp on condition of anonymity . complaints traded across the atlantic the united states lodged a complaint against eu subsidies to france-based airbus with the wto in october , which brought a counteraction from brussels against what it termed indirect us government aid for chicago-based boeing . but the agreement in january to try to resolve the dispute by renegotiating a 1992 bilateral accord that set the terms of assistance to aircraft makers effectively froze the wto procedure , which eu officials had said would have been a " disastrous " legal clash .
the two sides agreed to freeze subsidies while they negotiate the new agreement . washington tones down fighting talk washington on saturday dropped the saber rattling , and said it was ready to extend the deadline for reaching an agreement .
" we are very willing to continue talking , using the january 11 agreement as the basis - and we are willing to extend the terms of the january agreement , " us trade representative spokesman richard mills told afp . but " the problem is that over the last two months the eu has been focused more on maneuvering than on negotiating the core substance , " mills said by telephone from washington .
" as far as we are concerned , we 're ready to continue the negotiations , " the eu official said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the boeing dreamliner .
however , should no agreement be reached , " nothing would prevent the eu governments to put up the launch aid for the a350 , " the eu official warned , referring to the long-haul jet which would rival boeing 's 787 " dreamliner " . europe wants " pertinent " questions answered part of the difficulties in the negotiations is that the europeans are trying to reach agreements on two issues that were not included as part of the january agreement : japanese aid for development of boeing 's 787 and the foreign sales corporations -lrb- fscs -rrb- that us companies use to lower their taxes . " we have n't changed positions or made specific demands , " said the eu official , adding that " we 've indicated we want pertinent questions added " to the discussions . the eu believes that no comprehensive deal can be reached by april 11 given the complexities of the issues .
instead it has proposed cutting the negotiations into two and reaching by the deadline next month " a more modest package that creates confidence " to reach a comprehensive deal at a later date . but if the eu is ready to put on the table the launch aid for airbus aircraft it expects " an equivalent contribution " from the united states , said the official . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus , boeing dispute could become us-eu problem a massive dispute is brewing between airbus and its archrival , chicago-based boeing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 21.03.2005 fake designer goods cost france dearly großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is that really louis vuitton ?
france is the world 's largest manufacturer of luxury goods ; 250,000 people are employed by the sector .
but 38,000 jobs are lost every year due to counterfeiting .
designer brands spend millions annually fighting fakes . fshion labels like hermès , chanel and louis vuitton may have made france the world leader when it comes to luxury products . but , the country is also the global loser from illegal competition from fakes .
in france , according to the customs service , the counterfeit business is booming . at a freight depot at orly airport , just outside of paris , a customs officer slits open a box of socks as he settles in to another day 's work protecting the biggest luxury industry in the world .
last year , he and his colleagues found and destroyed some three million fakes , double what they had taken in the previous year .
in one seizure in january , they found enough louis vuitton fabric to cover 54 tennis courts . " there are hundreds of millions of fake products out there , " said marc-antoine jamet , secretary-general of louis vuitton 's parent company , lvmh .
he said counterfeiting has become a colossal world industry representing more than five percent of all world trade . " look what companies spend fighting fakes : three million euros a year for lacoste , 15 million for vuitton , " he said .
" this is a problem on an industrial scale . " everyday people although organized crime plays a role in the matter , normally law-abiding people are also part of the problem .
people on holiday , for example , who see good copies which look like amazing bargains that ca n't be passed up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at orly airport , people returning from holidays abroad are greeted with posters of the lacoste crocodile and a chanel handbag warning them that bringing fakes into france is a criminal offense . " we 've been to turkey several times on holiday with the children and , i can tell you , when you 're with teenagers and you see designer labels for a fifth of what you 'd pay back home , it 's tempting , " said one woman returning for vacation who did n't want to give her name . she said during the summers , she would get a new wardrobe for her kids with fake goods , mostly jeans , t-shirts and sweatshirts , always with a little designer logo and never in any doubt that she was buying fakes . " for me , there 's a bit of getting our own back on companies who , as soon as they get a brand that sells well , charge astronomical prices , " she said . but her purchasing patterns could be risky .
people who are discovered bringing in fake goods can get hefty fines .
generally if there are one or two fake goods , people are let off .
but with higher quantities , people can pay fines that are more than double what the goods are actually worth . the shame of it all for some , though , buying or wearing counterfeit goods is , well , simply l 'horreur . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fake chanel watch " i 'm used to seeing all these fake vuitton or prada bags in asia , " said marion dufour , a fashion editor at the women 's magazine group marie-claire international . " i imagine myself wearing it and arriving at a famous fashion party with all of these beautiful people and all of a sudden a pr or a fashion editor will arrive and she will discover and find out that it is a fake one .
and i think i would really feel shame ! " but the big names of the luxury industry along paris ' avenue montaigne want counterfeiters to feel more than shame .
in the sixteenth century , people would get their hand cut off for making a fake .
today they might have to pay nearly $ 500,000 -lrb- 375,800 euros -rrb- : the maximum fine was doubled last year .
that high amount shows that for france there 's much at stake - not just money , but the image of the country itself . john laurenson -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lagerfeld has world domination all sewn-up a hard-to-miss presence at the paris ready-to-wear week , karl lagerfeld hit the headlines with his hemlines , presenting his new pret-a-porter collection .

in france , according to the customs service , the counterfeit business is booming . at a freight depot at orly airport , just outside of paris , a customs officer slits open a box of socks as he settles in to another day 's work protecting the biggest luxury industry in the world .
last year , he and his colleagues found and destroyed some three million fakes , double what they had taken in the previous year .
in one seizure in january , they found enough louis vuitton fabric to cover 54 tennis courts . " there are hundreds of millions of fake products out there , " said marc-antoine jamet , secretary-general of louis vuitton 's parent company , lvmh .
he said counterfeiting has become a colossal world industry representing more than five percent of all world trade . " look what companies spend fighting fakes : three million euros a year for lacoste , 15 million for vuitton , " he said .
" this is a problem on an industrial scale . " everyday people although organized crime plays a role in the matter , normally law-abiding people are also part of the problem .

" we 've been to turkey several times on holiday with the children and , i can tell you , when you 're with teenagers and you see designer labels for a fifth of what you 'd pay back home , it 's tempting , " said one woman returning for vacation who did n't want to give her name . she said during the summers , she would get a new wardrobe for her kids with fake goods , mostly jeans , t-shirts and sweatshirts , always with a little designer logo and never in any doubt that she was buying fakes . " for me , there 's a bit of getting our own back on companies who , as soon as they get a brand that sells well , charge astronomical prices , " she said . but her purchasing patterns could be risky .
people who are discovered bringing in fake goods can get hefty fines .
generally if there are one or two fake goods , people are let off .
but with higher quantities , people can pay fines that are more than double what the goods are actually worth . the shame of it all for some , though , buying or wearing counterfeit goods is , well , simply l 'horreur . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fake chanel watch " i 'm used to seeing all these fake vuitton or prada bags in asia , " said marion dufour , a fashion editor at the women 's magazine group marie-claire international .

countries are expected to head for public surpluses in times of growth .
breaches of the limits are to be punished with stiff financial penalties . reality shows a long list of repeat offenders so much for the theory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder : " you pay . "
chirac : " no , you pay . "
in reality , nearly half the eu 's 25 members have since run up so-called excessive deficits , with france and germany topping the list of offenders . indeed , the euro zone heavyweights ' deficit ratios have been well above the 3.0-percent limit for the past three years and there is every indication that , with growth expected to remain sluggish at best , they will break the rules again this year . while smaller euro zone countries have swallowed the pact 's bitter medicine and managed to get their finances in order , laggards france and germany have long campaigned for a softening of the rules . they want special mitigating factors to be taken into account when evaluating the state of a country 's public finances , with germany particularly vocal in arguing that the astronomic costs of unification and its massive net contribution to the eu budget form part of the equation . generous germany on the ropes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel indicates the deficit to the german bundestag .
germany has ploughed hundreds of billions of euros into unification and is the biggest net contributor to the eu budget .
but the euro zone 's biggest economy also narrowly escaped its third recession in four years at the end of last year and unemployment in germany currently stands at a post-war high of 5.2 million or 12.6 percent of the population . and even current finance minister hans eichel , who originally presented himself as an iron-fisted and merciless cutter of costs and public-spending , now argues that tightening germany 's purse strings will only make matters worse .
it seems to be germany 's intransigence that is the main hurdle to eu-wide agreement being reached on a reform of the pact , analysts said . " the sticking point seems to be germany 's insistence that some allowance should be made for unification costs and the net contribution to the eu budget , " said dresdner kleinwort wasserstein economist anthony thomas in an interview with afp .
" although the german government is unlikely to be permitted such clear allowances , the question is whether finance ministers or government chiefs will be able to come up with appropriate wording to satisfy all parties , " thomas said . there was no sign friday of the stalemate being broken .
in fact , both sides appeared to be digging their heels in . pact struggles divide the european union bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder finds himself in the opposite camp to austrian counterpart and pact supporter wolfgang schüssel .
austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel insisted that the stability pact should be applied to the letter , while five big member states - namely germany , france , italy , spain and britain - had reportedly reached tacit agreement to block what they deemed to be an all too mechanistic or rigid implementation of the rules . addressing a press conference in schüssel 's home city of vienna on friday , german chancellor gerhard schroeder said berlin was not pushing for a modification of the pact " but an interpretation that makes economic sense " . " we want an interpretation that takes into account both stability and growth , " the german leader added . optimism remains despite sharpened knives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker .
luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , downplayed the lack of progress .
" if we do n't reach an agreement on sunday it will not be a catastrophe .
it will not prevent us finding an accord at the summit . " as things stand , it looks as if a general list will simply be drawn up of factors justifying an excessive deficit .
and " the danger is that the list could be so vague that it could be used to justify any overrun , " thomas said . in the end , the choice facing eu leaders would be to hold on to a stability pact that effectively remains suspended in its current form " or to reform it so that it is virtually toothless " , the economist said .
" so it wo n't really matter whether agreement is reached or not , at least for the moment , " thomas concluded . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu moves to renew battered fiscal rules the eu hopes to hammer out the main points of a revised budget rule book this week , 16 months after the pact meant to protect the euro was left in tatters by eu heavyweight states bent on reviving their ailing economies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 21.03.2005 us-eu airbus row hits turbulence großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe toasted the new airbus but continued subsidies anger the us talks between brussels and washington to resolve a dispute over subsidies for aircraft makers airbus and boeing have descended into a row with both sides threatening a damaging legal clash at the wto . the two agreed in january to avoid a bruising battle at the world trade organization and negotiate by april 11 a phase out of subsidies to develop commercial aircraft .
but with three weeks left and little progress to date , mutual recriminations have begun . the dispute flared up again on friday when us negotiator robert zoellick decided to step up the pressure after meeting with his european counterpart , eu trade commissioner peter mandelson .
zoellick 's spokesman said " the europeans are clearly unwilling to eliminate the subsidies , " and said if necessary the united states was ready to return to litigation at the wto . this triggered a warning saturday from brussels that it would also make claims against washington .
" if the us decides to move to the wto approach , which we hope they will not , obviously we would launch our own counter-case , " said a european commission official who spoke to afp on condition of anonymity . complaints traded across the atlantic the united states lodged a complaint against eu subsidies to france-based airbus with the wto in october , which brought a counteraction from brussels against what it termed indirect us government aid for chicago-based boeing . but the agreement in january to try to resolve the dispute by renegotiating a 1992 bilateral accord that set the terms of assistance to aircraft makers effectively froze the wto procedure , which eu officials had said would have been a " disastrous " legal clash .
the two sides agreed to freeze subsidies while they negotiate the new agreement . washington tones down fighting talk washington on saturday dropped the saber rattling , and said it was ready to extend the deadline for reaching an agreement .
" we are very willing to continue talking , using the january 11 agreement as the basis - and we are willing to extend the terms of the january agreement , " us trade representative spokesman richard mills told afp . but " the problem is that over the last two months the eu has been focused more on maneuvering than on negotiating the core substance , " mills said by telephone from washington .
" as far as we are concerned , we 're ready to continue the negotiations , " the eu official said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the boeing dreamliner .
however , should no agreement be reached , " nothing would prevent the eu governments to put up the launch aid for the a350 , " the eu official warned , referring to the long-haul jet which would rival boeing 's 787 " dreamliner " . europe wants " pertinent " questions answered part of the difficulties in the negotiations is that the europeans are trying to reach agreements on two issues that were not included as part of the january agreement : japanese aid for development of boeing 's 787 and the foreign sales corporations -lrb- fscs -rrb- that us companies use to lower their taxes . " we have n't changed positions or made specific demands , " said the eu official , adding that " we 've indicated we want pertinent questions added " to the discussions . the eu believes that no comprehensive deal can be reached by april 11 given the complexities of the issues .
instead it has proposed cutting the negotiations into two and reaching by the deadline next month " a more modest package that creates confidence " to reach a comprehensive deal at a later date . but if the eu is ready to put on the table the launch aid for airbus aircraft it expects " an equivalent contribution " from the united states , said the official . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus , boeing dispute could become us-eu problem a massive dispute is brewing between airbus and its archrival , chicago-based boeing .

france is the world 's largest manufacturer of luxury goods ; 250,000 people are employed by the sector .
but 38,000 jobs are lost every year due to counterfeiting .
designer brands spend millions annually fighting fakes . fshion labels like hermès , chanel and louis vuitton may have made france the world leader when it comes to luxury products . but , the country is also the global loser from illegal competition from fakes .
in france , according to the customs service , the counterfeit business is booming . at a freight depot at orly airport , just outside of paris , a customs officer slits open a box of socks as he settles in to another day 's work protecting the biggest luxury industry in the world .
last year , he and his colleagues found and destroyed some three million fakes , double what they had taken in the previous year .
in one seizure in january , they found enough louis vuitton fabric to cover 54 tennis courts . " there are hundreds of millions of fake products out there , " said marc-antoine jamet , secretary-general of louis vuitton 's parent company , lvmh .
he said counterfeiting has become a colossal world industry representing more than five percent of all world trade . " look what companies spend fighting fakes : three million euros a year for lacoste , 15 million for vuitton , " he said .
" this is a problem on an industrial scale . " everyday people although organized crime plays a role in the matter , normally law-abiding people are also part of the problem .
people on holiday , for example , who see good copies which look like amazing bargains that ca n't be passed up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at orly airport , people returning from holidays abroad are greeted with posters of the lacoste crocodile and a chanel handbag warning them that bringing fakes into france is a criminal offense . " we 've been to turkey several times on holiday with the children and , i can tell you , when you 're with teenagers and you see designer labels for a fifth of what you 'd pay back home , it 's tempting , " said one woman returning for vacation who did n't want to give her name . she said during the summers , she would get a new wardrobe for her kids with fake goods , mostly jeans , t-shirts and sweatshirts , always with a little designer logo and never in any doubt that she was buying fakes . " for me , there 's a bit of getting our own back on companies who , as soon as they get a brand that sells well , charge astronomical prices , " she said . but her purchasing patterns could be risky .
people who are discovered bringing in fake goods can get hefty fines .
generally if there are one or two fake goods , people are let off .
but with higher quantities , people can pay fines that are more than double what the goods are actually worth . the shame of it all for some , though , buying or wearing counterfeit goods is , well , simply l 'horreur . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fake chanel watch " i 'm used to seeing all these fake vuitton or prada bags in asia , " said marion dufour , a fashion editor at the women 's magazine group marie-claire international . " i imagine myself wearing it and arriving at a famous fashion party with all of these beautiful people and all of a sudden a pr or a fashion editor will arrive and she will discover and find out that it is a fake one .
and i think i would really feel shame ! " but the big names of the luxury industry along paris ' avenue montaigne want counterfeiters to feel more than shame .
in the sixteenth century , people would get their hand cut off for making a fake .
today they might have to pay nearly $ 500,000 -lrb- 375,800 euros -rrb- : the maximum fine was doubled last year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 21.03.2005 learning to be single-friendly großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shopping for the right amount for one person is n't easy over 20 percent of german homes are one-person households .
but singles are a very heterogeneous group and therefore pose a particular challenge as consumers . in germany , the bestseller “ bridget jones ’ s diary ” was translated into “ schokolade zum frühstück ” or “ chocolate for breakfast . ”
for many , bridget jones personifies the stereotypical image of a single : having chocolate for breakfast and a glass -lrb- or more -rrb- of chardonnay for dinner . but the reality looks quite different . “ studies on one-person households show that particularly young professionals who earn good money are very interested in fresh products and are more likely to buy brand goods , ” said doris rosenkranz , a sociology professor at the university of applied sciences in würzburg and author of several publications on consumer habits . making single life more convenient according to figures from the federal statistics office , 20.7 percent of germany ’ s adult population - or 13.8 million people - live in one-person households .
in cities , this figure can reach over 50 percent . retailers are aware that they have to address all consumers , including singles , said olaf roik from the german retailers ’ association hde .
“ we try to do this through well-targeted marketing , especially in cities which have a higher number of one-person households , ” he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pizza is n't the only alternative for singles anymore german supermarkets have in fact come a long way since frozen pizza was the only option for a quick meal after work .
but fast , healthy meals for one-person households are a more recent development in germany , compared to these markets in the united states or britain . rewe , one of the leading groups in the european grocery trade , said it particularly addresses singles ’ needs in city stores . “ we especially offer a lot in the convenience sector , that is food that is ready-to-eat , ” said press spokeswoman astrid ohletz .
“ for example , we have fresh soups , sushi or pre-prepared fruit . ” singles : hip or fate ? rosenkranz points out that singles are not just students living alone or young professionals , though .
“ singles are a very heterogeneous group , ” she said .
“ what is a hip lifestyle for some is fate for another .
if you define singles as one-person households , half of them are senior citizens over the age of 55 . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senior citizens make up half of one-person households in germany and it is precisely this group of older singles that feel overlooked as consumers .
older singles , who usually only shop for themselves , suffer from the fact that packaging is so large , for example . “ smaller portions are disproportionately more expensive and many older singles only have their pension at their disposal , ” said rosenkranz . as a matter of fact , smaller single-friendly sizes are more expensive .

but singles are a very heterogeneous group and therefore pose a particular challenge as consumers . in germany , the bestseller “ bridget jones ’ s diary ” was translated into “ schokolade zum frühstück ” or “ chocolate for breakfast . ”
for many , bridget jones personifies the stereotypical image of a single : having chocolate for breakfast and a glass -lrb- or more -rrb- of chardonnay for dinner . but the reality looks quite different . “ studies on one-person households show that particularly young professionals who earn good money are very interested in fresh products and are more likely to buy brand goods , ” said doris rosenkranz , a sociology professor at the university of applied sciences in würzburg and author of several publications on consumer habits . making single life more convenient according to figures from the federal statistics office , 20.7 percent of germany ’ s adult population - or 13.8 million people - live in one-person households .
in cities , this figure can reach over 50 percent . retailers are aware that they have to address all consumers , including singles , said olaf roik from the german retailers ’ association hde .
“ we try to do this through well-targeted marketing , especially in cities which have a higher number of one-person households , ” he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pizza is n't the only alternative for singles anymore german supermarkets have in fact come a long way since frozen pizza was the only option for a quick meal after work .
but fast , healthy meals for one-person households are a more recent development in germany , compared to these markets in the united states or britain . rewe , one of the leading groups in the european grocery trade , said it particularly addresses singles ’ needs in city stores . “ we especially offer a lot in the convenience sector , that is food that is ready-to-eat , ” said press spokeswoman astrid ohletz .
“ for example , we have fresh soups , sushi or pre-prepared fruit . ” singles : hip or fate ? rosenkranz points out that singles are not just students living alone or young professionals , though .
“ singles are a very heterogeneous group , ” she said .
“ what is a hip lifestyle for some is fate for another .
if you define singles as one-person households , half of them are senior citizens over the age of 55 . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senior citizens make up half of one-person households in germany and it is precisely this group of older singles that feel overlooked as consumers .
older singles , who usually only shop for themselves , suffer from the fact that packaging is so large , for example . “ smaller portions are disproportionately more expensive and many older singles only have their pension at their disposal , ” said rosenkranz . as a matter of fact , smaller single-friendly sizes are more expensive .

older singles , who usually only shop for themselves , suffer from the fact that packaging is so large , for example . “ smaller portions are disproportionately more expensive and many older singles only have their pension at their disposal , ” said rosenkranz . as a matter of fact , smaller single-friendly sizes are more expensive .
take your average major supermarket in cologne : 250 grams of regular butter costs between 0.99 euros and 1.29 euros -lrb- $ 1.31-1.70 -rrb- , depending on the brand .
but 125 grams costs 0.79 euro . another example is philadelphia cream cheese .
the regular size of 200 grams costs 1.49 euros .
but the single-friendly sized six-pack of 16.7 grams each , which comes to about half of the regular size , costs 1.19 euros . hde explained that this price difference is not discriminatory against singles .
it ’ s simply due to packaging and logistics costs , which are not necessarily half as great as for a big package .
“ large volumes are also less expensive , ” said roik .
“ that ’ s just the way it is . ” the “ living-alone-together ” single the larger packaging is not necessarily a problem for many younger singles aged between 25 and 35 .
“ these are so-called lats or ‘ living-alone-together ’ singles , who live alone , but often have a partner , ” rosenkranz explained .
“ in terms of consumption , this group often buys for the partner , too . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : singles prefer to eat their pizza in the restaurant in addition , lats spend above-average amounts on eating outside of their home , either in restaurants or with take-away food , she said . this group of singles is also not interested in the frozen dinners and mini-sized pizzas available on the market .
“ our research showed that this type of food mostly appeals to working mothers rather than singles , ” said rosenkranz . the internet ’ s potential for singles in his book “ consumer behavior in one-person households , ” the economic sociologist wilhelm ott wrote that eating well is important for the majority of singles . “ for many , eating and drinking express a certain lifestyle , ” said ott .
“ especially younger people living alone want to underline the particular quality of their way of life . ” in this sense , the internet holds a great potential for the singles ’ consumer market , said rosenkranz . “ it would be especially interesting for working singles if they could do their shopping online during the day , ” she said .
then , after work , they could simply pay for their groceries and head home . “ then , there would be more time for cooking good food with your partner or friends , ” she said . sabina casagrande , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de single and loving it in germany most german single women say they 're doing just fine without a man in their lives .

france is the world 's largest manufacturer of luxury goods ; 250,000 people are employed by the sector .
but 38,000 jobs are lost every year due to counterfeiting .
designer brands spend millions annually fighting fakes . fshion labels like hermès , chanel and louis vuitton may have made france the world leader when it comes to luxury products . but , the country is also the global loser from illegal competition from fakes .
in france , according to the customs service , the counterfeit business is booming . at a freight depot at orly airport , just outside of paris , a customs officer slits open a box of socks as he settles in to another day 's work protecting the biggest luxury industry in the world .
last year , he and his colleagues found and destroyed some three million fakes , double what they had taken in the previous year .
in one seizure in january , they found enough louis vuitton fabric to cover 54 tennis courts . " there are hundreds of millions of fake products out there , " said marc-antoine jamet , secretary-general of louis vuitton 's parent company , lvmh .
he said counterfeiting has become a colossal world industry representing more than five percent of all world trade . " look what companies spend fighting fakes : three million euros a year for lacoste , 15 million for vuitton , " he said .
" this is a problem on an industrial scale . " everyday people although organized crime plays a role in the matter , normally law-abiding people are also part of the problem .
people on holiday , for example , who see good copies which look like amazing bargains that ca n't be passed up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at orly airport , people returning from holidays abroad are greeted with posters of the lacoste crocodile and a chanel handbag warning them that bringing fakes into france is a criminal offense . " we 've been to turkey several times on holiday with the children and , i can tell you , when you 're with teenagers and you see designer labels for a fifth of what you 'd pay back home , it 's tempting , " said one woman returning for vacation who did n't want to give her name . she said during the summers , she would get a new wardrobe for her kids with fake goods , mostly jeans , t-shirts and sweatshirts , always with a little designer logo and never in any doubt that she was buying fakes . " for me , there 's a bit of getting our own back on companies who , as soon as they get a brand that sells well , charge astronomical prices , " she said . but her purchasing patterns could be risky .
people who are discovered bringing in fake goods can get hefty fines .
generally if there are one or two fake goods , people are let off .
but with higher quantities , people can pay fines that are more than double what the goods are actually worth . the shame of it all for some , though , buying or wearing counterfeit goods is , well , simply l 'horreur . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fake chanel watch " i 'm used to seeing all these fake vuitton or prada bags in asia , " said marion dufour , a fashion editor at the women 's magazine group marie-claire international . " i imagine myself wearing it and arriving at a famous fashion party with all of these beautiful people and all of a sudden a pr or a fashion editor will arrive and she will discover and find out that it is a fake one .
and i think i would really feel shame ! " but the big names of the luxury industry along paris ' avenue montaigne want counterfeiters to feel more than shame .
in the sixteenth century , people would get their hand cut off for making a fake .
today they might have to pay nearly $ 500,000 -lrb- 375,800 euros -rrb- : the maximum fine was doubled last year .
that high amount shows that for france there 's much at stake - not just money , but the image of the country itself . john laurenson -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lagerfeld has world domination all sewn-up a hard-to-miss presence at the paris ready-to-wear week , karl lagerfeld hit the headlines with his hemlines , presenting his new pret-a-porter collection .

but with three weeks left and little progress to date , mutual recriminations have begun . the dispute flared up again on friday when us negotiator robert zoellick decided to step up the pressure after meeting with his european counterpart , eu trade commissioner peter mandelson .
zoellick 's spokesman said " the europeans are clearly unwilling to eliminate the subsidies , " and said if necessary the united states was ready to return to litigation at the wto . this triggered a warning saturday from brussels that it would also make claims against washington .
" if the us decides to move to the wto approach , which we hope they will not , obviously we would launch our own counter-case , " said a european commission official who spoke to afp on condition of anonymity . complaints traded across the atlantic the united states lodged a complaint against eu subsidies to france-based airbus with the wto in october , which brought a counteraction from brussels against what it termed indirect us government aid for chicago-based boeing . but the agreement in january to try to resolve the dispute by renegotiating a 1992 bilateral accord that set the terms of assistance to aircraft makers effectively froze the wto procedure , which eu officials had said would have been a " disastrous " legal clash .
the two sides agreed to freeze subsidies while they negotiate the new agreement . washington tones down fighting talk washington on saturday dropped the saber rattling , and said it was ready to extend the deadline for reaching an agreement .
" we are very willing to continue talking , using the january 11 agreement as the basis - and we are willing to extend the terms of the january agreement , " us trade representative spokesman richard mills told afp . but " the problem is that over the last two months the eu has been focused more on maneuvering than on negotiating the core substance , " mills said by telephone from washington .
" as far as we are concerned , we 're ready to continue the negotiations , " the eu official said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the boeing dreamliner .
however , should no agreement be reached , " nothing would prevent the eu governments to put up the launch aid for the a350 , " the eu official warned , referring to the long-haul jet which would rival boeing 's 787 " dreamliner " . europe wants " pertinent " questions answered part of the difficulties in the negotiations is that the europeans are trying to reach agreements on two issues that were not included as part of the january agreement : japanese aid for development of boeing 's 787 and the foreign sales corporations -lrb- fscs -rrb- that us companies use to lower their taxes . " we have n't changed positions or made specific demands , " said the eu official , adding that " we 've indicated we want pertinent questions added " to the discussions . the eu believes that no comprehensive deal can be reached by april 11 given the complexities of the issues .
instead it has proposed cutting the negotiations into two and reaching by the deadline next month " a more modest package that creates confidence " to reach a comprehensive deal at a later date . but if the eu is ready to put on the table the launch aid for airbus aircraft it expects " an equivalent contribution " from the united states , said the official . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus , boeing dispute could become us-eu problem a massive dispute is brewing between airbus and its archrival , chicago-based boeing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 21.03.2005 germany leads pack of pact assassins großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the germans consider the pact their own frankenstein 's monster germany , one of the main architects of the eu 's stability and growth pact , heads a list of potential assassins who want to kill off the bloc 's tattered fiscal rules . in a remarkable twist of irony as eu ministers prepare to gather in brussels this week to talk about reform of the stability and growth pact , the main architect germany is a leading voice in calls for the tattered fiscal rules to be taken apart . shackled by low growth and crippling high unemployment , the euro zone 's biggest but worst-performing economy has effectively found itself caught in a trap of its own making . originally designed in 1997 by then german finance minister theo waigel to prevent spendthrift economies from hitching a free ride on the coat-tails of standard-bearers of financial rigor such as germany , the pact stipulates that no euro zone country is allowed to let public finances run too deeply into the red . the pact sets a limit on each country 's public deficit of 3.0 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , while overall debt is not allowed to exceed 60 percent of gdp .
countries are expected to head for public surpluses in times of growth .
breaches of the limits are to be punished with stiff financial penalties . reality shows a long list of repeat offenders so much for the theory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder : " you pay . "
chirac : " no , you pay . "
in reality , nearly half the eu 's 25 members have since run up so-called excessive deficits , with france and germany topping the list of offenders . indeed , the euro zone heavyweights ' deficit ratios have been well above the 3.0-percent limit for the past three years and there is every indication that , with growth expected to remain sluggish at best , they will break the rules again this year . while smaller euro zone countries have swallowed the pact 's bitter medicine and managed to get their finances in order , laggards france and germany have long campaigned for a softening of the rules . they want special mitigating factors to be taken into account when evaluating the state of a country 's public finances , with germany particularly vocal in arguing that the astronomic costs of unification and its massive net contribution to the eu budget form part of the equation . generous germany on the ropes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel indicates the deficit to the german bundestag .
germany has ploughed hundreds of billions of euros into unification and is the biggest net contributor to the eu budget .
but the euro zone 's biggest economy also narrowly escaped its third recession in four years at the end of last year and unemployment in germany currently stands at a post-war high of 5.2 million or 12.6 percent of the population . and even current finance minister hans eichel , who originally presented himself as an iron-fisted and merciless cutter of costs and public-spending , now argues that tightening germany 's purse strings will only make matters worse .
it seems to be germany 's intransigence that is the main hurdle to eu-wide agreement being reached on a reform of the pact , analysts said . " the sticking point seems to be germany 's insistence that some allowance should be made for unification costs and the net contribution to the eu budget , " said dresdner kleinwort wasserstein economist anthony thomas in an interview with afp .
" although the german government is unlikely to be permitted such clear allowances , the question is whether finance ministers or government chiefs will be able to come up with appropriate wording to satisfy all parties , " thomas said . there was no sign friday of the stalemate being broken .
in fact , both sides appeared to be digging their heels in . pact struggles divide the european union bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder finds himself in the opposite camp to austrian counterpart and pact supporter wolfgang schüssel .
austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel insisted that the stability pact should be applied to the letter , while five big member states - namely germany , france , italy , spain and britain - had reportedly reached tacit agreement to block what they deemed to be an all too mechanistic or rigid implementation of the rules . addressing a press conference in schüssel 's home city of vienna on friday , german chancellor gerhard schroeder said berlin was not pushing for a modification of the pact " but an interpretation that makes economic sense " . " we want an interpretation that takes into account both stability and growth , " the german leader added . optimism remains despite sharpened knives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker .
luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , downplayed the lack of progress .
" if we do n't reach an agreement on sunday it will not be a catastrophe .
it will not prevent us finding an accord at the summit . " as things stand , it looks as if a general list will simply be drawn up of factors justifying an excessive deficit .
and " the danger is that the list could be so vague that it could be used to justify any overrun , " thomas said . in the end , the choice facing eu leaders would be to hold on to a stability pact that effectively remains suspended in its current form " or to reform it so that it is virtually toothless " , the economist said .
" so it wo n't really matter whether agreement is reached or not , at least for the moment , " thomas concluded . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu moves to renew battered fiscal rules the eu hopes to hammer out the main points of a revised budget rule book this week , 16 months after the pact meant to protect the euro was left in tatters by eu heavyweight states bent on reviving their ailing economies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 21.03.2005 learning to be single-friendly großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shopping for the right amount for one person is n't easy over 20 percent of german homes are one-person households .
but singles are a very heterogeneous group and therefore pose a particular challenge as consumers . in germany , the bestseller “ bridget jones ’ s diary ” was translated into “ schokolade zum frühstück ” or “ chocolate for breakfast . ”
for many , bridget jones personifies the stereotypical image of a single : having chocolate for breakfast and a glass -lrb- or more -rrb- of chardonnay for dinner . but the reality looks quite different . “ studies on one-person households show that particularly young professionals who earn good money are very interested in fresh products and are more likely to buy brand goods , ” said doris rosenkranz , a sociology professor at the university of applied sciences in würzburg and author of several publications on consumer habits . making single life more convenient according to figures from the federal statistics office , 20.7 percent of germany ’ s adult population - or 13.8 million people - live in one-person households .
in cities , this figure can reach over 50 percent . retailers are aware that they have to address all consumers , including singles , said olaf roik from the german retailers ’ association hde .
“ we try to do this through well-targeted marketing , especially in cities which have a higher number of one-person households , ” he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pizza is n't the only alternative for singles anymore german supermarkets have in fact come a long way since frozen pizza was the only option for a quick meal after work .
but fast , healthy meals for one-person households are a more recent development in germany , compared to these markets in the united states or britain . rewe , one of the leading groups in the european grocery trade , said it particularly addresses singles ’ needs in city stores . “ we especially offer a lot in the convenience sector , that is food that is ready-to-eat , ” said press spokeswoman astrid ohletz .
“ for example , we have fresh soups , sushi or pre-prepared fruit . ” singles : hip or fate ? rosenkranz points out that singles are not just students living alone or young professionals , though .
“ singles are a very heterogeneous group , ” she said .
“ what is a hip lifestyle for some is fate for another .
if you define singles as one-person households , half of them are senior citizens over the age of 55 . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senior citizens make up half of one-person households in germany and it is precisely this group of older singles that feel overlooked as consumers .
older singles , who usually only shop for themselves , suffer from the fact that packaging is so large , for example . “ smaller portions are disproportionately more expensive and many older singles only have their pension at their disposal , ” said rosenkranz . as a matter of fact , smaller single-friendly sizes are more expensive .
take your average major supermarket in cologne : 250 grams of regular butter costs between 0.99 euros and 1.29 euros -lrb- $ 1.31-1.70 -rrb- , depending on the brand .
but 125 grams costs 0.79 euro . another example is philadelphia cream cheese .
the regular size of 200 grams costs 1.49 euros .
but the single-friendly sized six-pack of 16.7 grams each , which comes to about half of the regular size , costs 1.19 euros . hde explained that this price difference is not discriminatory against singles .
it ’ s simply due to packaging and logistics costs , which are not necessarily half as great as for a big package .
“ large volumes are also less expensive , ” said roik .
“ that ’ s just the way it is . ” the “ living-alone-together ” single the larger packaging is not necessarily a problem for many younger singles aged between 25 and 35 .
“ these are so-called lats or ‘ living-alone-together ’ singles , who live alone , but often have a partner , ” rosenkranz explained .
“ in terms of consumption , this group often buys for the partner , too . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : singles prefer to eat their pizza in the restaurant in addition , lats spend above-average amounts on eating outside of their home , either in restaurants or with take-away food , she said . this group of singles is also not interested in the frozen dinners and mini-sized pizzas available on the market .
“ our research showed that this type of food mostly appeals to working mothers rather than singles , ” said rosenkranz . the internet ’ s potential for singles in his book “ consumer behavior in one-person households , ” the economic sociologist wilhelm ott wrote that eating well is important for the majority of singles . “ for many , eating and drinking express a certain lifestyle , ” said ott .
“ especially younger people living alone want to underline the particular quality of their way of life . ” in this sense , the internet holds a great potential for the singles ’ consumer market , said rosenkranz . “ it would be especially interesting for working singles if they could do their shopping online during the day , ” she said .
then , after work , they could simply pay for their groceries and head home . “ then , there would be more time for cooking good food with your partner or friends , ” she said . sabina casagrande , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de single and loving it in germany most german single women say they 're doing just fine without a man in their lives .

but singles are a very heterogeneous group and therefore pose a particular challenge as consumers . in germany , the bestseller “ bridget jones ’ s diary ” was translated into “ schokolade zum frühstück ” or “ chocolate for breakfast . ”
for many , bridget jones personifies the stereotypical image of a single : having chocolate for breakfast and a glass -lrb- or more -rrb- of chardonnay for dinner . but the reality looks quite different . “ studies on one-person households show that particularly young professionals who earn good money are very interested in fresh products and are more likely to buy brand goods , ” said doris rosenkranz , a sociology professor at the university of applied sciences in würzburg and author of several publications on consumer habits . making single life more convenient according to figures from the federal statistics office , 20.7 percent of germany ’ s adult population - or 13.8 million people - live in one-person households .
in cities , this figure can reach over 50 percent . retailers are aware that they have to address all consumers , including singles , said olaf roik from the german retailers ’ association hde .
“ we try to do this through well-targeted marketing , especially in cities which have a higher number of one-person households , ” he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pizza is n't the only alternative for singles anymore german supermarkets have in fact come a long way since frozen pizza was the only option for a quick meal after work .
but fast , healthy meals for one-person households are a more recent development in germany , compared to these markets in the united states or britain . rewe , one of the leading groups in the european grocery trade , said it particularly addresses singles ’ needs in city stores . “ we especially offer a lot in the convenience sector , that is food that is ready-to-eat , ” said press spokeswoman astrid ohletz .
“ for example , we have fresh soups , sushi or pre-prepared fruit . ” singles : hip or fate ? rosenkranz points out that singles are not just students living alone or young professionals , though .
“ singles are a very heterogeneous group , ” she said .
“ what is a hip lifestyle for some is fate for another .
if you define singles as one-person households , half of them are senior citizens over the age of 55 . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senior citizens make up half of one-person households in germany and it is precisely this group of older singles that feel overlooked as consumers .
older singles , who usually only shop for themselves , suffer from the fact that packaging is so large , for example . “ smaller portions are disproportionately more expensive and many older singles only have their pension at their disposal , ” said rosenkranz . as a matter of fact , smaller single-friendly sizes are more expensive .
take your average major supermarket in cologne : 250 grams of regular butter costs between 0.99 euros and 1.29 euros -lrb- $ 1.31-1.70 -rrb- , depending on the brand .
but 125 grams costs 0.79 euro . another example is philadelphia cream cheese .
the regular size of 200 grams costs 1.49 euros .
but the single-friendly sized six-pack of 16.7 grams each , which comes to about half of the regular size , costs 1.19 euros . hde explained that this price difference is not discriminatory against singles .
it ’ s simply due to packaging and logistics costs , which are not necessarily half as great as for a big package .
“ large volumes are also less expensive , ” said roik .
“ that ’ s just the way it is . ” the “ living-alone-together ” single the larger packaging is not necessarily a problem for many younger singles aged between 25 and 35 .
“ these are so-called lats or ‘ living-alone-together ’ singles , who live alone , but often have a partner , ” rosenkranz explained .
“ in terms of consumption , this group often buys for the partner , too . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : singles prefer to eat their pizza in the restaurant in addition , lats spend above-average amounts on eating outside of their home , either in restaurants or with take-away food , she said . this group of singles is also not interested in the frozen dinners and mini-sized pizzas available on the market .
“ our research showed that this type of food mostly appeals to working mothers rather than singles , ” said rosenkranz . the internet ’ s potential for singles in his book “ consumer behavior in one-person households , ” the economic sociologist wilhelm ott wrote that eating well is important for the majority of singles . “ for many , eating and drinking express a certain lifestyle , ” said ott .
“ especially younger people living alone want to underline the particular quality of their way of life . ” in this sense , the internet holds a great potential for the singles ’ consumer market , said rosenkranz . “ it would be especially interesting for working singles if they could do their shopping online during the day , ” she said .

but with three weeks left and little progress to date , mutual recriminations have begun . the dispute flared up again on friday when us negotiator robert zoellick decided to step up the pressure after meeting with his european counterpart , eu trade commissioner peter mandelson .
zoellick 's spokesman said " the europeans are clearly unwilling to eliminate the subsidies , " and said if necessary the united states was ready to return to litigation at the wto . this triggered a warning saturday from brussels that it would also make claims against washington .
" if the us decides to move to the wto approach , which we hope they will not , obviously we would launch our own counter-case , " said a european commission official who spoke to afp on condition of anonymity . complaints traded across the atlantic the united states lodged a complaint against eu subsidies to france-based airbus with the wto in october , which brought a counteraction from brussels against what it termed indirect us government aid for chicago-based boeing . but the agreement in january to try to resolve the dispute by renegotiating a 1992 bilateral accord that set the terms of assistance to aircraft makers effectively froze the wto procedure , which eu officials had said would have been a " disastrous " legal clash .
the two sides agreed to freeze subsidies while they negotiate the new agreement . washington tones down fighting talk washington on saturday dropped the saber rattling , and said it was ready to extend the deadline for reaching an agreement .
" we are very willing to continue talking , using the january 11 agreement as the basis - and we are willing to extend the terms of the january agreement , " us trade representative spokesman richard mills told afp . but " the problem is that over the last two months the eu has been focused more on maneuvering than on negotiating the core substance , " mills said by telephone from washington .
" as far as we are concerned , we 're ready to continue the negotiations , " the eu official said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the boeing dreamliner .
however , should no agreement be reached , " nothing would prevent the eu governments to put up the launch aid for the a350 , " the eu official warned , referring to the long-haul jet which would rival boeing 's 787 " dreamliner " . europe wants " pertinent " questions answered part of the difficulties in the negotiations is that the europeans are trying to reach agreements on two issues that were not included as part of the january agreement : japanese aid for development of boeing 's 787 and the foreign sales corporations -lrb- fscs -rrb- that us companies use to lower their taxes . " we have n't changed positions or made specific demands , " said the eu official , adding that " we 've indicated we want pertinent questions added " to the discussions . the eu believes that no comprehensive deal can be reached by april 11 given the complexities of the issues .
instead it has proposed cutting the negotiations into two and reaching by the deadline next month " a more modest package that creates confidence " to reach a comprehensive deal at a later date . but if the eu is ready to put on the table the launch aid for airbus aircraft it expects " an equivalent contribution " from the united states , said the official . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus , boeing dispute could become us-eu problem a massive dispute is brewing between airbus and its archrival , chicago-based boeing .

france is the world 's largest manufacturer of luxury goods ; 250,000 people are employed by the sector .
but 38,000 jobs are lost every year due to counterfeiting .
designer brands spend millions annually fighting fakes . fshion labels like hermès , chanel and louis vuitton may have made france the world leader when it comes to luxury products . but , the country is also the global loser from illegal competition from fakes .
in france , according to the customs service , the counterfeit business is booming . at a freight depot at orly airport , just outside of paris , a customs officer slits open a box of socks as he settles in to another day 's work protecting the biggest luxury industry in the world .
last year , he and his colleagues found and destroyed some three million fakes , double what they had taken in the previous year .
in one seizure in january , they found enough louis vuitton fabric to cover 54 tennis courts . " there are hundreds of millions of fake products out there , " said marc-antoine jamet , secretary-general of louis vuitton 's parent company , lvmh .
he said counterfeiting has become a colossal world industry representing more than five percent of all world trade . " look what companies spend fighting fakes : three million euros a year for lacoste , 15 million for vuitton , " he said .
" this is a problem on an industrial scale . " everyday people although organized crime plays a role in the matter , normally law-abiding people are also part of the problem .
people on holiday , for example , who see good copies which look like amazing bargains that ca n't be passed up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at orly airport , people returning from holidays abroad are greeted with posters of the lacoste crocodile and a chanel handbag warning them that bringing fakes into france is a criminal offense . " we 've been to turkey several times on holiday with the children and , i can tell you , when you 're with teenagers and you see designer labels for a fifth of what you 'd pay back home , it 's tempting , " said one woman returning for vacation who did n't want to give her name . she said during the summers , she would get a new wardrobe for her kids with fake goods , mostly jeans , t-shirts and sweatshirts , always with a little designer logo and never in any doubt that she was buying fakes . " for me , there 's a bit of getting our own back on companies who , as soon as they get a brand that sells well , charge astronomical prices , " she said . but her purchasing patterns could be risky .
people who are discovered bringing in fake goods can get hefty fines .
generally if there are one or two fake goods , people are let off .
but with higher quantities , people can pay fines that are more than double what the goods are actually worth . the shame of it all for some , though , buying or wearing counterfeit goods is , well , simply l 'horreur . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fake chanel watch " i 'm used to seeing all these fake vuitton or prada bags in asia , " said marion dufour , a fashion editor at the women 's magazine group marie-claire international . " i imagine myself wearing it and arriving at a famous fashion party with all of these beautiful people and all of a sudden a pr or a fashion editor will arrive and she will discover and find out that it is a fake one .
and i think i would really feel shame ! " but the big names of the luxury industry along paris ' avenue montaigne want counterfeiters to feel more than shame .
in the sixteenth century , people would get their hand cut off for making a fake .
today they might have to pay nearly $ 500,000 -lrb- 375,800 euros -rrb- : the maximum fine was doubled last year .
that high amount shows that for france there 's much at stake - not just money , but the image of the country itself . john laurenson -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lagerfeld has world domination all sewn-up a hard-to-miss presence at the paris ready-to-wear week , karl lagerfeld hit the headlines with his hemlines , presenting his new pret-a-porter collection .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 21.03.2005 learning to be single-friendly großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shopping for the right amount for one person is n't easy over 20 percent of german homes are one-person households .
but singles are a very heterogeneous group and therefore pose a particular challenge as consumers . in germany , the bestseller “ bridget jones ’ s diary ” was translated into “ schokolade zum frühstück ” or “ chocolate for breakfast . ”
for many , bridget jones personifies the stereotypical image of a single : having chocolate for breakfast and a glass -lrb- or more -rrb- of chardonnay for dinner . but the reality looks quite different . “ studies on one-person households show that particularly young professionals who earn good money are very interested in fresh products and are more likely to buy brand goods , ” said doris rosenkranz , a sociology professor at the university of applied sciences in würzburg and author of several publications on consumer habits . making single life more convenient according to figures from the federal statistics office , 20.7 percent of germany ’ s adult population - or 13.8 million people - live in one-person households .
in cities , this figure can reach over 50 percent . retailers are aware that they have to address all consumers , including singles , said olaf roik from the german retailers ’ association hde .
“ we try to do this through well-targeted marketing , especially in cities which have a higher number of one-person households , ” he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pizza is n't the only alternative for singles anymore german supermarkets have in fact come a long way since frozen pizza was the only option for a quick meal after work .
but fast , healthy meals for one-person households are a more recent development in germany , compared to these markets in the united states or britain . rewe , one of the leading groups in the european grocery trade , said it particularly addresses singles ’ needs in city stores . “ we especially offer a lot in the convenience sector , that is food that is ready-to-eat , ” said press spokeswoman astrid ohletz .
“ for example , we have fresh soups , sushi or pre-prepared fruit . ” singles : hip or fate ? rosenkranz points out that singles are not just students living alone or young professionals , though .
“ singles are a very heterogeneous group , ” she said .
“ what is a hip lifestyle for some is fate for another .
if you define singles as one-person households , half of them are senior citizens over the age of 55 . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senior citizens make up half of one-person households in germany and it is precisely this group of older singles that feel overlooked as consumers .
older singles , who usually only shop for themselves , suffer from the fact that packaging is so large , for example . “ smaller portions are disproportionately more expensive and many older singles only have their pension at their disposal , ” said rosenkranz . as a matter of fact , smaller single-friendly sizes are more expensive .
take your average major supermarket in cologne : 250 grams of regular butter costs between 0.99 euros and 1.29 euros -lrb- $ 1.31-1.70 -rrb- , depending on the brand .
but 125 grams costs 0.79 euro . another example is philadelphia cream cheese .
the regular size of 200 grams costs 1.49 euros .
but the single-friendly sized six-pack of 16.7 grams each , which comes to about half of the regular size , costs 1.19 euros . hde explained that this price difference is not discriminatory against singles .
it ’ s simply due to packaging and logistics costs , which are not necessarily half as great as for a big package .
“ large volumes are also less expensive , ” said roik .
“ that ’ s just the way it is . ” the “ living-alone-together ” single the larger packaging is not necessarily a problem for many younger singles aged between 25 and 35 .
“ these are so-called lats or ‘ living-alone-together ’ singles , who live alone , but often have a partner , ” rosenkranz explained .
“ in terms of consumption , this group often buys for the partner , too . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : singles prefer to eat their pizza in the restaurant in addition , lats spend above-average amounts on eating outside of their home , either in restaurants or with take-away food , she said . this group of singles is also not interested in the frozen dinners and mini-sized pizzas available on the market .
“ our research showed that this type of food mostly appeals to working mothers rather than singles , ” said rosenkranz . the internet ’ s potential for singles in his book “ consumer behavior in one-person households , ” the economic sociologist wilhelm ott wrote that eating well is important for the majority of singles . “ for many , eating and drinking express a certain lifestyle , ” said ott .
“ especially younger people living alone want to underline the particular quality of their way of life . ” in this sense , the internet holds a great potential for the singles ’ consumer market , said rosenkranz . “ it would be especially interesting for working singles if they could do their shopping online during the day , ” she said .
then , after work , they could simply pay for their groceries and head home . “ then , there would be more time for cooking good food with your partner or friends , ” she said . sabina casagrande , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de single and loving it in germany most german single women say they 're doing just fine without a man in their lives .

france is the world 's largest manufacturer of luxury goods ; 250,000 people are employed by the sector .
but 38,000 jobs are lost every year due to counterfeiting .
designer brands spend millions annually fighting fakes . fshion labels like hermès , chanel and louis vuitton may have made france the world leader when it comes to luxury products . but , the country is also the global loser from illegal competition from fakes .
in france , according to the customs service , the counterfeit business is booming . at a freight depot at orly airport , just outside of paris , a customs officer slits open a box of socks as he settles in to another day 's work protecting the biggest luxury industry in the world .
last year , he and his colleagues found and destroyed some three million fakes , double what they had taken in the previous year .
in one seizure in january , they found enough louis vuitton fabric to cover 54 tennis courts . " there are hundreds of millions of fake products out there , " said marc-antoine jamet , secretary-general of louis vuitton 's parent company , lvmh .
he said counterfeiting has become a colossal world industry representing more than five percent of all world trade . " look what companies spend fighting fakes : three million euros a year for lacoste , 15 million for vuitton , " he said .
" this is a problem on an industrial scale . " everyday people although organized crime plays a role in the matter , normally law-abiding people are also part of the problem .
people on holiday , for example , who see good copies which look like amazing bargains that ca n't be passed up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at orly airport , people returning from holidays abroad are greeted with posters of the lacoste crocodile and a chanel handbag warning them that bringing fakes into france is a criminal offense . " we 've been to turkey several times on holiday with the children and , i can tell you , when you 're with teenagers and you see designer labels for a fifth of what you 'd pay back home , it 's tempting , " said one woman returning for vacation who did n't want to give her name . she said during the summers , she would get a new wardrobe for her kids with fake goods , mostly jeans , t-shirts and sweatshirts , always with a little designer logo and never in any doubt that she was buying fakes . " for me , there 's a bit of getting our own back on companies who , as soon as they get a brand that sells well , charge astronomical prices , " she said . but her purchasing patterns could be risky .
people who are discovered bringing in fake goods can get hefty fines .
generally if there are one or two fake goods , people are let off .
but with higher quantities , people can pay fines that are more than double what the goods are actually worth . the shame of it all for some , though , buying or wearing counterfeit goods is , well , simply l 'horreur . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fake chanel watch " i 'm used to seeing all these fake vuitton or prada bags in asia , " said marion dufour , a fashion editor at the women 's magazine group marie-claire international . " i imagine myself wearing it and arriving at a famous fashion party with all of these beautiful people and all of a sudden a pr or a fashion editor will arrive and she will discover and find out that it is a fake one .
and i think i would really feel shame ! " but the big names of the luxury industry along paris ' avenue montaigne want counterfeiters to feel more than shame .
in the sixteenth century , people would get their hand cut off for making a fake .
today they might have to pay nearly $ 500,000 -lrb- 375,800 euros -rrb- : the maximum fine was doubled last year .

france is the world 's largest manufacturer of luxury goods ; 250,000 people are employed by the sector .
but 38,000 jobs are lost every year due to counterfeiting .
designer brands spend millions annually fighting fakes . fshion labels like hermès , chanel and louis vuitton may have made france the world leader when it comes to luxury products . but , the country is also the global loser from illegal competition from fakes .
in france , according to the customs service , the counterfeit business is booming . at a freight depot at orly airport , just outside of paris , a customs officer slits open a box of socks as he settles in to another day 's work protecting the biggest luxury industry in the world .
last year , he and his colleagues found and destroyed some three million fakes , double what they had taken in the previous year .
in one seizure in january , they found enough louis vuitton fabric to cover 54 tennis courts . " there are hundreds of millions of fake products out there , " said marc-antoine jamet , secretary-general of louis vuitton 's parent company , lvmh .
he said counterfeiting has become a colossal world industry representing more than five percent of all world trade . " look what companies spend fighting fakes : three million euros a year for lacoste , 15 million for vuitton , " he said .
" this is a problem on an industrial scale . " everyday people although organized crime plays a role in the matter , normally law-abiding people are also part of the problem .
people on holiday , for example , who see good copies which look like amazing bargains that ca n't be passed up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at orly airport , people returning from holidays abroad are greeted with posters of the lacoste crocodile and a chanel handbag warning them that bringing fakes into france is a criminal offense . " we 've been to turkey several times on holiday with the children and , i can tell you , when you 're with teenagers and you see designer labels for a fifth of what you 'd pay back home , it 's tempting , " said one woman returning for vacation who did n't want to give her name . she said during the summers , she would get a new wardrobe for her kids with fake goods , mostly jeans , t-shirts and sweatshirts , always with a little designer logo and never in any doubt that she was buying fakes . " for me , there 's a bit of getting our own back on companies who , as soon as they get a brand that sells well , charge astronomical prices , " she said . but her purchasing patterns could be risky .
people who are discovered bringing in fake goods can get hefty fines .
generally if there are one or two fake goods , people are let off .
but with higher quantities , people can pay fines that are more than double what the goods are actually worth . the shame of it all for some , though , buying or wearing counterfeit goods is , well , simply l 'horreur . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fake chanel watch " i 'm used to seeing all these fake vuitton or prada bags in asia , " said marion dufour , a fashion editor at the women 's magazine group marie-claire international . " i imagine myself wearing it and arriving at a famous fashion party with all of these beautiful people and all of a sudden a pr or a fashion editor will arrive and she will discover and find out that it is a fake one .
and i think i would really feel shame ! " but the big names of the luxury industry along paris ' avenue montaigne want counterfeiters to feel more than shame .
in the sixteenth century , people would get their hand cut off for making a fake .
today they might have to pay nearly $ 500,000 -lrb- 375,800 euros -rrb- : the maximum fine was doubled last year .
that high amount shows that for france there 's much at stake - not just money , but the image of the country itself . john laurenson -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lagerfeld has world domination all sewn-up a hard-to-miss presence at the paris ready-to-wear week , karl lagerfeld hit the headlines with his hemlines , presenting his new pret-a-porter collection .

in reality , nearly half the eu 's 25 members have since run up so-called excessive deficits , with france and germany topping the list of offenders . indeed , the euro zone heavyweights ' deficit ratios have been well above the 3.0-percent limit for the past three years and there is every indication that , with growth expected to remain sluggish at best , they will break the rules again this year . while smaller euro zone countries have swallowed the pact 's bitter medicine and managed to get their finances in order , laggards france and germany have long campaigned for a softening of the rules . they want special mitigating factors to be taken into account when evaluating the state of a country 's public finances , with germany particularly vocal in arguing that the astronomic costs of unification and its massive net contribution to the eu budget form part of the equation . generous germany on the ropes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel indicates the deficit to the german bundestag .
germany has ploughed hundreds of billions of euros into unification and is the biggest net contributor to the eu budget .
but the euro zone 's biggest economy also narrowly escaped its third recession in four years at the end of last year and unemployment in germany currently stands at a post-war high of 5.2 million or 12.6 percent of the population . and even current finance minister hans eichel , who originally presented himself as an iron-fisted and merciless cutter of costs and public-spending , now argues that tightening germany 's purse strings will only make matters worse .
it seems to be germany 's intransigence that is the main hurdle to eu-wide agreement being reached on a reform of the pact , analysts said . " the sticking point seems to be germany 's insistence that some allowance should be made for unification costs and the net contribution to the eu budget , " said dresdner kleinwort wasserstein economist anthony thomas in an interview with afp .
" although the german government is unlikely to be permitted such clear allowances , the question is whether finance ministers or government chiefs will be able to come up with appropriate wording to satisfy all parties , " thomas said . there was no sign friday of the stalemate being broken .

austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel insisted that the stability pact should be applied to the letter , while five big member states - namely germany , france , italy , spain and britain - had reportedly reached tacit agreement to block what they deemed to be an all too mechanistic or rigid implementation of the rules . addressing a press conference in schüssel 's home city of vienna on friday , german chancellor gerhard schroeder said berlin was not pushing for a modification of the pact " but an interpretation that makes economic sense " .

and " the danger is that the list could be so vague that it could be used to justify any overrun , " thomas said . in the end , the choice facing eu leaders would be to hold on to a stability pact that effectively remains suspended in its current form " or to reform it so that it is virtually toothless " , the economist said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 21.03.2005 us-eu airbus row hits turbulence großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe toasted the new airbus but continued subsidies anger the us talks between brussels and washington to resolve a dispute over subsidies for aircraft makers airbus and boeing have descended into a row with both sides threatening a damaging legal clash at the wto . the two agreed in january to avoid a bruising battle at the world trade organization and negotiate by april 11 a phase out of subsidies to develop commercial aircraft .
but with three weeks left and little progress to date , mutual recriminations have begun . the dispute flared up again on friday when us negotiator robert zoellick decided to step up the pressure after meeting with his european counterpart , eu trade commissioner peter mandelson .
zoellick 's spokesman said " the europeans are clearly unwilling to eliminate the subsidies , " and said if necessary the united states was ready to return to litigation at the wto . this triggered a warning saturday from brussels that it would also make claims against washington .

they are " neither in question nor threatened " by the agreement , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , whose country holds the eu 's presidency , told afp .
" i am satisfied with the agreement , the fundamental rules ... have not been changed . " instead , the deal boosted measures aimed at preventing countries from overspending as well as reinforced the authority of eu 's executive commission to police the deficits , he said . the agreement also allows countries more time to rein in their deficits when they overshoot the three percent limit and it requires the european commission to take into account extraordinary circumstances when judging a member 's deficit . final approval is expected during the summit this week . not a free ride the european commission , which polices deficits , voiced satisfaction with the outcome of the talks with eu economic affairs commissioner joaquin almunia saying he had a " very positive view of the final result . " however , austrian finance minister karl-heinz grasser , who has led a campaign against watering down the pact , expressed muted satisfaction . " it is not the best solution i can imagine , but i am confident that it is a result that can guarantee stability-oriented fiscal policy in the european future , " he said .

germany was , at the time of the pact 's adoption , about to leave behind its beloved deutschmark , which had been a steady , stable friend of the country for decades . but over the past months , germany , along with france and italy , has been at the forefront of the drive to water down the pact . on sunday , its efforts bore fruit , and eu ministers agreed on a plan that includes giving germany special treatment because of the high costs of reunification , which germany has said is largely to blame for its inability over the past three years to keep its deficit under the three-percent mark required by the original stability pact . germany has breached the stability pact rules for the last three years and looks on its way to doing it again . there 's a definite sense of satisfaction coming from german finance minister hans eichel , who said the reworked pact is " more rational economically -lsb- and -rsb- more growth friendly , " since it takes into consideration the country 's economic growth and phases of stagnation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eating away at the euro ?

othmar karas , an austrian who represents the european people 's party in strasburg , said it was a grave mistake to bow to the german government 's demand for special treatment over reunification .
he called the reunification justification for changing the pact 's rules just an excuse , since the financial burden of german reunification started far before the year 2000 , when germany exceeded deficit limits for the first time . " no , it started 15 years ago , and for most of the time germany had enough discipline not to let the financial situation get out of control despite the additional burden , " he said .

he said the agreement did not mean german was abandoning the goal of keeping its deficit under three percent of gdp .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 21.03.2005 mixed reactions to stability pact rewrite großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro just got a little less stable , say critics of the change in the wake of sunday 's decision to loosen the rules of the stability and growth pact which underpins the euro , opposition voices in germany are crying foul .
but some economists say more flexibility was needed . germany was one of the prime architects of the stability pact , worried that the profligate ways of smaller eu members would weaken the common currency 's strength .
germany was , at the time of the pact 's adoption , about to leave behind its beloved deutschmark , which had been a steady , stable friend of the country for decades . but over the past months , germany , along with france and italy , has been at the forefront of the drive to water down the pact . on sunday , its efforts bore fruit , and eu ministers agreed on a plan that includes giving germany special treatment because of the high costs of reunification , which germany has said is largely to blame for its inability over the past three years to keep its deficit under the three-percent mark required by the original stability pact . germany has breached the stability pact rules for the last three years and looks on its way to doing it again . there 's a definite sense of satisfaction coming from german finance minister hans eichel , who said the reworked pact is " more rational economically -lsb- and -rsb- more growth friendly , " since it takes into consideration the country 's economic growth and phases of stagnation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eating away at the euro ?
but germany 's opposition is calling the compromise set forth by the 25 eu ministers nothing short of disastrous . " we 've all received a clear signal that the euro will not be as strong as the former deutschmark , " said michael meister , finance spokesman for the conservative christian democrats .
" what 's worse , confidence and trust in the reliability of the european union is being destroyed on a massive scale only because a few countries – germany included – are not willing to display budgetary discipline . ” a " sin " theo waigel , finance minister under former chancellor helmut kohl and member of the bavarian-based christian social union , called the loosening of the pact a " sin against our children " who he said will be left to shoulder the debt of their parents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former finance minister theo waigel , left , with his boss , former chancellor helmut kohl .
waigel , who was finance minister when the stability and growth pact was adopted in 1997 , said the government then had purposefully left out considerations of the cost of reunification in drawing up the agreement . " because then we knew we 'd have every country citing their own special problems , " he said , adding that germany had now abandoned its position as a leading advocate of euro stability in europe . there was criticism on the european level as well .
othmar karas , an austrian who represents the european people 's party in strasburg , said it was a grave mistake to bow to the german government 's demand for special treatment over reunification .
he called the reunification justification for changing the pact 's rules just an excuse , since the financial burden of german reunification started far before the year 2000 , when germany exceeded deficit limits for the first time . " no , it started 15 years ago , and for most of the time germany had enough discipline not to let the financial situation get out of control despite the additional burden , " he said .
" in other words , there ’ s no justification whatsoever to insist on special treatment now . ” a few voices in favor despite the reproaches of opposition politicians and other experts , some german economists have a more sanguine outlook regarding the relaxation of the pact .

but singles are a very heterogeneous group and therefore pose a particular challenge as consumers . in germany , the bestseller “ bridget jones ’ s diary ” was translated into “ schokolade zum frühstück ” or “ chocolate for breakfast . ”
for many , bridget jones personifies the stereotypical image of a single : having chocolate for breakfast and a glass -lrb- or more -rrb- of chardonnay for dinner . but the reality looks quite different . “ studies on one-person households show that particularly young professionals who earn good money are very interested in fresh products and are more likely to buy brand goods , ” said doris rosenkranz , a sociology professor at the university of applied sciences in würzburg and author of several publications on consumer habits . making single life more convenient according to figures from the federal statistics office , 20.7 percent of germany ’ s adult population - or 13.8 million people - live in one-person households .
in cities , this figure can reach over 50 percent . retailers are aware that they have to address all consumers , including singles , said olaf roik from the german retailers ’ association hde .
“ we try to do this through well-targeted marketing , especially in cities which have a higher number of one-person households , ” he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pizza is n't the only alternative for singles anymore german supermarkets have in fact come a long way since frozen pizza was the only option for a quick meal after work .
but fast , healthy meals for one-person households are a more recent development in germany , compared to these markets in the united states or britain . rewe , one of the leading groups in the european grocery trade , said it particularly addresses singles ’ needs in city stores . “ we especially offer a lot in the convenience sector , that is food that is ready-to-eat , ” said press spokeswoman astrid ohletz .
“ for example , we have fresh soups , sushi or pre-prepared fruit . ” singles : hip or fate ? rosenkranz points out that singles are not just students living alone or young professionals , though .
“ singles are a very heterogeneous group , ” she said .
“ what is a hip lifestyle for some is fate for another .
if you define singles as one-person households , half of them are senior citizens over the age of 55 . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senior citizens make up half of one-person households in germany and it is precisely this group of older singles that feel overlooked as consumers .
older singles , who usually only shop for themselves , suffer from the fact that packaging is so large , for example . “ smaller portions are disproportionately more expensive and many older singles only have their pension at their disposal , ” said rosenkranz . as a matter of fact , smaller single-friendly sizes are more expensive .
take your average major supermarket in cologne : 250 grams of regular butter costs between 0.99 euros and 1.29 euros -lrb- $ 1.31-1.70 -rrb- , depending on the brand .
but 125 grams costs 0.79 euro . another example is philadelphia cream cheese .
the regular size of 200 grams costs 1.49 euros .
but the single-friendly sized six-pack of 16.7 grams each , which comes to about half of the regular size , costs 1.19 euros . hde explained that this price difference is not discriminatory against singles .
it ’ s simply due to packaging and logistics costs , which are not necessarily half as great as for a big package .
“ large volumes are also less expensive , ” said roik .
“ that ’ s just the way it is . ” the “ living-alone-together ” single the larger packaging is not necessarily a problem for many younger singles aged between 25 and 35 .
“ these are so-called lats or ‘ living-alone-together ’ singles , who live alone , but often have a partner , ” rosenkranz explained .
“ in terms of consumption , this group often buys for the partner , too . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : singles prefer to eat their pizza in the restaurant in addition , lats spend above-average amounts on eating outside of their home , either in restaurants or with take-away food , she said . this group of singles is also not interested in the frozen dinners and mini-sized pizzas available on the market .
“ our research showed that this type of food mostly appeals to working mothers rather than singles , ” said rosenkranz . the internet ’ s potential for singles in his book “ consumer behavior in one-person households , ” the economic sociologist wilhelm ott wrote that eating well is important for the majority of singles . “ for many , eating and drinking express a certain lifestyle , ” said ott .
“ especially younger people living alone want to underline the particular quality of their way of life . ” in this sense , the internet holds a great potential for the singles ’ consumer market , said rosenkranz . “ it would be especially interesting for working singles if they could do their shopping online during the day , ” she said .
then , after work , they could simply pay for their groceries and head home . “ then , there would be more time for cooking good food with your partner or friends , ” she said . sabina casagrande , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de single and loving it in germany most german single women say they 're doing just fine without a man in their lives .

france is the world 's largest manufacturer of luxury goods ; 250,000 people are employed by the sector .
but 38,000 jobs are lost every year due to counterfeiting .
designer brands spend millions annually fighting fakes . fshion labels like hermès , chanel and louis vuitton may have made france the world leader when it comes to luxury products . but , the country is also the global loser from illegal competition from fakes .
in france , according to the customs service , the counterfeit business is booming . at a freight depot at orly airport , just outside of paris , a customs officer slits open a box of socks as he settles in to another day 's work protecting the biggest luxury industry in the world .
last year , he and his colleagues found and destroyed some three million fakes , double what they had taken in the previous year .
in one seizure in january , they found enough louis vuitton fabric to cover 54 tennis courts . " there are hundreds of millions of fake products out there , " said marc-antoine jamet , secretary-general of louis vuitton 's parent company , lvmh .
he said counterfeiting has become a colossal world industry representing more than five percent of all world trade . " look what companies spend fighting fakes : three million euros a year for lacoste , 15 million for vuitton , " he said .
" this is a problem on an industrial scale . " everyday people although organized crime plays a role in the matter , normally law-abiding people are also part of the problem .
people on holiday , for example , who see good copies which look like amazing bargains that ca n't be passed up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at orly airport , people returning from holidays abroad are greeted with posters of the lacoste crocodile and a chanel handbag warning them that bringing fakes into france is a criminal offense . " we 've been to turkey several times on holiday with the children and , i can tell you , when you 're with teenagers and you see designer labels for a fifth of what you 'd pay back home , it 's tempting , " said one woman returning for vacation who did n't want to give her name . she said during the summers , she would get a new wardrobe for her kids with fake goods , mostly jeans , t-shirts and sweatshirts , always with a little designer logo and never in any doubt that she was buying fakes . " for me , there 's a bit of getting our own back on companies who , as soon as they get a brand that sells well , charge astronomical prices , " she said . but her purchasing patterns could be risky .
people who are discovered bringing in fake goods can get hefty fines .
generally if there are one or two fake goods , people are let off .
but with higher quantities , people can pay fines that are more than double what the goods are actually worth . the shame of it all for some , though , buying or wearing counterfeit goods is , well , simply l 'horreur . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fake chanel watch " i 'm used to seeing all these fake vuitton or prada bags in asia , " said marion dufour , a fashion editor at the women 's magazine group marie-claire international . " i imagine myself wearing it and arriving at a famous fashion party with all of these beautiful people and all of a sudden a pr or a fashion editor will arrive and she will discover and find out that it is a fake one .
and i think i would really feel shame ! " but the big names of the luxury industry along paris ' avenue montaigne want counterfeiters to feel more than shame .
in the sixteenth century , people would get their hand cut off for making a fake .
today they might have to pay nearly $ 500,000 -lrb- 375,800 euros -rrb- : the maximum fine was doubled last year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 21.03.2005 learning to be single-friendly großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shopping for the right amount for one person is n't easy over 20 percent of german homes are one-person households .
but singles are a very heterogeneous group and therefore pose a particular challenge as consumers . in germany , the bestseller “ bridget jones ’ s diary ” was translated into “ schokolade zum frühstück ” or “ chocolate for breakfast . ”
for many , bridget jones personifies the stereotypical image of a single : having chocolate for breakfast and a glass -lrb- or more -rrb- of chardonnay for dinner . but the reality looks quite different . “ studies on one-person households show that particularly young professionals who earn good money are very interested in fresh products and are more likely to buy brand goods , ” said doris rosenkranz , a sociology professor at the university of applied sciences in würzburg and author of several publications on consumer habits . making single life more convenient according to figures from the federal statistics office , 20.7 percent of germany ’ s adult population - or 13.8 million people - live in one-person households .
in cities , this figure can reach over 50 percent . retailers are aware that they have to address all consumers , including singles , said olaf roik from the german retailers ’ association hde .
“ we try to do this through well-targeted marketing , especially in cities which have a higher number of one-person households , ” he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pizza is n't the only alternative for singles anymore german supermarkets have in fact come a long way since frozen pizza was the only option for a quick meal after work .
but fast , healthy meals for one-person households are a more recent development in germany , compared to these markets in the united states or britain . rewe , one of the leading groups in the european grocery trade , said it particularly addresses singles ’ needs in city stores . “ we especially offer a lot in the convenience sector , that is food that is ready-to-eat , ” said press spokeswoman astrid ohletz .
“ for example , we have fresh soups , sushi or pre-prepared fruit . ” singles : hip or fate ? rosenkranz points out that singles are not just students living alone or young professionals , though .
“ singles are a very heterogeneous group , ” she said .
“ what is a hip lifestyle for some is fate for another .
if you define singles as one-person households , half of them are senior citizens over the age of 55 . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senior citizens make up half of one-person households in germany and it is precisely this group of older singles that feel overlooked as consumers .
older singles , who usually only shop for themselves , suffer from the fact that packaging is so large , for example . “ smaller portions are disproportionately more expensive and many older singles only have their pension at their disposal , ” said rosenkranz . as a matter of fact , smaller single-friendly sizes are more expensive .
take your average major supermarket in cologne : 250 grams of regular butter costs between 0.99 euros and 1.29 euros -lrb- $ 1.31-1.70 -rrb- , depending on the brand .
but 125 grams costs 0.79 euro . another example is philadelphia cream cheese .
the regular size of 200 grams costs 1.49 euros .
but the single-friendly sized six-pack of 16.7 grams each , which comes to about half of the regular size , costs 1.19 euros . hde explained that this price difference is not discriminatory against singles .
it ’ s simply due to packaging and logistics costs , which are not necessarily half as great as for a big package .
“ large volumes are also less expensive , ” said roik .
“ that ’ s just the way it is . ” the “ living-alone-together ” single the larger packaging is not necessarily a problem for many younger singles aged between 25 and 35 .
“ these are so-called lats or ‘ living-alone-together ’ singles , who live alone , but often have a partner , ” rosenkranz explained .
“ in terms of consumption , this group often buys for the partner , too . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : singles prefer to eat their pizza in the restaurant in addition , lats spend above-average amounts on eating outside of their home , either in restaurants or with take-away food , she said . this group of singles is also not interested in the frozen dinners and mini-sized pizzas available on the market .
“ our research showed that this type of food mostly appeals to working mothers rather than singles , ” said rosenkranz . the internet ’ s potential for singles in his book “ consumer behavior in one-person households , ” the economic sociologist wilhelm ott wrote that eating well is important for the majority of singles . “ for many , eating and drinking express a certain lifestyle , ” said ott .
“ especially younger people living alone want to underline the particular quality of their way of life . ” in this sense , the internet holds a great potential for the singles ’ consumer market , said rosenkranz . “ it would be especially interesting for working singles if they could do their shopping online during the day , ” she said .
then , after work , they could simply pay for their groceries and head home . “ then , there would be more time for cooking good food with your partner or friends , ” she said . sabina casagrande , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de single and loving it in germany most german single women say they 're doing just fine without a man in their lives .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 21.03.2005 learning to be single-friendly großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shopping for the right amount for one person is n't easy over 20 percent of german homes are one-person households .
but singles are a very heterogeneous group and therefore pose a particular challenge as consumers . in germany , the bestseller “ bridget jones ’ s diary ” was translated into “ schokolade zum frühstück ” or “ chocolate for breakfast . ”
for many , bridget jones personifies the stereotypical image of a single : having chocolate for breakfast and a glass -lrb- or more -rrb- of chardonnay for dinner . but the reality looks quite different . “ studies on one-person households show that particularly young professionals who earn good money are very interested in fresh products and are more likely to buy brand goods , ” said doris rosenkranz , a sociology professor at the university of applied sciences in würzburg and author of several publications on consumer habits . making single life more convenient according to figures from the federal statistics office , 20.7 percent of germany ’ s adult population - or 13.8 million people - live in one-person households .
in cities , this figure can reach over 50 percent . retailers are aware that they have to address all consumers , including singles , said olaf roik from the german retailers ’ association hde .
“ we try to do this through well-targeted marketing , especially in cities which have a higher number of one-person households , ” he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pizza is n't the only alternative for singles anymore german supermarkets have in fact come a long way since frozen pizza was the only option for a quick meal after work .
but fast , healthy meals for one-person households are a more recent development in germany , compared to these markets in the united states or britain . rewe , one of the leading groups in the european grocery trade , said it particularly addresses singles ’ needs in city stores . “ we especially offer a lot in the convenience sector , that is food that is ready-to-eat , ” said press spokeswoman astrid ohletz .
“ for example , we have fresh soups , sushi or pre-prepared fruit . ” singles : hip or fate ? rosenkranz points out that singles are not just students living alone or young professionals , though .
“ singles are a very heterogeneous group , ” she said .
“ what is a hip lifestyle for some is fate for another .
if you define singles as one-person households , half of them are senior citizens over the age of 55 . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senior citizens make up half of one-person households in germany and it is precisely this group of older singles that feel overlooked as consumers .
older singles , who usually only shop for themselves , suffer from the fact that packaging is so large , for example . “ smaller portions are disproportionately more expensive and many older singles only have their pension at their disposal , ” said rosenkranz . as a matter of fact , smaller single-friendly sizes are more expensive .
take your average major supermarket in cologne : 250 grams of regular butter costs between 0.99 euros and 1.29 euros -lrb- $ 1.31-1.70 -rrb- , depending on the brand .
but 125 grams costs 0.79 euro . another example is philadelphia cream cheese .
the regular size of 200 grams costs 1.49 euros .
but the single-friendly sized six-pack of 16.7 grams each , which comes to about half of the regular size , costs 1.19 euros . hde explained that this price difference is not discriminatory against singles .
it ’ s simply due to packaging and logistics costs , which are not necessarily half as great as for a big package .
“ large volumes are also less expensive , ” said roik .
“ that ’ s just the way it is . ” the “ living-alone-together ” single the larger packaging is not necessarily a problem for many younger singles aged between 25 and 35 .
“ these are so-called lats or ‘ living-alone-together ’ singles , who live alone , but often have a partner , ” rosenkranz explained .
“ in terms of consumption , this group often buys for the partner , too . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : singles prefer to eat their pizza in the restaurant in addition , lats spend above-average amounts on eating outside of their home , either in restaurants or with take-away food , she said . this group of singles is also not interested in the frozen dinners and mini-sized pizzas available on the market .
“ our research showed that this type of food mostly appeals to working mothers rather than singles , ” said rosenkranz . the internet ’ s potential for singles in his book “ consumer behavior in one-person households , ” the economic sociologist wilhelm ott wrote that eating well is important for the majority of singles . “ for many , eating and drinking express a certain lifestyle , ” said ott .
“ especially younger people living alone want to underline the particular quality of their way of life . ” in this sense , the internet holds a great potential for the singles ’ consumer market , said rosenkranz . “ it would be especially interesting for working singles if they could do their shopping online during the day , ” she said .
then , after work , they could simply pay for their groceries and head home . “ then , there would be more time for cooking good food with your partner or friends , ” she said . sabina casagrande , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de single and loving it in germany most german single women say they 're doing just fine without a man in their lives .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 21.03.2005 learning to be single-friendly großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shopping for the right amount for one person is n't easy over 20 percent of german homes are one-person households .
but singles are a very heterogeneous group and therefore pose a particular challenge as consumers . in germany , the bestseller “ bridget jones ’ s diary ” was translated into “ schokolade zum frühstück ” or “ chocolate for breakfast . ”
for many , bridget jones personifies the stereotypical image of a single : having chocolate for breakfast and a glass -lrb- or more -rrb- of chardonnay for dinner . but the reality looks quite different . “ studies on one-person households show that particularly young professionals who earn good money are very interested in fresh products and are more likely to buy brand goods , ” said doris rosenkranz , a sociology professor at the university of applied sciences in würzburg and author of several publications on consumer habits . making single life more convenient according to figures from the federal statistics office , 20.7 percent of germany ’ s adult population - or 13.8 million people - live in one-person households .
in cities , this figure can reach over 50 percent . retailers are aware that they have to address all consumers , including singles , said olaf roik from the german retailers ’ association hde .
“ we try to do this through well-targeted marketing , especially in cities which have a higher number of one-person households , ” he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pizza is n't the only alternative for singles anymore german supermarkets have in fact come a long way since frozen pizza was the only option for a quick meal after work .
but fast , healthy meals for one-person households are a more recent development in germany , compared to these markets in the united states or britain . rewe , one of the leading groups in the european grocery trade , said it particularly addresses singles ’ needs in city stores . “ we especially offer a lot in the convenience sector , that is food that is ready-to-eat , ” said press spokeswoman astrid ohletz .
“ for example , we have fresh soups , sushi or pre-prepared fruit . ” singles : hip or fate ? rosenkranz points out that singles are not just students living alone or young professionals , though .
“ singles are a very heterogeneous group , ” she said .
“ what is a hip lifestyle for some is fate for another .
if you define singles as one-person households , half of them are senior citizens over the age of 55 . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senior citizens make up half of one-person households in germany and it is precisely this group of older singles that feel overlooked as consumers .
older singles , who usually only shop for themselves , suffer from the fact that packaging is so large , for example . “ smaller portions are disproportionately more expensive and many older singles only have their pension at their disposal , ” said rosenkranz . as a matter of fact , smaller single-friendly sizes are more expensive .
take your average major supermarket in cologne : 250 grams of regular butter costs between 0.99 euros and 1.29 euros -lrb- $ 1.31-1.70 -rrb- , depending on the brand .
but 125 grams costs 0.79 euro . another example is philadelphia cream cheese .
the regular size of 200 grams costs 1.49 euros .
but the single-friendly sized six-pack of 16.7 grams each , which comes to about half of the regular size , costs 1.19 euros . hde explained that this price difference is not discriminatory against singles .
it ’ s simply due to packaging and logistics costs , which are not necessarily half as great as for a big package .
“ large volumes are also less expensive , ” said roik .
“ that ’ s just the way it is . ” the “ living-alone-together ” single the larger packaging is not necessarily a problem for many younger singles aged between 25 and 35 .
“ these are so-called lats or ‘ living-alone-together ’ singles , who live alone , but often have a partner , ” rosenkranz explained .
“ in terms of consumption , this group often buys for the partner , too . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : singles prefer to eat their pizza in the restaurant in addition , lats spend above-average amounts on eating outside of their home , either in restaurants or with take-away food , she said . this group of singles is also not interested in the frozen dinners and mini-sized pizzas available on the market .
“ our research showed that this type of food mostly appeals to working mothers rather than singles , ” said rosenkranz . the internet ’ s potential for singles in his book “ consumer behavior in one-person households , ” the economic sociologist wilhelm ott wrote that eating well is important for the majority of singles . “ for many , eating and drinking express a certain lifestyle , ” said ott .
“ especially younger people living alone want to underline the particular quality of their way of life . ” in this sense , the internet holds a great potential for the singles ’ consumer market , said rosenkranz . “ it would be especially interesting for working singles if they could do their shopping online during the day , ” she said .
then , after work , they could simply pay for their groceries and head home . “ then , there would be more time for cooking good food with your partner or friends , ” she said . sabina casagrande , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de single and loving it in germany most german single women say they 're doing just fine without a man in their lives .

france is the world 's largest manufacturer of luxury goods ; 250,000 people are employed by the sector .
but 38,000 jobs are lost every year due to counterfeiting .
designer brands spend millions annually fighting fakes . fshion labels like hermès , chanel and louis vuitton may have made france the world leader when it comes to luxury products . but , the country is also the global loser from illegal competition from fakes .
in france , according to the customs service , the counterfeit business is booming . at a freight depot at orly airport , just outside of paris , a customs officer slits open a box of socks as he settles in to another day 's work protecting the biggest luxury industry in the world .
last year , he and his colleagues found and destroyed some three million fakes , double what they had taken in the previous year .
in one seizure in january , they found enough louis vuitton fabric to cover 54 tennis courts . " there are hundreds of millions of fake products out there , " said marc-antoine jamet , secretary-general of louis vuitton 's parent company , lvmh .
he said counterfeiting has become a colossal world industry representing more than five percent of all world trade . " look what companies spend fighting fakes : three million euros a year for lacoste , 15 million for vuitton , " he said .
" this is a problem on an industrial scale . " everyday people although organized crime plays a role in the matter , normally law-abiding people are also part of the problem .
people on holiday , for example , who see good copies which look like amazing bargains that ca n't be passed up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at orly airport , people returning from holidays abroad are greeted with posters of the lacoste crocodile and a chanel handbag warning them that bringing fakes into france is a criminal offense . " we 've been to turkey several times on holiday with the children and , i can tell you , when you 're with teenagers and you see designer labels for a fifth of what you 'd pay back home , it 's tempting , " said one woman returning for vacation who did n't want to give her name . she said during the summers , she would get a new wardrobe for her kids with fake goods , mostly jeans , t-shirts and sweatshirts , always with a little designer logo and never in any doubt that she was buying fakes . " for me , there 's a bit of getting our own back on companies who , as soon as they get a brand that sells well , charge astronomical prices , " she said . but her purchasing patterns could be risky .
people who are discovered bringing in fake goods can get hefty fines .
generally if there are one or two fake goods , people are let off .
but with higher quantities , people can pay fines that are more than double what the goods are actually worth . the shame of it all for some , though , buying or wearing counterfeit goods is , well , simply l 'horreur . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fake chanel watch " i 'm used to seeing all these fake vuitton or prada bags in asia , " said marion dufour , a fashion editor at the women 's magazine group marie-claire international . " i imagine myself wearing it and arriving at a famous fashion party with all of these beautiful people and all of a sudden a pr or a fashion editor will arrive and she will discover and find out that it is a fake one .
and i think i would really feel shame ! " but the big names of the luxury industry along paris ' avenue montaigne want counterfeiters to feel more than shame .
in the sixteenth century , people would get their hand cut off for making a fake .
today they might have to pay nearly $ 500,000 -lrb- 375,800 euros -rrb- : the maximum fine was doubled last year .
that high amount shows that for france there 's much at stake - not just money , but the image of the country itself . john laurenson -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lagerfeld has world domination all sewn-up a hard-to-miss presence at the paris ready-to-wear week , karl lagerfeld hit the headlines with his hemlines , presenting his new pret-a-porter collection .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 21.03.2005 learning to be single-friendly großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shopping for the right amount for one person is n't easy over 20 percent of german homes are one-person households .
but singles are a very heterogeneous group and therefore pose a particular challenge as consumers . in germany , the bestseller “ bridget jones ’ s diary ” was translated into “ schokolade zum frühstück ” or “ chocolate for breakfast . ”
for many , bridget jones personifies the stereotypical image of a single : having chocolate for breakfast and a glass -lrb- or more -rrb- of chardonnay for dinner . but the reality looks quite different . “ studies on one-person households show that particularly young professionals who earn good money are very interested in fresh products and are more likely to buy brand goods , ” said doris rosenkranz , a sociology professor at the university of applied sciences in würzburg and author of several publications on consumer habits . making single life more convenient according to figures from the federal statistics office , 20.7 percent of germany ’ s adult population - or 13.8 million people - live in one-person households .
in cities , this figure can reach over 50 percent . retailers are aware that they have to address all consumers , including singles , said olaf roik from the german retailers ’ association hde .
“ we try to do this through well-targeted marketing , especially in cities which have a higher number of one-person households , ” he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pizza is n't the only alternative for singles anymore german supermarkets have in fact come a long way since frozen pizza was the only option for a quick meal after work .
but fast , healthy meals for one-person households are a more recent development in germany , compared to these markets in the united states or britain . rewe , one of the leading groups in the european grocery trade , said it particularly addresses singles ’ needs in city stores . “ we especially offer a lot in the convenience sector , that is food that is ready-to-eat , ” said press spokeswoman astrid ohletz .
“ for example , we have fresh soups , sushi or pre-prepared fruit . ” singles : hip or fate ? rosenkranz points out that singles are not just students living alone or young professionals , though .
“ singles are a very heterogeneous group , ” she said .
“ what is a hip lifestyle for some is fate for another .
if you define singles as one-person households , half of them are senior citizens over the age of 55 . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senior citizens make up half of one-person households in germany and it is precisely this group of older singles that feel overlooked as consumers .
older singles , who usually only shop for themselves , suffer from the fact that packaging is so large , for example . “ smaller portions are disproportionately more expensive and many older singles only have their pension at their disposal , ” said rosenkranz . as a matter of fact , smaller single-friendly sizes are more expensive .
take your average major supermarket in cologne : 250 grams of regular butter costs between 0.99 euros and 1.29 euros -lrb- $ 1.31-1.70 -rrb- , depending on the brand .
but 125 grams costs 0.79 euro . another example is philadelphia cream cheese .
the regular size of 200 grams costs 1.49 euros .
but the single-friendly sized six-pack of 16.7 grams each , which comes to about half of the regular size , costs 1.19 euros . hde explained that this price difference is not discriminatory against singles .
it ’ s simply due to packaging and logistics costs , which are not necessarily half as great as for a big package .
“ large volumes are also less expensive , ” said roik .
“ that ’ s just the way it is . ” the “ living-alone-together ” single the larger packaging is not necessarily a problem for many younger singles aged between 25 and 35 .
“ these are so-called lats or ‘ living-alone-together ’ singles , who live alone , but often have a partner , ” rosenkranz explained .
“ in terms of consumption , this group often buys for the partner , too . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : singles prefer to eat their pizza in the restaurant in addition , lats spend above-average amounts on eating outside of their home , either in restaurants or with take-away food , she said . this group of singles is also not interested in the frozen dinners and mini-sized pizzas available on the market .
“ our research showed that this type of food mostly appeals to working mothers rather than singles , ” said rosenkranz . the internet ’ s potential for singles in his book “ consumer behavior in one-person households , ” the economic sociologist wilhelm ott wrote that eating well is important for the majority of singles . “ for many , eating and drinking express a certain lifestyle , ” said ott .
“ especially younger people living alone want to underline the particular quality of their way of life . ” in this sense , the internet holds a great potential for the singles ’ consumer market , said rosenkranz . “ it would be especially interesting for working singles if they could do their shopping online during the day , ” she said .
then , after work , they could simply pay for their groceries and head home . “ then , there would be more time for cooking good food with your partner or friends , ” she said . sabina casagrande , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de single and loving it in germany most german single women say they 're doing just fine without a man in their lives .

but singles are a very heterogeneous group and therefore pose a particular challenge as consumers . in germany , the bestseller “ bridget jones ’ s diary ” was translated into “ schokolade zum frühstück ” or “ chocolate for breakfast . ”
for many , bridget jones personifies the stereotypical image of a single : having chocolate for breakfast and a glass -lrb- or more -rrb- of chardonnay for dinner . but the reality looks quite different . “ studies on one-person households show that particularly young professionals who earn good money are very interested in fresh products and are more likely to buy brand goods , ” said doris rosenkranz , a sociology professor at the university of applied sciences in würzburg and author of several publications on consumer habits . making single life more convenient according to figures from the federal statistics office , 20.7 percent of germany ’ s adult population - or 13.8 million people - live in one-person households .

older singles , who usually only shop for themselves , suffer from the fact that packaging is so large , for example . “ smaller portions are disproportionately more expensive and many older singles only have their pension at their disposal , ” said rosenkranz . as a matter of fact , smaller single-friendly sizes are more expensive .
take your average major supermarket in cologne : 250 grams of regular butter costs between 0.99 euros and 1.29 euros -lrb- $ 1.31-1.70 -rrb- , depending on the brand .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 21.03.2005 fake designer goods cost france dearly großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is that really louis vuitton ?
france is the world 's largest manufacturer of luxury goods ; 250,000 people are employed by the sector .
but 38,000 jobs are lost every year due to counterfeiting .
designer brands spend millions annually fighting fakes . fshion labels like hermès , chanel and louis vuitton may have made france the world leader when it comes to luxury products . but , the country is also the global loser from illegal competition from fakes .
in france , according to the customs service , the counterfeit business is booming . at a freight depot at orly airport , just outside of paris , a customs officer slits open a box of socks as he settles in to another day 's work protecting the biggest luxury industry in the world .
last year , he and his colleagues found and destroyed some three million fakes , double what they had taken in the previous year .
in one seizure in january , they found enough louis vuitton fabric to cover 54 tennis courts . " there are hundreds of millions of fake products out there , " said marc-antoine jamet , secretary-general of louis vuitton 's parent company , lvmh .
he said counterfeiting has become a colossal world industry representing more than five percent of all world trade . " look what companies spend fighting fakes : three million euros a year for lacoste , 15 million for vuitton , " he said .
" this is a problem on an industrial scale . " everyday people although organized crime plays a role in the matter , normally law-abiding people are also part of the problem .
people on holiday , for example , who see good copies which look like amazing bargains that ca n't be passed up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at orly airport , people returning from holidays abroad are greeted with posters of the lacoste crocodile and a chanel handbag warning them that bringing fakes into france is a criminal offense . " we 've been to turkey several times on holiday with the children and , i can tell you , when you 're with teenagers and you see designer labels for a fifth of what you 'd pay back home , it 's tempting , " said one woman returning for vacation who did n't want to give her name . she said during the summers , she would get a new wardrobe for her kids with fake goods , mostly jeans , t-shirts and sweatshirts , always with a little designer logo and never in any doubt that she was buying fakes . " for me , there 's a bit of getting our own back on companies who , as soon as they get a brand that sells well , charge astronomical prices , " she said . but her purchasing patterns could be risky .
people who are discovered bringing in fake goods can get hefty fines .
generally if there are one or two fake goods , people are let off .
but with higher quantities , people can pay fines that are more than double what the goods are actually worth . the shame of it all for some , though , buying or wearing counterfeit goods is , well , simply l 'horreur . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fake chanel watch " i 'm used to seeing all these fake vuitton or prada bags in asia , " said marion dufour , a fashion editor at the women 's magazine group marie-claire international . " i imagine myself wearing it and arriving at a famous fashion party with all of these beautiful people and all of a sudden a pr or a fashion editor will arrive and she will discover and find out that it is a fake one .
and i think i would really feel shame ! " but the big names of the luxury industry along paris ' avenue montaigne want counterfeiters to feel more than shame .
in the sixteenth century , people would get their hand cut off for making a fake .
today they might have to pay nearly $ 500,000 -lrb- 375,800 euros -rrb- : the maximum fine was doubled last year .
that high amount shows that for france there 's much at stake - not just money , but the image of the country itself . john laurenson -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lagerfeld has world domination all sewn-up a hard-to-miss presence at the paris ready-to-wear week , karl lagerfeld hit the headlines with his hemlines , presenting his new pret-a-porter collection .

until now an agreement had been kept at bay by deep divisions between countries wanting more flexibility , led by france and germany , and other , mostly smaller , nations such as austria and the netherlands wanting the principles of budgetary discipline to be upheld . now the eu is determined to renew the budget rules in a way that will not threaten economic recovery and will strike the right balance between budgetary rigor and fiscal flexibility . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an agreement looms eu leaders maintain that the pact 's two key rules - public deficits should not exceed 3 percent of gross domestic product and public debt should not surpass 60 percent of gdp - were not compromised .

" i am satisfied with the agreement , the fundamental rules ... have not been changed . " instead , the deal boosted measures aimed at preventing countries from overspending as well as reinforced the authority of eu 's executive commission to police the deficits , he said . the agreement also allows countries more time to rein in their deficits when they overshoot the three percent limit and it requires the european commission to take into account extraordinary circumstances when judging a member 's deficit . final approval is expected during the summit this week . not a free ride the european commission , which polices deficits , voiced satisfaction with the outcome of the talks with eu economic affairs commissioner joaquin almunia saying he had a " very positive view of the final result .

" germany , the eu 's biggest economy , has for the past three years violated the stability and growth pact 's rules that stipulate that no eurozone member 's public debt should exceed 3 percent of gross domestic product . at the same time , germany , the largest net contributor to the eu budget , has spent hundreds of billions of euros on reunification .
it is also the eu 's poorest performing economy , having narrowly escaped its third recession in four years and having an unemployment rate of 12.6 percent .
the agreement will allow germany to discount about 4 percent of its gdp when tallying its deficit . still , not all german officials were happy with the agreement . " we are leaving future generations with more debt and higher taxes , " cdu financial expert michael meister told german television channel ard .
" and this is not going to be good for employment creation . " strained credibility the 1997 budget pact was all but suspended in november 2003 when eu heavyweights france and germany were let off the hook despite repeatedly breaching a key requirement .
since then nearly half the eu 's 25 states have also triggered disciplinary measures under the pact , while the system 's already-strained credibility has also suffered after it emerged that greece had submitted wrong data for years .
until now an agreement had been kept at bay by deep divisions between countries wanting more flexibility , led by france and germany , and other , mostly smaller , nations such as austria and the netherlands wanting the principles of budgetary discipline to be upheld . now the eu is determined to renew the budget rules in a way that will not threaten economic recovery and will strike the right balance between budgetary rigor and fiscal flexibility . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an agreement looms eu leaders maintain that the pact 's two key rules - public deficits should not exceed 3 percent of gross domestic product and public debt should not surpass 60 percent of gdp - were not compromised .
they are " neither in question nor threatened " by the agreement , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , whose country holds the eu 's presidency , told afp .
" i am satisfied with the agreement , the fundamental rules ... have not been changed . " instead , the deal boosted measures aimed at preventing countries from overspending as well as reinforced the authority of eu 's executive commission to police the deficits , he said . the agreement also allows countries more time to rein in their deficits when they overshoot the three percent limit and it requires the european commission to take into account extraordinary circumstances when judging a member 's deficit . final approval is expected during the summit this week . not a free ride the european commission , which polices deficits , voiced satisfaction with the outcome of the talks with eu economic affairs commissioner joaquin almunia saying he had a " very positive view of the final result . " however , austrian finance minister karl-heinz grasser , who has led a campaign against watering down the pact , expressed muted satisfaction .

germany increased troop numbers there recently as part of a european union effort to maintain a fragile peace . struck 's visit to the southern serb province of kosovo comes almost exactly a year after an outbreak of anti-serb violence there left 19 dead and hundreds injured .
then , serb villages were attacked by ethnic albanians for three days - while nato peacekeepers , including those from germany , did nothing to stop them . the defense minister 's two-day encounter with about 3,000 german troops in kosovo is primarily meant to boost morale in what many experts say is a hopeless mission .
general klaus reinhardt , commander of the nato-led kosovo force in 1999 , said the international community would not be able to end the violence simply sending more troops to the province . root causes remain " three additional brigades have been sent down there , but the root causes for the riots have not been tackled , " reinhardt said .

there are also plans by the un to start final negotiations on the status of kosovo this summer - a decision struck said was needed as soon as possible . " we can only help our troops make sense of their mission as long as there is political progress , " the german defense minister said .
over the long term , military engagement in kosovo would be hard to justify if serbian enclaves were protected without any will on the part of serbs and ethnic albanians in kosovo to live together in peace , he added . possible reduction in bosnia in bosnia , where struck will meet with political leaders on tuesday , the situation is much more stable .

germany increased troop numbers there recently as part of a european union effort to maintain a fragile peace . struck 's visit to the southern serb province of kosovo comes almost exactly a year after an outbreak of anti-serb violence there left 19 dead and hundreds injured .
then , serb villages were attacked by ethnic albanians for three days - while nato peacekeepers , including those from germany , did nothing to stop them . the defense minister 's two-day encounter with about 3,000 german troops in kosovo is primarily meant to boost morale in what many experts say is a hopeless mission .
general klaus reinhardt , commander of the nato-led kosovo force in 1999 , said the international community would not be able to end the violence simply sending more troops to the province . root causes remain " three additional brigades have been sent down there , but the root causes for the riots have not been tackled , " reinhardt said .
" since political and social disenchantment remain , there is bound to be a repeat of the ethnic clashes .
for many , it ’ s one year on and nothing has changed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramush haradinaj earlier this month , germany sent an additional 600 troops to kosovo to calm tensions after ethnic albanian prime minister ramush haradinaj -lrb- photo -rrb- resigned and surrendered to the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia in the hague . nato has around 18,000 peacekeepers in the province and a united nations mission spokesman claimed last week that the security situation had improved substantially .
there are also plans by the un to start final negotiations on the status of kosovo this summer - a decision struck said was needed as soon as possible . " we can only help our troops make sense of their mission as long as there is political progress , " the german defense minister said .
over the long term , military engagement in kosovo would be hard to justify if serbian enclaves were protected without any will on the part of serbs and ethnic albanians in kosovo to live together in peace , he added . possible reduction in bosnia in bosnia , where struck will meet with political leaders on tuesday , the situation is much more stable .
that has already led to calls for a substantial reduction in the number of foreign troops stationed there . the eu took over the bosnian mission from nato in december last year .
it has maintained troop levels at around 7,000 in what is the eu ’ s largest such operation to date .
but eu officials are reviewing whether troop numbers can be reduced to around 5,000 . the leaders of the eu force , which also includes troops from non-eu countries , describe conditions as peaceful .

but singles are a very heterogeneous group and therefore pose a particular challenge as consumers . in germany , the bestseller “ bridget jones ’ s diary ” was translated into “ schokolade zum frühstück ” or “ chocolate for breakfast . ”
for many , bridget jones personifies the stereotypical image of a single : having chocolate for breakfast and a glass -lrb- or more -rrb- of chardonnay for dinner . but the reality looks quite different . “ studies on one-person households show that particularly young professionals who earn good money are very interested in fresh products and are more likely to buy brand goods , ” said doris rosenkranz , a sociology professor at the university of applied sciences in würzburg and author of several publications on consumer habits . making single life more convenient according to figures from the federal statistics office , 20.7 percent of germany ’ s adult population - or 13.8 million people - live in one-person households .
in cities , this figure can reach over 50 percent . retailers are aware that they have to address all consumers , including singles , said olaf roik from the german retailers ’ association hde .
“ we try to do this through well-targeted marketing , especially in cities which have a higher number of one-person households , ” he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pizza is n't the only alternative for singles anymore german supermarkets have in fact come a long way since frozen pizza was the only option for a quick meal after work .
but fast , healthy meals for one-person households are a more recent development in germany , compared to these markets in the united states or britain . rewe , one of the leading groups in the european grocery trade , said it particularly addresses singles ’ needs in city stores . “ we especially offer a lot in the convenience sector , that is food that is ready-to-eat , ” said press spokeswoman astrid ohletz .
“ for example , we have fresh soups , sushi or pre-prepared fruit . ” singles : hip or fate ? rosenkranz points out that singles are not just students living alone or young professionals , though .
“ singles are a very heterogeneous group , ” she said .
“ what is a hip lifestyle for some is fate for another .
if you define singles as one-person households , half of them are senior citizens over the age of 55 . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senior citizens make up half of one-person households in germany and it is precisely this group of older singles that feel overlooked as consumers .
older singles , who usually only shop for themselves , suffer from the fact that packaging is so large , for example . “ smaller portions are disproportionately more expensive and many older singles only have their pension at their disposal , ” said rosenkranz . as a matter of fact , smaller single-friendly sizes are more expensive .
take your average major supermarket in cologne : 250 grams of regular butter costs between 0.99 euros and 1.29 euros -lrb- $ 1.31-1.70 -rrb- , depending on the brand .
but 125 grams costs 0.79 euro . another example is philadelphia cream cheese .
the regular size of 200 grams costs 1.49 euros .
but the single-friendly sized six-pack of 16.7 grams each , which comes to about half of the regular size , costs 1.19 euros . hde explained that this price difference is not discriminatory against singles .
it ’ s simply due to packaging and logistics costs , which are not necessarily half as great as for a big package .
“ large volumes are also less expensive , ” said roik .
“ that ’ s just the way it is . ” the “ living-alone-together ” single the larger packaging is not necessarily a problem for many younger singles aged between 25 and 35 .
“ these are so-called lats or ‘ living-alone-together ’ singles , who live alone , but often have a partner , ” rosenkranz explained .
“ in terms of consumption , this group often buys for the partner , too . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : singles prefer to eat their pizza in the restaurant in addition , lats spend above-average amounts on eating outside of their home , either in restaurants or with take-away food , she said . this group of singles is also not interested in the frozen dinners and mini-sized pizzas available on the market .
“ our research showed that this type of food mostly appeals to working mothers rather than singles , ” said rosenkranz . the internet ’ s potential for singles in his book “ consumer behavior in one-person households , ” the economic sociologist wilhelm ott wrote that eating well is important for the majority of singles . “ for many , eating and drinking express a certain lifestyle , ” said ott .
“ especially younger people living alone want to underline the particular quality of their way of life . ” in this sense , the internet holds a great potential for the singles ’ consumer market , said rosenkranz . “ it would be especially interesting for working singles if they could do their shopping online during the day , ” she said .
then , after work , they could simply pay for their groceries and head home . “ then , there would be more time for cooking good food with your partner or friends , ” she said . sabina casagrande , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de single and loving it in germany most german single women say they 're doing just fine without a man in their lives .

countries are expected to head for public surpluses in times of growth .
breaches of the limits are to be punished with stiff financial penalties . reality shows a long list of repeat offenders so much for the theory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder : " you pay . "
chirac : " no , you pay . "
in reality , nearly half the eu 's 25 members have since run up so-called excessive deficits , with france and germany topping the list of offenders . indeed , the euro zone heavyweights ' deficit ratios have been well above the 3.0-percent limit for the past three years and there is every indication that , with growth expected to remain sluggish at best , they will break the rules again this year . while smaller euro zone countries have swallowed the pact 's bitter medicine and managed to get their finances in order , laggards france and germany have long campaigned for a softening of the rules . they want special mitigating factors to be taken into account when evaluating the state of a country 's public finances , with germany particularly vocal in arguing that the astronomic costs of unification and its massive net contribution to the eu budget form part of the equation . generous germany on the ropes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel indicates the deficit to the german bundestag .
germany has ploughed hundreds of billions of euros into unification and is the biggest net contributor to the eu budget .
but the euro zone 's biggest economy also narrowly escaped its third recession in four years at the end of last year and unemployment in germany currently stands at a post-war high of 5.2 million or 12.6 percent of the population . and even current finance minister hans eichel , who originally presented himself as an iron-fisted and merciless cutter of costs and public-spending , now argues that tightening germany 's purse strings will only make matters worse .
it seems to be germany 's intransigence that is the main hurdle to eu-wide agreement being reached on a reform of the pact , analysts said . " the sticking point seems to be germany 's insistence that some allowance should be made for unification costs and the net contribution to the eu budget , " said dresdner kleinwort wasserstein economist anthony thomas in an interview with afp .

germany increased troop numbers there recently as part of a european union effort to maintain a fragile peace . struck 's visit to the southern serb province of kosovo comes almost exactly a year after an outbreak of anti-serb violence there left 19 dead and hundreds injured .
then , serb villages were attacked by ethnic albanians for three days - while nato peacekeepers , including those from germany , did nothing to stop them . the defense minister 's two-day encounter with about 3,000 german troops in kosovo is primarily meant to boost morale in what many experts say is a hopeless mission .
general klaus reinhardt , commander of the nato-led kosovo force in 1999 , said the international community would not be able to end the violence simply sending more troops to the province . root causes remain " three additional brigades have been sent down there , but the root causes for the riots have not been tackled , " reinhardt said .
" since political and social disenchantment remain , there is bound to be a repeat of the ethnic clashes .
for many , it ’ s one year on and nothing has changed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramush haradinaj earlier this month , germany sent an additional 600 troops to kosovo to calm tensions after ethnic albanian prime minister ramush haradinaj -lrb- photo -rrb- resigned and surrendered to the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia in the hague . nato has around 18,000 peacekeepers in the province and a united nations mission spokesman claimed last week that the security situation had improved substantially .
there are also plans by the un to start final negotiations on the status of kosovo this summer - a decision struck said was needed as soon as possible . " we can only help our troops make sense of their mission as long as there is political progress , " the german defense minister said .
over the long term , military engagement in kosovo would be hard to justify if serbian enclaves were protected without any will on the part of serbs and ethnic albanians in kosovo to live together in peace , he added . possible reduction in bosnia in bosnia , where struck will meet with political leaders on tuesday , the situation is much more stable .
that has already led to calls for a substantial reduction in the number of foreign troops stationed there . the eu took over the bosnian mission from nato in december last year .
it has maintained troop levels at around 7,000 in what is the eu ’ s largest such operation to date .
but eu officials are reviewing whether troop numbers can be reduced to around 5,000 . the leaders of the eu force , which also includes troops from non-eu countries , describe conditions as peaceful .
but they also say that , a decade after the end of the bosnian war , it 's proved impossible to stamp out the ethnic tensions that fuelled the balkans wars . uwe hessler -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de foreign missions trouble soldiers although germany has handed over the reins of the international security assistance force to canada , 1,700 german soldiers remain in afghanistan .

france is the world 's largest manufacturer of luxury goods ; 250,000 people are employed by the sector .
but 38,000 jobs are lost every year due to counterfeiting .
designer brands spend millions annually fighting fakes . fshion labels like hermès , chanel and louis vuitton may have made france the world leader when it comes to luxury products . but , the country is also the global loser from illegal competition from fakes .
in france , according to the customs service , the counterfeit business is booming . at a freight depot at orly airport , just outside of paris , a customs officer slits open a box of socks as he settles in to another day 's work protecting the biggest luxury industry in the world .
last year , he and his colleagues found and destroyed some three million fakes , double what they had taken in the previous year .
in one seizure in january , they found enough louis vuitton fabric to cover 54 tennis courts . " there are hundreds of millions of fake products out there , " said marc-antoine jamet , secretary-general of louis vuitton 's parent company , lvmh .
he said counterfeiting has become a colossal world industry representing more than five percent of all world trade . " look what companies spend fighting fakes : three million euros a year for lacoste , 15 million for vuitton , " he said .
" this is a problem on an industrial scale . " everyday people although organized crime plays a role in the matter , normally law-abiding people are also part of the problem .
people on holiday , for example , who see good copies which look like amazing bargains that ca n't be passed up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at orly airport , people returning from holidays abroad are greeted with posters of the lacoste crocodile and a chanel handbag warning them that bringing fakes into france is a criminal offense . " we 've been to turkey several times on holiday with the children and , i can tell you , when you 're with teenagers and you see designer labels for a fifth of what you 'd pay back home , it 's tempting , " said one woman returning for vacation who did n't want to give her name . she said during the summers , she would get a new wardrobe for her kids with fake goods , mostly jeans , t-shirts and sweatshirts , always with a little designer logo and never in any doubt that she was buying fakes . " for me , there 's a bit of getting our own back on companies who , as soon as they get a brand that sells well , charge astronomical prices , " she said . but her purchasing patterns could be risky .
people who are discovered bringing in fake goods can get hefty fines .
generally if there are one or two fake goods , people are let off .
but with higher quantities , people can pay fines that are more than double what the goods are actually worth . the shame of it all for some , though , buying or wearing counterfeit goods is , well , simply l 'horreur . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fake chanel watch " i 'm used to seeing all these fake vuitton or prada bags in asia , " said marion dufour , a fashion editor at the women 's magazine group marie-claire international . " i imagine myself wearing it and arriving at a famous fashion party with all of these beautiful people and all of a sudden a pr or a fashion editor will arrive and she will discover and find out that it is a fake one .
and i think i would really feel shame ! " but the big names of the luxury industry along paris ' avenue montaigne want counterfeiters to feel more than shame .
in the sixteenth century , people would get their hand cut off for making a fake .
today they might have to pay nearly $ 500,000 -lrb- 375,800 euros -rrb- : the maximum fine was doubled last year .

" it was clear that we were not examining the files enough and that many people were passing through the loopholes for unknown reasons , " ernst-jörg von studnitz , former ambassador to russia from 1995 to 2002 , told the german news agency dpa . " green ideology " fischer , whose standing as the most popular politician in germany has taken a hammering over the visa affair , did not pay enough attention to the visa policy , von studnitz charged . the former ambassador said fischer 's policy was " the attempt to put into practice the green ideology . " von studnitz said the ministry took too long to react to the abuse of the liberalized visa regulations introduced under fischer . " apparently , we just shut our eyes .
this happens often when ideological elements are slipped into political practice , " von studnitz told der spiegel weekly in an interviewed published on monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting outside the german consulate in kiev , december 2004 der spiegel also reported that the ministry acknowledged that the visa policy had led to illegal immigration in an internal memo dated july 2004 . fischer has acknowledged making mistakes but has refused to resign .

but with three weeks left and little progress to date , mutual recriminations have begun . the dispute flared up again on friday when us negotiator robert zoellick decided to step up the pressure after meeting with his european counterpart , eu trade commissioner peter mandelson .
zoellick 's spokesman said " the europeans are clearly unwilling to eliminate the subsidies , " and said if necessary the united states was ready to return to litigation at the wto . this triggered a warning saturday from brussels that it would also make claims against washington .
" if the us decides to move to the wto approach , which we hope they will not , obviously we would launch our own counter-case , " said a european commission official who spoke to afp on condition of anonymity . complaints traded across the atlantic the united states lodged a complaint against eu subsidies to france-based airbus with the wto in october , which brought a counteraction from brussels against what it termed indirect us government aid for chicago-based boeing . but the agreement in january to try to resolve the dispute by renegotiating a 1992 bilateral accord that set the terms of assistance to aircraft makers effectively froze the wto procedure , which eu officials had said would have been a " disastrous " legal clash .

" we have n't changed positions or made specific demands , " said the eu official , adding that " we 've indicated we want pertinent questions added " to the discussions . the eu believes that no comprehensive deal can be reached by april 11 given the complexities of the issues .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 21.03.2005 mixed reactions to stability pact rewrite großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro just got a little less stable , say critics of the change in the wake of sunday 's decision to loosen the rules of the stability and growth pact which underpins the euro , opposition voices in germany are crying foul .
but some economists say more flexibility was needed . germany was one of the prime architects of the stability pact , worried that the profligate ways of smaller eu members would weaken the common currency 's strength .
germany was , at the time of the pact 's adoption , about to leave behind its beloved deutschmark , which had been a steady , stable friend of the country for decades . but over the past months , germany , along with france and italy , has been at the forefront of the drive to water down the pact . on sunday , its efforts bore fruit , and eu ministers agreed on a plan that includes giving germany special treatment because of the high costs of reunification , which germany has said is largely to blame for its inability over the past three years to keep its deficit under the three-percent mark required by the original stability pact . germany has breached the stability pact rules for the last three years and looks on its way to doing it again . there 's a definite sense of satisfaction coming from german finance minister hans eichel , who said the reworked pact is " more rational economically -lsb- and -rsb- more growth friendly , " since it takes into consideration the country 's economic growth and phases of stagnation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eating away at the euro ?
but germany 's opposition is calling the compromise set forth by the 25 eu ministers nothing short of disastrous . " we 've all received a clear signal that the euro will not be as strong as the former deutschmark , " said michael meister , finance spokesman for the conservative christian democrats .
" what 's worse , confidence and trust in the reliability of the european union is being destroyed on a massive scale only because a few countries – germany included – are not willing to display budgetary discipline . ” a " sin " theo waigel , finance minister under former chancellor helmut kohl and member of the bavarian-based christian social union , called the loosening of the pact a " sin against our children " who he said will be left to shoulder the debt of their parents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former finance minister theo waigel , left , with his boss , former chancellor helmut kohl .
waigel , who was finance minister when the stability and growth pact was adopted in 1997 , said the government then had purposefully left out considerations of the cost of reunification in drawing up the agreement . " because then we knew we 'd have every country citing their own special problems , " he said , adding that germany had now abandoned its position as a leading advocate of euro stability in europe . there was criticism on the european level as well .
othmar karas , an austrian who represents the european people 's party in strasburg , said it was a grave mistake to bow to the german government 's demand for special treatment over reunification .
he called the reunification justification for changing the pact 's rules just an excuse , since the financial burden of german reunification started far before the year 2000 , when germany exceeded deficit limits for the first time . " no , it started 15 years ago , and for most of the time germany had enough discipline not to let the financial situation get out of control despite the additional burden , " he said .
" in other words , there ’ s no justification whatsoever to insist on special treatment now . ” a few voices in favor despite the reproaches of opposition politicians and other experts , some german economists have a more sanguine outlook regarding the relaxation of the pact .
most currency analysts said they did not fear a substantial weakening of the euro because of the new rules . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : balloon euro .
will it deflate soon ?
manfred kurz of the bavarian state bank said adding more flexibility to the stability agreement could give countries like germany more room to develop growth-oriented economic policies . the president of the halle institute for economic research , ulrich blum , told the reuters news agency that taking the particular economic difficulties of a country into consideration is not bad policy .
" after all , we are shouldering the entire weight of german reunification , " he said . german spends four percent of its gross domestic product on transfers to the former communist eastern part of the country .
the government estimates it has transferred 1.5 trillion euros -lrb- $ 2 trillion -rrb- since the berlin wall fell 15 years ago . finance minister hans eichel said german reunification was a " unique problem " that needed to be adequately addressed .
he said the agreement did not mean german was abandoning the goal of keeping its deficit under three percent of gdp . " of course i want to stick to it , " he said . boost for schröder the move by the eu 's finance ministers has given chancellor gerhard schröder an economic and political boost at a time when he badly needs it .
the government in berlin is struggling to overcome years of economic stagnation and an unemployment rate that has reached 12.6 percent , a rate not seen since the 1930s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder , left , with french president jacques chirac , another advocate of changing the euro rules .
the pact decision will lessen the likelihood that germany will face punitive action from brussels for not keeping its deficit down .
the change could inspire hope that the government will have room to spend and perhaps bring the unemployment rate down below the psychologically important number of five million . schröder 's party , the social democrats , is facing an important state election on may 22 in its traditional stronghold of north rhine-westphalia .
it is currently trailing the opposition in opinion polls .

but some economists say more flexibility was needed . germany was one of the prime architects of the stability pact , worried that the profligate ways of smaller eu members would weaken the common currency 's strength .
germany was , at the time of the pact 's adoption , about to leave behind its beloved deutschmark , which had been a steady , stable friend of the country for decades . but over the past months , germany , along with france and italy , has been at the forefront of the drive to water down the pact . on sunday , its efforts bore fruit , and eu ministers agreed on a plan that includes giving germany special treatment because of the high costs of reunification , which germany has said is largely to blame for its inability over the past three years to keep its deficit under the three-percent mark required by the original stability pact . germany has breached the stability pact rules for the last three years and looks on its way to doing it again . there 's a definite sense of satisfaction coming from german finance minister hans eichel , who said the reworked pact is " more rational economically -lsb- and -rsb- more growth friendly , " since it takes into consideration the country 's economic growth and phases of stagnation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eating away at the euro ?
but germany 's opposition is calling the compromise set forth by the 25 eu ministers nothing short of disastrous . " we 've all received a clear signal that the euro will not be as strong as the former deutschmark , " said michael meister , finance spokesman for the conservative christian democrats .
" what 's worse , confidence and trust in the reliability of the european union is being destroyed on a massive scale only because a few countries – germany included – are not willing to display budgetary discipline . ” a " sin " theo waigel , finance minister under former chancellor helmut kohl and member of the bavarian-based christian social union , called the loosening of the pact a " sin against our children " who he said will be left to shoulder the debt of their parents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former finance minister theo waigel , left , with his boss , former chancellor helmut kohl .
waigel , who was finance minister when the stability and growth pact was adopted in 1997 , said the government then had purposefully left out considerations of the cost of reunification in drawing up the agreement . " because then we knew we 'd have every country citing their own special problems , " he said , adding that germany had now abandoned its position as a leading advocate of euro stability in europe . there was criticism on the european level as well .
othmar karas , an austrian who represents the european people 's party in strasburg , said it was a grave mistake to bow to the german government 's demand for special treatment over reunification .
he called the reunification justification for changing the pact 's rules just an excuse , since the financial burden of german reunification started far before the year 2000 , when germany exceeded deficit limits for the first time . " no , it started 15 years ago , and for most of the time germany had enough discipline not to let the financial situation get out of control despite the additional burden , " he said .
" in other words , there ’ s no justification whatsoever to insist on special treatment now . ” a few voices in favor despite the reproaches of opposition politicians and other experts , some german economists have a more sanguine outlook regarding the relaxation of the pact .

manfred kurz of the bavarian state bank said adding more flexibility to the stability agreement could give countries like germany more room to develop growth-oriented economic policies . the president of the halle institute for economic research , ulrich blum , told the reuters news agency that taking the particular economic difficulties of a country into consideration is not bad policy .
" after all , we are shouldering the entire weight of german reunification , " he said . german spends four percent of its gross domestic product on transfers to the former communist eastern part of the country .
the government estimates it has transferred 1.5 trillion euros -lrb- $ 2 trillion -rrb- since the berlin wall fell 15 years ago . finance minister hans eichel said german reunification was a " unique problem " that needed to be adequately addressed .
he said the agreement did not mean german was abandoning the goal of keeping its deficit under three percent of gdp . " of course i want to stick to it , " he said . boost for schröder the move by the eu 's finance ministers has given chancellor gerhard schröder an economic and political boost at a time when he badly needs it .
the government in berlin is struggling to overcome years of economic stagnation and an unemployment rate that has reached 12.6 percent , a rate not seen since the 1930s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder , left , with french president jacques chirac , another advocate of changing the euro rules .
the pact decision will lessen the likelihood that germany will face punitive action from brussels for not keeping its deficit down .
the change could inspire hope that the government will have room to spend and perhaps bring the unemployment rate down below the psychologically important number of five million . schröder 's party , the social democrats , is facing an important state election on may 22 in its traditional stronghold of north rhine-westphalia .

but some economists say more flexibility was needed . germany was one of the prime architects of the stability pact , worried that the profligate ways of smaller eu members would weaken the common currency 's strength .
germany was , at the time of the pact 's adoption , about to leave behind its beloved deutschmark , which had been a steady , stable friend of the country for decades . but over the past months , germany , along with france and italy , has been at the forefront of the drive to water down the pact . on sunday , its efforts bore fruit , and eu ministers agreed on a plan that includes giving germany special treatment because of the high costs of reunification , which germany has said is largely to blame for its inability over the past three years to keep its deficit under the three-percent mark required by the original stability pact . germany has breached the stability pact rules for the last three years and looks on its way to doing it again . there 's a definite sense of satisfaction coming from german finance minister hans eichel , who said the reworked pact is " more rational economically -lsb- and -rsb- more growth friendly , " since it takes into consideration the country 's economic growth and phases of stagnation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eating away at the euro ?
but germany 's opposition is calling the compromise set forth by the 25 eu ministers nothing short of disastrous . " we 've all received a clear signal that the euro will not be as strong as the former deutschmark , " said michael meister , finance spokesman for the conservative christian democrats .
" what 's worse , confidence and trust in the reliability of the european union is being destroyed on a massive scale only because a few countries – germany included – are not willing to display budgetary discipline . ” a " sin " theo waigel , finance minister under former chancellor helmut kohl and member of the bavarian-based christian social union , called the loosening of the pact a " sin against our children " who he said will be left to shoulder the debt of their parents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former finance minister theo waigel , left , with his boss , former chancellor helmut kohl .
waigel , who was finance minister when the stability and growth pact was adopted in 1997 , said the government then had purposefully left out considerations of the cost of reunification in drawing up the agreement . " because then we knew we 'd have every country citing their own special problems , " he said , adding that germany had now abandoned its position as a leading advocate of euro stability in europe . there was criticism on the european level as well .
othmar karas , an austrian who represents the european people 's party in strasburg , said it was a grave mistake to bow to the german government 's demand for special treatment over reunification .
he called the reunification justification for changing the pact 's rules just an excuse , since the financial burden of german reunification started far before the year 2000 , when germany exceeded deficit limits for the first time . " no , it started 15 years ago , and for most of the time germany had enough discipline not to let the financial situation get out of control despite the additional burden , " he said .
" in other words , there ’ s no justification whatsoever to insist on special treatment now . ” a few voices in favor despite the reproaches of opposition politicians and other experts , some german economists have a more sanguine outlook regarding the relaxation of the pact .
most currency analysts said they did not fear a substantial weakening of the euro because of the new rules . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : balloon euro .
will it deflate soon ?
manfred kurz of the bavarian state bank said adding more flexibility to the stability agreement could give countries like germany more room to develop growth-oriented economic policies . the president of the halle institute for economic research , ulrich blum , told the reuters news agency that taking the particular economic difficulties of a country into consideration is not bad policy .
" after all , we are shouldering the entire weight of german reunification , " he said . german spends four percent of its gross domestic product on transfers to the former communist eastern part of the country .
the government estimates it has transferred 1.5 trillion euros -lrb- $ 2 trillion -rrb- since the berlin wall fell 15 years ago . finance minister hans eichel said german reunification was a " unique problem " that needed to be adequately addressed .
he said the agreement did not mean german was abandoning the goal of keeping its deficit under three percent of gdp . " of course i want to stick to it , " he said . boost for schröder the move by the eu 's finance ministers has given chancellor gerhard schröder an economic and political boost at a time when he badly needs it .
the government in berlin is struggling to overcome years of economic stagnation and an unemployment rate that has reached 12.6 percent , a rate not seen since the 1930s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder , left , with french president jacques chirac , another advocate of changing the euro rules .
the pact decision will lessen the likelihood that germany will face punitive action from brussels for not keeping its deficit down .
the change could inspire hope that the government will have room to spend and perhaps bring the unemployment rate down below the psychologically important number of five million . schröder 's party , the social democrats , is facing an important state election on may 22 in its traditional stronghold of north rhine-westphalia .
it is currently trailing the opposition in opinion polls .

france is the world 's largest manufacturer of luxury goods ; 250,000 people are employed by the sector .
but 38,000 jobs are lost every year due to counterfeiting .
designer brands spend millions annually fighting fakes . fshion labels like hermès , chanel and louis vuitton may have made france the world leader when it comes to luxury products . but , the country is also the global loser from illegal competition from fakes .
in france , according to the customs service , the counterfeit business is booming . at a freight depot at orly airport , just outside of paris , a customs officer slits open a box of socks as he settles in to another day 's work protecting the biggest luxury industry in the world .
last year , he and his colleagues found and destroyed some three million fakes , double what they had taken in the previous year .
in one seizure in january , they found enough louis vuitton fabric to cover 54 tennis courts . " there are hundreds of millions of fake products out there , " said marc-antoine jamet , secretary-general of louis vuitton 's parent company , lvmh .
he said counterfeiting has become a colossal world industry representing more than five percent of all world trade . " look what companies spend fighting fakes : three million euros a year for lacoste , 15 million for vuitton , " he said .
" this is a problem on an industrial scale . " everyday people although organized crime plays a role in the matter , normally law-abiding people are also part of the problem .

" for me , there 's a bit of getting our own back on companies who , as soon as they get a brand that sells well , charge astronomical prices , " she said . but her purchasing patterns could be risky .
people who are discovered bringing in fake goods can get hefty fines .
generally if there are one or two fake goods , people are let off .
but with higher quantities , people can pay fines that are more than double what the goods are actually worth . the shame of it all for some , though , buying or wearing counterfeit goods is , well , simply l 'horreur . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fake chanel watch " i 'm used to seeing all these fake vuitton or prada bags in asia , " said marion dufour , a fashion editor at the women 's magazine group marie-claire international .

and i think i would really feel shame ! " but the big names of the luxury industry along paris ' avenue montaigne want counterfeiters to feel more than shame .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 21.03.2005 us-eu airbus row hits turbulence großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe toasted the new airbus but continued subsidies anger the us talks between brussels and washington to resolve a dispute over subsidies for aircraft makers airbus and boeing have descended into a row with both sides threatening a damaging legal clash at the wto . the two agreed in january to avoid a bruising battle at the world trade organization and negotiate by april 11 a phase out of subsidies to develop commercial aircraft .
but with three weeks left and little progress to date , mutual recriminations have begun . the dispute flared up again on friday when us negotiator robert zoellick decided to step up the pressure after meeting with his european counterpart , eu trade commissioner peter mandelson .
zoellick 's spokesman said " the europeans are clearly unwilling to eliminate the subsidies , " and said if necessary the united states was ready to return to litigation at the wto . this triggered a warning saturday from brussels that it would also make claims against washington .
" if the us decides to move to the wto approach , which we hope they will not , obviously we would launch our own counter-case , " said a european commission official who spoke to afp on condition of anonymity . complaints traded across the atlantic the united states lodged a complaint against eu subsidies to france-based airbus with the wto in october , which brought a counteraction from brussels against what it termed indirect us government aid for chicago-based boeing . but the agreement in january to try to resolve the dispute by renegotiating a 1992 bilateral accord that set the terms of assistance to aircraft makers effectively froze the wto procedure , which eu officials had said would have been a " disastrous " legal clash .
the two sides agreed to freeze subsidies while they negotiate the new agreement . washington tones down fighting talk washington on saturday dropped the saber rattling , and said it was ready to extend the deadline for reaching an agreement .
" we are very willing to continue talking , using the january 11 agreement as the basis - and we are willing to extend the terms of the january agreement , " us trade representative spokesman richard mills told afp . but " the problem is that over the last two months the eu has been focused more on maneuvering than on negotiating the core substance , " mills said by telephone from washington .

but with three weeks left and little progress to date , mutual recriminations have begun . the dispute flared up again on friday when us negotiator robert zoellick decided to step up the pressure after meeting with his european counterpart , eu trade commissioner peter mandelson .
zoellick 's spokesman said " the europeans are clearly unwilling to eliminate the subsidies , " and said if necessary the united states was ready to return to litigation at the wto . this triggered a warning saturday from brussels that it would also make claims against washington .
" if the us decides to move to the wto approach , which we hope they will not , obviously we would launch our own counter-case , " said a european commission official who spoke to afp on condition of anonymity . complaints traded across the atlantic the united states lodged a complaint against eu subsidies to france-based airbus with the wto in october , which brought a counteraction from brussels against what it termed indirect us government aid for chicago-based boeing . but the agreement in january to try to resolve the dispute by renegotiating a 1992 bilateral accord that set the terms of assistance to aircraft makers effectively froze the wto procedure , which eu officials had said would have been a " disastrous " legal clash .
the two sides agreed to freeze subsidies while they negotiate the new agreement . washington tones down fighting talk washington on saturday dropped the saber rattling , and said it was ready to extend the deadline for reaching an agreement .
" we are very willing to continue talking , using the january 11 agreement as the basis - and we are willing to extend the terms of the january agreement , " us trade representative spokesman richard mills told afp . but " the problem is that over the last two months the eu has been focused more on maneuvering than on negotiating the core substance , " mills said by telephone from washington .
" as far as we are concerned , we 're ready to continue the negotiations , " the eu official said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the boeing dreamliner .
however , should no agreement be reached , " nothing would prevent the eu governments to put up the launch aid for the a350 , " the eu official warned , referring to the long-haul jet which would rival boeing 's 787 " dreamliner " . europe wants " pertinent " questions answered part of the difficulties in the negotiations is that the europeans are trying to reach agreements on two issues that were not included as part of the january agreement : japanese aid for development of boeing 's 787 and the foreign sales corporations -lrb- fscs -rrb- that us companies use to lower their taxes .

the institute for public policy research -lrb- ippr -rrb- wants more water meters installed to avoid future shortages .
researchers looking at sustainable development said demand would grow with climate change and population growth .
last year , the south east county leaders group criticised government house-building plans saying it would leave millions facing water shortages .
the south east has some of the highest rates of household water use in the country louise every , ippr the ippr said southern water and mid kent water were not expected to achieve a 50 % metering rate until 2010 .
and sutton and east surrey water was forecast to achieve a metering rate of 44 % by 2030 .
louise every , researcher for the think tank , said : " the south east has some of the highest rates of household water use in the country .
" getting people to pay for the water they use through metering is a fairer way to pay and will encourage people to use water efficient appliances in their homes , " it said .
the ippr report called for buildings regulations to be revised so all new homes meet a 20 % reduction in water use , which it claimed could be achieved with water-saving household appliances .
' water-saving targets ' other options included grey water recycling - re-use of household water for low water-quality applications such as toilet flushing .
researchers also wanted water-saving targets for water companies .
this month , two water companies in the region warned of shortages after low winter rainfall , sutton and east surrey water and southern water .
eight million people live in the south-east , one of the uk 's driest regions .
and on friday , the environment agency published a report warning about climate change and said some of the greatest extremes of british weather had occurred in the last decade .

hope house in oswestry , which helps sick children from mid and north wales , wants to build an extension .
it also hopes to raise enough money to employ an extra staff member and buy new equipment and furniture .
hope house opened a branch in conwy - ty gobaith - in june , becoming the only hospice for children in north wales .
appeals director nuala o 'kane said : " hope house has seen so much wear and tear in the last 10 years that it is now in need of a makeover .
" we are asking for donations to help us bring the hospice bang up to date for the children and families who think of it as their second home . "
ty gobaith opened in conwy last june kath jones , director of care at the hospice , explained that having the right environment was crucial for the children they helped .
" if it does n't look homely then families wo n't feel comfortable , " she said .
her view is backed by sharon barrett , whose 15-year-old daughter stacie was one of the first children to stay at the centre in 1995 .
" we have relied on hope house so much in the last decade and still do .
" what makes it special is the love and support you get from the staff , but the surroundings are important too - i ca n't wait to see the end result , " she said .
ty gobaith in conwy was opened last year with the aim of cutting a long journey to oswestry for families who needed the support of a hostel .
the centre has a four-bed unit and has been dealing with around 40 families since it opened .
running both centres costs the organisation £ 3m , with 95 % of the money coming from fund-raising and donations .

bowel cancer : the facts each year , around 35,000 people are diagnosed with colorectal cancer - or bowel cancer as it 's more commonly known .
that makes it the second most common cancer in women - and the third most common in men .
because the symptoms involve embarrassing changes to bowel habits , many people do n't see the doctor until the cancer has already spread to other organs , such as the lung and liver .
this was what happened in dave 's case .
but , if the disease is caught early , the chances of being cured completely rise to 80 % .
risk factors the risk of colorectal cancer increases with age : the average age of diagnosis is 70 .
but there are other factors which can increase your chances of getting the disease : having a close relative with the same condition , or chronic inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis .
symptoms the symptoms of bowel cancer are very similar to other common complaints such as piles or irritable bowel syndrome .
you must see your gp if you notice : blood in your stools , particularly if it 's dark or plum-coloured .
a severe change in bowel habits , such as diarrhoea or constipation , which lasts for more than two weeks .
pain in the abdomen which lasts for more than two weeks unexplained weight loss .
how you can help yourself if you 're worried about the risks of colorectal cancer , you can help yourself by eating a healthy diet .

he could hardly believe it : he played football and golf - and five years earlier had run the new york marathon .
but , he felt he could help save others : getting people to talk openly about the condition and its symptoms would mean earlier diagnosis .
dave made a short film for us , in which he spoke eloquently about his life - and the shock of his diagnosis .
last week , dave died - and his family have agreed that we can show his film again , as a way of increasing awareness of the disease .
this morning , breakfast showed dave 's film again - and we talked to jola gore-booth of the charity colon cancer concern .
you can watch both those items , by clicking on the links on the top right hand side of this story -lrb- you will need real player software to make this work -rrb- .
bowel cancer : the facts each year , around 35,000 people are diagnosed with colorectal cancer - or bowel cancer as it 's more commonly known .
that makes it the second most common cancer in women - and the third most common in men .
because the symptoms involve embarrassing changes to bowel habits , many people do n't see the doctor until the cancer has already spread to other organs , such as the lung and liver .
this was what happened in dave 's case .
but , if the disease is caught early , the chances of being cured completely rise to 80 % .
risk factors the risk of colorectal cancer increases with age : the average age of diagnosis is 70 .
but there are other factors which can increase your chances of getting the disease : having a close relative with the same condition , or chronic inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis .
symptoms the symptoms of bowel cancer are very similar to other common complaints such as piles or irritable bowel syndrome .
you must see your gp if you notice : blood in your stools , particularly if it 's dark or plum-coloured .
a severe change in bowel habits , such as diarrhoea or constipation , which lasts for more than two weeks .
pain in the abdomen which lasts for more than two weeks unexplained weight loss .
how you can help yourself if you 're worried about the risks of colorectal cancer , you can help yourself by eating a healthy diet .
a high fibre , low fat diet with plenty of fruit , vegetables and carbohydrate is thought to decrease your risk of bowel cancer .
and taking a moderate amount of exercise may help , too .

jovana mitic gives a strong performance in a powerful drama a midwinter night 's dream is a dark piece by serb director goran paskaljevic which focuses on a man still haunted by his wartime memories .
when lazar -lrb- lazar ristovski -rrb- comes home to reclaim his mother 's house in a desolate town outside belgrade , he finds jasna -lrb- jasna zalica -rrb- and her 12-year-old autistic daughter , jovana -lrb- jovana mitic -rrb- , squatting there .
it emerges that he had deserted from the serbian army , sickened by the atrocities his unit was ordered to commit against civilians .
he turns to alcohol and accidentally kills his best friend in a drunken fight .
his return home is after a ten year jail sentence .
although his initial inclination is to throw jasna and jovana out of the house , a tentative friendship soon emerges .
paskaljevic says jovana 's autism is a sort of political metaphor for the behaviour of serbia during the conflict .
" i think my country somehow became autistic - people were forgetting everything and i had a feeling that we were living in a world that was completely closed , " he told the bbc news website .
authenticity essential he is adamant that he would not have achieved the same dramatic results had he not used a disabled actress .
he met mitic at an institution for people with learning difficulties .
he spent six months gaining her trust before he shot a single frame .
" you ca n't control her at all , she is like she is , " he said .
" you shoot lots of footage and hope you get what you want - that 's why i used a digital camera . "
he said it was essential that jovana 's autism was genuine in order to convey the truth .
as the film progresses , lazar and jovana become very close - he even tells his family that she is his daughter .
lazar and jovana form a close bond as the film progresses but he has difficulty accepting that her condition is permanent and even tries to " exorcise her demons " with the aid of a priest .
jasna is horrified when she finds out about lazar 's efforts to " cure " her daughter .
" this is her !
this is her life , " she yells .
after a tragic turn of events lazar finds himself trapped by images of war , atrocities and the senseless crime that led to the death of his best friend .
" i think towards the end of the film lazar himself becomes autistic , " said paskaljevic .
audience outrage when a midwinter night 's dream was released in serbia audiences were shocked at the film 's candour about serbian complicity in war crimes .
one cinema phoned to say that people were coming out shouting " traitor ! " .
i think this film has hopefully made people less awkward about disability goran paskaljevic , director " they asked me , if they stopped showing the film , whether i would be angry , " he said .
" unfortunately in serbia we 're still not mature enough to accept this kind of truth - the film 's a little bit ahead of its time . "
mitic is still a regular visitor at the paskaljevic household - he felt it would be too great a shock to end contact abruptly when the shoot was finished .
but he did worry that her new-found fame would bring unwelcome attention .
her real mother told him not to worry , that it would help to educate the public about conditions like autism .
" i think this film has hopefully made people less awkward about disability , " said paskaljevic .
a midwinter night 's dream will be shown at the ritzy cinema in london on tuesday .

when lazar -lrb- lazar ristovski -rrb- comes home to reclaim his mother 's house in a desolate town outside belgrade , he finds jasna -lrb- jasna zalica -rrb- and her 12-year-old autistic daughter , jovana -lrb- jovana mitic -rrb- , squatting there .
it emerges that he had deserted from the serbian army , sickened by the atrocities his unit was ordered to commit against civilians .
he turns to alcohol and accidentally kills his best friend in a drunken fight .
his return home is after a ten year jail sentence .
although his initial inclination is to throw jasna and jovana out of the house , a tentative friendship soon emerges .
paskaljevic says jovana 's autism is a sort of political metaphor for the behaviour of serbia during the conflict .
" i think my country somehow became autistic - people were forgetting everything and i had a feeling that we were living in a world that was completely closed , " he told the bbc news website .
authenticity essential he is adamant that he would not have achieved the same dramatic results had he not used a disabled actress .
he met mitic at an institution for people with learning difficulties .
he spent six months gaining her trust before he shot a single frame .
" you ca n't control her at all , she is like she is , " he said .
" you shoot lots of footage and hope you get what you want - that 's why i used a digital camera . "
he said it was essential that jovana 's autism was genuine in order to convey the truth .
as the film progresses , lazar and jovana become very close - he even tells his family that she is his daughter .
lazar and jovana form a close bond as the film progresses but he has difficulty accepting that her condition is permanent and even tries to " exorcise her demons " with the aid of a priest .
jasna is horrified when she finds out about lazar 's efforts to " cure " her daughter .
" this is her !
this is her life , " she yells .
after a tragic turn of events lazar finds himself trapped by images of war , atrocities and the senseless crime that led to the death of his best friend .
" i think towards the end of the film lazar himself becomes autistic , " said paskaljevic .
audience outrage when a midwinter night 's dream was released in serbia audiences were shocked at the film 's candour about serbian complicity in war crimes .
one cinema phoned to say that people were coming out shouting " traitor ! " .
i think this film has hopefully made people less awkward about disability goran paskaljevic , director " they asked me , if they stopped showing the film , whether i would be angry , " he said .
" unfortunately in serbia we 're still not mature enough to accept this kind of truth - the film 's a little bit ahead of its time . "
mitic is still a regular visitor at the paskaljevic household - he felt it would be too great a shock to end contact abruptly when the shoot was finished .
but he did worry that her new-found fame would bring unwelcome attention .
her real mother told him not to worry , that it would help to educate the public about conditions like autism .
" i think this film has hopefully made people less awkward about disability , " said paskaljevic .
a midwinter night 's dream will be shown at the ritzy cinema in london on tuesday .

the offshore workers want to secure four weeks leave a year which they say they are currently being denied .
the offshore industry liaison committee -lrb- oilc -rrb- union said its members will press ahead despite government calls for them to abandon their plans .
so far , 236 workers have filed cases in aberdeen under the european union working time directive .
however , about 5,000 contractors have received rejections following requests for time off and as many as 20,000 workers represented by five unions are looking to have the situation resolved . "
we need some kind of ruling in legal statute so offshore workers can be given the same rights as onshore workers " jake molloy oilc oil rig workers were supposed to have been covered by the regulations from 1 august , 2003 , but the government and unions disagreed over a key measure of the directive - an entitlement to four weeks holiday .
the workers typically work 26 weeks offshore and then have 26 weeks onshore , as compensatory rest which for many oil workers is unpaid .
the government wants two weeks of the new holiday entitlement to be discounted from the 26 weeks compensatory rest period but the workers believe nothing should be taken under the working time provisions .
westminster 's employment relations minister gerry sutcliffe attempted to quell the dispute on monday , asking contractors to drop their cases and begin negotiations to find a compromise instead .
however , the oilc has refused to talk and said the tribunals would go ahead unless mr sutcliffe climbed down .
conflict resolution mr sutcliffe said : " the working time regulations , as amended in 2003 , apply to offshore workers in territorial waters and on the uk continental shelf , including an entitlement to paid annual leave .
" i regret that even with the involvement of acas , the industry and trades unions have not been able to reach a consensus on the issue of paid leave .
" however , i strongly believe that the solution lies in constructive dialogue . "
jake molloy , of the oilc , believes the minister is heading up a blind alley and said : " if he thinks he is going to be able to negotiate some kind of settlement then he will be disappointed because these tribunals will go ahead .
" on the other hand , if he wants to admit that there has been some mistake , and we secure four weeks for the offshore workers , then the tribunal cases will fall .
" we need some kind of ruling in legal statute so offshore workers can be given the same rights as onshore workers . "
