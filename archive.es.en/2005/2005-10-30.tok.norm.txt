program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.10.2005 german parties set to clash over nuclear power großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just hot air or will nuclear energy split the partners ?
the future of nuclear energy is set to be a key battlefield in talks between germany 's potential coalition partners with both bracing for a showdown over the emotive issue . one of the most crucial pieces of legislation passed by outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , in the eyes of many , was a planned phase-out of germany 's atomic energy plants by 2020 . the idea , largely pressed by the environmentally-friendly greens , was to focus on renewable energy and away from a crippling dependence on oil .
it also found support at a time when safety concerns over nuclear power reactors were highlighted with accidents like the one in chernobyl in 1986 . but that law now faces an uncertain future with germany 's new government set to comprise the conservatives and the social democrats in a power-sharing alliance by the end of november . economic arguments the conservatives led by chancellor-designate angela merkel have made no secret of the fact that they intend to put the brakes on the nuclear-phase out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel fears germany may lose out if it halts nuclear-power production earlier this year , merkel argued in a speech that if germany is no longer active in nuclear power it would have no influence on the international market when it comes to exporting nuclear technology . " in my view , an ideologically motivated nuclear phase-out does not reflect economic demands , " merkel said , citing the fact that countries such as india and china are expanding their nuclear energy capacities . " for me , the question is , how can germany with its technical know-how profit from this export potential .
as a patriot , i would like to see my country profit from our expertise , not watch others take the profits . " merkel 's rhetoric could have been put down to mere election-speak at the time .
but now with a federal election forcing the two largest parties into a grand coalition and the hard negotiating over policies gathering momentum , the issue of nuclear energy is proving to be a key test for the future partners . spd , conservatives dig in their heels signs over the weekend were n't encouraging with both sides sticking to their positions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a nuclear reactor in biblis , germany " the lifetime of nuclear power stations can not be extended , " spd chairman franz müntefering told bild am sonntag newspaper , adding that a so-called nuclear compromise hammered out between schröder 's government and energy companies in 2000 and which became law in 2002 , must be upheld .
the law foresees phasing out the last of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants by 2020 . however , the conservatives are keen to provide germany , a large importer of oil and gas , with greater energy security and allow the energy industry to earn more by extending the life of their plants . in a guest commentary in bild am sonntag , conservative premier of baden-württemberg , günther oettinger urged the future government not to switch off any nuclear power plants in the next four years and to generally extend their lives . " we need time and money to further develop stable renewable energy sources , " oettinger wrote .
" the extension of the lifetimes of nuclear stations with maximum security standards can give us both . " but , michael müller , vice-chairman of the spd parliamentary group demanded that the conservatives finally recognize that they " have no chance " to chip away at nuclear phase-out with the spd . müller argued that if the nuclear plants were indeed allowed to run longer , they would have to undergo updated security modifications - something that would cost money , he said . nuclear energy makes comeback the two future coalition partners have thus far made steady progress on a host of issues , from budgetary policy to renewable energy .
but it seems unlikely that the same will be seen on nuclear energy , which is set to dominate talks next week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the loviisa southern finnish nuclear power station one thing that 's bolstered the conservatives ' case is the fact that nuclear energy has been gradually making a comeback in europe with the first new nuclear plant on the continent in years being built in finland . its supporters also point out that nuclear reactors emit virtually no greenhouse gases . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de renewable sector wary of cdu promises should the conservatives win september 's election , the renewable energy sector , which boomed under the green party 's influence , will be hit by changes .
opinions are clashing over what 's best for germany 's economy .
-lrb- aug .
10 , 2005 -rrb- energy oil and gas are scarce resources .
politicians from germany 's main parties have vastly different ideas when it comes to meeting growing energy demand .
a rebirth for german nuclear energy ?
the prospect of victory by germany 's conservative opposition in an early general election has shaken up the country 's energy sector .
the nuclear power industry is hoping to slow the planned phase out atomic energy .

the future of nuclear energy is set to be a key battlefield in talks between germany 's potential coalition partners with both bracing for a showdown over the emotive issue . one of the most crucial pieces of legislation passed by outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , in the eyes of many , was a planned phase-out of germany 's atomic energy plants by 2020 . the idea , largely pressed by the environmentally-friendly greens , was to focus on renewable energy and away from a crippling dependence on oil .
it also found support at a time when safety concerns over nuclear power reactors were highlighted with accidents like the one in chernobyl in 1986 . but that law now faces an uncertain future with germany 's new government set to comprise the conservatives and the social democrats in a power-sharing alliance by the end of november . economic arguments the conservatives led by chancellor-designate angela merkel have made no secret of the fact that they intend to put the brakes on the nuclear-phase out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel fears germany may lose out if it halts nuclear-power production earlier this year , merkel argued in a speech that if germany is no longer active in nuclear power it would have no influence on the international market when it comes to exporting nuclear technology . " in my view , an ideologically motivated nuclear phase-out does not reflect economic demands , " merkel said , citing the fact that countries such as india and china are expanding their nuclear energy capacities . " for me , the question is , how can germany with its technical know-how profit from this export potential .
as a patriot , i would like to see my country profit from our expertise , not watch others take the profits . " merkel 's rhetoric could have been put down to mere election-speak at the time .
but now with a federal election forcing the two largest parties into a grand coalition and the hard negotiating over policies gathering momentum , the issue of nuclear energy is proving to be a key test for the future partners . spd , conservatives dig in their heels signs over the weekend were n't encouraging with both sides sticking to their positions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a nuclear reactor in biblis , germany " the lifetime of nuclear power stations can not be extended , " spd chairman franz müntefering told bild am sonntag newspaper , adding that a so-called nuclear compromise hammered out between schröder 's government and energy companies in 2000 and which became law in 2002 , must be upheld .
the law foresees phasing out the last of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants by 2020 . however , the conservatives are keen to provide germany , a large importer of oil and gas , with greater energy security and allow the energy industry to earn more by extending the life of their plants . in a guest commentary in bild am sonntag , conservative premier of baden-württemberg , günther oettinger urged the future government not to switch off any nuclear power plants in the next four years and to generally extend their lives . " we need time and money to further develop stable renewable energy sources , " oettinger wrote .
" the extension of the lifetimes of nuclear stations with maximum security standards can give us both . " but , michael müller , vice-chairman of the spd parliamentary group demanded that the conservatives finally recognize that they " have no chance " to chip away at nuclear phase-out with the spd . müller argued that if the nuclear plants were indeed allowed to run longer , they would have to undergo updated security modifications - something that would cost money , he said . nuclear energy makes comeback the two future coalition partners have thus far made steady progress on a host of issues , from budgetary policy to renewable energy .
but it seems unlikely that the same will be seen on nuclear energy , which is set to dominate talks next week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the loviisa southern finnish nuclear power station one thing that 's bolstered the conservatives ' case is the fact that nuclear energy has been gradually making a comeback in europe with the first new nuclear plant on the continent in years being built in finland . its supporters also point out that nuclear reactors emit virtually no greenhouse gases . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de renewable sector wary of cdu promises should the conservatives win september 's election , the renewable energy sector , which boomed under the green party 's influence , will be hit by changes .

the future of nuclear energy is set to be a key battlefield in talks between germany 's potential coalition partners with both bracing for a showdown over the emotive issue . one of the most crucial pieces of legislation passed by outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , in the eyes of many , was a planned phase-out of germany 's atomic energy plants by 2020 . the idea , largely pressed by the environmentally-friendly greens , was to focus on renewable energy and away from a crippling dependence on oil .
it also found support at a time when safety concerns over nuclear power reactors were highlighted with accidents like the one in chernobyl in 1986 . but that law now faces an uncertain future with germany 's new government set to comprise the conservatives and the social democrats in a power-sharing alliance by the end of november . economic arguments the conservatives led by chancellor-designate angela merkel have made no secret of the fact that they intend to put the brakes on the nuclear-phase out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel fears germany may lose out if it halts nuclear-power production earlier this year , merkel argued in a speech that if germany is no longer active in nuclear power it would have no influence on the international market when it comes to exporting nuclear technology . " in my view , an ideologically motivated nuclear phase-out does not reflect economic demands , " merkel said , citing the fact that countries such as india and china are expanding their nuclear energy capacities . " for me , the question is , how can germany with its technical know-how profit from this export potential .
as a patriot , i would like to see my country profit from our expertise , not watch others take the profits . " merkel 's rhetoric could have been put down to mere election-speak at the time .
but now with a federal election forcing the two largest parties into a grand coalition and the hard negotiating over policies gathering momentum , the issue of nuclear energy is proving to be a key test for the future partners . spd , conservatives dig in their heels signs over the weekend were n't encouraging with both sides sticking to their positions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a nuclear reactor in biblis , germany " the lifetime of nuclear power stations can not be extended , " spd chairman franz müntefering told bild am sonntag newspaper , adding that a so-called nuclear compromise hammered out between schröder 's government and energy companies in 2000 and which became law in 2002 , must be upheld .

someone innocuously uses the internet to make a purchase .
later , money begins disappearing from the customer 's bank account unbeknownst to them .
thousands of such cases land on desks of prosecutors everywhere .

club president franz beckenbauer said however , if he were ballack , then he would go to spanish team real madrid . tactics to keep his best player ?
or just plain old-fashioned advice from one star to another ?
bayern munich president franz beckenbauer has advised german international captain michael ballack to join spanish giants real madrid should he decide to leave bayern . beckenbauer and bayern are trying to persuade ballack , whose contract expires at the end of the season , to extend his stay with the german champions , but admit the lure of nine-time european champions real madrid is enticing for any top player . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack 's future is uncertain " i 'd probably say yes to real madrid , " beckenbauer told magazine sport-bild .
" they stand above all others in terms of legend .
they 're the ambition of every player and it was the same when i was playing . " ballack turned down real madrid in the summer of 2002 to join bayern in a 12.9 million euro -lrb- $ 15.5 million -rrb- deal .
at that time , ballack wanted to make his mark on german soccer - and stay in the country until after the 2006 world cup . the list of top clubs is long madrid are n't alone on the list of potential buyers .
italian titans inter milan are also monitoring ballack and can point to a history of signing german players with west germany 's 1990 world cup winners jürgen klinsmann , lothar matthäus and andreas brehme all having spent spells at the club . " i do not know if michael would have fun in the italian league , " declared beckenbauer .
" they often have crowds as low as 7,8 or 9,000 .
that 's equivalent to the regional league attendances in germany .
in the bundesliga we have average crowds of 40,000 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch striker ruud van nistelrooy could also be a ballack teammate english premiership side manchester united have emerged as favorites in the media but munich chairman karl-heinz rummenigge dismissed talk that the move would be a step up from bayern . " i can not imagine that he -lrb- ballack -rrb- would go to manchester united , " rummenigge told television channel premiere .
" what do manchester united have that bayern munich do n't ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 30.10.2005 internet fraud costs europe millions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beware of internet pirates when shopping online although internet fraud is costing consumer millions in europe , europeans still remain less guarded and informed about online theft than people elsewhere . everyone has read the horror stories .
someone innocuously uses the internet to make a purchase .
later , money begins disappearing from the customer 's bank account unbeknownst to them .
thousands of such cases land on desks of prosecutors everywhere .
but according to a recent survey , europeans , from whom millions are stolen annually via the form of internet theft known as phishing , still remain ignorant about online security , especially in comparison to american consumers .
" the cases we have seen in our office are just the tip of the iceberg , " andreas kingbeil , who works with police to combat computer fraud in berlin , told focus newsmagazine .
shopping away according to a survey by us-based momentum research group , online shopping is influenced by fears of internet theft more often in the us than in europe , particularly in germany and france . about 16 percent of the us customers surveyed said they had started spending less online because they feared theft .
but only 6 percent of german and 9 percent of french consumers said they had changed their habits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hijacked web sites threaten consumers meanwhile , 90 percent of americans surveyed understood what internet theft is , while only a third in france and germany did .
a majority of respondents did not understand internet fraud methods such as phishing .
still , the survey showed , consumers are spending more online today than ever before at the same time as some are cutting back .
more education needed internet security experts say phishing is one of the most common methods of internet fraud .
in phishing , customers are lured away from a company 's official web site to a fake web site which closely replicates the original .
usually , the fake site is missing specific elements of the original or the name is slightly different .
sometimes customers will indeed enter the official web site , but then be redirected to a fake site .
only by taking the time to explore the entire site can customers figure out whether it 's a fraud .
but most do n't take the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : let the buyer beware online charities , lotteries and auctions are often other sources of fraud .
consumers click on links to donate money or claim prizes , and by doing so , give their credit card and other important information to thieves .
pharming is an even more serious problem for internet consumers .
in this method , web pirates hijack a site and use sensitive data entered there for their own purposes .
security experts say it 's very difficult to detect when a web site has been taken over by thieves .
millions lost in the us , experts say that phishing and other internet fraud costs customers 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- annually .
in germany , officials estimate that phishing has cost consumers more than 4.5 million euros - and that is just cases that police have investigated .
in some cases , retailers and banks compensate customers and investigate themselves .
most respondents to the momentum research survey said they believe that should be the case and knowing so would make them feel more secure about online shopping .
" for consumers , the key to online confidence lies at the door of the business community - meaning that it is imperative for online vendors to be seen taking appropriate measures to protect their customers ' interests , " said art coviello , president and ceo of rsa security which commissioned the study , in a prepared statement .
" the survey clearly demonstrates that , once their trust is earned , users will return - and spend - again and again .
but that trust is a fragile commodity . " dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hackers go phishing for online bankers that e-mail from your bank may be more than a friendly enquiry .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.10.2005 german parties set to clash over nuclear power großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just hot air or will nuclear energy split the partners ?
the future of nuclear energy is set to be a key battlefield in talks between germany 's potential coalition partners with both bracing for a showdown over the emotive issue . one of the most crucial pieces of legislation passed by outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , in the eyes of many , was a planned phase-out of germany 's atomic energy plants by 2020 . the idea , largely pressed by the environmentally-friendly greens , was to focus on renewable energy and away from a crippling dependence on oil .
it also found support at a time when safety concerns over nuclear power reactors were highlighted with accidents like the one in chernobyl in 1986 . but that law now faces an uncertain future with germany 's new government set to comprise the conservatives and the social democrats in a power-sharing alliance by the end of november . economic arguments the conservatives led by chancellor-designate angela merkel have made no secret of the fact that they intend to put the brakes on the nuclear-phase out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel fears germany may lose out if it halts nuclear-power production earlier this year , merkel argued in a speech that if germany is no longer active in nuclear power it would have no influence on the international market when it comes to exporting nuclear technology . " in my view , an ideologically motivated nuclear phase-out does not reflect economic demands , " merkel said , citing the fact that countries such as india and china are expanding their nuclear energy capacities . " for me , the question is , how can germany with its technical know-how profit from this export potential .
as a patriot , i would like to see my country profit from our expertise , not watch others take the profits . " merkel 's rhetoric could have been put down to mere election-speak at the time .
but now with a federal election forcing the two largest parties into a grand coalition and the hard negotiating over policies gathering momentum , the issue of nuclear energy is proving to be a key test for the future partners . spd , conservatives dig in their heels signs over the weekend were n't encouraging with both sides sticking to their positions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a nuclear reactor in biblis , germany " the lifetime of nuclear power stations can not be extended , " spd chairman franz müntefering told bild am sonntag newspaper , adding that a so-called nuclear compromise hammered out between schröder 's government and energy companies in 2000 and which became law in 2002 , must be upheld .
the law foresees phasing out the last of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants by 2020 . however , the conservatives are keen to provide germany , a large importer of oil and gas , with greater energy security and allow the energy industry to earn more by extending the life of their plants . in a guest commentary in bild am sonntag , conservative premier of baden-württemberg , günther oettinger urged the future government not to switch off any nuclear power plants in the next four years and to generally extend their lives . " we need time and money to further develop stable renewable energy sources , " oettinger wrote .
" the extension of the lifetimes of nuclear stations with maximum security standards can give us both . " but , michael müller , vice-chairman of the spd parliamentary group demanded that the conservatives finally recognize that they " have no chance " to chip away at nuclear phase-out with the spd . müller argued that if the nuclear plants were indeed allowed to run longer , they would have to undergo updated security modifications - something that would cost money , he said . nuclear energy makes comeback the two future coalition partners have thus far made steady progress on a host of issues , from budgetary policy to renewable energy .
but it seems unlikely that the same will be seen on nuclear energy , which is set to dominate talks next week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the loviisa southern finnish nuclear power station one thing that 's bolstered the conservatives ' case is the fact that nuclear energy has been gradually making a comeback in europe with the first new nuclear plant on the continent in years being built in finland . its supporters also point out that nuclear reactors emit virtually no greenhouse gases . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de renewable sector wary of cdu promises should the conservatives win september 's election , the renewable energy sector , which boomed under the green party 's influence , will be hit by changes .
opinions are clashing over what 's best for germany 's economy .
-lrb- aug .
10 , 2005 -rrb- energy oil and gas are scarce resources .
politicians from germany 's main parties have vastly different ideas when it comes to meeting growing energy demand .
a rebirth for german nuclear energy ?
the prospect of victory by germany 's conservative opposition in an early general election has shaken up the country 's energy sector .
the nuclear power industry is hoping to slow the planned phase out atomic energy .

someone innocuously uses the internet to make a purchase .
later , money begins disappearing from the customer 's bank account unbeknownst to them .
thousands of such cases land on desks of prosecutors everywhere .
but according to a recent survey , europeans , from whom millions are stolen annually via the form of internet theft known as phishing , still remain ignorant about online security , especially in comparison to american consumers .
" the cases we have seen in our office are just the tip of the iceberg , " andreas kingbeil , who works with police to combat computer fraud in berlin , told focus newsmagazine .
shopping away according to a survey by us-based momentum research group , online shopping is influenced by fears of internet theft more often in the us than in europe , particularly in germany and france . about 16 percent of the us customers surveyed said they had started spending less online because they feared theft .
but only 6 percent of german and 9 percent of french consumers said they had changed their habits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hijacked web sites threaten consumers meanwhile , 90 percent of americans surveyed understood what internet theft is , while only a third in france and germany did .
a majority of respondents did not understand internet fraud methods such as phishing .
still , the survey showed , consumers are spending more online today than ever before at the same time as some are cutting back .
more education needed internet security experts say phishing is one of the most common methods of internet fraud .
in phishing , customers are lured away from a company 's official web site to a fake web site which closely replicates the original .
usually , the fake site is missing specific elements of the original or the name is slightly different .
sometimes customers will indeed enter the official web site , but then be redirected to a fake site .
only by taking the time to explore the entire site can customers figure out whether it 's a fraud .
but most do n't take the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : let the buyer beware online charities , lotteries and auctions are often other sources of fraud .
consumers click on links to donate money or claim prizes , and by doing so , give their credit card and other important information to thieves .
pharming is an even more serious problem for internet consumers .
in this method , web pirates hijack a site and use sensitive data entered there for their own purposes .
security experts say it 's very difficult to detect when a web site has been taken over by thieves .
millions lost in the us , experts say that phishing and other internet fraud costs customers 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- annually .
in germany , officials estimate that phishing has cost consumers more than 4.5 million euros - and that is just cases that police have investigated .
in some cases , retailers and banks compensate customers and investigate themselves .
most respondents to the momentum research survey said they believe that should be the case and knowing so would make them feel more secure about online shopping .
" for consumers , the key to online confidence lies at the door of the business community - meaning that it is imperative for online vendors to be seen taking appropriate measures to protect their customers ' interests , " said art coviello , president and ceo of rsa security which commissioned the study , in a prepared statement .
" the survey clearly demonstrates that , once their trust is earned , users will return - and spend - again and again .

" the biggest obstacle to returning the cathedral to the -lrb- normal -rrb- world heritage list has been removed , " said dieter offenhäusser , spokesman for the german commission of the united nations educational , scientific and cultural organization . property developers had submitted plans for three office blocks that would have radically altered the skyline of the western city , which is currently dominated by the twin spires of the gothic cathedral .
the city 's planning authorities look set to scrap plans for two of the towers but say one could still be built , but only if a tenant can be found .
lufthansa pulls out german airline lufthansa had expressed an interest in renting the first tower , but has now pulled out . " it was planned that lufthansa would move into the building but this has not been followed through , " a spokesman for the cologne city authorities told afp . cologne cathedral was built over six centuries from 1248 to 1880 and survived bombing of the city during world war ii . unesco describes the world heritage sites as " places on earth that are of outstanding universal value to humanity .

the future of nuclear energy is set to be a key battlefield in talks between germany 's potential coalition partners with both bracing for a showdown over the emotive issue . one of the most crucial pieces of legislation passed by outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , in the eyes of many , was a planned phase-out of germany 's atomic energy plants by 2020 . the idea , largely pressed by the environmentally-friendly greens , was to focus on renewable energy and away from a crippling dependence on oil .
it also found support at a time when safety concerns over nuclear power reactors were highlighted with accidents like the one in chernobyl in 1986 . but that law now faces an uncertain future with germany 's new government set to comprise the conservatives and the social democrats in a power-sharing alliance by the end of november . economic arguments the conservatives led by chancellor-designate angela merkel have made no secret of the fact that they intend to put the brakes on the nuclear-phase out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel fears germany may lose out if it halts nuclear-power production earlier this year , merkel argued in a speech that if germany is no longer active in nuclear power it would have no influence on the international market when it comes to exporting nuclear technology . " in my view , an ideologically motivated nuclear phase-out does not reflect economic demands , " merkel said , citing the fact that countries such as india and china are expanding their nuclear energy capacities . " for me , the question is , how can germany with its technical know-how profit from this export potential .
as a patriot , i would like to see my country profit from our expertise , not watch others take the profits . " merkel 's rhetoric could have been put down to mere election-speak at the time .
but now with a federal election forcing the two largest parties into a grand coalition and the hard negotiating over policies gathering momentum , the issue of nuclear energy is proving to be a key test for the future partners . spd , conservatives dig in their heels signs over the weekend were n't encouraging with both sides sticking to their positions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a nuclear reactor in biblis , germany " the lifetime of nuclear power stations can not be extended , " spd chairman franz müntefering told bild am sonntag newspaper , adding that a so-called nuclear compromise hammered out between schröder 's government and energy companies in 2000 and which became law in 2002 , must be upheld .
the law foresees phasing out the last of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants by 2020 . however , the conservatives are keen to provide germany , a large importer of oil and gas , with greater energy security and allow the energy industry to earn more by extending the life of their plants . in a guest commentary in bild am sonntag , conservative premier of baden-württemberg , günther oettinger urged the future government not to switch off any nuclear power plants in the next four years and to generally extend their lives . " we need time and money to further develop stable renewable energy sources , " oettinger wrote .
" the extension of the lifetimes of nuclear stations with maximum security standards can give us both . " but , michael müller , vice-chairman of the spd parliamentary group demanded that the conservatives finally recognize that they " have no chance " to chip away at nuclear phase-out with the spd . müller argued that if the nuclear plants were indeed allowed to run longer , they would have to undergo updated security modifications - something that would cost money , he said . nuclear energy makes comeback the two future coalition partners have thus far made steady progress on a host of issues , from budgetary policy to renewable energy .
but it seems unlikely that the same will be seen on nuclear energy , which is set to dominate talks next week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the loviisa southern finnish nuclear power station one thing that 's bolstered the conservatives ' case is the fact that nuclear energy has been gradually making a comeback in europe with the first new nuclear plant on the continent in years being built in finland . its supporters also point out that nuclear reactors emit virtually no greenhouse gases . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de renewable sector wary of cdu promises should the conservatives win september 's election , the renewable energy sector , which boomed under the green party 's influence , will be hit by changes .

the future of nuclear energy is set to be a key battlefield in talks between germany 's potential coalition partners with both bracing for a showdown over the emotive issue . one of the most crucial pieces of legislation passed by outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , in the eyes of many , was a planned phase-out of germany 's atomic energy plants by 2020 . the idea , largely pressed by the environmentally-friendly greens , was to focus on renewable energy and away from a crippling dependence on oil .
it also found support at a time when safety concerns over nuclear power reactors were highlighted with accidents like the one in chernobyl in 1986 . but that law now faces an uncertain future with germany 's new government set to comprise the conservatives and the social democrats in a power-sharing alliance by the end of november . economic arguments the conservatives led by chancellor-designate angela merkel have made no secret of the fact that they intend to put the brakes on the nuclear-phase out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel fears germany may lose out if it halts nuclear-power production earlier this year , merkel argued in a speech that if germany is no longer active in nuclear power it would have no influence on the international market when it comes to exporting nuclear technology . " in my view , an ideologically motivated nuclear phase-out does not reflect economic demands , " merkel said , citing the fact that countries such as india and china are expanding their nuclear energy capacities . " for me , the question is , how can germany with its technical know-how profit from this export potential .
as a patriot , i would like to see my country profit from our expertise , not watch others take the profits . " merkel 's rhetoric could have been put down to mere election-speak at the time .
but now with a federal election forcing the two largest parties into a grand coalition and the hard negotiating over policies gathering momentum , the issue of nuclear energy is proving to be a key test for the future partners . spd , conservatives dig in their heels signs over the weekend were n't encouraging with both sides sticking to their positions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a nuclear reactor in biblis , germany " the lifetime of nuclear power stations can not be extended , " spd chairman franz müntefering told bild am sonntag newspaper , adding that a so-called nuclear compromise hammered out between schröder 's government and energy companies in 2000 and which became law in 2002 , must be upheld .
the law foresees phasing out the last of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants by 2020 . however , the conservatives are keen to provide germany , a large importer of oil and gas , with greater energy security and allow the energy industry to earn more by extending the life of their plants . in a guest commentary in bild am sonntag , conservative premier of baden-württemberg , günther oettinger urged the future government not to switch off any nuclear power plants in the next four years and to generally extend their lives . " we need time and money to further develop stable renewable energy sources , " oettinger wrote .
" the extension of the lifetimes of nuclear stations with maximum security standards can give us both . " but , michael müller , vice-chairman of the spd parliamentary group demanded that the conservatives finally recognize that they " have no chance " to chip away at nuclear phase-out with the spd . müller argued that if the nuclear plants were indeed allowed to run longer , they would have to undergo updated security modifications - something that would cost money , he said . nuclear energy makes comeback the two future coalition partners have thus far made steady progress on a host of issues , from budgetary policy to renewable energy .

club president franz beckenbauer said however , if he were ballack , then he would go to spanish team real madrid . tactics to keep his best player ?
or just plain old-fashioned advice from one star to another ?
bayern munich president franz beckenbauer has advised german international captain michael ballack to join spanish giants real madrid should he decide to leave bayern . beckenbauer and bayern are trying to persuade ballack , whose contract expires at the end of the season , to extend his stay with the german champions , but admit the lure of nine-time european champions real madrid is enticing for any top player . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack 's future is uncertain " i 'd probably say yes to real madrid , " beckenbauer told magazine sport-bild .
" they stand above all others in terms of legend .
they 're the ambition of every player and it was the same when i was playing . " ballack turned down real madrid in the summer of 2002 to join bayern in a 12.9 million euro -lrb- $ 15.5 million -rrb- deal .
at that time , ballack wanted to make his mark on german soccer - and stay in the country until after the 2006 world cup . the list of top clubs is long madrid are n't alone on the list of potential buyers .
italian titans inter milan are also monitoring ballack and can point to a history of signing german players with west germany 's 1990 world cup winners jürgen klinsmann , lothar matthäus and andreas brehme all having spent spells at the club . " i do not know if michael would have fun in the italian league , " declared beckenbauer .
" they often have crowds as low as 7,8 or 9,000 .
that 's equivalent to the regional league attendances in germany .
in the bundesliga we have average crowds of 40,000 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch striker ruud van nistelrooy could also be a ballack teammate english premiership side manchester united have emerged as favorites in the media but munich chairman karl-heinz rummenigge dismissed talk that the move would be a step up from bayern . " i can not imagine that he -lrb- ballack -rrb- would go to manchester united , " rummenigge told television channel premiere .
" what do manchester united have that bayern munich do n't ?
if you take a quick look at the english table then it seems it is nothing .
if i was a player i would not go to manchester united under any circumstances . " ballack has postponed making any decision until the end of november when he is expected to inform bayern whether he will sign on the dotted line or leave on a free transfer in june 2006 . for the time being , nobody , probably not even ballack 's agent michael becker , knows which club will get the lucky phone call that is something akin to the jackpot in the lottery . dw staff / afp -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern and ballack in contract crunch time it was a marriage made in heaven : germany 's one true superstar and the bundesliga 's only real superpower .

the future of nuclear energy is set to be a key battlefield in talks between germany 's potential coalition partners with both bracing for a showdown over the emotive issue . one of the most crucial pieces of legislation passed by outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , in the eyes of many , was a planned phase-out of germany 's atomic energy plants by 2020 . the idea , largely pressed by the environmentally-friendly greens , was to focus on renewable energy and away from a crippling dependence on oil .
it also found support at a time when safety concerns over nuclear power reactors were highlighted with accidents like the one in chernobyl in 1986 . but that law now faces an uncertain future with germany 's new government set to comprise the conservatives and the social democrats in a power-sharing alliance by the end of november . economic arguments the conservatives led by chancellor-designate angela merkel have made no secret of the fact that they intend to put the brakes on the nuclear-phase out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel fears germany may lose out if it halts nuclear-power production earlier this year , merkel argued in a speech that if germany is no longer active in nuclear power it would have no influence on the international market when it comes to exporting nuclear technology . " in my view , an ideologically motivated nuclear phase-out does not reflect economic demands , " merkel said , citing the fact that countries such as india and china are expanding their nuclear energy capacities . " for me , the question is , how can germany with its technical know-how profit from this export potential .
as a patriot , i would like to see my country profit from our expertise , not watch others take the profits . " merkel 's rhetoric could have been put down to mere election-speak at the time .
but now with a federal election forcing the two largest parties into a grand coalition and the hard negotiating over policies gathering momentum , the issue of nuclear energy is proving to be a key test for the future partners . spd , conservatives dig in their heels signs over the weekend were n't encouraging with both sides sticking to their positions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a nuclear reactor in biblis , germany " the lifetime of nuclear power stations can not be extended , " spd chairman franz müntefering told bild am sonntag newspaper , adding that a so-called nuclear compromise hammered out between schröder 's government and energy companies in 2000 and which became law in 2002 , must be upheld .
the law foresees phasing out the last of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants by 2020 . however , the conservatives are keen to provide germany , a large importer of oil and gas , with greater energy security and allow the energy industry to earn more by extending the life of their plants . in a guest commentary in bild am sonntag , conservative premier of baden-württemberg , günther oettinger urged the future government not to switch off any nuclear power plants in the next four years and to generally extend their lives . " we need time and money to further develop stable renewable energy sources , " oettinger wrote .
" the extension of the lifetimes of nuclear stations with maximum security standards can give us both . " but , michael müller , vice-chairman of the spd parliamentary group demanded that the conservatives finally recognize that they " have no chance " to chip away at nuclear phase-out with the spd . müller argued that if the nuclear plants were indeed allowed to run longer , they would have to undergo updated security modifications - something that would cost money , he said . nuclear energy makes comeback the two future coalition partners have thus far made steady progress on a host of issues , from budgetary policy to renewable energy .
but it seems unlikely that the same will be seen on nuclear energy , which is set to dominate talks next week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the loviisa southern finnish nuclear power station one thing that 's bolstered the conservatives ' case is the fact that nuclear energy has been gradually making a comeback in europe with the first new nuclear plant on the continent in years being built in finland . its supporters also point out that nuclear reactors emit virtually no greenhouse gases . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de renewable sector wary of cdu promises should the conservatives win september 's election , the renewable energy sector , which boomed under the green party 's influence , will be hit by changes .

club president franz beckenbauer said however , if he were ballack , then he would go to spanish team real madrid . tactics to keep his best player ?
or just plain old-fashioned advice from one star to another ?
bayern munich president franz beckenbauer has advised german international captain michael ballack to join spanish giants real madrid should he decide to leave bayern . beckenbauer and bayern are trying to persuade ballack , whose contract expires at the end of the season , to extend his stay with the german champions , but admit the lure of nine-time european champions real madrid is enticing for any top player . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack 's future is uncertain " i 'd probably say yes to real madrid , " beckenbauer told magazine sport-bild .
" they stand above all others in terms of legend .
they 're the ambition of every player and it was the same when i was playing . " ballack turned down real madrid in the summer of 2002 to join bayern in a 12.9 million euro -lrb- $ 15.5 million -rrb- deal .
at that time , ballack wanted to make his mark on german soccer - and stay in the country until after the 2006 world cup . the list of top clubs is long madrid are n't alone on the list of potential buyers .
italian titans inter milan are also monitoring ballack and can point to a history of signing german players with west germany 's 1990 world cup winners jürgen klinsmann , lothar matthäus and andreas brehme all having spent spells at the club . " i do not know if michael would have fun in the italian league , " declared beckenbauer .
" they often have crowds as low as 7,8 or 9,000 .
that 's equivalent to the regional league attendances in germany .
in the bundesliga we have average crowds of 40,000 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch striker ruud van nistelrooy could also be a ballack teammate english premiership side manchester united have emerged as favorites in the media but munich chairman karl-heinz rummenigge dismissed talk that the move would be a step up from bayern . " i can not imagine that he -lrb- ballack -rrb- would go to manchester united , " rummenigge told television channel premiere .
" what do manchester united have that bayern munich do n't ?
if you take a quick look at the english table then it seems it is nothing .
if i was a player i would not go to manchester united under any circumstances . " ballack has postponed making any decision until the end of november when he is expected to inform bayern whether he will sign on the dotted line or leave on a free transfer in june 2006 . for the time being , nobody , probably not even ballack 's agent michael becker , knows which club will get the lucky phone call that is something akin to the jackpot in the lottery . dw staff / afp -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern and ballack in contract crunch time it was a marriage made in heaven : germany 's one true superstar and the bundesliga 's only real superpower .

the future of nuclear energy is set to be a key battlefield in talks between germany 's potential coalition partners with both bracing for a showdown over the emotive issue . one of the most crucial pieces of legislation passed by outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , in the eyes of many , was a planned phase-out of germany 's atomic energy plants by 2020 . the idea , largely pressed by the environmentally-friendly greens , was to focus on renewable energy and away from a crippling dependence on oil .
it also found support at a time when safety concerns over nuclear power reactors were highlighted with accidents like the one in chernobyl in 1986 . but that law now faces an uncertain future with germany 's new government set to comprise the conservatives and the social democrats in a power-sharing alliance by the end of november . economic arguments the conservatives led by chancellor-designate angela merkel have made no secret of the fact that they intend to put the brakes on the nuclear-phase out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel fears germany may lose out if it halts nuclear-power production earlier this year , merkel argued in a speech that if germany is no longer active in nuclear power it would have no influence on the international market when it comes to exporting nuclear technology . " in my view , an ideologically motivated nuclear phase-out does not reflect economic demands , " merkel said , citing the fact that countries such as india and china are expanding their nuclear energy capacities . " for me , the question is , how can germany with its technical know-how profit from this export potential .
as a patriot , i would like to see my country profit from our expertise , not watch others take the profits . " merkel 's rhetoric could have been put down to mere election-speak at the time .
but now with a federal election forcing the two largest parties into a grand coalition and the hard negotiating over policies gathering momentum , the issue of nuclear energy is proving to be a key test for the future partners . spd , conservatives dig in their heels signs over the weekend were n't encouraging with both sides sticking to their positions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a nuclear reactor in biblis , germany " the lifetime of nuclear power stations can not be extended , " spd chairman franz müntefering told bild am sonntag newspaper , adding that a so-called nuclear compromise hammered out between schröder 's government and energy companies in 2000 and which became law in 2002 , must be upheld .
the law foresees phasing out the last of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants by 2020 . however , the conservatives are keen to provide germany , a large importer of oil and gas , with greater energy security and allow the energy industry to earn more by extending the life of their plants . in a guest commentary in bild am sonntag , conservative premier of baden-württemberg , günther oettinger urged the future government not to switch off any nuclear power plants in the next four years and to generally extend their lives . " we need time and money to further develop stable renewable energy sources , " oettinger wrote .
" the extension of the lifetimes of nuclear stations with maximum security standards can give us both . " but , michael müller , vice-chairman of the spd parliamentary group demanded that the conservatives finally recognize that they " have no chance " to chip away at nuclear phase-out with the spd . müller argued that if the nuclear plants were indeed allowed to run longer , they would have to undergo updated security modifications - something that would cost money , he said . nuclear energy makes comeback the two future coalition partners have thus far made steady progress on a host of issues , from budgetary policy to renewable energy .
but it seems unlikely that the same will be seen on nuclear energy , which is set to dominate talks next week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the loviisa southern finnish nuclear power station one thing that 's bolstered the conservatives ' case is the fact that nuclear energy has been gradually making a comeback in europe with the first new nuclear plant on the continent in years being built in finland . its supporters also point out that nuclear reactors emit virtually no greenhouse gases . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de renewable sector wary of cdu promises should the conservatives win september 's election , the renewable energy sector , which boomed under the green party 's influence , will be hit by changes .

" the biggest obstacle to returning the cathedral to the -lrb- normal -rrb- world heritage list has been removed , " said dieter offenhäusser , spokesman for the german commission of the united nations educational , scientific and cultural organization . property developers had submitted plans for three office blocks that would have radically altered the skyline of the western city , which is currently dominated by the twin spires of the gothic cathedral .
the city 's planning authorities look set to scrap plans for two of the towers but say one could still be built , but only if a tenant can be found .
lufthansa pulls out german airline lufthansa had expressed an interest in renting the first tower , but has now pulled out . " it was planned that lufthansa would move into the building but this has not been followed through , " a spokesman for the cologne city authorities told afp . cologne cathedral was built over six centuries from 1248 to 1880 and survived bombing of the city during world war ii . unesco describes the world heritage sites as " places on earth that are of outstanding universal value to humanity .

someone innocuously uses the internet to make a purchase .
later , money begins disappearing from the customer 's bank account unbeknownst to them .
thousands of such cases land on desks of prosecutors everywhere .
but according to a recent survey , europeans , from whom millions are stolen annually via the form of internet theft known as phishing , still remain ignorant about online security , especially in comparison to american consumers .
" the cases we have seen in our office are just the tip of the iceberg , " andreas kingbeil , who works with police to combat computer fraud in berlin , told focus newsmagazine .
shopping away according to a survey by us-based momentum research group , online shopping is influenced by fears of internet theft more often in the us than in europe , particularly in germany and france . about 16 percent of the us customers surveyed said they had started spending less online because they feared theft .
but only 6 percent of german and 9 percent of french consumers said they had changed their habits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hijacked web sites threaten consumers meanwhile , 90 percent of americans surveyed understood what internet theft is , while only a third in france and germany did .
a majority of respondents did not understand internet fraud methods such as phishing .
still , the survey showed , consumers are spending more online today than ever before at the same time as some are cutting back .
more education needed internet security experts say phishing is one of the most common methods of internet fraud .
in phishing , customers are lured away from a company 's official web site to a fake web site which closely replicates the original .
usually , the fake site is missing specific elements of the original or the name is slightly different .
sometimes customers will indeed enter the official web site , but then be redirected to a fake site .
only by taking the time to explore the entire site can customers figure out whether it 's a fraud .
but most do n't take the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : let the buyer beware online charities , lotteries and auctions are often other sources of fraud .
consumers click on links to donate money or claim prizes , and by doing so , give their credit card and other important information to thieves .
pharming is an even more serious problem for internet consumers .
in this method , web pirates hijack a site and use sensitive data entered there for their own purposes .
security experts say it 's very difficult to detect when a web site has been taken over by thieves .
millions lost in the us , experts say that phishing and other internet fraud costs customers 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- annually .
in germany , officials estimate that phishing has cost consumers more than 4.5 million euros - and that is just cases that police have investigated .
in some cases , retailers and banks compensate customers and investigate themselves .
most respondents to the momentum research survey said they believe that should be the case and knowing so would make them feel more secure about online shopping .
" for consumers , the key to online confidence lies at the door of the business community - meaning that it is imperative for online vendors to be seen taking appropriate measures to protect their customers ' interests , " said art coviello , president and ceo of rsa security which commissioned the study , in a prepared statement .
" the survey clearly demonstrates that , once their trust is earned , users will return - and spend - again and again .
but that trust is a fragile commodity . " dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hackers go phishing for online bankers that e-mail from your bank may be more than a friendly enquiry .

the future of nuclear energy is set to be a key battlefield in talks between germany 's potential coalition partners with both bracing for a showdown over the emotive issue . one of the most crucial pieces of legislation passed by outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , in the eyes of many , was a planned phase-out of germany 's atomic energy plants by 2020 . the idea , largely pressed by the environmentally-friendly greens , was to focus on renewable energy and away from a crippling dependence on oil .
it also found support at a time when safety concerns over nuclear power reactors were highlighted with accidents like the one in chernobyl in 1986 . but that law now faces an uncertain future with germany 's new government set to comprise the conservatives and the social democrats in a power-sharing alliance by the end of november . economic arguments the conservatives led by chancellor-designate angela merkel have made no secret of the fact that they intend to put the brakes on the nuclear-phase out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel fears germany may lose out if it halts nuclear-power production earlier this year , merkel argued in a speech that if germany is no longer active in nuclear power it would have no influence on the international market when it comes to exporting nuclear technology . " in my view , an ideologically motivated nuclear phase-out does not reflect economic demands , " merkel said , citing the fact that countries such as india and china are expanding their nuclear energy capacities . " for me , the question is , how can germany with its technical know-how profit from this export potential .
as a patriot , i would like to see my country profit from our expertise , not watch others take the profits . " merkel 's rhetoric could have been put down to mere election-speak at the time .
but now with a federal election forcing the two largest parties into a grand coalition and the hard negotiating over policies gathering momentum , the issue of nuclear energy is proving to be a key test for the future partners . spd , conservatives dig in their heels signs over the weekend were n't encouraging with both sides sticking to their positions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a nuclear reactor in biblis , germany " the lifetime of nuclear power stations can not be extended , " spd chairman franz müntefering told bild am sonntag newspaper , adding that a so-called nuclear compromise hammered out between schröder 's government and energy companies in 2000 and which became law in 2002 , must be upheld .
the law foresees phasing out the last of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants by 2020 . however , the conservatives are keen to provide germany , a large importer of oil and gas , with greater energy security and allow the energy industry to earn more by extending the life of their plants . in a guest commentary in bild am sonntag , conservative premier of baden-württemberg , günther oettinger urged the future government not to switch off any nuclear power plants in the next four years and to generally extend their lives . " we need time and money to further develop stable renewable energy sources , " oettinger wrote .
" the extension of the lifetimes of nuclear stations with maximum security standards can give us both . " but , michael müller , vice-chairman of the spd parliamentary group demanded that the conservatives finally recognize that they " have no chance " to chip away at nuclear phase-out with the spd . müller argued that if the nuclear plants were indeed allowed to run longer , they would have to undergo updated security modifications - something that would cost money , he said . nuclear energy makes comeback the two future coalition partners have thus far made steady progress on a host of issues , from budgetary policy to renewable energy .
but it seems unlikely that the same will be seen on nuclear energy , which is set to dominate talks next week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the loviisa southern finnish nuclear power station one thing that 's bolstered the conservatives ' case is the fact that nuclear energy has been gradually making a comeback in europe with the first new nuclear plant on the continent in years being built in finland . its supporters also point out that nuclear reactors emit virtually no greenhouse gases . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de renewable sector wary of cdu promises should the conservatives win september 's election , the renewable energy sector , which boomed under the green party 's influence , will be hit by changes .
opinions are clashing over what 's best for germany 's economy .

the future of nuclear energy is set to be a key battlefield in talks between germany 's potential coalition partners with both bracing for a showdown over the emotive issue . one of the most crucial pieces of legislation passed by outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , in the eyes of many , was a planned phase-out of germany 's atomic energy plants by 2020 . the idea , largely pressed by the environmentally-friendly greens , was to focus on renewable energy and away from a crippling dependence on oil .
it also found support at a time when safety concerns over nuclear power reactors were highlighted with accidents like the one in chernobyl in 1986 . but that law now faces an uncertain future with germany 's new government set to comprise the conservatives and the social democrats in a power-sharing alliance by the end of november . economic arguments the conservatives led by chancellor-designate angela merkel have made no secret of the fact that they intend to put the brakes on the nuclear-phase out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel fears germany may lose out if it halts nuclear-power production earlier this year , merkel argued in a speech that if germany is no longer active in nuclear power it would have no influence on the international market when it comes to exporting nuclear technology . " in my view , an ideologically motivated nuclear phase-out does not reflect economic demands , " merkel said , citing the fact that countries such as india and china are expanding their nuclear energy capacities . " for me , the question is , how can germany with its technical know-how profit from this export potential .

club president franz beckenbauer said however , if he were ballack , then he would go to spanish team real madrid . tactics to keep his best player ?
or just plain old-fashioned advice from one star to another ?
bayern munich president franz beckenbauer has advised german international captain michael ballack to join spanish giants real madrid should he decide to leave bayern . beckenbauer and bayern are trying to persuade ballack , whose contract expires at the end of the season , to extend his stay with the german champions , but admit the lure of nine-time european champions real madrid is enticing for any top player . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack 's future is uncertain " i 'd probably say yes to real madrid , " beckenbauer told magazine sport-bild .
" they stand above all others in terms of legend .
they 're the ambition of every player and it was the same when i was playing . " ballack turned down real madrid in the summer of 2002 to join bayern in a 12.9 million euro -lrb- $ 15.5 million -rrb- deal .
at that time , ballack wanted to make his mark on german soccer - and stay in the country until after the 2006 world cup . the list of top clubs is long madrid are n't alone on the list of potential buyers .
italian titans inter milan are also monitoring ballack and can point to a history of signing german players with west germany 's 1990 world cup winners jürgen klinsmann , lothar matthäus and andreas brehme all having spent spells at the club . " i do not know if michael would have fun in the italian league , " declared beckenbauer .
" they often have crowds as low as 7,8 or 9,000 .

the future of nuclear energy is set to be a key battlefield in talks between germany 's potential coalition partners with both bracing for a showdown over the emotive issue . one of the most crucial pieces of legislation passed by outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , in the eyes of many , was a planned phase-out of germany 's atomic energy plants by 2020 . the idea , largely pressed by the environmentally-friendly greens , was to focus on renewable energy and away from a crippling dependence on oil .
it also found support at a time when safety concerns over nuclear power reactors were highlighted with accidents like the one in chernobyl in 1986 . but that law now faces an uncertain future with germany 's new government set to comprise the conservatives and the social democrats in a power-sharing alliance by the end of november . economic arguments the conservatives led by chancellor-designate angela merkel have made no secret of the fact that they intend to put the brakes on the nuclear-phase out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel fears germany may lose out if it halts nuclear-power production earlier this year , merkel argued in a speech that if germany is no longer active in nuclear power it would have no influence on the international market when it comes to exporting nuclear technology . " in my view , an ideologically motivated nuclear phase-out does not reflect economic demands , " merkel said , citing the fact that countries such as india and china are expanding their nuclear energy capacities . " for me , the question is , how can germany with its technical know-how profit from this export potential .
as a patriot , i would like to see my country profit from our expertise , not watch others take the profits . " merkel 's rhetoric could have been put down to mere election-speak at the time .
but now with a federal election forcing the two largest parties into a grand coalition and the hard negotiating over policies gathering momentum , the issue of nuclear energy is proving to be a key test for the future partners . spd , conservatives dig in their heels signs over the weekend were n't encouraging with both sides sticking to their positions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a nuclear reactor in biblis , germany " the lifetime of nuclear power stations can not be extended , " spd chairman franz müntefering told bild am sonntag newspaper , adding that a so-called nuclear compromise hammered out between schröder 's government and energy companies in 2000 and which became law in 2002 , must be upheld .
the law foresees phasing out the last of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants by 2020 . however , the conservatives are keen to provide germany , a large importer of oil and gas , with greater energy security and allow the energy industry to earn more by extending the life of their plants . in a guest commentary in bild am sonntag , conservative premier of baden-württemberg , günther oettinger urged the future government not to switch off any nuclear power plants in the next four years and to generally extend their lives . " we need time and money to further develop stable renewable energy sources , " oettinger wrote .
" the extension of the lifetimes of nuclear stations with maximum security standards can give us both . " but , michael müller , vice-chairman of the spd parliamentary group demanded that the conservatives finally recognize that they " have no chance " to chip away at nuclear phase-out with the spd . müller argued that if the nuclear plants were indeed allowed to run longer , they would have to undergo updated security modifications - something that would cost money , he said . nuclear energy makes comeback the two future coalition partners have thus far made steady progress on a host of issues , from budgetary policy to renewable energy .
but it seems unlikely that the same will be seen on nuclear energy , which is set to dominate talks next week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the loviisa southern finnish nuclear power station one thing that 's bolstered the conservatives ' case is the fact that nuclear energy has been gradually making a comeback in europe with the first new nuclear plant on the continent in years being built in finland . its supporters also point out that nuclear reactors emit virtually no greenhouse gases . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de renewable sector wary of cdu promises should the conservatives win september 's election , the renewable energy sector , which boomed under the green party 's influence , will be hit by changes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 30.10.2005 internet fraud costs europe millions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beware of internet pirates when shopping online although internet fraud is costing consumer millions in europe , europeans still remain less guarded and informed about online theft than people elsewhere . everyone has read the horror stories .
someone innocuously uses the internet to make a purchase .
later , money begins disappearing from the customer 's bank account unbeknownst to them .
thousands of such cases land on desks of prosecutors everywhere .
but according to a recent survey , europeans , from whom millions are stolen annually via the form of internet theft known as phishing , still remain ignorant about online security , especially in comparison to american consumers .
" the cases we have seen in our office are just the tip of the iceberg , " andreas kingbeil , who works with police to combat computer fraud in berlin , told focus newsmagazine .
shopping away according to a survey by us-based momentum research group , online shopping is influenced by fears of internet theft more often in the us than in europe , particularly in germany and france . about 16 percent of the us customers surveyed said they had started spending less online because they feared theft .
but only 6 percent of german and 9 percent of french consumers said they had changed their habits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hijacked web sites threaten consumers meanwhile , 90 percent of americans surveyed understood what internet theft is , while only a third in france and germany did .
a majority of respondents did not understand internet fraud methods such as phishing .
still , the survey showed , consumers are spending more online today than ever before at the same time as some are cutting back .
more education needed internet security experts say phishing is one of the most common methods of internet fraud .
in phishing , customers are lured away from a company 's official web site to a fake web site which closely replicates the original .
usually , the fake site is missing specific elements of the original or the name is slightly different .
sometimes customers will indeed enter the official web site , but then be redirected to a fake site .
only by taking the time to explore the entire site can customers figure out whether it 's a fraud .
but most do n't take the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : let the buyer beware online charities , lotteries and auctions are often other sources of fraud .
consumers click on links to donate money or claim prizes , and by doing so , give their credit card and other important information to thieves .
pharming is an even more serious problem for internet consumers .
in this method , web pirates hijack a site and use sensitive data entered there for their own purposes .
security experts say it 's very difficult to detect when a web site has been taken over by thieves .
millions lost in the us , experts say that phishing and other internet fraud costs customers 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- annually .
in germany , officials estimate that phishing has cost consumers more than 4.5 million euros - and that is just cases that police have investigated .
in some cases , retailers and banks compensate customers and investigate themselves .
most respondents to the momentum research survey said they believe that should be the case and knowing so would make them feel more secure about online shopping .
" for consumers , the key to online confidence lies at the door of the business community - meaning that it is imperative for online vendors to be seen taking appropriate measures to protect their customers ' interests , " said art coviello , president and ceo of rsa security which commissioned the study , in a prepared statement .
" the survey clearly demonstrates that , once their trust is earned , users will return - and spend - again and again .
but that trust is a fragile commodity . " dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hackers go phishing for online bankers that e-mail from your bank may be more than a friendly enquiry .

the future of nuclear energy is set to be a key battlefield in talks between germany 's potential coalition partners with both bracing for a showdown over the emotive issue . one of the most crucial pieces of legislation passed by outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , in the eyes of many , was a planned phase-out of germany 's atomic energy plants by 2020 . the idea , largely pressed by the environmentally-friendly greens , was to focus on renewable energy and away from a crippling dependence on oil .
it also found support at a time when safety concerns over nuclear power reactors were highlighted with accidents like the one in chernobyl in 1986 . but that law now faces an uncertain future with germany 's new government set to comprise the conservatives and the social democrats in a power-sharing alliance by the end of november . economic arguments the conservatives led by chancellor-designate angela merkel have made no secret of the fact that they intend to put the brakes on the nuclear-phase out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel fears germany may lose out if it halts nuclear-power production earlier this year , merkel argued in a speech that if germany is no longer active in nuclear power it would have no influence on the international market when it comes to exporting nuclear technology . " in my view , an ideologically motivated nuclear phase-out does not reflect economic demands , " merkel said , citing the fact that countries such as india and china are expanding their nuclear energy capacities . " for me , the question is , how can germany with its technical know-how profit from this export potential .
as a patriot , i would like to see my country profit from our expertise , not watch others take the profits . " merkel 's rhetoric could have been put down to mere election-speak at the time .
but now with a federal election forcing the two largest parties into a grand coalition and the hard negotiating over policies gathering momentum , the issue of nuclear energy is proving to be a key test for the future partners . spd , conservatives dig in their heels signs over the weekend were n't encouraging with both sides sticking to their positions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a nuclear reactor in biblis , germany " the lifetime of nuclear power stations can not be extended , " spd chairman franz müntefering told bild am sonntag newspaper , adding that a so-called nuclear compromise hammered out between schröder 's government and energy companies in 2000 and which became law in 2002 , must be upheld .
the law foresees phasing out the last of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants by 2020 . however , the conservatives are keen to provide germany , a large importer of oil and gas , with greater energy security and allow the energy industry to earn more by extending the life of their plants . in a guest commentary in bild am sonntag , conservative premier of baden-württemberg , günther oettinger urged the future government not to switch off any nuclear power plants in the next four years and to generally extend their lives . " we need time and money to further develop stable renewable energy sources , " oettinger wrote .
" the extension of the lifetimes of nuclear stations with maximum security standards can give us both . " but , michael müller , vice-chairman of the spd parliamentary group demanded that the conservatives finally recognize that they " have no chance " to chip away at nuclear phase-out with the spd . müller argued that if the nuclear plants were indeed allowed to run longer , they would have to undergo updated security modifications - something that would cost money , he said . nuclear energy makes comeback the two future coalition partners have thus far made steady progress on a host of issues , from budgetary policy to renewable energy .
but it seems unlikely that the same will be seen on nuclear energy , which is set to dominate talks next week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the loviisa southern finnish nuclear power station one thing that 's bolstered the conservatives ' case is the fact that nuclear energy has been gradually making a comeback in europe with the first new nuclear plant on the continent in years being built in finland . its supporters also point out that nuclear reactors emit virtually no greenhouse gases . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de renewable sector wary of cdu promises should the conservatives win september 's election , the renewable energy sector , which boomed under the green party 's influence , will be hit by changes .

the future of nuclear energy is set to be a key battlefield in talks between germany 's potential coalition partners with both bracing for a showdown over the emotive issue . one of the most crucial pieces of legislation passed by outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , in the eyes of many , was a planned phase-out of germany 's atomic energy plants by 2020 . the idea , largely pressed by the environmentally-friendly greens , was to focus on renewable energy and away from a crippling dependence on oil .
it also found support at a time when safety concerns over nuclear power reactors were highlighted with accidents like the one in chernobyl in 1986 . but that law now faces an uncertain future with germany 's new government set to comprise the conservatives and the social democrats in a power-sharing alliance by the end of november . economic arguments the conservatives led by chancellor-designate angela merkel have made no secret of the fact that they intend to put the brakes on the nuclear-phase out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel fears germany may lose out if it halts nuclear-power production earlier this year , merkel argued in a speech that if germany is no longer active in nuclear power it would have no influence on the international market when it comes to exporting nuclear technology . " in my view , an ideologically motivated nuclear phase-out does not reflect economic demands , " merkel said , citing the fact that countries such as india and china are expanding their nuclear energy capacities . " for me , the question is , how can germany with its technical know-how profit from this export potential .
as a patriot , i would like to see my country profit from our expertise , not watch others take the profits . " merkel 's rhetoric could have been put down to mere election-speak at the time .
but now with a federal election forcing the two largest parties into a grand coalition and the hard negotiating over policies gathering momentum , the issue of nuclear energy is proving to be a key test for the future partners . spd , conservatives dig in their heels signs over the weekend were n't encouraging with both sides sticking to their positions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a nuclear reactor in biblis , germany " the lifetime of nuclear power stations can not be extended , " spd chairman franz müntefering told bild am sonntag newspaper , adding that a so-called nuclear compromise hammered out between schröder 's government and energy companies in 2000 and which became law in 2002 , must be upheld .
the law foresees phasing out the last of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants by 2020 . however , the conservatives are keen to provide germany , a large importer of oil and gas , with greater energy security and allow the energy industry to earn more by extending the life of their plants . in a guest commentary in bild am sonntag , conservative premier of baden-württemberg , günther oettinger urged the future government not to switch off any nuclear power plants in the next four years and to generally extend their lives . " we need time and money to further develop stable renewable energy sources , " oettinger wrote .
" the extension of the lifetimes of nuclear stations with maximum security standards can give us both . " but , michael müller , vice-chairman of the spd parliamentary group demanded that the conservatives finally recognize that they " have no chance " to chip away at nuclear phase-out with the spd . müller argued that if the nuclear plants were indeed allowed to run longer , they would have to undergo updated security modifications - something that would cost money , he said . nuclear energy makes comeback the two future coalition partners have thus far made steady progress on a host of issues , from budgetary policy to renewable energy .
but it seems unlikely that the same will be seen on nuclear energy , which is set to dominate talks next week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the loviisa southern finnish nuclear power station one thing that 's bolstered the conservatives ' case is the fact that nuclear energy has been gradually making a comeback in europe with the first new nuclear plant on the continent in years being built in finland . its supporters also point out that nuclear reactors emit virtually no greenhouse gases . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de renewable sector wary of cdu promises should the conservatives win september 's election , the renewable energy sector , which boomed under the green party 's influence , will be hit by changes .

club president franz beckenbauer said however , if he were ballack , then he would go to spanish team real madrid . tactics to keep his best player ?
or just plain old-fashioned advice from one star to another ?
bayern munich president franz beckenbauer has advised german international captain michael ballack to join spanish giants real madrid should he decide to leave bayern . beckenbauer and bayern are trying to persuade ballack , whose contract expires at the end of the season , to extend his stay with the german champions , but admit the lure of nine-time european champions real madrid is enticing for any top player . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack 's future is uncertain " i 'd probably say yes to real madrid , " beckenbauer told magazine sport-bild .
" they stand above all others in terms of legend .
they 're the ambition of every player and it was the same when i was playing . " ballack turned down real madrid in the summer of 2002 to join bayern in a 12.9 million euro -lrb- $ 15.5 million -rrb- deal .
at that time , ballack wanted to make his mark on german soccer - and stay in the country until after the 2006 world cup . the list of top clubs is long madrid are n't alone on the list of potential buyers .
italian titans inter milan are also monitoring ballack and can point to a history of signing german players with west germany 's 1990 world cup winners jürgen klinsmann , lothar matthäus and andreas brehme all having spent spells at the club . " i do not know if michael would have fun in the italian league , " declared beckenbauer .
" they often have crowds as low as 7,8 or 9,000 .
that 's equivalent to the regional league attendances in germany .
in the bundesliga we have average crowds of 40,000 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch striker ruud van nistelrooy could also be a ballack teammate english premiership side manchester united have emerged as favorites in the media but munich chairman karl-heinz rummenigge dismissed talk that the move would be a step up from bayern . " i can not imagine that he -lrb- ballack -rrb- would go to manchester united , " rummenigge told television channel premiere .
" what do manchester united have that bayern munich do n't ?
if you take a quick look at the english table then it seems it is nothing .
if i was a player i would not go to manchester united under any circumstances . " ballack has postponed making any decision until the end of november when he is expected to inform bayern whether he will sign on the dotted line or leave on a free transfer in june 2006 . for the time being , nobody , probably not even ballack 's agent michael becker , knows which club will get the lucky phone call that is something akin to the jackpot in the lottery . dw staff / afp -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern and ballack in contract crunch time it was a marriage made in heaven : germany 's one true superstar and the bundesliga 's only real superpower .

the future of nuclear energy is set to be a key battlefield in talks between germany 's potential coalition partners with both bracing for a showdown over the emotive issue . one of the most crucial pieces of legislation passed by outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , in the eyes of many , was a planned phase-out of germany 's atomic energy plants by 2020 . the idea , largely pressed by the environmentally-friendly greens , was to focus on renewable energy and away from a crippling dependence on oil .
it also found support at a time when safety concerns over nuclear power reactors were highlighted with accidents like the one in chernobyl in 1986 . but that law now faces an uncertain future with germany 's new government set to comprise the conservatives and the social democrats in a power-sharing alliance by the end of november . economic arguments the conservatives led by chancellor-designate angela merkel have made no secret of the fact that they intend to put the brakes on the nuclear-phase out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel fears germany may lose out if it halts nuclear-power production earlier this year , merkel argued in a speech that if germany is no longer active in nuclear power it would have no influence on the international market when it comes to exporting nuclear technology . " in my view , an ideologically motivated nuclear phase-out does not reflect economic demands , " merkel said , citing the fact that countries such as india and china are expanding their nuclear energy capacities . " for me , the question is , how can germany with its technical know-how profit from this export potential .
as a patriot , i would like to see my country profit from our expertise , not watch others take the profits . " merkel 's rhetoric could have been put down to mere election-speak at the time .
but now with a federal election forcing the two largest parties into a grand coalition and the hard negotiating over policies gathering momentum , the issue of nuclear energy is proving to be a key test for the future partners . spd , conservatives dig in their heels signs over the weekend were n't encouraging with both sides sticking to their positions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a nuclear reactor in biblis , germany " the lifetime of nuclear power stations can not be extended , " spd chairman franz müntefering told bild am sonntag newspaper , adding that a so-called nuclear compromise hammered out between schröder 's government and energy companies in 2000 and which became law in 2002 , must be upheld .
the law foresees phasing out the last of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants by 2020 . however , the conservatives are keen to provide germany , a large importer of oil and gas , with greater energy security and allow the energy industry to earn more by extending the life of their plants . in a guest commentary in bild am sonntag , conservative premier of baden-württemberg , günther oettinger urged the future government not to switch off any nuclear power plants in the next four years and to generally extend their lives . " we need time and money to further develop stable renewable energy sources , " oettinger wrote .
" the extension of the lifetimes of nuclear stations with maximum security standards can give us both . " but , michael müller , vice-chairman of the spd parliamentary group demanded that the conservatives finally recognize that they " have no chance " to chip away at nuclear phase-out with the spd . müller argued that if the nuclear plants were indeed allowed to run longer , they would have to undergo updated security modifications - something that would cost money , he said . nuclear energy makes comeback the two future coalition partners have thus far made steady progress on a host of issues , from budgetary policy to renewable energy .
but it seems unlikely that the same will be seen on nuclear energy , which is set to dominate talks next week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the loviisa southern finnish nuclear power station one thing that 's bolstered the conservatives ' case is the fact that nuclear energy has been gradually making a comeback in europe with the first new nuclear plant on the continent in years being built in finland . its supporters also point out that nuclear reactors emit virtually no greenhouse gases . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de renewable sector wary of cdu promises should the conservatives win september 's election , the renewable energy sector , which boomed under the green party 's influence , will be hit by changes .

the future of nuclear energy is set to be a key battlefield in talks between germany 's potential coalition partners with both bracing for a showdown over the emotive issue . one of the most crucial pieces of legislation passed by outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , in the eyes of many , was a planned phase-out of germany 's atomic energy plants by 2020 . the idea , largely pressed by the environmentally-friendly greens , was to focus on renewable energy and away from a crippling dependence on oil .

club president franz beckenbauer said however , if he were ballack , then he would go to spanish team real madrid . tactics to keep his best player ?
or just plain old-fashioned advice from one star to another ?
bayern munich president franz beckenbauer has advised german international captain michael ballack to join spanish giants real madrid should he decide to leave bayern . beckenbauer and bayern are trying to persuade ballack , whose contract expires at the end of the season , to extend his stay with the german champions , but admit the lure of nine-time european champions real madrid is enticing for any top player . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack 's future is uncertain " i 'd probably say yes to real madrid , " beckenbauer told magazine sport-bild .
" they stand above all others in terms of legend .
they 're the ambition of every player and it was the same when i was playing . " ballack turned down real madrid in the summer of 2002 to join bayern in a 12.9 million euro -lrb- $ 15.5 million -rrb- deal .
at that time , ballack wanted to make his mark on german soccer - and stay in the country until after the 2006 world cup . the list of top clubs is long madrid are n't alone on the list of potential buyers .
italian titans inter milan are also monitoring ballack and can point to a history of signing german players with west germany 's 1990 world cup winners jürgen klinsmann , lothar matthäus and andreas brehme all having spent spells at the club . " i do not know if michael would have fun in the italian league , " declared beckenbauer .
" they often have crowds as low as 7,8 or 9,000 .
that 's equivalent to the regional league attendances in germany .
in the bundesliga we have average crowds of 40,000 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch striker ruud van nistelrooy could also be a ballack teammate english premiership side manchester united have emerged as favorites in the media but munich chairman karl-heinz rummenigge dismissed talk that the move would be a step up from bayern . " i can not imagine that he -lrb- ballack -rrb- would go to manchester united , " rummenigge told television channel premiere .
" what do manchester united have that bayern munich do n't ?
if you take a quick look at the english table then it seems it is nothing .
if i was a player i would not go to manchester united under any circumstances . " ballack has postponed making any decision until the end of november when he is expected to inform bayern whether he will sign on the dotted line or leave on a free transfer in june 2006 . for the time being , nobody , probably not even ballack 's agent michael becker , knows which club will get the lucky phone call that is something akin to the jackpot in the lottery . dw staff / afp -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : bayern and ballack in contract crunch time it was a marriage made in heaven : germany 's one true superstar and the bundesliga 's only real superpower .

views given at the birmingham gathering could help shape a government white paper on reforms due later this year .
options such as extra drop-in clinics and allowing people to register with more than one gp , were discussed .
the public consultation was on an unprecedented scale , said bbc health correspondent branwen jeffries .
us-style town hall meetings have been hailed by the government as the way forward in helping to form policies . "
we have had people at the regional events not wanting to go home because they have got so involved " department of health spokeswoman the government said five regional events held to date , including saturday 's at birmingham 's international convention centre , had been a success and promised the model would be considered for future consultations .
around one million people visit " out of hospital " services such as the family doctor or social care services every day , said our correspondent .
those primary care services account for around 90 % of contact with nhs patients .
a clear mandate for change could help the government in its negotiations with health service professionals , she added .

the st stephen 's tower bell and clock , at westminster palace , stopped after the 0800 bst chimes on saturday and the hands moved to the midday position .
engineers are due to restart the clock at about 1600 gmt on sunday .
the chimes were silenced for longer in 1983 when the clock 's hands were removed for new gilding to be applied .
extreme heat and snow have caused short unplanned stoppages of the great clock .
the last time this happened was in may this year , when engineers said high temperatures of 31.8c -lrb- 90f -rrb- could have contributed to the clock failing for an hour-and-a-half .

" there is nothing actually wrong .
it is a routine maintenance that happens every 15 or 20 years . "
while the clock is stopped , engineers from the whitechapel bell foundry are also replacing rubber hammer buffers on the hour bell and three of the four quarter bells .
the work is intended to form the basis of a new five and 10-yearly maintenance regime to ensure continued reliability for the foreseeable future .
the inspection came as the clocks went back at 0200bst on sunday .
