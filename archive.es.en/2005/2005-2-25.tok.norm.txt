the new ball will tell the referee if it crossed the line a new soccer ball designed to eradicate controversial goal-line decisions is expected to be approved by a law making body in the next step toward its inclusion in the 2006 world cup in germany . a new hit-tech soccer ball may help make the world cup 2006 in germany one of the least controversial in terms of goal decisions since the tournament began in 1932 .
the revolutionary ball will be armed with the technology to alert referees when it has crossed the goal-line , avoiding situations like the notorious geoff hurst strike for england in the 1966 final . the decision to introduce the sci-fi ball at the world cup next summer is likely to be approved by the international fa board , soccer 's ultimate law making body , at a conference in cardiff , wales over the weekend . the ball , the product of a collaborative effort between german sports giant adidas , cairos technologies and radio communications firm fraunhofer , is shrouded in secrecy .

the new ball will tell the referee if it crossed the line a new soccer ball designed to eradicate controversial goal-line decisions is expected to be approved by a law making body in the next step toward its inclusion in the 2006 world cup in germany . a new hit-tech soccer ball may help make the world cup 2006 in germany one of the least controversial in terms of goal decisions since the tournament began in 1932 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.02.2005 energy firms seek new german sources großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a potential scene on germany 's north sea coast ?
the winter in germany has been cold and the demand for heating oil and gas has risen sharply .
to meet them , german oil and gas companies have had to increase production - abroad . the company names are the same : exxonmobil , bp , total and shell .
the oil and gas multinationals are omnipresent .
in germany , they also have subsidiaries searching for oil and gas reserves both in the country and abroad .
the demand is rising , particularly for natural gas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of kilometers of natural gas pipelines cross throughout germany to end consumers according to statistics from the german gas supplier , verbundnetz gas , natural gas consumption rose 40 percent from 1990 to 2003 in germany .
in the same time period , the use of natural gas for energy purposes increased from 15.4 percent of total energy consumption to 22.5 percent .
the increase creates incentives to tap into new sources .
germany has never been a rich country for natural gas and oil reserves , but one-fifth of the natural gas consumed by germans is german .
but that is changing .
the head of the german oil and gas producer association and director of exxonmobil germany , gernot kalkoffen , said that production in germany is falling due to the depletion of the reserves already present .
international pricing also plays a role .
" the development in germany has fallen because of the strength of the euro and the uncoupling of the gas price from oil , so that in germany , there has n't been a price increase in natural gas for the producers , " explained kalkoffen .
offshore attractive yet complicated as gas and oil reserves drop in germany proper , the producers have had to turn to increasingly more unconventional ways to win fossil fuels , such as extracting so-called tight gas from extremely dense layers of rock .
kalkoffen sees potential there , but offshore drilling in the north sea is also attractive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind parks such as this one in denmark have sprouted up and down the north sea coast yet offshore drilling collides with operators of wind energy parks , and , naturally , environmentalists and german governmental environmental policies .
kalkoffen is still uncertain just what effect the nature reserve status of the north sea coast is going to have on potential drilling there .
on the german greenpeace web site , the demands are clear : no more drilling in the north sea and more renewable energy .
in the meantime , the oil industry is turning to foreign oil and gas to satisfy demand .
in 2004 alone , german natural gas production abroad rose 12 percent , a continuation of the trend in the last few years .
wherever there are reserves , german oil and gas producers are drilling - north africa , libya in particular , north and south america , but also in other parts of europe , such as the states of the former soviet union , said kalkoffen . thomas mösch -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder joins the libya fan club since dismantling its weapons programs , libya has been embraced by the west .

the new ball will tell the referee if it crossed the line a new soccer ball designed to eradicate controversial goal-line decisions is expected to be approved by a law making body in the next step toward its inclusion in the 2006 world cup in germany . a new hit-tech soccer ball may help make the world cup 2006 in germany one of the least controversial in terms of goal decisions since the tournament began in 1932 .
the revolutionary ball will be armed with the technology to alert referees when it has crossed the goal-line , avoiding situations like the notorious geoff hurst strike for england in the 1966 final . the decision to introduce the sci-fi ball at the world cup next summer is likely to be approved by the international fa board , soccer 's ultimate law making body , at a conference in cardiff , wales over the weekend . the ball , the product of a collaborative effort between german sports giant adidas , cairos technologies and radio communications firm fraunhofer , is shrouded in secrecy .
adidas researchers have been reluctant to talk about their plans to fit the balls with microchip sensors , designed to bring an end to controversial goal situations . goal-line alert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the technology will allow the exact position of the ball on the pitch to be monitored throughout the whole of a game .
once it has crossed the goal-line for a valid goal , the referee will receive an automatic bleep in his earpiece without any need for a fourth official watching pictures or instruments in the stands . officials from the german sports firm were reportedly angered by fifa president sepp blatter announcement last month when the world soccer body 's chief said there would be a presentation of the ball in cardiff . adidas boffins claimed they had not yet completed their schedule of testing and development .
adidas have already conducted two successful tests , but need to conduct more trials at grounds during games before they launch the product . vorsprung durch technik bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fußball-wm 2006 frnakfurt / main frankfurt stadion fußball media reports since the fifa announcement have indicated that adidas and fifa had set the target of the world cup as the ball 's baptism of fire .
it would be the centerpiece of germany 's intended hi-tech tournament filled with state-of-the-art stadia and 21st-century technology . as well as updating the game for the new millenium , fifa are keen to avoid the refereeing decisions that dogged the 2002 world cup finals in japan and south korea and are seen to be bending to pressure to follow the lead of rugby and cricket where new technology has been introduced to the benefit of the sport . the adidas ball would also give blatter the chance to show he is answering the calls to help referees without resorting to the use of tv replays , which he fiercely opposes . possible bundesliga tests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : * * spervermerk : die publikation und weiterverwertung dieses bildes in elektronischen medien , insbesondere im internet und auf mobilen endgeraeten waehrend des laufenden spiels , einschliesslich der halbzeit , ist durch die deutsche fussball liga untersagt .

6 , 2004 .
-lrb- ap photo / christof stache -rrb- after the presentation on saturday , the international board will discuss whether the ball will be given the green light for further trials of the ball in competitions .
it is likely that the ball would be tested in the bundesliga and in the german stadiums designated as world cup venues , and even during champions league games in germany where conventional adidas balls are already used . if these tests were successful , the law making body would then convene for another meeting this time next year where it would decide whether the new ball could be included in the rules for the world cup .
if agreed , this would mean computerized soccer balls would see action in germany next summer . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de scandal deals blow to german soccer the widening match-fixing scandal is damaging german soccer 's image in the build-up to the 2006 world cup , organizing committee president franz beckenbauer said tuesday .

to date , the swastika and other symbols of the national socialist party are banned only in germany and austria .
on thursday , the interior and justice ministers of the 25 eu countries met to discuss the possible ban of all nazi symbols , as well as questions of visa regulation and other timely issues .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.02.2005 energy firms seek new german sources großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a potential scene on germany 's north sea coast ?
the winter in germany has been cold and the demand for heating oil and gas has risen sharply .
to meet them , german oil and gas companies have had to increase production - abroad . the company names are the same : exxonmobil , bp , total and shell .
the oil and gas multinationals are omnipresent .
in germany , they also have subsidiaries searching for oil and gas reserves both in the country and abroad .
the demand is rising , particularly for natural gas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of kilometers of natural gas pipelines cross throughout germany to end consumers according to statistics from the german gas supplier , verbundnetz gas , natural gas consumption rose 40 percent from 1990 to 2003 in germany .
in the same time period , the use of natural gas for energy purposes increased from 15.4 percent of total energy consumption to 22.5 percent .
the increase creates incentives to tap into new sources .
germany has never been a rich country for natural gas and oil reserves , but one-fifth of the natural gas consumed by germans is german .
but that is changing .
the head of the german oil and gas producer association and director of exxonmobil germany , gernot kalkoffen , said that production in germany is falling due to the depletion of the reserves already present .
international pricing also plays a role .
" the development in germany has fallen because of the strength of the euro and the uncoupling of the gas price from oil , so that in germany , there has n't been a price increase in natural gas for the producers , " explained kalkoffen .
offshore attractive yet complicated as gas and oil reserves drop in germany proper , the producers have had to turn to increasingly more unconventional ways to win fossil fuels , such as extracting so-called tight gas from extremely dense layers of rock .
kalkoffen sees potential there , but offshore drilling in the north sea is also attractive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind parks such as this one in denmark have sprouted up and down the north sea coast yet offshore drilling collides with operators of wind energy parks , and , naturally , environmentalists and german governmental environmental policies .
kalkoffen is still uncertain just what effect the nature reserve status of the north sea coast is going to have on potential drilling there .
on the german greenpeace web site , the demands are clear : no more drilling in the north sea and more renewable energy .
in the meantime , the oil industry is turning to foreign oil and gas to satisfy demand .
in 2004 alone , german natural gas production abroad rose 12 percent , a continuation of the trend in the last few years .
wherever there are reserves , german oil and gas producers are drilling - north africa , libya in particular , north and south america , but also in other parts of europe , such as the states of the former soviet union , said kalkoffen . thomas mösch -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder joins the libya fan club since dismantling its weapons programs , libya has been embraced by the west .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 25.02.2005 bringing the burrito to berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dolores is berlin 's first burrito shop berlin may be famous for its currywurst and döner kebab , but those old fast food standards might soon give way for snacking california-style , as two entrepreneurs aim to show germany what burritos are all about . standing on the corner of rosa luxemburg and münz streets in berlin , one is n't immediately reminded of sunny california .
just a stone 's throw away from the city 's marvel of communist postwar city planning , alexanderplatz , there certainly are n't any palm trees to be found . upon closer inspection , however , one discovers there are avocados aplenty here .
on the window of dolores , berlin 's first and only burrito shop , there 's a stylized logo of the green fruit telling passersby that this is no ordinary german imbiss , or snack bar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dolores owners grischa coenen und philipp krahé .
inside , cartons of the real thing have been mashed up by the shop 's owners , philipp krahé and grischa coenen , to make up a fresh daily batch of what every proper burrito needs : guacamole .
but that 's easier said than done in a city where ripe avocados are hard to come by . " it 's all a matter of organization , " explained the 37-year-old krahé .
" you 've just got to buy them as they are and store them until they 're ready . " avocado wrangling but in their quest to bring a little slice of california to the german capital , avocado wrangling is one of the easier challenges krahé and his 30-year-old partner coenen have had to face .
prior to opening dolores last autumn , the two had to contend with miserly banks and teutonic bureaucracy - a lethal combination for so many of germany 's would-be entrepreneurs . " they put so many obstacles in your way , it 's really hard to believe , " said coenen . he and krahé ploughed through it all as if they were on a mission , which was only fitting , since their shop is named after san francisco 's oldest standing building , the mission dolores .
the neighborhood around the mission is filled with mexican and latino shops and restaurants , but the two actually came up with the idea for their little burrito haven after they met while living in london . although they loved london 's energy , both had become disenchanted with their jobs and they decided to start their own business .

just a stone 's throw away from the city 's marvel of communist postwar city planning , alexanderplatz , there certainly are n't any palm trees to be found . upon closer inspection , however , one discovers there are avocados aplenty here .
on the window of dolores , berlin 's first and only burrito shop , there 's a stylized logo of the green fruit telling passersby that this is no ordinary german imbiss , or snack bar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dolores owners grischa coenen und philipp krahé .
inside , cartons of the real thing have been mashed up by the shop 's owners , philipp krahé and grischa coenen , to make up a fresh daily batch of what every proper burrito needs : guacamole .
but that 's easier said than done in a city where ripe avocados are hard to come by . " it 's all a matter of organization , " explained the 37-year-old krahé .
" you 've just got to buy them as they are and store them until they 're ready . " avocado wrangling but in their quest to bring a little slice of california to the german capital , avocado wrangling is one of the easier challenges krahé and his 30-year-old partner coenen have had to face .
prior to opening dolores last autumn , the two had to contend with miserly banks and teutonic bureaucracy - a lethal combination for so many of germany 's would-be entrepreneurs . " they put so many obstacles in your way , it 's really hard to believe , " said coenen . he and krahé ploughed through it all as if they were on a mission , which was only fitting , since their shop is named after san francisco 's oldest standing building , the mission dolores .
the neighborhood around the mission is filled with mexican and latino shops and restaurants , but the two actually came up with the idea for their little burrito haven after they met while living in london . although they loved london 's energy , both had become disenchanted with their jobs and they decided to start their own business .
both were also amazed at the innovative and creative types of fast food in britain compared to what was on offer in germany .
it was then that they decided to set up their own stylish gourmet snack bar in berlin . having spent considerable time in california , the two compared notes and decided the city had a burrito gap just crying out to be filled by a fat tortilla stuffed with adobo beef , pinto beans and , yes , guacamole .

german towns grappling with welfare cuts and labor reforms thought so when they registered them with job centers .
but the federal government , facing spiraling costs , is not amused . german chancellor gerhard schröder 's controversial " hartz iv " reforms , which triggered angry protests across the country last year , is once again at the center of a row after a relatively calm couple of months . the reforms , named after peter hartz , personnel director at germany 's biggest carmaker volkswagen , replaces the previous two-tier system of unemployment benefits and welfare support for the long-term unemployed with a single flat-rate payout . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters at an anti-hartz demonstration in brandenburg that means that starting this year people formerly on the dole that are fit to work , are now given handouts by the government in berlin .

the german state has urged warsaw to recall it from stores .
now , the polish foreign minister too , has slammed the edition . polish foreign minister adam rotfeld on thursday criticized the polish release of nazi dictator adolf hitler 's controversial book " mein kampf , " saying the work contains the seeds of nazi crimes . " i think it is a scandal .
this can not be tolerated , " rotfeld told reporters .
" this is a book which encourages crime .
do you think people should be encouraged to commit crime ? " rotfeld was reacting to the publication of 3,000 copies of a polish translation of " mein kampf " by a small publisher in the southwestern city of wroclaw .
the book sets out hitler 's anti-semitic , racist and fascist views and his vision of germany as a racially superior nation and a conqueror . " as the bible said , in the beginning there was the world , and the word became flesh .
in the beginning there was hitler 's word ' mein kampf , ' after which crimes followed .
is it really good to let this start again ? "

six million poles died during the war .
six million jews who were also killed in ghettos and concentration camps . publication incenses bavaria the polish publication of the book has already raised hackles in germany .
earlier this week , the german state of bavaria said the german embassy in warsaw was looking into what legal action could be taken to block the publication . bavarian finance minister kurt faltlhauser issued a statement saying that the german state , which the victorious world war ii allies designated as the guardian of hitler 's estate , holds the rights to the book and will apply " those rights very restrictively to prevent the spread of nazi ideology . " polish publisher xxl said it wants to make a historical record available .
a first edition was published in polish in 1992 but was withdrawn after claims that it incited racial hatred .
the book is banned from public display or sale in germany although it is available for historical research in libraries . hitler " was n't german " experts , however , say the new polish edition is unlikely to raise legal problems because its foreword puts it in a historical context .
the book includes an introduction by warsaw professor bogdan michalski . " the whole nature of this publication is to serve as a warning for the polish people , " michalski told reuters on thursday .
" we ca n't close our eyes to certain characteristics of our western neighbors , " michalski wrote in the introduction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish publisher marek skierkowski said thursday he did not know the copyright was held by the bavarian government .

the star-studded affair will bring out the cream of tinseltown ... and a few germans with hopes of a prize and a passion for partying " like devils . " the global movie industry will turn its star-struck eyes towards hollywood once more on sunday for oscar night .
the 77th academy awards ceremony is usually quite an insular affair with back-slaps all round for the local talent and those associated with tinseltown productions .
but this year , the germans have a reason to be optimistic , with " der untergang " up for one of the coveted gongs . if " der untergang , " or " the downfall " to give it its english-language release title , gatecrashes the party , it wo n't be the first time for a german film .
in fact , german films have been gaining momentum and respect in hollywood for many years now and caroline link 's " nowhere in africa " snatched the best foreign language film statuette as recently as 2003 . history favors films about nazis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nowhere in africa the odds seem to be in the favor of director oliver hirschbiegel 's depiction of the last days of adolf hitler .
historically , german films with themes realted to the nazis have been very successful on oscar night .
link 's story of german emigrants in africa during world war ii followed the success in 1980 of volker schlöndorff 's wartime masterpiece " die blechtrommel . " regardless of the good omens , hirschbiegel is just happy to be nominated .
" for a filmmaker it is the biggest thing just to be there , this is like olympic gold .
whether we win an oscar or not - we will celebrate like devils , " said the german director . mixed responses from stateside critics in the meantime , under its english-language title , the german film has opened in the united states .
critics have reacted with mixed feelings towards the film .
the influential hollywood reporter - essential reading for many of the academy members - praised the german production highly : " one of the best war films of all time .
a film which can bring new standards in the transference of history onto celluloid . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the downfall -lrb- der untergang -rrb- however , the respected film reviewer a.o. scott of the new york times said the film contained " a reassuring message for the home audience that the germans were , above all , victims of nazism . "
he criticized the manner in which the film presented some figures linked with hitler 's regime and the way it attempted to extract sympathy from the audience . others have said that the film raises questions for all humanity , showing hitler and his cronies as people capable of horrific acts and not the demons of the nazi myth .
this same point has been used to deride the film , with some expressing concerns that humanizing the characters reduces their status as the most heinous criminals of the 20th century . growing global audience and profits the debate around the film has done little to distract audiences from seeing it .
" the downfall " has so far earned $ 40 million worldwide .

the star-studded affair will bring out the cream of tinseltown ... and a few germans with hopes of a prize and a passion for partying " like devils . " the global movie industry will turn its star-struck eyes towards hollywood once more on sunday for oscar night .
the 77th academy awards ceremony is usually quite an insular affair with back-slaps all round for the local talent and those associated with tinseltown productions .
but this year , the germans have a reason to be optimistic , with " der untergang " up for one of the coveted gongs . if " der untergang , " or " the downfall " to give it its english-language release title , gatecrashes the party , it wo n't be the first time for a german film .
in fact , german films have been gaining momentum and respect in hollywood for many years now and caroline link 's " nowhere in africa " snatched the best foreign language film statuette as recently as 2003 . history favors films about nazis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nowhere in africa the odds seem to be in the favor of director oliver hirschbiegel 's depiction of the last days of adolf hitler .
historically , german films with themes realted to the nazis have been very successful on oscar night .
link 's story of german emigrants in africa during world war ii followed the success in 1980 of volker schlöndorff 's wartime masterpiece " die blechtrommel . " regardless of the good omens , hirschbiegel is just happy to be nominated .
" for a filmmaker it is the biggest thing just to be there , this is like olympic gold .
whether we win an oscar or not - we will celebrate like devils , " said the german director . mixed responses from stateside critics in the meantime , under its english-language title , the german film has opened in the united states .
critics have reacted with mixed feelings towards the film .
the influential hollywood reporter - essential reading for many of the academy members - praised the german production highly : " one of the best war films of all time .
a film which can bring new standards in the transference of history onto celluloid . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the downfall -lrb- der untergang -rrb- however , the respected film reviewer a.o. scott of the new york times said the film contained " a reassuring message for the home audience that the germans were , above all , victims of nazism . "
he criticized the manner in which the film presented some figures linked with hitler 's regime and the way it attempted to extract sympathy from the audience . others have said that the film raises questions for all humanity , showing hitler and his cronies as people capable of horrific acts and not the demons of the nazi myth .
this same point has been used to deride the film , with some expressing concerns that humanizing the characters reduces their status as the most heinous criminals of the 20th century . growing global audience and profits the debate around the film has done little to distract audiences from seeing it .
" the downfall " has so far earned $ 40 million worldwide .
however , $ 30 million of that has been earned in germany where 4.6 million viewers have flocked to see it .
the film has also been on general release in france , belgium , the netherlands , poland , austria and switzerland , hungary , finland and spain . while german movie industry voices have been calling producer bernd eichinger " the most important man in german film , " he and his colleague hirschbiegel will have to wait until sunday night to see if they have a tangible accolade to go with all the praise . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a bumper year for german film after years of decline , german film appears to have made a comeback in 2004 .

zones to be sealed off include the area around the us embassy and the district around the presidential palace , the summit venue . president bush arrived in the slovak capital on wednesday evening from mainz , germany , on the final leg of a european tour designed to patch up rifts between the united states and europe over the iraq war .
russian president vladimir putin is due to arrive on thursday morning . questions of democracy events may take on a similar feel to those in europe where outward smiles attempted to hide tensions behind the scenes .
bush has already warned that russia must " renew a commitment to democracy and the rule of law . "
the us leader said tuesday in brussels that he would use his " good personal relationship " with the russian leader to convey his concerns " in a cordial way . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a constructive relationship allows me to remind him that i believe russia is a european country , and european countries embrace those very same values that america embraces , " bush told reporters after meeting with european union leaders . putin has taken a series of actions seen as increasingly autocratic , including moves against the oil giant yukos , a clampdown on the media , new kremlin authority to appoint regional officials and allegedly interfering in ukraine 's presidential elections .
washington is also concerned about russian nuclear cooperation with iran , which us officials accuse of trying to acquire atomic weapons . russian dealings with iran a sore point in mainz on wednesday , bush and german chancellor gerhard schröder united in warning iran against developing a nuclear weapon .
" it 's vital that the iranians hear the world speak with one voice that they should n't have nuclear weapons , " bush said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin had said last week in moscow that russia , which is helping iran build its first nuclear power reactor , was convinced that iran has no intention of making atomic weapons . bush said he had heard some concerns about developments in russia expressed by eu leaders during his talks in brussels , notably formerly soviet baltic states which were among 10 countries to join the eu last year .
" i think it 's very important that president putin hear not only from me in a private way , which he will , but also hears some of the concerns i heard around the table today , " he said . putin defends russian approach but on tuesday , putin told slovak media : " democratic institutions should be adapted to today 's realities in russian life , to our traditions and our history . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin " we are against use of this issue as an instrument for fulfilling foreign policy objectives or for making something amorphous of the russian state , to manipulate in one way or another such a large and important country for international relations , " the russian leader said , according to a transcript released in moscow by the kremlin . " but i do n't think that is the aim of our partners , " he said , stressing that russia made its choice for democracy 14 years ago when the soviet union collapsed not in order to please any other countries " but for ourselves , for our country , for our citizens . " a number of potentially thorny subjects analysts in moscow said however that thursday 's meeting , the second between the two leaders in three months , is unlikely to settle current differences . bush and putin are due to discuss combatting terrorism , sign an accord imposing controls on shoulder-fired missiles , and review events in iraq and north korea as well as russia 's bid to join the world trade organization .

it 's regarded as a global growth market , and one in which german industry hopes to play a part . " white " biotechnology - which uses living cells like moulds , yeasts or bacteria to produce goods and service - has long ceased to be a futuristic concept .
every day , millions of people buy products containing the technology , such as washing powder which contains enzymes to make it more efficient .
these modern detergents work with less water and in lower temperatures , meaning less waste water , and lower energy consumption . it 's a good example of the benefits of white biotechnology , according to fritz brickwedde of the bundesstiftung umwelt , a national foundation for the environment . " we have three goals which we 'd like to see realized alongside white biotechnology - the protection of limited natural resources , the reduction of environmental pollution , and a more efficient means of production , " brickwedde said . political framework the expectations are high .
studies predict that in just a few years , up to a fifth of revenues from the chemical industry worldwide will come from biotech products - a market of over € 300 billion -lrb- $ 396 billion -rrb- .
jürgen hambrecht , president of the chemical industry association , believes it 's important that germany take a leading role in this market . " in the area of white biotechnology , the german chemical industry wants to continue to be a world leader , as we are today , " hambrecht said .
" whether that will happen depends on how the political framework continues to develop .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.02.2005 " white " biotechnology on expansion course großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : detergent production is just one area using white biotechnology unlike " green " biotechnology , the " white " variety is less well known - and less controversial .
it 's regarded as a global growth market , and one in which german industry hopes to play a part . " white " biotechnology - which uses living cells like moulds , yeasts or bacteria to produce goods and service - has long ceased to be a futuristic concept .
every day , millions of people buy products containing the technology , such as washing powder which contains enzymes to make it more efficient .
these modern detergents work with less water and in lower temperatures , meaning less waste water , and lower energy consumption . it 's a good example of the benefits of white biotechnology , according to fritz brickwedde of the bundesstiftung umwelt , a national foundation for the environment . " we have three goals which we 'd like to see realized alongside white biotechnology - the protection of limited natural resources , the reduction of environmental pollution , and a more efficient means of production , " brickwedde said . political framework the expectations are high .
studies predict that in just a few years , up to a fifth of revenues from the chemical industry worldwide will come from biotech products - a market of over € 300 billion -lrb- $ 396 billion -rrb- .
jürgen hambrecht , president of the chemical industry association , believes it 's important that germany take a leading role in this market . " in the area of white biotechnology , the german chemical industry wants to continue to be a world leader , as we are today , " hambrecht said .
" whether that will happen depends on how the political framework continues to develop . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavaria has several fields where genetically modified crops have been planted under strict regulation hambrecht 's concern is with white biotechnology 's sister field , namely , " green " biotechnology , or the planting of genetically manipulated crops .
" we 're dealing with a kind of magic triangle here - green genetic technology , renewable raw materials , and white biotechnology , " he said .
" those who do n't see this certainly wo n't be among those to help usher in the future of this technology . " migration abroad in other words : industry views germany 's laws on genetic technology as overly restrictive .
hambrecht wants to be able to more easily plant genetically modified crops , as only by pursuing this field can the progress of white biotechnology be assured . hambrecht 's main criticism is directed at economics minister wolfgang clement , who responded : " as far as our legislation is concerned , in my view , it is deserving of criticism .
we held a critical discussion , so my assumption is that we 're in the midst of a process which could lead to changes on the laws regarding genetic technology , and in my opinion , should lead to changes . " the chemical industry clearly has a sympathetic ear in clement .
however , the economics minister ca n't speak for the whole government , and especially not for coalition partner , the green party .
after all , the greens harbor the most committed opponents to the cultivation of genetically modified plants . the next assessment of the legislation 's status is due to take place in two years ' time .
the chemical industry is waiting with baited breath .
should the laws not be loosened , hambrecht predicts that german research and development in the biotechnology sector will suffer , adding that it would no longer be possible to rule out a brain drain of german talent to countries with more relaxed legislation . gernot jaeger -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu-us rift remains over biotech food it 's been 10 years since the production of genetically modified crops reached commercial status .

the winter in germany has been cold and the demand for heating oil and gas has risen sharply .
to meet them , german oil and gas companies have had to increase production - abroad . the company names are the same : exxonmobil , bp , total and shell .
the oil and gas multinationals are omnipresent .
in germany , they also have subsidiaries searching for oil and gas reserves both in the country and abroad .
the demand is rising , particularly for natural gas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of kilometers of natural gas pipelines cross throughout germany to end consumers according to statistics from the german gas supplier , verbundnetz gas , natural gas consumption rose 40 percent from 1990 to 2003 in germany .
in the same time period , the use of natural gas for energy purposes increased from 15.4 percent of total energy consumption to 22.5 percent .
the increase creates incentives to tap into new sources .
germany has never been a rich country for natural gas and oil reserves , but one-fifth of the natural gas consumed by germans is german .
but that is changing .
the head of the german oil and gas producer association and director of exxonmobil germany , gernot kalkoffen , said that production in germany is falling due to the depletion of the reserves already present .
international pricing also plays a role .
" the development in germany has fallen because of the strength of the euro and the uncoupling of the gas price from oil , so that in germany , there has n't been a price increase in natural gas for the producers , " explained kalkoffen .
offshore attractive yet complicated as gas and oil reserves drop in germany proper , the producers have had to turn to increasingly more unconventional ways to win fossil fuels , such as extracting so-called tight gas from extremely dense layers of rock .
kalkoffen sees potential there , but offshore drilling in the north sea is also attractive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind parks such as this one in denmark have sprouted up and down the north sea coast yet offshore drilling collides with operators of wind energy parks , and , naturally , environmentalists and german governmental environmental policies .
kalkoffen is still uncertain just what effect the nature reserve status of the north sea coast is going to have on potential drilling there .
on the german greenpeace web site , the demands are clear : no more drilling in the north sea and more renewable energy .
in the meantime , the oil industry is turning to foreign oil and gas to satisfy demand .
in 2004 alone , german natural gas production abroad rose 12 percent , a continuation of the trend in the last few years .
wherever there are reserves , german oil and gas producers are drilling - north africa , libya in particular , north and south america , but also in other parts of europe , such as the states of the former soviet union , said kalkoffen . thomas mösch -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder joins the libya fan club since dismantling its weapons programs , libya has been embraced by the west .

to date , the swastika and other symbols of the national socialist party are banned only in germany and austria .
on thursday , the interior and justice ministers of the 25 eu countries met to discuss the possible ban of all nazi symbols , as well as questions of visa regulation and other timely issues .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-nazi demonstrators in dresden on feb .
12 the ministers decided against a ban on nazi insignia .
at the same time they vowed to reopen talks on combating racism and zenophobia across europe .
britain , denmark opposed danish justice minister lene espersen said the decision was final .
" it is better to drop any discussion on that .
it does not add any value to the proposals , " she told reporters .
" it would only open a long debate on what symbols it should be . "
german justice minister brigitte zypries called the move " regrettable " but admitted that the question of outlawing nazi insignia was less important than ensuring that racism and xenophobia were severely penalized across the european union .
" the central issue for us is to ban expressions -lrb- of racism -rrb- , " she said .
great britain , denmark and other countries spoke against an eu wide regulation on the grounds that it would go against the basic right of free expression .
but the ministers did agree to reanimate a sleeping debate on regulating racism and xenophobia .
in this case , great britain and italy dropped up their blockade-like reaction .
among other things , the agreement would make it punishable by law to deny the holocaust or other crimes against humanity .
regulation on racism but the racism regulation needs to be discussed with the 15 new european union members from eastern europe , a process that is expected to take time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister brigitte zypries zypries -lrb- photo -rrb- warned proponents of the actions that even if it does go into effect , it is not the solution to racism in europe .
" making something punishable by law can only be one part of the fight against neo-fascism .
the most important job is to convince people that neofascist politics must be fought .
above all , that is a job for civil society . "
concerns over freedom of speech the plan to outlaw nazi symbols was first proposed in 2001 , but talks collapsed after resistance from italy 's center-right government .
italian justice minister roberto castelli from the populist northern league , repeated rome 's concerns that the proposals could curtail the freedom of speech .
" i am favorable to reopening the debate , " castelli told reporters thursday .
" but there must be no provisions hampering freedom of speech and the question of symbols has to be tackled because it is very important . "
under the proposals , all eu countries would have to make punishable any attempt to incite violence , discrimination or hatred against any person or group on the basis of race , color , religion , national or ethnic origin .
the plans also seek to ban " condoning , denial or gross trivialization of crimes of genocide " such as the holocaust , which killed more than 6 million jews . bernd riegert -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de calls for eu ban on nazi symbols several german lawmakers have called for a europe-wide ban on nazi insignia following widespread outrage after britain 's prince harry wore a swastika as part of a costume at a high-society gathering .

clement 's ministry had originally calculated that the " hartz iv " labor reforms would cost it € 14.6 billion for an estimated 3.4 million long-term jobless .
now the government will have to pick up the tab of a further € 6.4 billion for the additional 640,000 long-term unemployed . the conservative opposition has already seized upon the issue as proof that chancellor schröder 's government miscalculated the costs of the labor reforms . " the estimates of the government have nothing to do with reality , " dietrich austermann , budgetary spokesman of the christian democrat parliamentary group told daily passauer neuen presse . the free democratic party 's social expert dirk niebel suggested the government deliberately falsified statistics .

the star-studded affair will bring out the cream of tinseltown ... and a few germans with hopes of a prize and a passion for partying " like devils . " the global movie industry will turn its star-struck eyes towards hollywood once more on sunday for oscar night .
the 77th academy awards ceremony is usually quite an insular affair with back-slaps all round for the local talent and those associated with tinseltown productions .
but this year , the germans have a reason to be optimistic , with " der untergang " up for one of the coveted gongs . if " der untergang , " or " the downfall " to give it its english-language release title , gatecrashes the party , it wo n't be the first time for a german film .
in fact , german films have been gaining momentum and respect in hollywood for many years now and caroline link 's " nowhere in africa " snatched the best foreign language film statuette as recently as 2003 . history favors films about nazis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nowhere in africa the odds seem to be in the favor of director oliver hirschbiegel 's depiction of the last days of adolf hitler .
historically , german films with themes realted to the nazis have been very successful on oscar night .
link 's story of german emigrants in africa during world war ii followed the success in 1980 of volker schlöndorff 's wartime masterpiece " die blechtrommel . " regardless of the good omens , hirschbiegel is just happy to be nominated .
" for a filmmaker it is the biggest thing just to be there , this is like olympic gold .
whether we win an oscar or not - we will celebrate like devils , " said the german director . mixed responses from stateside critics in the meantime , under its english-language title , the german film has opened in the united states .
critics have reacted with mixed feelings towards the film .
the influential hollywood reporter - essential reading for many of the academy members - praised the german production highly : " one of the best war films of all time .
a film which can bring new standards in the transference of history onto celluloid . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the downfall -lrb- der untergang -rrb- however , the respected film reviewer a.o. scott of the new york times said the film contained " a reassuring message for the home audience that the germans were , above all , victims of nazism . "
he criticized the manner in which the film presented some figures linked with hitler 's regime and the way it attempted to extract sympathy from the audience . others have said that the film raises questions for all humanity , showing hitler and his cronies as people capable of horrific acts and not the demons of the nazi myth .
this same point has been used to deride the film , with some expressing concerns that humanizing the characters reduces their status as the most heinous criminals of the 20th century . growing global audience and profits the debate around the film has done little to distract audiences from seeing it .
" the downfall " has so far earned $ 40 million worldwide .
however , $ 30 million of that has been earned in germany where 4.6 million viewers have flocked to see it .
the film has also been on general release in france , belgium , the netherlands , poland , austria and switzerland , hungary , finland and spain . while german movie industry voices have been calling producer bernd eichinger " the most important man in german film , " he and his colleague hirschbiegel will have to wait until sunday night to see if they have a tangible accolade to go with all the praise . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a bumper year for german film after years of decline , german film appears to have made a comeback in 2004 .

"
schröder accepts opposition offer of help germany -pipe- 25.02.2005 in coma and looking for work großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's a job waiting at the end are comatose people fit to work ?
german towns grappling with welfare cuts and labor reforms thought so when they registered them with job centers .
but the federal government , facing spiraling costs , is not amused . german chancellor gerhard schröder 's controversial " hartz iv " reforms , which triggered angry protests across the country last year , is once again at the center of a row after a relatively calm couple of months . the reforms , named after peter hartz , personnel director at germany 's biggest carmaker volkswagen , replaces the previous two-tier system of unemployment benefits and welfare support for the long-term unemployed with a single flat-rate payout . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters at an anti-hartz demonstration in brandenburg that means that starting this year people formerly on the dole that are fit to work , are now given handouts by the government in berlin .
however , if they are n't capable of working for whatever reason , then it 's the local authorities in towns and cities who have to shoulder the financial responsibility and pay them welfare benefits . a job for a terminally-ill patient ? this week it emerged that several towns and cities in germany had apparently decided to interpret the new labor regulation to their own advantage to avoid shelling out millions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : local authorities classified more than four million social welfare recipients obviously unfit to work - among them old pensioners , children and terminally ill people with cancer and aids as well as some lying in a coma - as fit to work and registered them last year with job centers . german ard television reported earlier this week of a surprised severely-ill cancer patient who had received a letter from a job center , informing him they had found a job . the news of the abuse has angered german economy and labor minister wolfgang clement , who on thursday described the absurd situation that the fudging of the new reforms had led to . " we 're received calls from health insurance companies telling us that we 're looking for jobs for comatose people , heavy addicts and aids patients , " clement said .
" we 've even realized that in berlin , students and homeless people have been labeled fit to work .
the record at the moment is an 84-year-old man . " insurance companies upset health insurance companies , who are responsible for providing cover to social welfare recipients fit to work , have also been hit by the affair .
the insurance companies receive a flat-payment of € 125 per person from the government in berlin , which only covers a part of the high costs of the health system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hartz iv application form with local authorities and social centers now shirking their healthcare responsibility for people on the dole and unable to take up a job , insurance companies faced with a rising number of seriously-ill jobless patients , are reporting cases of abuse . on thursday , a spokesman for an insurance company in bavaria said that a paraplegic who needed nursing and cost the insurance company € 75,000 a year was now categorized as fit to work as was a cancer patient , who was terminally ill and confined to his bed . towns reject abuse allegations however , local authorities have denied allegations that they deliberately tried to dodge their financial responsibility towards social welfare recipients incapable of working . " we reject the accusation that we illegally tried to do that , " said gerd landsberg , president of the german association of towns and communities , " the law clearly says that those able to work more than three hours are considered fit to work .
and there are definitely aids patients and addicts who can fulfill this criterion , " he said . reports emerged friday that local umbrella associations were aware of the abuse for a long time and that some health insurance companies had written letters to the german economic ministry and the federal labor agency , drawing attention to suspicious cases .
the government is now set to investigate whether it did n't sufficiently examine applicants ' capability of working before sanctioning handouts . exploding costs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : job-seekers in germany meanwhile , the whole affair is expected to blow quite a hole in the federal government 's budget .
clement 's ministry had originally calculated that the " hartz iv " labor reforms would cost it € 14.6 billion for an estimated 3.4 million long-term jobless .
now the government will have to pick up the tab of a further € 6.4 billion for the additional 640,000 long-term unemployed . the conservative opposition has already seized upon the issue as proof that chancellor schröder 's government miscalculated the costs of the labor reforms . " the estimates of the government have nothing to do with reality , " dietrich austermann , budgetary spokesman of the christian democrat parliamentary group told daily passauer neuen presse . the free democratic party 's social expert dirk niebel suggested the government deliberately falsified statistics .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 25.02.2005 bringing the burrito to berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dolores is berlin 's first burrito shop berlin may be famous for its currywurst and döner kebab , but those old fast food standards might soon give way for snacking california-style , as two entrepreneurs aim to show germany what burritos are all about . standing on the corner of rosa luxemburg and münz streets in berlin , one is n't immediately reminded of sunny california .
just a stone 's throw away from the city 's marvel of communist postwar city planning , alexanderplatz , there certainly are n't any palm trees to be found . upon closer inspection , however , one discovers there are avocados aplenty here .
on the window of dolores , berlin 's first and only burrito shop , there 's a stylized logo of the green fruit telling passersby that this is no ordinary german imbiss , or snack bar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dolores owners grischa coenen und philipp krahé .
inside , cartons of the real thing have been mashed up by the shop 's owners , philipp krahé and grischa coenen , to make up a fresh daily batch of what every proper burrito needs : guacamole .
but that 's easier said than done in a city where ripe avocados are hard to come by . " it 's all a matter of organization , " explained the 37-year-old krahé .
" you 've just got to buy them as they are and store them until they 're ready . " avocado wrangling but in their quest to bring a little slice of california to the german capital , avocado wrangling is one of the easier challenges krahé and his 30-year-old partner coenen have had to face .
prior to opening dolores last autumn , the two had to contend with miserly banks and teutonic bureaucracy - a lethal combination for so many of germany 's would-be entrepreneurs . " they put so many obstacles in your way , it 's really hard to believe , " said coenen . he and krahé ploughed through it all as if they were on a mission , which was only fitting , since their shop is named after san francisco 's oldest standing building , the mission dolores .
the neighborhood around the mission is filled with mexican and latino shops and restaurants , but the two actually came up with the idea for their little burrito haven after they met while living in london . although they loved london 's energy , both had become disenchanted with their jobs and they decided to start their own business .
both were also amazed at the innovative and creative types of fast food in britain compared to what was on offer in germany .
it was then that they decided to set up their own stylish gourmet snack bar in berlin . having spent considerable time in california , the two compared notes and decided the city had a burrito gap just crying out to be filled by a fat tortilla stuffed with adobo beef , pinto beans and , yes , guacamole . " i was in california for my job quite a lot and burritos were my favorite thing to eat there , " said coenen , while describing the traditional mexican dish . better than kebab and wurst " the food in san francisco was a dream , " concurred krahé .
" in berlin there 's not much to choose from except for döner and currywurst . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the best berlin could do on its own : the currywurst .
they admitted it was a bit of a risk trying to expand the city 's culinary horizons , but their efforts fine-tuning their recipes with a friend with mexican roots paid off .
the shop has quickly become a sanctuary for californian refugees in berlin - that includes your correspondent - who are tired of the tyranny of kebab and sausage . other foreigners with a hankering for lime chicken and tomatillo salsa have also started making regular pilgrimages .
marc-andré fortier , a 25-year-old from montreal currently studying international economics in berlin , first came to dolores on the recommendation of a friend from colombia .
now he comes whenever he needs a burrito fix . " i guess you could say i 'm quickly on my way to becoming a regular customer .
they 're really quite delicious , " fortier said . surging interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : open wide !
but that 's not to say that berlin 's first burrito imbiss is n't a hit with the locals .
each day around noon , germans crowd in to order from the menu that 's half in english .
if all goes to plan , krahé and coenen hope to make dolores into a chain of shops accross germany . that is n't surprising for gabriele frankemölle , a german food writer who operates web sites on american and mexican cuisine . she said interest in mexican food and its american interpretations had surged in recent years even though it was still quite hard to get authentic mexican ingredients in germany . " i think germans are more familiar with the american take on mexican food , because they 've had it while vacationing in the usa , " frankemölle said , adding a chain of burrito shops could have considerable potential in germany . " it could be quite an advantage that no one else is doing it right now , " she said .

just a stone 's throw away from the city 's marvel of communist postwar city planning , alexanderplatz , there certainly are n't any palm trees to be found . upon closer inspection , however , one discovers there are avocados aplenty here .
on the window of dolores , berlin 's first and only burrito shop , there 's a stylized logo of the green fruit telling passersby that this is no ordinary german imbiss , or snack bar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dolores owners grischa coenen und philipp krahé .
inside , cartons of the real thing have been mashed up by the shop 's owners , philipp krahé and grischa coenen , to make up a fresh daily batch of what every proper burrito needs : guacamole .
but that 's easier said than done in a city where ripe avocados are hard to come by . " it 's all a matter of organization , " explained the 37-year-old krahé .
" you 've just got to buy them as they are and store them until they 're ready . " avocado wrangling but in their quest to bring a little slice of california to the german capital , avocado wrangling is one of the easier challenges krahé and his 30-year-old partner coenen have had to face .
prior to opening dolores last autumn , the two had to contend with miserly banks and teutonic bureaucracy - a lethal combination for so many of germany 's would-be entrepreneurs . " they put so many obstacles in your way , it 's really hard to believe , " said coenen . he and krahé ploughed through it all as if they were on a mission , which was only fitting , since their shop is named after san francisco 's oldest standing building , the mission dolores .
the neighborhood around the mission is filled with mexican and latino shops and restaurants , but the two actually came up with the idea for their little burrito haven after they met while living in london . although they loved london 's energy , both had become disenchanted with their jobs and they decided to start their own business .
both were also amazed at the innovative and creative types of fast food in britain compared to what was on offer in germany .
it was then that they decided to set up their own stylish gourmet snack bar in berlin . having spent considerable time in california , the two compared notes and decided the city had a burrito gap just crying out to be filled by a fat tortilla stuffed with adobo beef , pinto beans and , yes , guacamole . " i was in california for my job quite a lot and burritos were my favorite thing to eat there , " said coenen , while describing the traditional mexican dish . better than kebab and wurst " the food in san francisco was a dream , " concurred krahé .
" in berlin there 's not much to choose from except for döner and currywurst . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the best berlin could do on its own : the currywurst .
they admitted it was a bit of a risk trying to expand the city 's culinary horizons , but their efforts fine-tuning their recipes with a friend with mexican roots paid off .
the shop has quickly become a sanctuary for californian refugees in berlin - that includes your correspondent - who are tired of the tyranny of kebab and sausage . other foreigners with a hankering for lime chicken and tomatillo salsa have also started making regular pilgrimages .
marc-andré fortier , a 25-year-old from montreal currently studying international economics in berlin , first came to dolores on the recommendation of a friend from colombia .
now he comes whenever he needs a burrito fix . " i guess you could say i 'm quickly on my way to becoming a regular customer .
they 're really quite delicious , " fortier said . surging interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : open wide !
but that 's not to say that berlin 's first burrito imbiss is n't a hit with the locals .
each day around noon , germans crowd in to order from the menu that 's half in english .
if all goes to plan , krahé and coenen hope to make dolores into a chain of shops accross germany . that is n't surprising for gabriele frankemölle , a german food writer who operates web sites on american and mexican cuisine . she said interest in mexican food and its american interpretations had surged in recent years even though it was still quite hard to get authentic mexican ingredients in germany . " i think germans are more familiar with the american take on mexican food , because they 've had it while vacationing in the usa , " frankemölle said , adding a chain of burrito shops could have considerable potential in germany .

"
schröder accepts opposition offer of help germany -pipe- 25.02.2005 in coma and looking for work großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's a job waiting at the end are comatose people fit to work ?
german towns grappling with welfare cuts and labor reforms thought so when they registered them with job centers .
but the federal government , facing spiraling costs , is not amused . german chancellor gerhard schröder 's controversial " hartz iv " reforms , which triggered angry protests across the country last year , is once again at the center of a row after a relatively calm couple of months . the reforms , named after peter hartz , personnel director at germany 's biggest carmaker volkswagen , replaces the previous two-tier system of unemployment benefits and welfare support for the long-term unemployed with a single flat-rate payout . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters at an anti-hartz demonstration in brandenburg that means that starting this year people formerly on the dole that are fit to work , are now given handouts by the government in berlin .
however , if they are n't capable of working for whatever reason , then it 's the local authorities in towns and cities who have to shoulder the financial responsibility and pay them welfare benefits . a job for a terminally-ill patient ? this week it emerged that several towns and cities in germany had apparently decided to interpret the new labor regulation to their own advantage to avoid shelling out millions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : local authorities classified more than four million social welfare recipients obviously unfit to work - among them old pensioners , children and terminally ill people with cancer and aids as well as some lying in a coma - as fit to work and registered them last year with job centers . german ard television reported earlier this week of a surprised severely-ill cancer patient who had received a letter from a job center , informing him they had found a job . the news of the abuse has angered german economy and labor minister wolfgang clement , who on thursday described the absurd situation that the fudging of the new reforms had led to . " we 're received calls from health insurance companies telling us that we 're looking for jobs for comatose people , heavy addicts and aids patients , " clement said .
" we 've even realized that in berlin , students and homeless people have been labeled fit to work .
the record at the moment is an 84-year-old man . " insurance companies upset health insurance companies , who are responsible for providing cover to social welfare recipients fit to work , have also been hit by the affair .
the insurance companies receive a flat-payment of € 125 per person from the government in berlin , which only covers a part of the high costs of the health system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hartz iv application form with local authorities and social centers now shirking their healthcare responsibility for people on the dole and unable to take up a job , insurance companies faced with a rising number of seriously-ill jobless patients , are reporting cases of abuse . on thursday , a spokesman for an insurance company in bavaria said that a paraplegic who needed nursing and cost the insurance company € 75,000 a year was now categorized as fit to work as was a cancer patient , who was terminally ill and confined to his bed . towns reject abuse allegations however , local authorities have denied allegations that they deliberately tried to dodge their financial responsibility towards social welfare recipients incapable of working . " we reject the accusation that we illegally tried to do that , " said gerd landsberg , president of the german association of towns and communities , " the law clearly says that those able to work more than three hours are considered fit to work .
and there are definitely aids patients and addicts who can fulfill this criterion , " he said . reports emerged friday that local umbrella associations were aware of the abuse for a long time and that some health insurance companies had written letters to the german economic ministry and the federal labor agency , drawing attention to suspicious cases .
the government is now set to investigate whether it did n't sufficiently examine applicants ' capability of working before sanctioning handouts . exploding costs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : job-seekers in germany meanwhile , the whole affair is expected to blow quite a hole in the federal government 's budget .
clement 's ministry had originally calculated that the " hartz iv " labor reforms would cost it € 14.6 billion for an estimated 3.4 million long-term jobless .
now the government will have to pick up the tab of a further € 6.4 billion for the additional 640,000 long-term unemployed . the conservative opposition has already seized upon the issue as proof that chancellor schröder 's government miscalculated the costs of the labor reforms . " the estimates of the government have nothing to do with reality , " dietrich austermann , budgetary spokesman of the christian democrat parliamentary group told daily passauer neuen presse . the free democratic party 's social expert dirk niebel suggested the government deliberately falsified statistics .

but a senior iranian cleric accused europeans of stalling for time . " the negotiating partners are the three european nations , " iran 's negotiator hassan rowhani said , but " iran would welcome it if the united states helped . " germany , france and britain are seeking to persuade iran to abandon the nuclear fuel cycle that can be used to make atomic weapons , in return for a lucrative economic package .
but the united states suspects iran is developing a nuclear weapon and is skeptical about the progress of the talks with the europeans . white house national security advisor stephen hadley said this week : " the question is how can we help .
it 's not just a question of the carrots and sticks discussion . " rowhani was speaking the day after iran said it opposed any us role in the talks alongside the european union nations .
foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said on thursday that " if the americans joined the talks , the best that could happen is that they would bring nothing to the negotiations and in the worst case scenario they would sabotage everything . " us president george w. bush said in bratislava on thursday , on the final leg of his european trip , that the united states and europe were " on the same page " over iran , which represented his strongest endorsement yet of the eu talks .
washington still wants to bring iran before the un security council for possible sanctions . refusal to abandon enrichment the europeans are trying , however , to persuade iran to comply with international obligations in return for trade , security and technology deals .
iran insists its nuclear program is a peaceful effort to make electricity but refuses to abandon uranium enrichment , saying it has the right to carry out enrichment under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- . meanwhile , a senior iranian cleric on friday accused europeans of stalling for time in their negotiations over iran 's nuclear program and pledged that iran will resume uranium enrichment if negotiations break down . " europeans are killing time ; negotiations are going on but the achievement we expected has not been reached yet . " said ayatollah ahmad janati , a hardline cleric who heads the powerful watchdog body that vets all legislation and candidates for public office . " we will wait for a while and if the negotiations do not reach the desired result , we will resume our work -lrb- uranium enrichment -rrb- . "
janati said in a weekly prayer sermon broadcast live on state radio .
" they must not hope they can go on with suspension until enrichment is stopped .
europeans must not be acting under america 's pressure , " janati said . dw staff / afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu says strike on iran a mistake a military strike against iran ’ s nuclear facilities would be a “ mistake , ” the european union ’ s foreign policy chief javier solana said and stressed the importance of continuing eu efforts at diplomatic engagement .

"
schröder accepts opposition offer of help germany -pipe- 25.02.2005 in coma and looking for work großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's a job waiting at the end are comatose people fit to work ?
german towns grappling with welfare cuts and labor reforms thought so when they registered them with job centers .
but the federal government , facing spiraling costs , is not amused . german chancellor gerhard schröder 's controversial " hartz iv " reforms , which triggered angry protests across the country last year , is once again at the center of a row after a relatively calm couple of months . the reforms , named after peter hartz , personnel director at germany 's biggest carmaker volkswagen , replaces the previous two-tier system of unemployment benefits and welfare support for the long-term unemployed with a single flat-rate payout . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters at an anti-hartz demonstration in brandenburg that means that starting this year people formerly on the dole that are fit to work , are now given handouts by the government in berlin .
however , if they are n't capable of working for whatever reason , then it 's the local authorities in towns and cities who have to shoulder the financial responsibility and pay them welfare benefits . a job for a terminally-ill patient ? this week it emerged that several towns and cities in germany had apparently decided to interpret the new labor regulation to their own advantage to avoid shelling out millions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : local authorities classified more than four million social welfare recipients obviously unfit to work - among them old pensioners , children and terminally ill people with cancer and aids as well as some lying in a coma - as fit to work and registered them last year with job centers . german ard television reported earlier this week of a surprised severely-ill cancer patient who had received a letter from a job center , informing him they had found a job . the news of the abuse has angered german economy and labor minister wolfgang clement , who on thursday described the absurd situation that the fudging of the new reforms had led to . " we 're received calls from health insurance companies telling us that we 're looking for jobs for comatose people , heavy addicts and aids patients , " clement said .
" we 've even realized that in berlin , students and homeless people have been labeled fit to work .
the record at the moment is an 84-year-old man . " insurance companies upset health insurance companies , who are responsible for providing cover to social welfare recipients fit to work , have also been hit by the affair .
the insurance companies receive a flat-payment of € 125 per person from the government in berlin , which only covers a part of the high costs of the health system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hartz iv application form with local authorities and social centers now shirking their healthcare responsibility for people on the dole and unable to take up a job , insurance companies faced with a rising number of seriously-ill jobless patients , are reporting cases of abuse . on thursday , a spokesman for an insurance company in bavaria said that a paraplegic who needed nursing and cost the insurance company € 75,000 a year was now categorized as fit to work as was a cancer patient , who was terminally ill and confined to his bed . towns reject abuse allegations however , local authorities have denied allegations that they deliberately tried to dodge their financial responsibility towards social welfare recipients incapable of working . " we reject the accusation that we illegally tried to do that , " said gerd landsberg , president of the german association of towns and communities , " the law clearly says that those able to work more than three hours are considered fit to work .
and there are definitely aids patients and addicts who can fulfill this criterion , " he said . reports emerged friday that local umbrella associations were aware of the abuse for a long time and that some health insurance companies had written letters to the german economic ministry and the federal labor agency , drawing attention to suspicious cases .
the government is now set to investigate whether it did n't sufficiently examine applicants ' capability of working before sanctioning handouts . exploding costs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : job-seekers in germany meanwhile , the whole affair is expected to blow quite a hole in the federal government 's budget .
clement 's ministry had originally calculated that the " hartz iv " labor reforms would cost it € 14.6 billion for an estimated 3.4 million long-term jobless .
now the government will have to pick up the tab of a further € 6.4 billion for the additional 640,000 long-term unemployed . the conservative opposition has already seized upon the issue as proof that chancellor schröder 's government miscalculated the costs of the labor reforms . " the estimates of the government have nothing to do with reality , " dietrich austermann , budgetary spokesman of the christian democrat parliamentary group told daily passauer neuen presse . the free democratic party 's social expert dirk niebel suggested the government deliberately falsified statistics .
" clement is just hiding behind coma patients and paraplegics , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reform opponents ponder " what now ? "

inside , cartons of the real thing have been mashed up by the shop 's owners , philipp krahé and grischa coenen , to make up a fresh daily batch of what every proper burrito needs : guacamole .
but that 's easier said than done in a city where ripe avocados are hard to come by . " it 's all a matter of organization , " explained the 37-year-old krahé .

" they put so many obstacles in your way , it 's really hard to believe , " said coenen . he and krahé ploughed through it all as if they were on a mission , which was only fitting , since their shop is named after san francisco 's oldest standing building , the mission dolores .

it was then that they decided to set up their own stylish gourmet snack bar in berlin . having spent considerable time in california , the two compared notes and decided the city had a burrito gap just crying out to be filled by a fat tortilla stuffed with adobo beef , pinto beans and , yes , guacamole . " i was in california for my job quite a lot and burritos were my favorite thing to eat there , " said coenen , while describing the traditional mexican dish . better than kebab and wurst " the food in san francisco was a dream , " concurred krahé .
" in berlin there 's not much to choose from except for döner and currywurst . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the best berlin could do on its own : the currywurst .
they admitted it was a bit of a risk trying to expand the city 's culinary horizons , but their efforts fine-tuning their recipes with a friend with mexican roots paid off .
the shop has quickly become a sanctuary for californian refugees in berlin - that includes your correspondent - who are tired of the tyranny of kebab and sausage . other foreigners with a hankering for lime chicken and tomatillo salsa have also started making regular pilgrimages .
marc-andré fortier , a 25-year-old from montreal currently studying international economics in berlin , first came to dolores on the recommendation of a friend from colombia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 25.02.2005 bringing the burrito to berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dolores is berlin 's first burrito shop berlin may be famous for its currywurst and döner kebab , but those old fast food standards might soon give way for snacking california-style , as two entrepreneurs aim to show germany what burritos are all about . standing on the corner of rosa luxemburg and münz streets in berlin , one is n't immediately reminded of sunny california .
just a stone 's throw away from the city 's marvel of communist postwar city planning , alexanderplatz , there certainly are n't any palm trees to be found . upon closer inspection , however , one discovers there are avocados aplenty here .
on the window of dolores , berlin 's first and only burrito shop , there 's a stylized logo of the green fruit telling passersby that this is no ordinary german imbiss , or snack bar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dolores owners grischa coenen und philipp krahé .
inside , cartons of the real thing have been mashed up by the shop 's owners , philipp krahé and grischa coenen , to make up a fresh daily batch of what every proper burrito needs : guacamole .
but that 's easier said than done in a city where ripe avocados are hard to come by . " it 's all a matter of organization , " explained the 37-year-old krahé .
" you 've just got to buy them as they are and store them until they 're ready . " avocado wrangling but in their quest to bring a little slice of california to the german capital , avocado wrangling is one of the easier challenges krahé and his 30-year-old partner coenen have had to face .
prior to opening dolores last autumn , the two had to contend with miserly banks and teutonic bureaucracy - a lethal combination for so many of germany 's would-be entrepreneurs . " they put so many obstacles in your way , it 's really hard to believe , " said coenen . he and krahé ploughed through it all as if they were on a mission , which was only fitting , since their shop is named after san francisco 's oldest standing building , the mission dolores .
the neighborhood around the mission is filled with mexican and latino shops and restaurants , but the two actually came up with the idea for their little burrito haven after they met while living in london . although they loved london 's energy , both had become disenchanted with their jobs and they decided to start their own business .
both were also amazed at the innovative and creative types of fast food in britain compared to what was on offer in germany .
it was then that they decided to set up their own stylish gourmet snack bar in berlin . having spent considerable time in california , the two compared notes and decided the city had a burrito gap just crying out to be filled by a fat tortilla stuffed with adobo beef , pinto beans and , yes , guacamole . " i was in california for my job quite a lot and burritos were my favorite thing to eat there , " said coenen , while describing the traditional mexican dish . better than kebab and wurst " the food in san francisco was a dream , " concurred krahé .
" in berlin there 's not much to choose from except for döner and currywurst . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the best berlin could do on its own : the currywurst .
they admitted it was a bit of a risk trying to expand the city 's culinary horizons , but their efforts fine-tuning their recipes with a friend with mexican roots paid off .
the shop has quickly become a sanctuary for californian refugees in berlin - that includes your correspondent - who are tired of the tyranny of kebab and sausage . other foreigners with a hankering for lime chicken and tomatillo salsa have also started making regular pilgrimages .
marc-andré fortier , a 25-year-old from montreal currently studying international economics in berlin , first came to dolores on the recommendation of a friend from colombia .
now he comes whenever he needs a burrito fix . " i guess you could say i 'm quickly on my way to becoming a regular customer .
they 're really quite delicious , " fortier said . surging interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : open wide !
but that 's not to say that berlin 's first burrito imbiss is n't a hit with the locals .
each day around noon , germans crowd in to order from the menu that 's half in english .
if all goes to plan , krahé and coenen hope to make dolores into a chain of shops accross germany . that is n't surprising for gabriele frankemölle , a german food writer who operates web sites on american and mexican cuisine . she said interest in mexican food and its american interpretations had surged in recent years even though it was still quite hard to get authentic mexican ingredients in germany . " i think germans are more familiar with the american take on mexican food , because they 've had it while vacationing in the usa , " frankemölle said , adding a chain of burrito shops could have considerable potential in germany . " it could be quite an advantage that no one else is doing it right now , " she said .

the winter in germany has been cold and the demand for heating oil and gas has risen sharply .
to meet them , german oil and gas companies have had to increase production - abroad . the company names are the same : exxonmobil , bp , total and shell .
the oil and gas multinationals are omnipresent .
in germany , they also have subsidiaries searching for oil and gas reserves both in the country and abroad .
the demand is rising , particularly for natural gas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of kilometers of natural gas pipelines cross throughout germany to end consumers according to statistics from the german gas supplier , verbundnetz gas , natural gas consumption rose 40 percent from 1990 to 2003 in germany .
in the same time period , the use of natural gas for energy purposes increased from 15.4 percent of total energy consumption to 22.5 percent .
the increase creates incentives to tap into new sources .
germany has never been a rich country for natural gas and oil reserves , but one-fifth of the natural gas consumed by germans is german .
but that is changing .
the head of the german oil and gas producer association and director of exxonmobil germany , gernot kalkoffen , said that production in germany is falling due to the depletion of the reserves already present .
international pricing also plays a role .
" the development in germany has fallen because of the strength of the euro and the uncoupling of the gas price from oil , so that in germany , there has n't been a price increase in natural gas for the producers , " explained kalkoffen .
offshore attractive yet complicated as gas and oil reserves drop in germany proper , the producers have had to turn to increasingly more unconventional ways to win fossil fuels , such as extracting so-called tight gas from extremely dense layers of rock .
kalkoffen sees potential there , but offshore drilling in the north sea is also attractive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind parks such as this one in denmark have sprouted up and down the north sea coast yet offshore drilling collides with operators of wind energy parks , and , naturally , environmentalists and german governmental environmental policies .
kalkoffen is still uncertain just what effect the nature reserve status of the north sea coast is going to have on potential drilling there .
on the german greenpeace web site , the demands are clear : no more drilling in the north sea and more renewable energy .
in the meantime , the oil industry is turning to foreign oil and gas to satisfy demand .
in 2004 alone , german natural gas production abroad rose 12 percent , a continuation of the trend in the last few years .
wherever there are reserves , german oil and gas producers are drilling - north africa , libya in particular , north and south america , but also in other parts of europe , such as the states of the former soviet union , said kalkoffen . thomas mösch -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder joins the libya fan club since dismantling its weapons programs , libya has been embraced by the west .

to date , the swastika and other symbols of the national socialist party are banned only in germany and austria .
on thursday , the interior and justice ministers of the 25 eu countries met to discuss the possible ban of all nazi symbols , as well as questions of visa regulation and other timely issues .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-nazi demonstrators in dresden on feb .
12 the ministers decided against a ban on nazi insignia .
at the same time they vowed to reopen talks on combating racism and zenophobia across europe .
britain , denmark opposed danish justice minister lene espersen said the decision was final .
" it is better to drop any discussion on that .
it does not add any value to the proposals , " she told reporters .
" it would only open a long debate on what symbols it should be . "
german justice minister brigitte zypries called the move " regrettable " but admitted that the question of outlawing nazi insignia was less important than ensuring that racism and xenophobia were severely penalized across the european union .
" the central issue for us is to ban expressions -lrb- of racism -rrb- , " she said .
great britain , denmark and other countries spoke against an eu wide regulation on the grounds that it would go against the basic right of free expression .
but the ministers did agree to reanimate a sleeping debate on regulating racism and xenophobia .
in this case , great britain and italy dropped up their blockade-like reaction .
among other things , the agreement would make it punishable by law to deny the holocaust or other crimes against humanity .
regulation on racism but the racism regulation needs to be discussed with the 15 new european union members from eastern europe , a process that is expected to take time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister brigitte zypries zypries -lrb- photo -rrb- warned proponents of the actions that even if it does go into effect , it is not the solution to racism in europe .
" making something punishable by law can only be one part of the fight against neo-fascism .
the most important job is to convince people that neofascist politics must be fought .
above all , that is a job for civil society . "
concerns over freedom of speech the plan to outlaw nazi symbols was first proposed in 2001 , but talks collapsed after resistance from italy 's center-right government .
italian justice minister roberto castelli from the populist northern league , repeated rome 's concerns that the proposals could curtail the freedom of speech .
" i am favorable to reopening the debate , " castelli told reporters thursday .
" but there must be no provisions hampering freedom of speech and the question of symbols has to be tackled because it is very important . "
under the proposals , all eu countries would have to make punishable any attempt to incite violence , discrimination or hatred against any person or group on the basis of race , color , religion , national or ethnic origin .
the plans also seek to ban " condoning , denial or gross trivialization of crimes of genocide " such as the holocaust , which killed more than 6 million jews . bernd riegert -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de calls for eu ban on nazi symbols several german lawmakers have called for a europe-wide ban on nazi insignia following widespread outrage after britain 's prince harry wore a swastika as part of a costume at a high-society gathering .

to date , the swastika and other symbols of the national socialist party are banned only in germany and austria .
on thursday , the interior and justice ministers of the 25 eu countries met to discuss the possible ban of all nazi symbols , as well as questions of visa regulation and other timely issues .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-nazi demonstrators in dresden on feb .
12 the ministers decided against a ban on nazi insignia .
at the same time they vowed to reopen talks on combating racism and zenophobia across europe .
britain , denmark opposed danish justice minister lene espersen said the decision was final .
" it is better to drop any discussion on that .
it does not add any value to the proposals , " she told reporters .
" it would only open a long debate on what symbols it should be . "
german justice minister brigitte zypries called the move " regrettable " but admitted that the question of outlawing nazi insignia was less important than ensuring that racism and xenophobia were severely penalized across the european union .
" the central issue for us is to ban expressions -lrb- of racism -rrb- , " she said .
great britain , denmark and other countries spoke against an eu wide regulation on the grounds that it would go against the basic right of free expression .
but the ministers did agree to reanimate a sleeping debate on regulating racism and xenophobia .
in this case , great britain and italy dropped up their blockade-like reaction .
among other things , the agreement would make it punishable by law to deny the holocaust or other crimes against humanity .
regulation on racism but the racism regulation needs to be discussed with the 15 new european union members from eastern europe , a process that is expected to take time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister brigitte zypries zypries -lrb- photo -rrb- warned proponents of the actions that even if it does go into effect , it is not the solution to racism in europe .
" making something punishable by law can only be one part of the fight against neo-fascism .
the most important job is to convince people that neofascist politics must be fought .
above all , that is a job for civil society . "
concerns over freedom of speech the plan to outlaw nazi symbols was first proposed in 2001 , but talks collapsed after resistance from italy 's center-right government .
italian justice minister roberto castelli from the populist northern league , repeated rome 's concerns that the proposals could curtail the freedom of speech .
" i am favorable to reopening the debate , " castelli told reporters thursday .
" but there must be no provisions hampering freedom of speech and the question of symbols has to be tackled because it is very important . "
under the proposals , all eu countries would have to make punishable any attempt to incite violence , discrimination or hatred against any person or group on the basis of race , color , religion , national or ethnic origin .
the plans also seek to ban " condoning , denial or gross trivialization of crimes of genocide " such as the holocaust , which killed more than 6 million jews . bernd riegert -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de calls for eu ban on nazi symbols several german lawmakers have called for a europe-wide ban on nazi insignia following widespread outrage after britain 's prince harry wore a swastika as part of a costume at a high-society gathering .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.02.2005 energy firms seek new german sources großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a potential scene on germany 's north sea coast ?
the winter in germany has been cold and the demand for heating oil and gas has risen sharply .
to meet them , german oil and gas companies have had to increase production - abroad . the company names are the same : exxonmobil , bp , total and shell .
the oil and gas multinationals are omnipresent .
in germany , they also have subsidiaries searching for oil and gas reserves both in the country and abroad .
the demand is rising , particularly for natural gas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of kilometers of natural gas pipelines cross throughout germany to end consumers according to statistics from the german gas supplier , verbundnetz gas , natural gas consumption rose 40 percent from 1990 to 2003 in germany .
in the same time period , the use of natural gas for energy purposes increased from 15.4 percent of total energy consumption to 22.5 percent .
the increase creates incentives to tap into new sources .
germany has never been a rich country for natural gas and oil reserves , but one-fifth of the natural gas consumed by germans is german .
but that is changing .
the head of the german oil and gas producer association and director of exxonmobil germany , gernot kalkoffen , said that production in germany is falling due to the depletion of the reserves already present .
international pricing also plays a role .
" the development in germany has fallen because of the strength of the euro and the uncoupling of the gas price from oil , so that in germany , there has n't been a price increase in natural gas for the producers , " explained kalkoffen .
offshore attractive yet complicated as gas and oil reserves drop in germany proper , the producers have had to turn to increasingly more unconventional ways to win fossil fuels , such as extracting so-called tight gas from extremely dense layers of rock .
kalkoffen sees potential there , but offshore drilling in the north sea is also attractive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind parks such as this one in denmark have sprouted up and down the north sea coast yet offshore drilling collides with operators of wind energy parks , and , naturally , environmentalists and german governmental environmental policies .
kalkoffen is still uncertain just what effect the nature reserve status of the north sea coast is going to have on potential drilling there .
on the german greenpeace web site , the demands are clear : no more drilling in the north sea and more renewable energy .
in the meantime , the oil industry is turning to foreign oil and gas to satisfy demand .
in 2004 alone , german natural gas production abroad rose 12 percent , a continuation of the trend in the last few years .
wherever there are reserves , german oil and gas producers are drilling - north africa , libya in particular , north and south america , but also in other parts of europe , such as the states of the former soviet union , said kalkoffen . thomas mösch -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder joins the libya fan club since dismantling its weapons programs , libya has been embraced by the west .

zones to be sealed off include the area around the us embassy and the district around the presidential palace , the summit venue . president bush arrived in the slovak capital on wednesday evening from mainz , germany , on the final leg of a european tour designed to patch up rifts between the united states and europe over the iraq war .
russian president vladimir putin is due to arrive on thursday morning . questions of democracy events may take on a similar feel to those in europe where outward smiles attempted to hide tensions behind the scenes .
bush has already warned that russia must " renew a commitment to democracy and the rule of law . "
the us leader said tuesday in brussels that he would use his " good personal relationship " with the russian leader to convey his concerns " in a cordial way . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a constructive relationship allows me to remind him that i believe russia is a european country , and european countries embrace those very same values that america embraces , " bush told reporters after meeting with european union leaders . putin has taken a series of actions seen as increasingly autocratic , including moves against the oil giant yukos , a clampdown on the media , new kremlin authority to appoint regional officials and allegedly interfering in ukraine 's presidential elections .
washington is also concerned about russian nuclear cooperation with iran , which us officials accuse of trying to acquire atomic weapons . russian dealings with iran a sore point in mainz on wednesday , bush and german chancellor gerhard schröder united in warning iran against developing a nuclear weapon .
" it 's vital that the iranians hear the world speak with one voice that they should n't have nuclear weapons , " bush said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin had said last week in moscow that russia , which is helping iran build its first nuclear power reactor , was convinced that iran has no intention of making atomic weapons . bush said he had heard some concerns about developments in russia expressed by eu leaders during his talks in brussels , notably formerly soviet baltic states which were among 10 countries to join the eu last year .
" i think it 's very important that president putin hear not only from me in a private way , which he will , but also hears some of the concerns i heard around the table today , " he said . putin defends russian approach but on tuesday , putin told slovak media : " democratic institutions should be adapted to today 's realities in russian life , to our traditions and our history . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin " we are against use of this issue as an instrument for fulfilling foreign policy objectives or for making something amorphous of the russian state , to manipulate in one way or another such a large and important country for international relations , " the russian leader said , according to a transcript released in moscow by the kremlin . " but i do n't think that is the aim of our partners , " he said , stressing that russia made its choice for democracy 14 years ago when the soviet union collapsed not in order to please any other countries " but for ourselves , for our country , for our citizens . " a number of potentially thorny subjects analysts in moscow said however that thursday 's meeting , the second between the two leaders in three months , is unlikely to settle current differences . bush and putin are due to discuss combatting terrorism , sign an accord imposing controls on shoulder-fired missiles , and review events in iraq and north korea as well as russia 's bid to join the world trade organization .

to date , the swastika and other symbols of the national socialist party are banned only in germany and austria .
on thursday , the interior and justice ministers of the 25 eu countries met to discuss the possible ban of all nazi symbols , as well as questions of visa regulation and other timely issues .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-nazi demonstrators in dresden on feb .
12 the ministers decided against a ban on nazi insignia .
at the same time they vowed to reopen talks on combating racism and zenophobia across europe .
britain , denmark opposed danish justice minister lene espersen said the decision was final .
" it is better to drop any discussion on that .
it does not add any value to the proposals , " she told reporters .
" it would only open a long debate on what symbols it should be . "
german justice minister brigitte zypries called the move " regrettable " but admitted that the question of outlawing nazi insignia was less important than ensuring that racism and xenophobia were severely penalized across the european union .
" the central issue for us is to ban expressions -lrb- of racism -rrb- , " she said .
great britain , denmark and other countries spoke against an eu wide regulation on the grounds that it would go against the basic right of free expression .
but the ministers did agree to reanimate a sleeping debate on regulating racism and xenophobia .
in this case , great britain and italy dropped up their blockade-like reaction .
among other things , the agreement would make it punishable by law to deny the holocaust or other crimes against humanity .
regulation on racism but the racism regulation needs to be discussed with the 15 new european union members from eastern europe , a process that is expected to take time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister brigitte zypries zypries -lrb- photo -rrb- warned proponents of the actions that even if it does go into effect , it is not the solution to racism in europe .
" making something punishable by law can only be one part of the fight against neo-fascism .
the most important job is to convince people that neofascist politics must be fought .
above all , that is a job for civil society . "
concerns over freedom of speech the plan to outlaw nazi symbols was first proposed in 2001 , but talks collapsed after resistance from italy 's center-right government .
italian justice minister roberto castelli from the populist northern league , repeated rome 's concerns that the proposals could curtail the freedom of speech .
" i am favorable to reopening the debate , " castelli told reporters thursday .
" but there must be no provisions hampering freedom of speech and the question of symbols has to be tackled because it is very important . "
under the proposals , all eu countries would have to make punishable any attempt to incite violence , discrimination or hatred against any person or group on the basis of race , color , religion , national or ethnic origin .
the plans also seek to ban " condoning , denial or gross trivialization of crimes of genocide " such as the holocaust , which killed more than 6 million jews . bernd riegert -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de calls for eu ban on nazi symbols several german lawmakers have called for a europe-wide ban on nazi insignia following widespread outrage after britain 's prince harry wore a swastika as part of a costume at a high-society gathering .

to date , the swastika and other symbols of the national socialist party are banned only in germany and austria .
on thursday , the interior and justice ministers of the 25 eu countries met to discuss the possible ban of all nazi symbols , as well as questions of visa regulation and other timely issues .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-nazi demonstrators in dresden on feb .
12 the ministers decided against a ban on nazi insignia .
at the same time they vowed to reopen talks on combating racism and zenophobia across europe .
britain , denmark opposed danish justice minister lene espersen said the decision was final .
" it is better to drop any discussion on that .
it does not add any value to the proposals , " she told reporters .
" it would only open a long debate on what symbols it should be . "
german justice minister brigitte zypries called the move " regrettable " but admitted that the question of outlawing nazi insignia was less important than ensuring that racism and xenophobia were severely penalized across the european union .
" the central issue for us is to ban expressions -lrb- of racism -rrb- , " she said .
great britain , denmark and other countries spoke against an eu wide regulation on the grounds that it would go against the basic right of free expression .
but the ministers did agree to reanimate a sleeping debate on regulating racism and xenophobia .
in this case , great britain and italy dropped up their blockade-like reaction .
among other things , the agreement would make it punishable by law to deny the holocaust or other crimes against humanity .
regulation on racism but the racism regulation needs to be discussed with the 15 new european union members from eastern europe , a process that is expected to take time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister brigitte zypries zypries -lrb- photo -rrb- warned proponents of the actions that even if it does go into effect , it is not the solution to racism in europe .
" making something punishable by law can only be one part of the fight against neo-fascism .
the most important job is to convince people that neofascist politics must be fought .
above all , that is a job for civil society . "
concerns over freedom of speech the plan to outlaw nazi symbols was first proposed in 2001 , but talks collapsed after resistance from italy 's center-right government .
italian justice minister roberto castelli from the populist northern league , repeated rome 's concerns that the proposals could curtail the freedom of speech .
" i am favorable to reopening the debate , " castelli told reporters thursday .
" but there must be no provisions hampering freedom of speech and the question of symbols has to be tackled because it is very important . "
under the proposals , all eu countries would have to make punishable any attempt to incite violence , discrimination or hatred against any person or group on the basis of race , color , religion , national or ethnic origin .
the plans also seek to ban " condoning , denial or gross trivialization of crimes of genocide " such as the holocaust , which killed more than 6 million jews . bernd riegert -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de calls for eu ban on nazi symbols several german lawmakers have called for a europe-wide ban on nazi insignia following widespread outrage after britain 's prince harry wore a swastika as part of a costume at a high-society gathering .

just a stone 's throw away from the city 's marvel of communist postwar city planning , alexanderplatz , there certainly are n't any palm trees to be found . upon closer inspection , however , one discovers there are avocados aplenty here .
on the window of dolores , berlin 's first and only burrito shop , there 's a stylized logo of the green fruit telling passersby that this is no ordinary german imbiss , or snack bar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dolores owners grischa coenen und philipp krahé .
inside , cartons of the real thing have been mashed up by the shop 's owners , philipp krahé and grischa coenen , to make up a fresh daily batch of what every proper burrito needs : guacamole .
but that 's easier said than done in a city where ripe avocados are hard to come by . " it 's all a matter of organization , " explained the 37-year-old krahé .
" you 've just got to buy them as they are and store them until they 're ready . " avocado wrangling but in their quest to bring a little slice of california to the german capital , avocado wrangling is one of the easier challenges krahé and his 30-year-old partner coenen have had to face .
prior to opening dolores last autumn , the two had to contend with miserly banks and teutonic bureaucracy - a lethal combination for so many of germany 's would-be entrepreneurs . " they put so many obstacles in your way , it 's really hard to believe , " said coenen . he and krahé ploughed through it all as if they were on a mission , which was only fitting , since their shop is named after san francisco 's oldest standing building , the mission dolores .

both were also amazed at the innovative and creative types of fast food in britain compared to what was on offer in germany .
it was then that they decided to set up their own stylish gourmet snack bar in berlin . having spent considerable time in california , the two compared notes and decided the city had a burrito gap just crying out to be filled by a fat tortilla stuffed with adobo beef , pinto beans and , yes , guacamole . " i was in california for my job quite a lot and burritos were my favorite thing to eat there , " said coenen , while describing the traditional mexican dish . better than kebab and wurst " the food in san francisco was a dream , " concurred krahé .

they admitted it was a bit of a risk trying to expand the city 's culinary horizons , but their efforts fine-tuning their recipes with a friend with mexican roots paid off .

marc-andré fortier , a 25-year-old from montreal currently studying international economics in berlin , first came to dolores on the recommendation of a friend from colombia .

but that 's easier said than done in a city where ripe avocados are hard to come by . " it 's all a matter of organization , " explained the 37-year-old krahé .
" you 've just got to buy them as they are and store them until they 're ready . " avocado wrangling but in their quest to bring a little slice of california to the german capital , avocado wrangling is one of the easier challenges krahé and his 30-year-old partner coenen have had to face .
prior to opening dolores last autumn , the two had to contend with miserly banks and teutonic bureaucracy - a lethal combination for so many of germany 's would-be entrepreneurs . " they put so many obstacles in your way , it 's really hard to believe , " said coenen . he and krahé ploughed through it all as if they were on a mission , which was only fitting , since their shop is named after san francisco 's oldest standing building , the mission dolores .
the neighborhood around the mission is filled with mexican and latino shops and restaurants , but the two actually came up with the idea for their little burrito haven after they met while living in london . although they loved london 's energy , both had become disenchanted with their jobs and they decided to start their own business .
both were also amazed at the innovative and creative types of fast food in britain compared to what was on offer in germany .
it was then that they decided to set up their own stylish gourmet snack bar in berlin . having spent considerable time in california , the two compared notes and decided the city had a burrito gap just crying out to be filled by a fat tortilla stuffed with adobo beef , pinto beans and , yes , guacamole . " i was in california for my job quite a lot and burritos were my favorite thing to eat there , " said coenen , while describing the traditional mexican dish . better than kebab and wurst " the food in san francisco was a dream , " concurred krahé .
" in berlin there 's not much to choose from except for döner and currywurst . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the best berlin could do on its own : the currywurst .
they admitted it was a bit of a risk trying to expand the city 's culinary horizons , but their efforts fine-tuning their recipes with a friend with mexican roots paid off .
the shop has quickly become a sanctuary for californian refugees in berlin - that includes your correspondent - who are tired of the tyranny of kebab and sausage . other foreigners with a hankering for lime chicken and tomatillo salsa have also started making regular pilgrimages .
marc-andré fortier , a 25-year-old from montreal currently studying international economics in berlin , first came to dolores on the recommendation of a friend from colombia .
now he comes whenever he needs a burrito fix . " i guess you could say i 'm quickly on my way to becoming a regular customer .
they 're really quite delicious , " fortier said . surging interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : open wide !
but that 's not to say that berlin 's first burrito imbiss is n't a hit with the locals .
each day around noon , germans crowd in to order from the menu that 's half in english .
if all goes to plan , krahé and coenen hope to make dolores into a chain of shops accross germany . that is n't surprising for gabriele frankemölle , a german food writer who operates web sites on american and mexican cuisine . she said interest in mexican food and its american interpretations had surged in recent years even though it was still quite hard to get authentic mexican ingredients in germany . " i think germans are more familiar with the american take on mexican food , because they 've had it while vacationing in the usa , " frankemölle said , adding a chain of burrito shops could have considerable potential in germany .

to date , the swastika and other symbols of the national socialist party are banned only in germany and austria .
on thursday , the interior and justice ministers of the 25 eu countries met to discuss the possible ban of all nazi symbols , as well as questions of visa regulation and other timely issues .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-nazi demonstrators in dresden on feb .
12 the ministers decided against a ban on nazi insignia .
at the same time they vowed to reopen talks on combating racism and zenophobia across europe .
britain , denmark opposed danish justice minister lene espersen said the decision was final .
" it is better to drop any discussion on that .
it does not add any value to the proposals , " she told reporters .
" it would only open a long debate on what symbols it should be . "
german justice minister brigitte zypries called the move " regrettable " but admitted that the question of outlawing nazi insignia was less important than ensuring that racism and xenophobia were severely penalized across the european union .
" the central issue for us is to ban expressions -lrb- of racism -rrb- , " she said .
great britain , denmark and other countries spoke against an eu wide regulation on the grounds that it would go against the basic right of free expression .
but the ministers did agree to reanimate a sleeping debate on regulating racism and xenophobia .
in this case , great britain and italy dropped up their blockade-like reaction .
among other things , the agreement would make it punishable by law to deny the holocaust or other crimes against humanity .

italian justice minister roberto castelli from the populist northern league , repeated rome 's concerns that the proposals could curtail the freedom of speech .
" i am favorable to reopening the debate , " castelli told reporters thursday .
" but there must be no provisions hampering freedom of speech and the question of symbols has to be tackled because it is very important . "
under the proposals , all eu countries would have to make punishable any attempt to incite violence , discrimination or hatred against any person or group on the basis of race , color , religion , national or ethnic origin .

to date , the swastika and other symbols of the national socialist party are banned only in germany and austria .
on thursday , the interior and justice ministers of the 25 eu countries met to discuss the possible ban of all nazi symbols , as well as questions of visa regulation and other timely issues .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-nazi demonstrators in dresden on feb .
12 the ministers decided against a ban on nazi insignia .
at the same time they vowed to reopen talks on combating racism and zenophobia across europe .
britain , denmark opposed danish justice minister lene espersen said the decision was final .
" it is better to drop any discussion on that .
it does not add any value to the proposals , " she told reporters .
" it would only open a long debate on what symbols it should be . "
german justice minister brigitte zypries called the move " regrettable " but admitted that the question of outlawing nazi insignia was less important than ensuring that racism and xenophobia were severely penalized across the european union .
" the central issue for us is to ban expressions -lrb- of racism -rrb- , " she said .
great britain , denmark and other countries spoke against an eu wide regulation on the grounds that it would go against the basic right of free expression .
but the ministers did agree to reanimate a sleeping debate on regulating racism and xenophobia .
in this case , great britain and italy dropped up their blockade-like reaction .
among other things , the agreement would make it punishable by law to deny the holocaust or other crimes against humanity .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister brigitte zypries zypries -lrb- photo -rrb- warned proponents of the actions that even if it does go into effect , it is not the solution to racism in europe .
" making something punishable by law can only be one part of the fight against neo-fascism .
the most important job is to convince people that neofascist politics must be fought .
above all , that is a job for civil society . "
concerns over freedom of speech the plan to outlaw nazi symbols was first proposed in 2001 , but talks collapsed after resistance from italy 's center-right government .
italian justice minister roberto castelli from the populist northern league , repeated rome 's concerns that the proposals could curtail the freedom of speech .
" i am favorable to reopening the debate , " castelli told reporters thursday .
" but there must be no provisions hampering freedom of speech and the question of symbols has to be tackled because it is very important . "
under the proposals , all eu countries would have to make punishable any attempt to incite violence , discrimination or hatred against any person or group on the basis of race , color , religion , national or ethnic origin .

schröder accepts opposition offer of help germany -pipe- 25.02.2005 in coma and looking for work großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's a job waiting at the end are comatose people fit to work ?
german towns grappling with welfare cuts and labor reforms thought so when they registered them with job centers .
but the federal government , facing spiraling costs , is not amused . german chancellor gerhard schröder 's controversial " hartz iv " reforms , which triggered angry protests across the country last year , is once again at the center of a row after a relatively calm couple of months . the reforms , named after peter hartz , personnel director at germany 's biggest carmaker volkswagen , replaces the previous two-tier system of unemployment benefits and welfare support for the long-term unemployed with a single flat-rate payout . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters at an anti-hartz demonstration in brandenburg that means that starting this year people formerly on the dole that are fit to work , are now given handouts by the government in berlin .
however , if they are n't capable of working for whatever reason , then it 's the local authorities in towns and cities who have to shoulder the financial responsibility and pay them welfare benefits . a job for a terminally-ill patient ? this week it emerged that several towns and cities in germany had apparently decided to interpret the new labor regulation to their own advantage to avoid shelling out millions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : local authorities classified more than four million social welfare recipients obviously unfit to work - among them old pensioners , children and terminally ill people with cancer and aids as well as some lying in a coma - as fit to work and registered them last year with job centers . german ard television reported earlier this week of a surprised severely-ill cancer patient who had received a letter from a job center , informing him they had found a job . the news of the abuse has angered german economy and labor minister wolfgang clement , who on thursday described the absurd situation that the fudging of the new reforms had led to . " we 're received calls from health insurance companies telling us that we 're looking for jobs for comatose people , heavy addicts and aids patients , " clement said .
" we 've even realized that in berlin , students and homeless people have been labeled fit to work .
the record at the moment is an 84-year-old man . " insurance companies upset health insurance companies , who are responsible for providing cover to social welfare recipients fit to work , have also been hit by the affair .
the insurance companies receive a flat-payment of € 125 per person from the government in berlin , which only covers a part of the high costs of the health system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hartz iv application form with local authorities and social centers now shirking their healthcare responsibility for people on the dole and unable to take up a job , insurance companies faced with a rising number of seriously-ill jobless patients , are reporting cases of abuse . on thursday , a spokesman for an insurance company in bavaria said that a paraplegic who needed nursing and cost the insurance company € 75,000 a year was now categorized as fit to work as was a cancer patient , who was terminally ill and confined to his bed . towns reject abuse allegations however , local authorities have denied allegations that they deliberately tried to dodge their financial responsibility towards social welfare recipients incapable of working . " we reject the accusation that we illegally tried to do that , " said gerd landsberg , president of the german association of towns and communities , " the law clearly says that those able to work more than three hours are considered fit to work .
and there are definitely aids patients and addicts who can fulfill this criterion , " he said . reports emerged friday that local umbrella associations were aware of the abuse for a long time and that some health insurance companies had written letters to the german economic ministry and the federal labor agency , drawing attention to suspicious cases .
the government is now set to investigate whether it did n't sufficiently examine applicants ' capability of working before sanctioning handouts . exploding costs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : job-seekers in germany meanwhile , the whole affair is expected to blow quite a hole in the federal government 's budget .
clement 's ministry had originally calculated that the " hartz iv " labor reforms would cost it € 14.6 billion for an estimated 3.4 million long-term jobless .
now the government will have to pick up the tab of a further € 6.4 billion for the additional 640,000 long-term unemployed . the conservative opposition has already seized upon the issue as proof that chancellor schröder 's government miscalculated the costs of the labor reforms . " the estimates of the government have nothing to do with reality , " dietrich austermann , budgetary spokesman of the christian democrat parliamentary group told daily passauer neuen presse . the free democratic party 's social expert dirk niebel suggested the government deliberately falsified statistics .
" clement is just hiding behind coma patients and paraplegics , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reform opponents ponder " what now ? "

to date , the swastika and other symbols of the national socialist party are banned only in germany and austria .
on thursday , the interior and justice ministers of the 25 eu countries met to discuss the possible ban of all nazi symbols , as well as questions of visa regulation and other timely issues .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-nazi demonstrators in dresden on feb .
12 the ministers decided against a ban on nazi insignia .
at the same time they vowed to reopen talks on combating racism and zenophobia across europe .
britain , denmark opposed danish justice minister lene espersen said the decision was final .
" it is better to drop any discussion on that .
it does not add any value to the proposals , " she told reporters .
" it would only open a long debate on what symbols it should be . "
german justice minister brigitte zypries called the move " regrettable " but admitted that the question of outlawing nazi insignia was less important than ensuring that racism and xenophobia were severely penalized across the european union .
" the central issue for us is to ban expressions -lrb- of racism -rrb- , " she said .
great britain , denmark and other countries spoke against an eu wide regulation on the grounds that it would go against the basic right of free expression .
but the ministers did agree to reanimate a sleeping debate on regulating racism and xenophobia .
in this case , great britain and italy dropped up their blockade-like reaction .
among other things , the agreement would make it punishable by law to deny the holocaust or other crimes against humanity .
regulation on racism but the racism regulation needs to be discussed with the 15 new european union members from eastern europe , a process that is expected to take time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister brigitte zypries zypries -lrb- photo -rrb- warned proponents of the actions that even if it does go into effect , it is not the solution to racism in europe .
" making something punishable by law can only be one part of the fight against neo-fascism .
the most important job is to convince people that neofascist politics must be fought .
above all , that is a job for civil society . "
concerns over freedom of speech the plan to outlaw nazi symbols was first proposed in 2001 , but talks collapsed after resistance from italy 's center-right government .
italian justice minister roberto castelli from the populist northern league , repeated rome 's concerns that the proposals could curtail the freedom of speech .
" i am favorable to reopening the debate , " castelli told reporters thursday .
" but there must be no provisions hampering freedom of speech and the question of symbols has to be tackled because it is very important . "
under the proposals , all eu countries would have to make punishable any attempt to incite violence , discrimination or hatred against any person or group on the basis of race , color , religion , national or ethnic origin .
the plans also seek to ban " condoning , denial or gross trivialization of crimes of genocide " such as the holocaust , which killed more than 6 million jews . bernd riegert -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de calls for eu ban on nazi symbols several german lawmakers have called for a europe-wide ban on nazi insignia following widespread outrage after britain 's prince harry wore a swastika as part of a costume at a high-society gathering .

to date , the swastika and other symbols of the national socialist party are banned only in germany and austria .
on thursday , the interior and justice ministers of the 25 eu countries met to discuss the possible ban of all nazi symbols , as well as questions of visa regulation and other timely issues .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-nazi demonstrators in dresden on feb .
12 the ministers decided against a ban on nazi insignia .
at the same time they vowed to reopen talks on combating racism and zenophobia across europe .
britain , denmark opposed danish justice minister lene espersen said the decision was final .
" it is better to drop any discussion on that .
it does not add any value to the proposals , " she told reporters .
" it would only open a long debate on what symbols it should be . "
german justice minister brigitte zypries called the move " regrettable " but admitted that the question of outlawing nazi insignia was less important than ensuring that racism and xenophobia were severely penalized across the european union .
" the central issue for us is to ban expressions -lrb- of racism -rrb- , " she said .
great britain , denmark and other countries spoke against an eu wide regulation on the grounds that it would go against the basic right of free expression .
but the ministers did agree to reanimate a sleeping debate on regulating racism and xenophobia .
in this case , great britain and italy dropped up their blockade-like reaction .
among other things , the agreement would make it punishable by law to deny the holocaust or other crimes against humanity .
regulation on racism but the racism regulation needs to be discussed with the 15 new european union members from eastern europe , a process that is expected to take time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister brigitte zypries zypries -lrb- photo -rrb- warned proponents of the actions that even if it does go into effect , it is not the solution to racism in europe .
" making something punishable by law can only be one part of the fight against neo-fascism .
the most important job is to convince people that neofascist politics must be fought .
above all , that is a job for civil society . "
concerns over freedom of speech the plan to outlaw nazi symbols was first proposed in 2001 , but talks collapsed after resistance from italy 's center-right government .
italian justice minister roberto castelli from the populist northern league , repeated rome 's concerns that the proposals could curtail the freedom of speech .
" i am favorable to reopening the debate , " castelli told reporters thursday .
" but there must be no provisions hampering freedom of speech and the question of symbols has to be tackled because it is very important . "
under the proposals , all eu countries would have to make punishable any attempt to incite violence , discrimination or hatred against any person or group on the basis of race , color , religion , national or ethnic origin .
the plans also seek to ban " condoning , denial or gross trivialization of crimes of genocide " such as the holocaust , which killed more than 6 million jews . bernd riegert -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de calls for eu ban on nazi symbols several german lawmakers have called for a europe-wide ban on nazi insignia following widespread outrage after britain 's prince harry wore a swastika as part of a costume at a high-society gathering .

just a stone 's throw away from the city 's marvel of communist postwar city planning , alexanderplatz , there certainly are n't any palm trees to be found . upon closer inspection , however , one discovers there are avocados aplenty here .
on the window of dolores , berlin 's first and only burrito shop , there 's a stylized logo of the green fruit telling passersby that this is no ordinary german imbiss , or snack bar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dolores owners grischa coenen und philipp krahé .
inside , cartons of the real thing have been mashed up by the shop 's owners , philipp krahé and grischa coenen , to make up a fresh daily batch of what every proper burrito needs : guacamole .
but that 's easier said than done in a city where ripe avocados are hard to come by . " it 's all a matter of organization , " explained the 37-year-old krahé .
" you 've just got to buy them as they are and store them until they 're ready . " avocado wrangling but in their quest to bring a little slice of california to the german capital , avocado wrangling is one of the easier challenges krahé and his 30-year-old partner coenen have had to face .
prior to opening dolores last autumn , the two had to contend with miserly banks and teutonic bureaucracy - a lethal combination for so many of germany 's would-be entrepreneurs . " they put so many obstacles in your way , it 's really hard to believe , " said coenen . he and krahé ploughed through it all as if they were on a mission , which was only fitting , since their shop is named after san francisco 's oldest standing building , the mission dolores .
the neighborhood around the mission is filled with mexican and latino shops and restaurants , but the two actually came up with the idea for their little burrito haven after they met while living in london . although they loved london 's energy , both had become disenchanted with their jobs and they decided to start their own business .
both were also amazed at the innovative and creative types of fast food in britain compared to what was on offer in germany .
it was then that they decided to set up their own stylish gourmet snack bar in berlin . having spent considerable time in california , the two compared notes and decided the city had a burrito gap just crying out to be filled by a fat tortilla stuffed with adobo beef , pinto beans and , yes , guacamole . " i was in california for my job quite a lot and burritos were my favorite thing to eat there , " said coenen , while describing the traditional mexican dish . better than kebab and wurst " the food in san francisco was a dream , " concurred krahé .
" in berlin there 's not much to choose from except for döner and currywurst . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the best berlin could do on its own : the currywurst .
they admitted it was a bit of a risk trying to expand the city 's culinary horizons , but their efforts fine-tuning their recipes with a friend with mexican roots paid off .
the shop has quickly become a sanctuary for californian refugees in berlin - that includes your correspondent - who are tired of the tyranny of kebab and sausage . other foreigners with a hankering for lime chicken and tomatillo salsa have also started making regular pilgrimages .
marc-andré fortier , a 25-year-old from montreal currently studying international economics in berlin , first came to dolores on the recommendation of a friend from colombia .
now he comes whenever he needs a burrito fix . " i guess you could say i 'm quickly on my way to becoming a regular customer .
they 're really quite delicious , " fortier said . surging interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : open wide !
but that 's not to say that berlin 's first burrito imbiss is n't a hit with the locals .
each day around noon , germans crowd in to order from the menu that 's half in english .
if all goes to plan , krahé and coenen hope to make dolores into a chain of shops accross germany . that is n't surprising for gabriele frankemölle , a german food writer who operates web sites on american and mexican cuisine . she said interest in mexican food and its american interpretations had surged in recent years even though it was still quite hard to get authentic mexican ingredients in germany . " i think germans are more familiar with the american take on mexican food , because they 've had it while vacationing in the usa , " frankemölle said , adding a chain of burrito shops could have considerable potential in germany .

to date , the swastika and other symbols of the national socialist party are banned only in germany and austria .
on thursday , the interior and justice ministers of the 25 eu countries met to discuss the possible ban of all nazi symbols , as well as questions of visa regulation and other timely issues .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-nazi demonstrators in dresden on feb .
12 the ministers decided against a ban on nazi insignia .
at the same time they vowed to reopen talks on combating racism and zenophobia across europe .
britain , denmark opposed danish justice minister lene espersen said the decision was final .
" it is better to drop any discussion on that .
it does not add any value to the proposals , " she told reporters .
" it would only open a long debate on what symbols it should be . "
german justice minister brigitte zypries called the move " regrettable " but admitted that the question of outlawing nazi insignia was less important than ensuring that racism and xenophobia were severely penalized across the european union .
" the central issue for us is to ban expressions -lrb- of racism -rrb- , " she said .
great britain , denmark and other countries spoke against an eu wide regulation on the grounds that it would go against the basic right of free expression .
but the ministers did agree to reanimate a sleeping debate on regulating racism and xenophobia .
in this case , great britain and italy dropped up their blockade-like reaction .
among other things , the agreement would make it punishable by law to deny the holocaust or other crimes against humanity .
regulation on racism but the racism regulation needs to be discussed with the 15 new european union members from eastern europe , a process that is expected to take time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister brigitte zypries zypries -lrb- photo -rrb- warned proponents of the actions that even if it does go into effect , it is not the solution to racism in europe .
" making something punishable by law can only be one part of the fight against neo-fascism .
the most important job is to convince people that neofascist politics must be fought .
above all , that is a job for civil society . "
concerns over freedom of speech the plan to outlaw nazi symbols was first proposed in 2001 , but talks collapsed after resistance from italy 's center-right government .
italian justice minister roberto castelli from the populist northern league , repeated rome 's concerns that the proposals could curtail the freedom of speech .
" i am favorable to reopening the debate , " castelli told reporters thursday .
" but there must be no provisions hampering freedom of speech and the question of symbols has to be tackled because it is very important . "
under the proposals , all eu countries would have to make punishable any attempt to incite violence , discrimination or hatred against any person or group on the basis of race , color , religion , national or ethnic origin .
the plans also seek to ban " condoning , denial or gross trivialization of crimes of genocide " such as the holocaust , which killed more than 6 million jews . bernd riegert -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de calls for eu ban on nazi symbols several german lawmakers have called for a europe-wide ban on nazi insignia following widespread outrage after britain 's prince harry wore a swastika as part of a costume at a high-society gathering .

the winter in germany has been cold and the demand for heating oil and gas has risen sharply .
to meet them , german oil and gas companies have had to increase production - abroad . the company names are the same : exxonmobil , bp , total and shell .
the oil and gas multinationals are omnipresent .
in germany , they also have subsidiaries searching for oil and gas reserves both in the country and abroad .
the demand is rising , particularly for natural gas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of kilometers of natural gas pipelines cross throughout germany to end consumers according to statistics from the german gas supplier , verbundnetz gas , natural gas consumption rose 40 percent from 1990 to 2003 in germany .
in the same time period , the use of natural gas for energy purposes increased from 15.4 percent of total energy consumption to 22.5 percent .
the increase creates incentives to tap into new sources .
germany has never been a rich country for natural gas and oil reserves , but one-fifth of the natural gas consumed by germans is german .
but that is changing .
the head of the german oil and gas producer association and director of exxonmobil germany , gernot kalkoffen , said that production in germany is falling due to the depletion of the reserves already present .
international pricing also plays a role .
" the development in germany has fallen because of the strength of the euro and the uncoupling of the gas price from oil , so that in germany , there has n't been a price increase in natural gas for the producers , " explained kalkoffen .
offshore attractive yet complicated as gas and oil reserves drop in germany proper , the producers have had to turn to increasingly more unconventional ways to win fossil fuels , such as extracting so-called tight gas from extremely dense layers of rock .
kalkoffen sees potential there , but offshore drilling in the north sea is also attractive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind parks such as this one in denmark have sprouted up and down the north sea coast yet offshore drilling collides with operators of wind energy parks , and , naturally , environmentalists and german governmental environmental policies .
kalkoffen is still uncertain just what effect the nature reserve status of the north sea coast is going to have on potential drilling there .
on the german greenpeace web site , the demands are clear : no more drilling in the north sea and more renewable energy .
in the meantime , the oil industry is turning to foreign oil and gas to satisfy demand .
in 2004 alone , german natural gas production abroad rose 12 percent , a continuation of the trend in the last few years .
wherever there are reserves , german oil and gas producers are drilling - north africa , libya in particular , north and south america , but also in other parts of europe , such as the states of the former soviet union , said kalkoffen . thomas mösch -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder joins the libya fan club since dismantling its weapons programs , libya has been embraced by the west .

in germany , they also have subsidiaries searching for oil and gas reserves both in the country and abroad .
the demand is rising , particularly for natural gas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of kilometers of natural gas pipelines cross throughout germany to end consumers according to statistics from the german gas supplier , verbundnetz gas , natural gas consumption rose 40 percent from 1990 to 2003 in germany .
in the same time period , the use of natural gas for energy purposes increased from 15.4 percent of total energy consumption to 22.5 percent .
the increase creates incentives to tap into new sources .
germany has never been a rich country for natural gas and oil reserves , but one-fifth of the natural gas consumed by germans is german .
but that is changing .
the head of the german oil and gas producer association and director of exxonmobil germany , gernot kalkoffen , said that production in germany is falling due to the depletion of the reserves already present .
international pricing also plays a role .
" the development in germany has fallen because of the strength of the euro and the uncoupling of the gas price from oil , so that in germany , there has n't been a price increase in natural gas for the producers , " explained kalkoffen .
offshore attractive yet complicated as gas and oil reserves drop in germany proper , the producers have had to turn to increasingly more unconventional ways to win fossil fuels , such as extracting so-called tight gas from extremely dense layers of rock .

on the german greenpeace web site , the demands are clear : no more drilling in the north sea and more renewable energy .

the german state has urged warsaw to recall it from stores .
now , the polish foreign minister too , has slammed the edition . polish foreign minister adam rotfeld on thursday criticized the polish release of nazi dictator adolf hitler 's controversial book " mein kampf , " saying the work contains the seeds of nazi crimes . " i think it is a scandal .
this can not be tolerated , " rotfeld told reporters .

the german state has urged warsaw to recall it from stores .
now , the polish foreign minister too , has slammed the edition . polish foreign minister adam rotfeld on thursday criticized the polish release of nazi dictator adolf hitler 's controversial book " mein kampf , " saying the work contains the seeds of nazi crimes . " i think it is a scandal .
this can not be tolerated , " rotfeld told reporters .
" this is a book which encourages crime .
do you think people should be encouraged to commit crime ? " rotfeld was reacting to the publication of 3,000 copies of a polish translation of " mein kampf " by a small publisher in the southwestern city of wroclaw .
the book sets out hitler 's anti-semitic , racist and fascist views and his vision of germany as a racially superior nation and a conqueror . " as the bible said , in the beginning there was the world , and the word became flesh .
in the beginning there was hitler 's word ' mein kampf , ' after which crimes followed .

the new ball will tell the referee if it crossed the line a new soccer ball designed to eradicate controversial goal-line decisions is expected to be approved by a law making body in the next step toward its inclusion in the 2006 world cup in germany . a new hit-tech soccer ball may help make the world cup 2006 in germany one of the least controversial in terms of goal decisions since the tournament began in 1932 .
the revolutionary ball will be armed with the technology to alert referees when it has crossed the goal-line , avoiding situations like the notorious geoff hurst strike for england in the 1966 final . the decision to introduce the sci-fi ball at the world cup next summer is likely to be approved by the international fa board , soccer 's ultimate law making body , at a conference in cardiff , wales over the weekend . the ball , the product of a collaborative effort between german sports giant adidas , cairos technologies and radio communications firm fraunhofer , is shrouded in secrecy .

adidas have already conducted two successful tests , but need to conduct more trials at grounds during games before they launch the product . vorsprung durch technik bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fußball-wm 2006 frnakfurt / main frankfurt stadion fußball media reports since the fifa announcement have indicated that adidas and fifa had set the target of the world cup as the ball 's baptism of fire .

just a stone 's throw away from the city 's marvel of communist postwar city planning , alexanderplatz , there certainly are n't any palm trees to be found . upon closer inspection , however , one discovers there are avocados aplenty here .
on the window of dolores , berlin 's first and only burrito shop , there 's a stylized logo of the green fruit telling passersby that this is no ordinary german imbiss , or snack bar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dolores owners grischa coenen und philipp krahé .
inside , cartons of the real thing have been mashed up by the shop 's owners , philipp krahé and grischa coenen , to make up a fresh daily batch of what every proper burrito needs : guacamole .
but that 's easier said than done in a city where ripe avocados are hard to come by . " it 's all a matter of organization , " explained the 37-year-old krahé .
" you 've just got to buy them as they are and store them until they 're ready . " avocado wrangling but in their quest to bring a little slice of california to the german capital , avocado wrangling is one of the easier challenges krahé and his 30-year-old partner coenen have had to face .
prior to opening dolores last autumn , the two had to contend with miserly banks and teutonic bureaucracy - a lethal combination for so many of germany 's would-be entrepreneurs . " they put so many obstacles in your way , it 's really hard to believe , " said coenen . he and krahé ploughed through it all as if they were on a mission , which was only fitting , since their shop is named after san francisco 's oldest standing building , the mission dolores .
the neighborhood around the mission is filled with mexican and latino shops and restaurants , but the two actually came up with the idea for their little burrito haven after they met while living in london . although they loved london 's energy , both had become disenchanted with their jobs and they decided to start their own business .
both were also amazed at the innovative and creative types of fast food in britain compared to what was on offer in germany .
it was then that they decided to set up their own stylish gourmet snack bar in berlin . having spent considerable time in california , the two compared notes and decided the city had a burrito gap just crying out to be filled by a fat tortilla stuffed with adobo beef , pinto beans and , yes , guacamole . " i was in california for my job quite a lot and burritos were my favorite thing to eat there , " said coenen , while describing the traditional mexican dish . better than kebab and wurst " the food in san francisco was a dream , " concurred krahé .
" in berlin there 's not much to choose from except for döner and currywurst . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the best berlin could do on its own : the currywurst .
they admitted it was a bit of a risk trying to expand the city 's culinary horizons , but their efforts fine-tuning their recipes with a friend with mexican roots paid off .
the shop has quickly become a sanctuary for californian refugees in berlin - that includes your correspondent - who are tired of the tyranny of kebab and sausage . other foreigners with a hankering for lime chicken and tomatillo salsa have also started making regular pilgrimages .
marc-andré fortier , a 25-year-old from montreal currently studying international economics in berlin , first came to dolores on the recommendation of a friend from colombia .
now he comes whenever he needs a burrito fix . " i guess you could say i 'm quickly on my way to becoming a regular customer .
they 're really quite delicious , " fortier said . surging interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : open wide !
but that 's not to say that berlin 's first burrito imbiss is n't a hit with the locals .
each day around noon , germans crowd in to order from the menu that 's half in english .
if all goes to plan , krahé and coenen hope to make dolores into a chain of shops accross germany . that is n't surprising for gabriele frankemölle , a german food writer who operates web sites on american and mexican cuisine . she said interest in mexican food and its american interpretations had surged in recent years even though it was still quite hard to get authentic mexican ingredients in germany . " i think germans are more familiar with the american take on mexican food , because they 've had it while vacationing in the usa , " frankemölle said , adding a chain of burrito shops could have considerable potential in germany .

just a stone 's throw away from the city 's marvel of communist postwar city planning , alexanderplatz , there certainly are n't any palm trees to be found . upon closer inspection , however , one discovers there are avocados aplenty here .
on the window of dolores , berlin 's first and only burrito shop , there 's a stylized logo of the green fruit telling passersby that this is no ordinary german imbiss , or snack bar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dolores owners grischa coenen und philipp krahé .
inside , cartons of the real thing have been mashed up by the shop 's owners , philipp krahé and grischa coenen , to make up a fresh daily batch of what every proper burrito needs : guacamole .
but that 's easier said than done in a city where ripe avocados are hard to come by . " it 's all a matter of organization , " explained the 37-year-old krahé .
" you 've just got to buy them as they are and store them until they 're ready . " avocado wrangling but in their quest to bring a little slice of california to the german capital , avocado wrangling is one of the easier challenges krahé and his 30-year-old partner coenen have had to face .
prior to opening dolores last autumn , the two had to contend with miserly banks and teutonic bureaucracy - a lethal combination for so many of germany 's would-be entrepreneurs . " they put so many obstacles in your way , it 's really hard to believe , " said coenen . he and krahé ploughed through it all as if they were on a mission , which was only fitting , since their shop is named after san francisco 's oldest standing building , the mission dolores .
the neighborhood around the mission is filled with mexican and latino shops and restaurants , but the two actually came up with the idea for their little burrito haven after they met while living in london . although they loved london 's energy , both had become disenchanted with their jobs and they decided to start their own business .
both were also amazed at the innovative and creative types of fast food in britain compared to what was on offer in germany .
it was then that they decided to set up their own stylish gourmet snack bar in berlin . having spent considerable time in california , the two compared notes and decided the city had a burrito gap just crying out to be filled by a fat tortilla stuffed with adobo beef , pinto beans and , yes , guacamole . " i was in california for my job quite a lot and burritos were my favorite thing to eat there , " said coenen , while describing the traditional mexican dish . better than kebab and wurst " the food in san francisco was a dream , " concurred krahé .
" in berlin there 's not much to choose from except for döner and currywurst . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the best berlin could do on its own : the currywurst .
they admitted it was a bit of a risk trying to expand the city 's culinary horizons , but their efforts fine-tuning their recipes with a friend with mexican roots paid off .
the shop has quickly become a sanctuary for californian refugees in berlin - that includes your correspondent - who are tired of the tyranny of kebab and sausage . other foreigners with a hankering for lime chicken and tomatillo salsa have also started making regular pilgrimages .
marc-andré fortier , a 25-year-old from montreal currently studying international economics in berlin , first came to dolores on the recommendation of a friend from colombia .
now he comes whenever he needs a burrito fix . " i guess you could say i 'm quickly on my way to becoming a regular customer .
they 're really quite delicious , " fortier said . surging interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : open wide !
but that 's not to say that berlin 's first burrito imbiss is n't a hit with the locals .
each day around noon , germans crowd in to order from the menu that 's half in english .
if all goes to plan , krahé and coenen hope to make dolores into a chain of shops accross germany . that is n't surprising for gabriele frankemölle , a german food writer who operates web sites on american and mexican cuisine . she said interest in mexican food and its american interpretations had surged in recent years even though it was still quite hard to get authentic mexican ingredients in germany . " i think germans are more familiar with the american take on mexican food , because they 've had it while vacationing in the usa , " frankemölle said , adding a chain of burrito shops could have considerable potential in germany . " it could be quite an advantage that no one else is doing it right now , " she said .

but a senior iranian cleric accused europeans of stalling for time . " the negotiating partners are the three european nations , " iran 's negotiator hassan rowhani said , but " iran would welcome it if the united states helped . " germany , france and britain are seeking to persuade iran to abandon the nuclear fuel cycle that can be used to make atomic weapons , in return for a lucrative economic package .
but the united states suspects iran is developing a nuclear weapon and is skeptical about the progress of the talks with the europeans . white house national security advisor stephen hadley said this week : " the question is how can we help .
it 's not just a question of the carrots and sticks discussion . " rowhani was speaking the day after iran said it opposed any us role in the talks alongside the european union nations .
foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said on thursday that " if the americans joined the talks , the best that could happen is that they would bring nothing to the negotiations and in the worst case scenario they would sabotage everything . " us president george w. bush said in bratislava on thursday , on the final leg of his european trip , that the united states and europe were " on the same page " over iran , which represented his strongest endorsement yet of the eu talks .
washington still wants to bring iran before the un security council for possible sanctions . refusal to abandon enrichment the europeans are trying , however , to persuade iran to comply with international obligations in return for trade , security and technology deals .
iran insists its nuclear program is a peaceful effort to make electricity but refuses to abandon uranium enrichment , saying it has the right to carry out enrichment under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- . meanwhile , a senior iranian cleric on friday accused europeans of stalling for time in their negotiations over iran 's nuclear program and pledged that iran will resume uranium enrichment if negotiations break down .

the new ball will tell the referee if it crossed the line a new soccer ball designed to eradicate controversial goal-line decisions is expected to be approved by a law making body in the next step toward its inclusion in the 2006 world cup in germany . a new hit-tech soccer ball may help make the world cup 2006 in germany one of the least controversial in terms of goal decisions since the tournament began in 1932 .
the revolutionary ball will be armed with the technology to alert referees when it has crossed the goal-line , avoiding situations like the notorious geoff hurst strike for england in the 1966 final . the decision to introduce the sci-fi ball at the world cup next summer is likely to be approved by the international fa board , soccer 's ultimate law making body , at a conference in cardiff , wales over the weekend . the ball , the product of a collaborative effort between german sports giant adidas , cairos technologies and radio communications firm fraunhofer , is shrouded in secrecy .
adidas researchers have been reluctant to talk about their plans to fit the balls with microchip sensors , designed to bring an end to controversial goal situations . goal-line alert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the technology will allow the exact position of the ball on the pitch to be monitored throughout the whole of a game .
once it has crossed the goal-line for a valid goal , the referee will receive an automatic bleep in his earpiece without any need for a fourth official watching pictures or instruments in the stands . officials from the german sports firm were reportedly angered by fifa president sepp blatter announcement last month when the world soccer body 's chief said there would be a presentation of the ball in cardiff . adidas boffins claimed they had not yet completed their schedule of testing and development .
adidas have already conducted two successful tests , but need to conduct more trials at grounds during games before they launch the product . vorsprung durch technik bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fußball-wm 2006 frnakfurt / main frankfurt stadion fußball media reports since the fifa announcement have indicated that adidas and fifa had set the target of the world cup as the ball 's baptism of fire .
it would be the centerpiece of germany 's intended hi-tech tournament filled with state-of-the-art stadia and 21st-century technology . as well as updating the game for the new millenium , fifa are keen to avoid the refereeing decisions that dogged the 2002 world cup finals in japan and south korea and are seen to be bending to pressure to follow the lead of rugby and cricket where new technology has been introduced to the benefit of the sport . the adidas ball would also give blatter the chance to show he is answering the calls to help referees without resorting to the use of tv replays , which he fiercely opposes . possible bundesliga tests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : * * spervermerk : die publikation und weiterverwertung dieses bildes in elektronischen medien , insbesondere im internet und auf mobilen endgeraeten waehrend des laufenden spiels , einschliesslich der halbzeit , ist durch die deutsche fussball liga untersagt .

-lrb- ap photo / christof stache -rrb- after the presentation on saturday , the international board will discuss whether the ball will be given the green light for further trials of the ball in competitions .
it is likely that the ball would be tested in the bundesliga and in the german stadiums designated as world cup venues , and even during champions league games in germany where conventional adidas balls are already used . if these tests were successful , the law making body would then convene for another meeting this time next year where it would decide whether the new ball could be included in the rules for the world cup .

the winter in germany has been cold and the demand for heating oil and gas has risen sharply .
to meet them , german oil and gas companies have had to increase production - abroad . the company names are the same : exxonmobil , bp , total and shell .
the oil and gas multinationals are omnipresent .
in germany , they also have subsidiaries searching for oil and gas reserves both in the country and abroad .
the demand is rising , particularly for natural gas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of kilometers of natural gas pipelines cross throughout germany to end consumers according to statistics from the german gas supplier , verbundnetz gas , natural gas consumption rose 40 percent from 1990 to 2003 in germany .
in the same time period , the use of natural gas for energy purposes increased from 15.4 percent of total energy consumption to 22.5 percent .
the increase creates incentives to tap into new sources .
germany has never been a rich country for natural gas and oil reserves , but one-fifth of the natural gas consumed by germans is german .
but that is changing .
the head of the german oil and gas producer association and director of exxonmobil germany , gernot kalkoffen , said that production in germany is falling due to the depletion of the reserves already present .
international pricing also plays a role .
" the development in germany has fallen because of the strength of the euro and the uncoupling of the gas price from oil , so that in germany , there has n't been a price increase in natural gas for the producers , " explained kalkoffen .
offshore attractive yet complicated as gas and oil reserves drop in germany proper , the producers have had to turn to increasingly more unconventional ways to win fossil fuels , such as extracting so-called tight gas from extremely dense layers of rock .
kalkoffen sees potential there , but offshore drilling in the north sea is also attractive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind parks such as this one in denmark have sprouted up and down the north sea coast yet offshore drilling collides with operators of wind energy parks , and , naturally , environmentalists and german governmental environmental policies .
kalkoffen is still uncertain just what effect the nature reserve status of the north sea coast is going to have on potential drilling there .
on the german greenpeace web site , the demands are clear : no more drilling in the north sea and more renewable energy .
in the meantime , the oil industry is turning to foreign oil and gas to satisfy demand .
in 2004 alone , german natural gas production abroad rose 12 percent , a continuation of the trend in the last few years .
wherever there are reserves , german oil and gas producers are drilling - north africa , libya in particular , north and south america , but also in other parts of europe , such as the states of the former soviet union , said kalkoffen . thomas mösch -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder joins the libya fan club since dismantling its weapons programs , libya has been embraced by the west .

schröder accepts opposition offer of help germany -pipe- 25.02.2005 in coma and looking for work großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's a job waiting at the end are comatose people fit to work ?
german towns grappling with welfare cuts and labor reforms thought so when they registered them with job centers .
but the federal government , facing spiraling costs , is not amused . german chancellor gerhard schröder 's controversial " hartz iv " reforms , which triggered angry protests across the country last year , is once again at the center of a row after a relatively calm couple of months . the reforms , named after peter hartz , personnel director at germany 's biggest carmaker volkswagen , replaces the previous two-tier system of unemployment benefits and welfare support for the long-term unemployed with a single flat-rate payout . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters at an anti-hartz demonstration in brandenburg that means that starting this year people formerly on the dole that are fit to work , are now given handouts by the government in berlin .
however , if they are n't capable of working for whatever reason , then it 's the local authorities in towns and cities who have to shoulder the financial responsibility and pay them welfare benefits . a job for a terminally-ill patient ? this week it emerged that several towns and cities in germany had apparently decided to interpret the new labor regulation to their own advantage to avoid shelling out millions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : local authorities classified more than four million social welfare recipients obviously unfit to work - among them old pensioners , children and terminally ill people with cancer and aids as well as some lying in a coma - as fit to work and registered them last year with job centers . german ard television reported earlier this week of a surprised severely-ill cancer patient who had received a letter from a job center , informing him they had found a job . the news of the abuse has angered german economy and labor minister wolfgang clement , who on thursday described the absurd situation that the fudging of the new reforms had led to . " we 're received calls from health insurance companies telling us that we 're looking for jobs for comatose people , heavy addicts and aids patients , " clement said .
" we 've even realized that in berlin , students and homeless people have been labeled fit to work .
the record at the moment is an 84-year-old man . " insurance companies upset health insurance companies , who are responsible for providing cover to social welfare recipients fit to work , have also been hit by the affair .
the insurance companies receive a flat-payment of € 125 per person from the government in berlin , which only covers a part of the high costs of the health system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hartz iv application form with local authorities and social centers now shirking their healthcare responsibility for people on the dole and unable to take up a job , insurance companies faced with a rising number of seriously-ill jobless patients , are reporting cases of abuse . on thursday , a spokesman for an insurance company in bavaria said that a paraplegic who needed nursing and cost the insurance company € 75,000 a year was now categorized as fit to work as was a cancer patient , who was terminally ill and confined to his bed . towns reject abuse allegations however , local authorities have denied allegations that they deliberately tried to dodge their financial responsibility towards social welfare recipients incapable of working . " we reject the accusation that we illegally tried to do that , " said gerd landsberg , president of the german association of towns and communities , " the law clearly says that those able to work more than three hours are considered fit to work .
and there are definitely aids patients and addicts who can fulfill this criterion , " he said . reports emerged friday that local umbrella associations were aware of the abuse for a long time and that some health insurance companies had written letters to the german economic ministry and the federal labor agency , drawing attention to suspicious cases .
the government is now set to investigate whether it did n't sufficiently examine applicants ' capability of working before sanctioning handouts . exploding costs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : job-seekers in germany meanwhile , the whole affair is expected to blow quite a hole in the federal government 's budget .
clement 's ministry had originally calculated that the " hartz iv " labor reforms would cost it € 14.6 billion for an estimated 3.4 million long-term jobless .
now the government will have to pick up the tab of a further € 6.4 billion for the additional 640,000 long-term unemployed . the conservative opposition has already seized upon the issue as proof that chancellor schröder 's government miscalculated the costs of the labor reforms . " the estimates of the government have nothing to do with reality , " dietrich austermann , budgetary spokesman of the christian democrat parliamentary group told daily passauer neuen presse . the free democratic party 's social expert dirk niebel suggested the government deliberately falsified statistics .

the demand is rising , particularly for natural gas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of kilometers of natural gas pipelines cross throughout germany to end consumers according to statistics from the german gas supplier , verbundnetz gas , natural gas consumption rose 40 percent from 1990 to 2003 in germany .
in the same time period , the use of natural gas for energy purposes increased from 15.4 percent of total energy consumption to 22.5 percent .
the increase creates incentives to tap into new sources .
germany has never been a rich country for natural gas and oil reserves , but one-fifth of the natural gas consumed by germans is german .
but that is changing .
the head of the german oil and gas producer association and director of exxonmobil germany , gernot kalkoffen , said that production in germany is falling due to the depletion of the reserves already present .
international pricing also plays a role .
" the development in germany has fallen because of the strength of the euro and the uncoupling of the gas price from oil , so that in germany , there has n't been a price increase in natural gas for the producers , " explained kalkoffen .
offshore attractive yet complicated as gas and oil reserves drop in germany proper , the producers have had to turn to increasingly more unconventional ways to win fossil fuels , such as extracting so-called tight gas from extremely dense layers of rock .
kalkoffen sees potential there , but offshore drilling in the north sea is also attractive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind parks such as this one in denmark have sprouted up and down the north sea coast yet offshore drilling collides with operators of wind energy parks , and , naturally , environmentalists and german governmental environmental policies .
kalkoffen is still uncertain just what effect the nature reserve status of the north sea coast is going to have on potential drilling there .
on the german greenpeace web site , the demands are clear : no more drilling in the north sea and more renewable energy .
in the meantime , the oil industry is turning to foreign oil and gas to satisfy demand .
in 2004 alone , german natural gas production abroad rose 12 percent , a continuation of the trend in the last few years .
wherever there are reserves , german oil and gas producers are drilling - north africa , libya in particular , north and south america , but also in other parts of europe , such as the states of the former soviet union , said kalkoffen . thomas mösch -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder joins the libya fan club since dismantling its weapons programs , libya has been embraced by the west .

to date , the swastika and other symbols of the national socialist party are banned only in germany and austria .
on thursday , the interior and justice ministers of the 25 eu countries met to discuss the possible ban of all nazi symbols , as well as questions of visa regulation and other timely issues .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-nazi demonstrators in dresden on feb .
12 the ministers decided against a ban on nazi insignia .
at the same time they vowed to reopen talks on combating racism and zenophobia across europe .
britain , denmark opposed danish justice minister lene espersen said the decision was final .
" it is better to drop any discussion on that .
it does not add any value to the proposals , " she told reporters .
" it would only open a long debate on what symbols it should be . "
german justice minister brigitte zypries called the move " regrettable " but admitted that the question of outlawing nazi insignia was less important than ensuring that racism and xenophobia were severely penalized across the european union .
" the central issue for us is to ban expressions -lrb- of racism -rrb- , " she said .
great britain , denmark and other countries spoke against an eu wide regulation on the grounds that it would go against the basic right of free expression .
but the ministers did agree to reanimate a sleeping debate on regulating racism and xenophobia .
in this case , great britain and italy dropped up their blockade-like reaction .
among other things , the agreement would make it punishable by law to deny the holocaust or other crimes against humanity .

" making something punishable by law can only be one part of the fight against neo-fascism .
the most important job is to convince people that neofascist politics must be fought .
above all , that is a job for civil society . "
concerns over freedom of speech the plan to outlaw nazi symbols was first proposed in 2001 , but talks collapsed after resistance from italy 's center-right government .
italian justice minister roberto castelli from the populist northern league , repeated rome 's concerns that the proposals could curtail the freedom of speech .
" i am favorable to reopening the debate , " castelli told reporters thursday .
" but there must be no provisions hampering freedom of speech and the question of symbols has to be tackled because it is very important . "
under the proposals , all eu countries would have to make punishable any attempt to incite violence , discrimination or hatred against any person or group on the basis of race , color , religion , national or ethnic origin .
the plans also seek to ban " condoning , denial or gross trivialization of crimes of genocide " such as the holocaust , which killed more than 6 million jews . bernd riegert -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de calls for eu ban on nazi symbols several german lawmakers have called for a europe-wide ban on nazi insignia following widespread outrage after britain 's prince harry wore a swastika as part of a costume at a high-society gathering .

to date , the swastika and other symbols of the national socialist party are banned only in germany and austria .
on thursday , the interior and justice ministers of the 25 eu countries met to discuss the possible ban of all nazi symbols , as well as questions of visa regulation and other timely issues .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-nazi demonstrators in dresden on feb .
12 the ministers decided against a ban on nazi insignia .
at the same time they vowed to reopen talks on combating racism and zenophobia across europe .
britain , denmark opposed danish justice minister lene espersen said the decision was final .
" it is better to drop any discussion on that .
it does not add any value to the proposals , " she told reporters .
" it would only open a long debate on what symbols it should be . "
german justice minister brigitte zypries called the move " regrettable " but admitted that the question of outlawing nazi insignia was less important than ensuring that racism and xenophobia were severely penalized across the european union .
" the central issue for us is to ban expressions -lrb- of racism -rrb- , " she said .
great britain , denmark and other countries spoke against an eu wide regulation on the grounds that it would go against the basic right of free expression .
but the ministers did agree to reanimate a sleeping debate on regulating racism and xenophobia .
in this case , great britain and italy dropped up their blockade-like reaction .
among other things , the agreement would make it punishable by law to deny the holocaust or other crimes against humanity .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister brigitte zypries zypries -lrb- photo -rrb- warned proponents of the actions that even if it does go into effect , it is not the solution to racism in europe .
" making something punishable by law can only be one part of the fight against neo-fascism .
the most important job is to convince people that neofascist politics must be fought .
above all , that is a job for civil society . "
concerns over freedom of speech the plan to outlaw nazi symbols was first proposed in 2001 , but talks collapsed after resistance from italy 's center-right government .
italian justice minister roberto castelli from the populist northern league , repeated rome 's concerns that the proposals could curtail the freedom of speech .
" i am favorable to reopening the debate , " castelli told reporters thursday .
" but there must be no provisions hampering freedom of speech and the question of symbols has to be tackled because it is very important . "
under the proposals , all eu countries would have to make punishable any attempt to incite violence , discrimination or hatred against any person or group on the basis of race , color , religion , national or ethnic origin .
the plans also seek to ban " condoning , denial or gross trivialization of crimes of genocide " such as the holocaust , which killed more than 6 million jews . bernd riegert -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de calls for eu ban on nazi symbols several german lawmakers have called for a europe-wide ban on nazi insignia following widespread outrage after britain 's prince harry wore a swastika as part of a costume at a high-society gathering .

"
schröder accepts opposition offer of help germany -pipe- 25.02.2005 in coma and looking for work großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's a job waiting at the end are comatose people fit to work ?
german towns grappling with welfare cuts and labor reforms thought so when they registered them with job centers .
but the federal government , facing spiraling costs , is not amused . german chancellor gerhard schröder 's controversial " hartz iv " reforms , which triggered angry protests across the country last year , is once again at the center of a row after a relatively calm couple of months . the reforms , named after peter hartz , personnel director at germany 's biggest carmaker volkswagen , replaces the previous two-tier system of unemployment benefits and welfare support for the long-term unemployed with a single flat-rate payout . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters at an anti-hartz demonstration in brandenburg that means that starting this year people formerly on the dole that are fit to work , are now given handouts by the government in berlin .
however , if they are n't capable of working for whatever reason , then it 's the local authorities in towns and cities who have to shoulder the financial responsibility and pay them welfare benefits . a job for a terminally-ill patient ? this week it emerged that several towns and cities in germany had apparently decided to interpret the new labor regulation to their own advantage to avoid shelling out millions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : local authorities classified more than four million social welfare recipients obviously unfit to work - among them old pensioners , children and terminally ill people with cancer and aids as well as some lying in a coma - as fit to work and registered them last year with job centers . german ard television reported earlier this week of a surprised severely-ill cancer patient who had received a letter from a job center , informing him they had found a job . the news of the abuse has angered german economy and labor minister wolfgang clement , who on thursday described the absurd situation that the fudging of the new reforms had led to . " we 're received calls from health insurance companies telling us that we 're looking for jobs for comatose people , heavy addicts and aids patients , " clement said .
" we 've even realized that in berlin , students and homeless people have been labeled fit to work .
the record at the moment is an 84-year-old man . " insurance companies upset health insurance companies , who are responsible for providing cover to social welfare recipients fit to work , have also been hit by the affair .
the insurance companies receive a flat-payment of € 125 per person from the government in berlin , which only covers a part of the high costs of the health system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hartz iv application form with local authorities and social centers now shirking their healthcare responsibility for people on the dole and unable to take up a job , insurance companies faced with a rising number of seriously-ill jobless patients , are reporting cases of abuse . on thursday , a spokesman for an insurance company in bavaria said that a paraplegic who needed nursing and cost the insurance company € 75,000 a year was now categorized as fit to work as was a cancer patient , who was terminally ill and confined to his bed . towns reject abuse allegations however , local authorities have denied allegations that they deliberately tried to dodge their financial responsibility towards social welfare recipients incapable of working . " we reject the accusation that we illegally tried to do that , " said gerd landsberg , president of the german association of towns and communities , " the law clearly says that those able to work more than three hours are considered fit to work .
and there are definitely aids patients and addicts who can fulfill this criterion , " he said . reports emerged friday that local umbrella associations were aware of the abuse for a long time and that some health insurance companies had written letters to the german economic ministry and the federal labor agency , drawing attention to suspicious cases .
the government is now set to investigate whether it did n't sufficiently examine applicants ' capability of working before sanctioning handouts . exploding costs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : job-seekers in germany meanwhile , the whole affair is expected to blow quite a hole in the federal government 's budget .
clement 's ministry had originally calculated that the " hartz iv " labor reforms would cost it € 14.6 billion for an estimated 3.4 million long-term jobless .
now the government will have to pick up the tab of a further € 6.4 billion for the additional 640,000 long-term unemployed . the conservative opposition has already seized upon the issue as proof that chancellor schröder 's government miscalculated the costs of the labor reforms . " the estimates of the government have nothing to do with reality , " dietrich austermann , budgetary spokesman of the christian democrat parliamentary group told daily passauer neuen presse . the free democratic party 's social expert dirk niebel suggested the government deliberately falsified statistics .
" clement is just hiding behind coma patients and paraplegics , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reform opponents ponder " what now ? "
last year , an opposition movement gained momentum protesting the german government ’ s welfare and labor market reforms .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 25.02.2005 bringing the burrito to berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dolores is berlin 's first burrito shop berlin may be famous for its currywurst and döner kebab , but those old fast food standards might soon give way for snacking california-style , as two entrepreneurs aim to show germany what burritos are all about . standing on the corner of rosa luxemburg and münz streets in berlin , one is n't immediately reminded of sunny california .
just a stone 's throw away from the city 's marvel of communist postwar city planning , alexanderplatz , there certainly are n't any palm trees to be found . upon closer inspection , however , one discovers there are avocados aplenty here .
on the window of dolores , berlin 's first and only burrito shop , there 's a stylized logo of the green fruit telling passersby that this is no ordinary german imbiss , or snack bar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dolores owners grischa coenen und philipp krahé .
inside , cartons of the real thing have been mashed up by the shop 's owners , philipp krahé and grischa coenen , to make up a fresh daily batch of what every proper burrito needs : guacamole .
but that 's easier said than done in a city where ripe avocados are hard to come by . " it 's all a matter of organization , " explained the 37-year-old krahé .
" you 've just got to buy them as they are and store them until they 're ready . " avocado wrangling but in their quest to bring a little slice of california to the german capital , avocado wrangling is one of the easier challenges krahé and his 30-year-old partner coenen have had to face .
prior to opening dolores last autumn , the two had to contend with miserly banks and teutonic bureaucracy - a lethal combination for so many of germany 's would-be entrepreneurs . " they put so many obstacles in your way , it 's really hard to believe , " said coenen . he and krahé ploughed through it all as if they were on a mission , which was only fitting , since their shop is named after san francisco 's oldest standing building , the mission dolores .
the neighborhood around the mission is filled with mexican and latino shops and restaurants , but the two actually came up with the idea for their little burrito haven after they met while living in london . although they loved london 's energy , both had become disenchanted with their jobs and they decided to start their own business .
both were also amazed at the innovative and creative types of fast food in britain compared to what was on offer in germany .
it was then that they decided to set up their own stylish gourmet snack bar in berlin . having spent considerable time in california , the two compared notes and decided the city had a burrito gap just crying out to be filled by a fat tortilla stuffed with adobo beef , pinto beans and , yes , guacamole . " i was in california for my job quite a lot and burritos were my favorite thing to eat there , " said coenen , while describing the traditional mexican dish . better than kebab and wurst " the food in san francisco was a dream , " concurred krahé .
" in berlin there 's not much to choose from except for döner and currywurst . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the best berlin could do on its own : the currywurst .
they admitted it was a bit of a risk trying to expand the city 's culinary horizons , but their efforts fine-tuning their recipes with a friend with mexican roots paid off .
the shop has quickly become a sanctuary for californian refugees in berlin - that includes your correspondent - who are tired of the tyranny of kebab and sausage . other foreigners with a hankering for lime chicken and tomatillo salsa have also started making regular pilgrimages .
marc-andré fortier , a 25-year-old from montreal currently studying international economics in berlin , first came to dolores on the recommendation of a friend from colombia .
now he comes whenever he needs a burrito fix . " i guess you could say i 'm quickly on my way to becoming a regular customer .
they 're really quite delicious , " fortier said . surging interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : open wide !
but that 's not to say that berlin 's first burrito imbiss is n't a hit with the locals .
each day around noon , germans crowd in to order from the menu that 's half in english .
if all goes to plan , krahé and coenen hope to make dolores into a chain of shops accross germany . that is n't surprising for gabriele frankemölle , a german food writer who operates web sites on american and mexican cuisine . she said interest in mexican food and its american interpretations had surged in recent years even though it was still quite hard to get authentic mexican ingredients in germany . " i think germans are more familiar with the american take on mexican food , because they 've had it while vacationing in the usa , " frankemölle said , adding a chain of burrito shops could have considerable potential in germany . " it could be quite an advantage that no one else is doing it right now , " she said .

"
schröder accepts opposition offer of help germany -pipe- 25.02.2005 in coma and looking for work großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's a job waiting at the end are comatose people fit to work ?
german towns grappling with welfare cuts and labor reforms thought so when they registered them with job centers .
but the federal government , facing spiraling costs , is not amused . german chancellor gerhard schröder 's controversial " hartz iv " reforms , which triggered angry protests across the country last year , is once again at the center of a row after a relatively calm couple of months . the reforms , named after peter hartz , personnel director at germany 's biggest carmaker volkswagen , replaces the previous two-tier system of unemployment benefits and welfare support for the long-term unemployed with a single flat-rate payout . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters at an anti-hartz demonstration in brandenburg that means that starting this year people formerly on the dole that are fit to work , are now given handouts by the government in berlin .
however , if they are n't capable of working for whatever reason , then it 's the local authorities in towns and cities who have to shoulder the financial responsibility and pay them welfare benefits . a job for a terminally-ill patient ? this week it emerged that several towns and cities in germany had apparently decided to interpret the new labor regulation to their own advantage to avoid shelling out millions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : local authorities classified more than four million social welfare recipients obviously unfit to work - among them old pensioners , children and terminally ill people with cancer and aids as well as some lying in a coma - as fit to work and registered them last year with job centers . german ard television reported earlier this week of a surprised severely-ill cancer patient who had received a letter from a job center , informing him they had found a job . the news of the abuse has angered german economy and labor minister wolfgang clement , who on thursday described the absurd situation that the fudging of the new reforms had led to . " we 're received calls from health insurance companies telling us that we 're looking for jobs for comatose people , heavy addicts and aids patients , " clement said .
" we 've even realized that in berlin , students and homeless people have been labeled fit to work .
the record at the moment is an 84-year-old man . " insurance companies upset health insurance companies , who are responsible for providing cover to social welfare recipients fit to work , have also been hit by the affair .
the insurance companies receive a flat-payment of € 125 per person from the government in berlin , which only covers a part of the high costs of the health system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hartz iv application form with local authorities and social centers now shirking their healthcare responsibility for people on the dole and unable to take up a job , insurance companies faced with a rising number of seriously-ill jobless patients , are reporting cases of abuse . on thursday , a spokesman for an insurance company in bavaria said that a paraplegic who needed nursing and cost the insurance company € 75,000 a year was now categorized as fit to work as was a cancer patient , who was terminally ill and confined to his bed . towns reject abuse allegations however , local authorities have denied allegations that they deliberately tried to dodge their financial responsibility towards social welfare recipients incapable of working . " we reject the accusation that we illegally tried to do that , " said gerd landsberg , president of the german association of towns and communities , " the law clearly says that those able to work more than three hours are considered fit to work .
and there are definitely aids patients and addicts who can fulfill this criterion , " he said . reports emerged friday that local umbrella associations were aware of the abuse for a long time and that some health insurance companies had written letters to the german economic ministry and the federal labor agency , drawing attention to suspicious cases .
the government is now set to investigate whether it did n't sufficiently examine applicants ' capability of working before sanctioning handouts . exploding costs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : job-seekers in germany meanwhile , the whole affair is expected to blow quite a hole in the federal government 's budget .
clement 's ministry had originally calculated that the " hartz iv " labor reforms would cost it € 14.6 billion for an estimated 3.4 million long-term jobless .
now the government will have to pick up the tab of a further € 6.4 billion for the additional 640,000 long-term unemployed . the conservative opposition has already seized upon the issue as proof that chancellor schröder 's government miscalculated the costs of the labor reforms . " the estimates of the government have nothing to do with reality , " dietrich austermann , budgetary spokesman of the christian democrat parliamentary group told daily passauer neuen presse . the free democratic party 's social expert dirk niebel suggested the government deliberately falsified statistics .

the new ball will tell the referee if it crossed the line a new soccer ball designed to eradicate controversial goal-line decisions is expected to be approved by a law making body in the next step toward its inclusion in the 2006 world cup in germany . a new hit-tech soccer ball may help make the world cup 2006 in germany one of the least controversial in terms of goal decisions since the tournament began in 1932 .
the revolutionary ball will be armed with the technology to alert referees when it has crossed the goal-line , avoiding situations like the notorious geoff hurst strike for england in the 1966 final . the decision to introduce the sci-fi ball at the world cup next summer is likely to be approved by the international fa board , soccer 's ultimate law making body , at a conference in cardiff , wales over the weekend . the ball , the product of a collaborative effort between german sports giant adidas , cairos technologies and radio communications firm fraunhofer , is shrouded in secrecy .
adidas researchers have been reluctant to talk about their plans to fit the balls with microchip sensors , designed to bring an end to controversial goal situations . goal-line alert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the technology will allow the exact position of the ball on the pitch to be monitored throughout the whole of a game .
once it has crossed the goal-line for a valid goal , the referee will receive an automatic bleep in his earpiece without any need for a fourth official watching pictures or instruments in the stands . officials from the german sports firm were reportedly angered by fifa president sepp blatter announcement last month when the world soccer body 's chief said there would be a presentation of the ball in cardiff . adidas boffins claimed they had not yet completed their schedule of testing and development .
adidas have already conducted two successful tests , but need to conduct more trials at grounds during games before they launch the product . vorsprung durch technik bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fußball-wm 2006 frnakfurt / main frankfurt stadion fußball media reports since the fifa announcement have indicated that adidas and fifa had set the target of the world cup as the ball 's baptism of fire .
it would be the centerpiece of germany 's intended hi-tech tournament filled with state-of-the-art stadia and 21st-century technology . as well as updating the game for the new millenium , fifa are keen to avoid the refereeing decisions that dogged the 2002 world cup finals in japan and south korea and are seen to be bending to pressure to follow the lead of rugby and cricket where new technology has been introduced to the benefit of the sport . the adidas ball would also give blatter the chance to show he is answering the calls to help referees without resorting to the use of tv replays , which he fiercely opposes . possible bundesliga tests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : * * spervermerk : die publikation und weiterverwertung dieses bildes in elektronischen medien , insbesondere im internet und auf mobilen endgeraeten waehrend des laufenden spiels , einschliesslich der halbzeit , ist durch die deutsche fussball liga untersagt .

-lrb- ap photo / christof stache -rrb- after the presentation on saturday , the international board will discuss whether the ball will be given the green light for further trials of the ball in competitions .
it is likely that the ball would be tested in the bundesliga and in the german stadiums designated as world cup venues , and even during champions league games in germany where conventional adidas balls are already used . if these tests were successful , the law making body would then convene for another meeting this time next year where it would decide whether the new ball could be included in the rules for the world cup .

it 's regarded as a global growth market , and one in which german industry hopes to play a part . " white " biotechnology - which uses living cells like moulds , yeasts or bacteria to produce goods and service - has long ceased to be a futuristic concept .
every day , millions of people buy products containing the technology , such as washing powder which contains enzymes to make it more efficient .
these modern detergents work with less water and in lower temperatures , meaning less waste water , and lower energy consumption . it 's a good example of the benefits of white biotechnology , according to fritz brickwedde of the bundesstiftung umwelt , a national foundation for the environment . " we have three goals which we 'd like to see realized alongside white biotechnology - the protection of limited natural resources , the reduction of environmental pollution , and a more efficient means of production , " brickwedde said . political framework the expectations are high .
studies predict that in just a few years , up to a fifth of revenues from the chemical industry worldwide will come from biotech products - a market of over € 300 billion -lrb- $ 396 billion -rrb- .
jürgen hambrecht , president of the chemical industry association , believes it 's important that germany take a leading role in this market . " in the area of white biotechnology , the german chemical industry wants to continue to be a world leader , as we are today , " hambrecht said .
" whether that will happen depends on how the political framework continues to develop . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavaria has several fields where genetically modified crops have been planted under strict regulation hambrecht 's concern is with white biotechnology 's sister field , namely , " green " biotechnology , or the planting of genetically manipulated crops .
" we 're dealing with a kind of magic triangle here - green genetic technology , renewable raw materials , and white biotechnology , " he said .
" those who do n't see this certainly wo n't be among those to help usher in the future of this technology . " migration abroad in other words : industry views germany 's laws on genetic technology as overly restrictive .
hambrecht wants to be able to more easily plant genetically modified crops , as only by pursuing this field can the progress of white biotechnology be assured . hambrecht 's main criticism is directed at economics minister wolfgang clement , who responded : " as far as our legislation is concerned , in my view , it is deserving of criticism .
we held a critical discussion , so my assumption is that we 're in the midst of a process which could lead to changes on the laws regarding genetic technology , and in my opinion , should lead to changes . " the chemical industry clearly has a sympathetic ear in clement .
however , the economics minister ca n't speak for the whole government , and especially not for coalition partner , the green party .
after all , the greens harbor the most committed opponents to the cultivation of genetically modified plants . the next assessment of the legislation 's status is due to take place in two years ' time .
the chemical industry is waiting with baited breath .
should the laws not be loosened , hambrecht predicts that german research and development in the biotechnology sector will suffer , adding that it would no longer be possible to rule out a brain drain of german talent to countries with more relaxed legislation . gernot jaeger -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu-us rift remains over biotech food it 's been 10 years since the production of genetically modified crops reached commercial status .

the star-studded affair will bring out the cream of tinseltown ... and a few germans with hopes of a prize and a passion for partying " like devils . " the global movie industry will turn its star-struck eyes towards hollywood once more on sunday for oscar night .
the 77th academy awards ceremony is usually quite an insular affair with back-slaps all round for the local talent and those associated with tinseltown productions .
but this year , the germans have a reason to be optimistic , with " der untergang " up for one of the coveted gongs . if " der untergang , " or " the downfall " to give it its english-language release title , gatecrashes the party , it wo n't be the first time for a german film .
in fact , german films have been gaining momentum and respect in hollywood for many years now and caroline link 's " nowhere in africa " snatched the best foreign language film statuette as recently as 2003 . history favors films about nazis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nowhere in africa the odds seem to be in the favor of director oliver hirschbiegel 's depiction of the last days of adolf hitler .
historically , german films with themes realted to the nazis have been very successful on oscar night .
link 's story of german emigrants in africa during world war ii followed the success in 1980 of volker schlöndorff 's wartime masterpiece " die blechtrommel . " regardless of the good omens , hirschbiegel is just happy to be nominated .
" for a filmmaker it is the biggest thing just to be there , this is like olympic gold .
whether we win an oscar or not - we will celebrate like devils , " said the german director . mixed responses from stateside critics in the meantime , under its english-language title , the german film has opened in the united states .
critics have reacted with mixed feelings towards the film .
the influential hollywood reporter - essential reading for many of the academy members - praised the german production highly : " one of the best war films of all time .
a film which can bring new standards in the transference of history onto celluloid . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the downfall -lrb- der untergang -rrb- however , the respected film reviewer a.o. scott of the new york times said the film contained " a reassuring message for the home audience that the germans were , above all , victims of nazism . "
he criticized the manner in which the film presented some figures linked with hitler 's regime and the way it attempted to extract sympathy from the audience . others have said that the film raises questions for all humanity , showing hitler and his cronies as people capable of horrific acts and not the demons of the nazi myth .
this same point has been used to deride the film , with some expressing concerns that humanizing the characters reduces their status as the most heinous criminals of the 20th century . growing global audience and profits the debate around the film has done little to distract audiences from seeing it .
" the downfall " has so far earned $ 40 million worldwide .
however , $ 30 million of that has been earned in germany where 4.6 million viewers have flocked to see it .
the film has also been on general release in france , belgium , the netherlands , poland , austria and switzerland , hungary , finland and spain . while german movie industry voices have been calling producer bernd eichinger " the most important man in german film , " he and his colleague hirschbiegel will have to wait until sunday night to see if they have a tangible accolade to go with all the praise . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a bumper year for german film after years of decline , german film appears to have made a comeback in 2004 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.02.2005 " white " biotechnology on expansion course großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : detergent production is just one area using white biotechnology unlike " green " biotechnology , the " white " variety is less well known - and less controversial .
it 's regarded as a global growth market , and one in which german industry hopes to play a part . " white " biotechnology - which uses living cells like moulds , yeasts or bacteria to produce goods and service - has long ceased to be a futuristic concept .
every day , millions of people buy products containing the technology , such as washing powder which contains enzymes to make it more efficient .
these modern detergents work with less water and in lower temperatures , meaning less waste water , and lower energy consumption . it 's a good example of the benefits of white biotechnology , according to fritz brickwedde of the bundesstiftung umwelt , a national foundation for the environment . " we have three goals which we 'd like to see realized alongside white biotechnology - the protection of limited natural resources , the reduction of environmental pollution , and a more efficient means of production , " brickwedde said . political framework the expectations are high .
studies predict that in just a few years , up to a fifth of revenues from the chemical industry worldwide will come from biotech products - a market of over € 300 billion -lrb- $ 396 billion -rrb- .
jürgen hambrecht , president of the chemical industry association , believes it 's important that germany take a leading role in this market . " in the area of white biotechnology , the german chemical industry wants to continue to be a world leader , as we are today , " hambrecht said .
" whether that will happen depends on how the political framework continues to develop .

zones to be sealed off include the area around the us embassy and the district around the presidential palace , the summit venue . president bush arrived in the slovak capital on wednesday evening from mainz , germany , on the final leg of a european tour designed to patch up rifts between the united states and europe over the iraq war .
russian president vladimir putin is due to arrive on thursday morning . questions of democracy events may take on a similar feel to those in europe where outward smiles attempted to hide tensions behind the scenes .

washington is also concerned about russian nuclear cooperation with iran , which us officials accuse of trying to acquire atomic weapons . russian dealings with iran a sore point in mainz on wednesday , bush and german chancellor gerhard schröder united in warning iran against developing a nuclear weapon .
" it 's vital that the iranians hear the world speak with one voice that they should n't have nuclear weapons , " bush said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin had said last week in moscow that russia , which is helping iran build its first nuclear power reactor , was convinced that iran has no intention of making atomic weapons . bush said he had heard some concerns about developments in russia expressed by eu leaders during his talks in brussels , notably formerly soviet baltic states which were among 10 countries to join the eu last year .
" i think it 's very important that president putin hear not only from me in a private way , which he will , but also hears some of the concerns i heard around the table today , " he said . putin defends russian approach but on tuesday , putin told slovak media : " democratic institutions should be adapted to today 's realities in russian life , to our traditions and our history . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin " we are against use of this issue as an instrument for fulfilling foreign policy objectives or for making something amorphous of the russian state , to manipulate in one way or another such a large and important country for international relations , " the russian leader said , according to a transcript released in moscow by the kremlin . " but i do n't think that is the aim of our partners , " he said , stressing that russia made its choice for democracy 14 years ago when the soviet union collapsed not in order to please any other countries " but for ourselves , for our country , for our citizens . " a number of potentially thorny subjects analysts in moscow said however that thursday 's meeting , the second between the two leaders in three months , is unlikely to settle current differences . bush and putin are due to discuss combatting terrorism , sign an accord imposing controls on shoulder-fired missiles , and review events in iraq and north korea as well as russia 's bid to join the world trade organization .

in the same time period , the use of natural gas for energy purposes increased from 15.4 percent of total energy consumption to 22.5 percent .
the increase creates incentives to tap into new sources .
germany has never been a rich country for natural gas and oil reserves , but one-fifth of the natural gas consumed by germans is german .

on the german greenpeace web site , the demands are clear : no more drilling in the north sea and more renewable energy .

the winter in germany has been cold and the demand for heating oil and gas has risen sharply .
to meet them , german oil and gas companies have had to increase production - abroad . the company names are the same : exxonmobil , bp , total and shell .
the oil and gas multinationals are omnipresent .
in germany , they also have subsidiaries searching for oil and gas reserves both in the country and abroad .
the demand is rising , particularly for natural gas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of kilometers of natural gas pipelines cross throughout germany to end consumers according to statistics from the german gas supplier , verbundnetz gas , natural gas consumption rose 40 percent from 1990 to 2003 in germany .
in the same time period , the use of natural gas for energy purposes increased from 15.4 percent of total energy consumption to 22.5 percent .
the increase creates incentives to tap into new sources .
germany has never been a rich country for natural gas and oil reserves , but one-fifth of the natural gas consumed by germans is german .
but that is changing .
the head of the german oil and gas producer association and director of exxonmobil germany , gernot kalkoffen , said that production in germany is falling due to the depletion of the reserves already present .
international pricing also plays a role .
" the development in germany has fallen because of the strength of the euro and the uncoupling of the gas price from oil , so that in germany , there has n't been a price increase in natural gas for the producers , " explained kalkoffen .
offshore attractive yet complicated as gas and oil reserves drop in germany proper , the producers have had to turn to increasingly more unconventional ways to win fossil fuels , such as extracting so-called tight gas from extremely dense layers of rock .
kalkoffen sees potential there , but offshore drilling in the north sea is also attractive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind parks such as this one in denmark have sprouted up and down the north sea coast yet offshore drilling collides with operators of wind energy parks , and , naturally , environmentalists and german governmental environmental policies .
kalkoffen is still uncertain just what effect the nature reserve status of the north sea coast is going to have on potential drilling there .
on the german greenpeace web site , the demands are clear : no more drilling in the north sea and more renewable energy .
in the meantime , the oil industry is turning to foreign oil and gas to satisfy demand .
in 2004 alone , german natural gas production abroad rose 12 percent , a continuation of the trend in the last few years .
wherever there are reserves , german oil and gas producers are drilling - north africa , libya in particular , north and south america , but also in other parts of europe , such as the states of the former soviet union , said kalkoffen . thomas mösch -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder joins the libya fan club since dismantling its weapons programs , libya has been embraced by the west .

some 4,500 workers are expected to leave their jobs voluntarily this year , fortified with severance pay , it added .
an additional 1,500 workers are likely to choose such an option in 2006 and 2007 .
the remaining 3,500 have opted for alternative solutions such as pre-retirement or training in affiliated companies created by opel with subcontractors specializing in logistics and the manufacture of spare parts .
" we are pleased with the reception the plan has received by workers , " said opel 's director of human resources , norbert kuepper , in a statement . dw-world.de what next for german auto industry ?
germany produces some 5.5 million cars every year , but the german car industry is most likely to remember 2004 for poor sales and industrial strikes .

but a senior iranian cleric accused europeans of stalling for time . " the negotiating partners are the three european nations , " iran 's negotiator hassan rowhani said , but " iran would welcome it if the united states helped . " germany , france and britain are seeking to persuade iran to abandon the nuclear fuel cycle that can be used to make atomic weapons , in return for a lucrative economic package .
but the united states suspects iran is developing a nuclear weapon and is skeptical about the progress of the talks with the europeans . white house national security advisor stephen hadley said this week : " the question is how can we help .
it 's not just a question of the carrots and sticks discussion . " rowhani was speaking the day after iran said it opposed any us role in the talks alongside the european union nations .
foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said on thursday that " if the americans joined the talks , the best that could happen is that they would bring nothing to the negotiations and in the worst case scenario they would sabotage everything . " us president george w. bush said in bratislava on thursday , on the final leg of his european trip , that the united states and europe were " on the same page " over iran , which represented his strongest endorsement yet of the eu talks .
washington still wants to bring iran before the un security council for possible sanctions . refusal to abandon enrichment the europeans are trying , however , to persuade iran to comply with international obligations in return for trade , security and technology deals .
iran insists its nuclear program is a peaceful effort to make electricity but refuses to abandon uranium enrichment , saying it has the right to carry out enrichment under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- . meanwhile , a senior iranian cleric on friday accused europeans of stalling for time in their negotiations over iran 's nuclear program and pledged that iran will resume uranium enrichment if negotiations break down . " europeans are killing time ; negotiations are going on but the achievement we expected has not been reached yet . " said ayatollah ahmad janati , a hardline cleric who heads the powerful watchdog body that vets all legislation and candidates for public office . " we will wait for a while and if the negotiations do not reach the desired result , we will resume our work -lrb- uranium enrichment -rrb- . "
janati said in a weekly prayer sermon broadcast live on state radio .
" they must not hope they can go on with suspension until enrichment is stopped .
europeans must not be acting under america 's pressure , " janati said . dw staff / afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu says strike on iran a mistake a military strike against iran ’ s nuclear facilities would be a “ mistake , ” the european union ’ s foreign policy chief javier solana said and stressed the importance of continuing eu efforts at diplomatic engagement .

the new ball will tell the referee if it crossed the line a new soccer ball designed to eradicate controversial goal-line decisions is expected to be approved by a law making body in the next step toward its inclusion in the 2006 world cup in germany . a new hit-tech soccer ball may help make the world cup 2006 in germany one of the least controversial in terms of goal decisions since the tournament began in 1932 .

the new ball will tell the referee if it crossed the line a new soccer ball designed to eradicate controversial goal-line decisions is expected to be approved by a law making body in the next step toward its inclusion in the 2006 world cup in germany . a new hit-tech soccer ball may help make the world cup 2006 in germany one of the least controversial in terms of goal decisions since the tournament began in 1932 .
the revolutionary ball will be armed with the technology to alert referees when it has crossed the goal-line , avoiding situations like the notorious geoff hurst strike for england in the 1966 final . the decision to introduce the sci-fi ball at the world cup next summer is likely to be approved by the international fa board , soccer 's ultimate law making body , at a conference in cardiff , wales over the weekend . the ball , the product of a collaborative effort between german sports giant adidas , cairos technologies and radio communications firm fraunhofer , is shrouded in secrecy .
adidas researchers have been reluctant to talk about their plans to fit the balls with microchip sensors , designed to bring an end to controversial goal situations . goal-line alert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the technology will allow the exact position of the ball on the pitch to be monitored throughout the whole of a game .
once it has crossed the goal-line for a valid goal , the referee will receive an automatic bleep in his earpiece without any need for a fourth official watching pictures or instruments in the stands . officials from the german sports firm were reportedly angered by fifa president sepp blatter announcement last month when the world soccer body 's chief said there would be a presentation of the ball in cardiff . adidas boffins claimed they had not yet completed their schedule of testing and development .
adidas have already conducted two successful tests , but need to conduct more trials at grounds during games before they launch the product . vorsprung durch technik bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fußball-wm 2006 frnakfurt / main frankfurt stadion fußball media reports since the fifa announcement have indicated that adidas and fifa had set the target of the world cup as the ball 's baptism of fire .
it would be the centerpiece of germany 's intended hi-tech tournament filled with state-of-the-art stadia and 21st-century technology . as well as updating the game for the new millenium , fifa are keen to avoid the refereeing decisions that dogged the 2002 world cup finals in japan and south korea and are seen to be bending to pressure to follow the lead of rugby and cricket where new technology has been introduced to the benefit of the sport . the adidas ball would also give blatter the chance to show he is answering the calls to help referees without resorting to the use of tv replays , which he fiercely opposes . possible bundesliga tests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : * * spervermerk : die publikation und weiterverwertung dieses bildes in elektronischen medien , insbesondere im internet und auf mobilen endgeraeten waehrend des laufenden spiels , einschliesslich der halbzeit , ist durch die deutsche fussball liga untersagt .

just a stone 's throw away from the city 's marvel of communist postwar city planning , alexanderplatz , there certainly are n't any palm trees to be found . upon closer inspection , however , one discovers there are avocados aplenty here .

prior to opening dolores last autumn , the two had to contend with miserly banks and teutonic bureaucracy - a lethal combination for so many of germany 's would-be entrepreneurs . " they put so many obstacles in your way , it 's really hard to believe , " said coenen . he and krahé ploughed through it all as if they were on a mission , which was only fitting , since their shop is named after san francisco 's oldest standing building , the mission dolores .

" i was in california for my job quite a lot and burritos were my favorite thing to eat there , " said coenen , while describing the traditional mexican dish . better than kebab and wurst " the food in san francisco was a dream , " concurred krahé .

just a stone 's throw away from the city 's marvel of communist postwar city planning , alexanderplatz , there certainly are n't any palm trees to be found . upon closer inspection , however , one discovers there are avocados aplenty here .
on the window of dolores , berlin 's first and only burrito shop , there 's a stylized logo of the green fruit telling passersby that this is no ordinary german imbiss , or snack bar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dolores owners grischa coenen und philipp krahé .
inside , cartons of the real thing have been mashed up by the shop 's owners , philipp krahé and grischa coenen , to make up a fresh daily batch of what every proper burrito needs : guacamole .
but that 's easier said than done in a city where ripe avocados are hard to come by . " it 's all a matter of organization , " explained the 37-year-old krahé .
" you 've just got to buy them as they are and store them until they 're ready . " avocado wrangling but in their quest to bring a little slice of california to the german capital , avocado wrangling is one of the easier challenges krahé and his 30-year-old partner coenen have had to face .
prior to opening dolores last autumn , the two had to contend with miserly banks and teutonic bureaucracy - a lethal combination for so many of germany 's would-be entrepreneurs . " they put so many obstacles in your way , it 's really hard to believe , " said coenen . he and krahé ploughed through it all as if they were on a mission , which was only fitting , since their shop is named after san francisco 's oldest standing building , the mission dolores .
the neighborhood around the mission is filled with mexican and latino shops and restaurants , but the two actually came up with the idea for their little burrito haven after they met while living in london . although they loved london 's energy , both had become disenchanted with their jobs and they decided to start their own business .
both were also amazed at the innovative and creative types of fast food in britain compared to what was on offer in germany .
it was then that they decided to set up their own stylish gourmet snack bar in berlin . having spent considerable time in california , the two compared notes and decided the city had a burrito gap just crying out to be filled by a fat tortilla stuffed with adobo beef , pinto beans and , yes , guacamole . " i was in california for my job quite a lot and burritos were my favorite thing to eat there , " said coenen , while describing the traditional mexican dish . better than kebab and wurst " the food in san francisco was a dream , " concurred krahé .
" in berlin there 's not much to choose from except for döner and currywurst . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the best berlin could do on its own : the currywurst .
they admitted it was a bit of a risk trying to expand the city 's culinary horizons , but their efforts fine-tuning their recipes with a friend with mexican roots paid off .
the shop has quickly become a sanctuary for californian refugees in berlin - that includes your correspondent - who are tired of the tyranny of kebab and sausage . other foreigners with a hankering for lime chicken and tomatillo salsa have also started making regular pilgrimages .
marc-andré fortier , a 25-year-old from montreal currently studying international economics in berlin , first came to dolores on the recommendation of a friend from colombia .
now he comes whenever he needs a burrito fix . " i guess you could say i 'm quickly on my way to becoming a regular customer .
they 're really quite delicious , " fortier said . surging interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : open wide !
but that 's not to say that berlin 's first burrito imbiss is n't a hit with the locals .
each day around noon , germans crowd in to order from the menu that 's half in english .
if all goes to plan , krahé and coenen hope to make dolores into a chain of shops accross germany . that is n't surprising for gabriele frankemölle , a german food writer who operates web sites on american and mexican cuisine . she said interest in mexican food and its american interpretations had surged in recent years even though it was still quite hard to get authentic mexican ingredients in germany . " i think germans are more familiar with the american take on mexican food , because they 've had it while vacationing in the usa , " frankemölle said , adding a chain of burrito shops could have considerable potential in germany .

the new ball will tell the referee if it crossed the line a new soccer ball designed to eradicate controversial goal-line decisions is expected to be approved by a law making body in the next step toward its inclusion in the 2006 world cup in germany . a new hit-tech soccer ball may help make the world cup 2006 in germany one of the least controversial in terms of goal decisions since the tournament began in 1932 .
the revolutionary ball will be armed with the technology to alert referees when it has crossed the goal-line , avoiding situations like the notorious geoff hurst strike for england in the 1966 final . the decision to introduce the sci-fi ball at the world cup next summer is likely to be approved by the international fa board , soccer 's ultimate law making body , at a conference in cardiff , wales over the weekend . the ball , the product of a collaborative effort between german sports giant adidas , cairos technologies and radio communications firm fraunhofer , is shrouded in secrecy .
adidas researchers have been reluctant to talk about their plans to fit the balls with microchip sensors , designed to bring an end to controversial goal situations . goal-line alert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the technology will allow the exact position of the ball on the pitch to be monitored throughout the whole of a game .
once it has crossed the goal-line for a valid goal , the referee will receive an automatic bleep in his earpiece without any need for a fourth official watching pictures or instruments in the stands . officials from the german sports firm were reportedly angered by fifa president sepp blatter announcement last month when the world soccer body 's chief said there would be a presentation of the ball in cardiff . adidas boffins claimed they had not yet completed their schedule of testing and development .
adidas have already conducted two successful tests , but need to conduct more trials at grounds during games before they launch the product . vorsprung durch technik bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fußball-wm 2006 frnakfurt / main frankfurt stadion fußball media reports since the fifa announcement have indicated that adidas and fifa had set the target of the world cup as the ball 's baptism of fire .
it would be the centerpiece of germany 's intended hi-tech tournament filled with state-of-the-art stadia and 21st-century technology . as well as updating the game for the new millenium , fifa are keen to avoid the refereeing decisions that dogged the 2002 world cup finals in japan and south korea and are seen to be bending to pressure to follow the lead of rugby and cricket where new technology has been introduced to the benefit of the sport . the adidas ball would also give blatter the chance to show he is answering the calls to help referees without resorting to the use of tv replays , which he fiercely opposes . possible bundesliga tests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : * * spervermerk : die publikation und weiterverwertung dieses bildes in elektronischen medien , insbesondere im internet und auf mobilen endgeraeten waehrend des laufenden spiels , einschliesslich der halbzeit , ist durch die deutsche fussball liga untersagt .

6 , 2004 .
-lrb- ap photo / christof stache -rrb- after the presentation on saturday , the international board will discuss whether the ball will be given the green light for further trials of the ball in competitions .
it is likely that the ball would be tested in the bundesliga and in the german stadiums designated as world cup venues , and even during champions league games in germany where conventional adidas balls are already used . if these tests were successful , the law making body would then convene for another meeting this time next year where it would decide whether the new ball could be included in the rules for the world cup .
if agreed , this would mean computerized soccer balls would see action in germany next summer . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de scandal deals blow to german soccer the widening match-fixing scandal is damaging german soccer 's image in the build-up to the 2006 world cup , organizing committee president franz beckenbauer said tuesday .

to date , the swastika and other symbols of the national socialist party are banned only in germany and austria .
on thursday , the interior and justice ministers of the 25 eu countries met to discuss the possible ban of all nazi symbols , as well as questions of visa regulation and other timely issues .

12 the ministers decided against a ban on nazi insignia .
at the same time they vowed to reopen talks on combating racism and zenophobia across europe .
britain , denmark opposed danish justice minister lene espersen said the decision was final .
" it is better to drop any discussion on that .
it does not add any value to the proposals , " she told reporters .
" it would only open a long debate on what symbols it should be . "
german justice minister brigitte zypries called the move " regrettable " but admitted that the question of outlawing nazi insignia was less important than ensuring that racism and xenophobia were severely penalized across the european union .
" the central issue for us is to ban expressions -lrb- of racism -rrb- , " she said .
great britain , denmark and other countries spoke against an eu wide regulation on the grounds that it would go against the basic right of free expression .

among other things , the agreement would make it punishable by law to deny the holocaust or other crimes against humanity .

" making something punishable by law can only be one part of the fight against neo-fascism .
the most important job is to convince people that neofascist politics must be fought .
above all , that is a job for civil society . "
concerns over freedom of speech the plan to outlaw nazi symbols was first proposed in 2001 , but talks collapsed after resistance from italy 's center-right government .
italian justice minister roberto castelli from the populist northern league , repeated rome 's concerns that the proposals could curtail the freedom of speech .
" i am favorable to reopening the debate , " castelli told reporters thursday .
" but there must be no provisions hampering freedom of speech and the question of symbols has to be tackled because it is very important . "
under the proposals , all eu countries would have to make punishable any attempt to incite violence , discrimination or hatred against any person or group on the basis of race , color , religion , national or ethnic origin .

the new ball will tell the referee if it crossed the line a new soccer ball designed to eradicate controversial goal-line decisions is expected to be approved by a law making body in the next step toward its inclusion in the 2006 world cup in germany . a new hit-tech soccer ball may help make the world cup 2006 in germany one of the least controversial in terms of goal decisions since the tournament began in 1932 .
the revolutionary ball will be armed with the technology to alert referees when it has crossed the goal-line , avoiding situations like the notorious geoff hurst strike for england in the 1966 final . the decision to introduce the sci-fi ball at the world cup next summer is likely to be approved by the international fa board , soccer 's ultimate law making body , at a conference in cardiff , wales over the weekend . the ball , the product of a collaborative effort between german sports giant adidas , cairos technologies and radio communications firm fraunhofer , is shrouded in secrecy .
adidas researchers have been reluctant to talk about their plans to fit the balls with microchip sensors , designed to bring an end to controversial goal situations . goal-line alert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the technology will allow the exact position of the ball on the pitch to be monitored throughout the whole of a game .
once it has crossed the goal-line for a valid goal , the referee will receive an automatic bleep in his earpiece without any need for a fourth official watching pictures or instruments in the stands . officials from the german sports firm were reportedly angered by fifa president sepp blatter announcement last month when the world soccer body 's chief said there would be a presentation of the ball in cardiff . adidas boffins claimed they had not yet completed their schedule of testing and development .
adidas have already conducted two successful tests , but need to conduct more trials at grounds during games before they launch the product . vorsprung durch technik bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fußball-wm 2006 frnakfurt / main frankfurt stadion fußball media reports since the fifa announcement have indicated that adidas and fifa had set the target of the world cup as the ball 's baptism of fire .
it would be the centerpiece of germany 's intended hi-tech tournament filled with state-of-the-art stadia and 21st-century technology . as well as updating the game for the new millenium , fifa are keen to avoid the refereeing decisions that dogged the 2002 world cup finals in japan and south korea and are seen to be bending to pressure to follow the lead of rugby and cricket where new technology has been introduced to the benefit of the sport . the adidas ball would also give blatter the chance to show he is answering the calls to help referees without resorting to the use of tv replays , which he fiercely opposes . possible bundesliga tests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : * * spervermerk : die publikation und weiterverwertung dieses bildes in elektronischen medien , insbesondere im internet und auf mobilen endgeraeten waehrend des laufenden spiels , einschliesslich der halbzeit , ist durch die deutsche fussball liga untersagt .

-lrb- ap photo / christof stache -rrb- after the presentation on saturday , the international board will discuss whether the ball will be given the green light for further trials of the ball in competitions .
it is likely that the ball would be tested in the bundesliga and in the german stadiums designated as world cup venues , and even during champions league games in germany where conventional adidas balls are already used . if these tests were successful , the law making body would then convene for another meeting this time next year where it would decide whether the new ball could be included in the rules for the world cup .
if agreed , this would mean computerized soccer balls would see action in germany next summer . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de scandal deals blow to german soccer the widening match-fixing scandal is damaging german soccer 's image in the build-up to the 2006 world cup , organizing committee president franz beckenbauer said tuesday .

zones to be sealed off include the area around the us embassy and the district around the presidential palace , the summit venue . president bush arrived in the slovak capital on wednesday evening from mainz , germany , on the final leg of a european tour designed to patch up rifts between the united states and europe over the iraq war .
russian president vladimir putin is due to arrive on thursday morning . questions of democracy events may take on a similar feel to those in europe where outward smiles attempted to hide tensions behind the scenes .
bush has already warned that russia must " renew a commitment to democracy and the rule of law . "
the us leader said tuesday in brussels that he would use his " good personal relationship " with the russian leader to convey his concerns " in a cordial way . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a constructive relationship allows me to remind him that i believe russia is a european country , and european countries embrace those very same values that america embraces , " bush told reporters after meeting with european union leaders . putin has taken a series of actions seen as increasingly autocratic , including moves against the oil giant yukos , a clampdown on the media , new kremlin authority to appoint regional officials and allegedly interfering in ukraine 's presidential elections .
washington is also concerned about russian nuclear cooperation with iran , which us officials accuse of trying to acquire atomic weapons . russian dealings with iran a sore point in mainz on wednesday , bush and german chancellor gerhard schröder united in warning iran against developing a nuclear weapon .
" it 's vital that the iranians hear the world speak with one voice that they should n't have nuclear weapons , " bush said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin had said last week in moscow that russia , which is helping iran build its first nuclear power reactor , was convinced that iran has no intention of making atomic weapons . bush said he had heard some concerns about developments in russia expressed by eu leaders during his talks in brussels , notably formerly soviet baltic states which were among 10 countries to join the eu last year .
" i think it 's very important that president putin hear not only from me in a private way , which he will , but also hears some of the concerns i heard around the table today , " he said . putin defends russian approach but on tuesday , putin told slovak media : " democratic institutions should be adapted to today 's realities in russian life , to our traditions and our history . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin " we are against use of this issue as an instrument for fulfilling foreign policy objectives or for making something amorphous of the russian state , to manipulate in one way or another such a large and important country for international relations , " the russian leader said , according to a transcript released in moscow by the kremlin . " but i do n't think that is the aim of our partners , " he said , stressing that russia made its choice for democracy 14 years ago when the soviet union collapsed not in order to please any other countries " but for ourselves , for our country , for our citizens . " a number of potentially thorny subjects analysts in moscow said however that thursday 's meeting , the second between the two leaders in three months , is unlikely to settle current differences . bush and putin are due to discuss combatting terrorism , sign an accord imposing controls on shoulder-fired missiles , and review events in iraq and north korea as well as russia 's bid to join the world trade organization .

washington is also concerned about russian nuclear cooperation with iran , which us officials accuse of trying to acquire atomic weapons . russian dealings with iran a sore point in mainz on wednesday , bush and german chancellor gerhard schröder united in warning iran against developing a nuclear weapon .
" it 's vital that the iranians hear the world speak with one voice that they should n't have nuclear weapons , " bush said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin had said last week in moscow that russia , which is helping iran build its first nuclear power reactor , was convinced that iran has no intention of making atomic weapons . bush said he had heard some concerns about developments in russia expressed by eu leaders during his talks in brussels , notably formerly soviet baltic states which were among 10 countries to join the eu last year .
" i think it 's very important that president putin hear not only from me in a private way , which he will , but also hears some of the concerns i heard around the table today , " he said . putin defends russian approach but on tuesday , putin told slovak media : " democratic institutions should be adapted to today 's realities in russian life , to our traditions and our history . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin " we are against use of this issue as an instrument for fulfilling foreign policy objectives or for making something amorphous of the russian state , to manipulate in one way or another such a large and important country for international relations , " the russian leader said , according to a transcript released in moscow by the kremlin . " but i do n't think that is the aim of our partners , " he said , stressing that russia made its choice for democracy 14 years ago when the soviet union collapsed not in order to please any other countries " but for ourselves , for our country , for our citizens . " a number of potentially thorny subjects analysts in moscow said however that thursday 's meeting , the second between the two leaders in three months , is unlikely to settle current differences . bush and putin are due to discuss combatting terrorism , sign an accord imposing controls on shoulder-fired missiles , and review events in iraq and north korea as well as russia 's bid to join the world trade organization .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.02.2005 " white " biotechnology on expansion course großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : detergent production is just one area using white biotechnology unlike " green " biotechnology , the " white " variety is less well known - and less controversial .
it 's regarded as a global growth market , and one in which german industry hopes to play a part . " white " biotechnology - which uses living cells like moulds , yeasts or bacteria to produce goods and service - has long ceased to be a futuristic concept .
every day , millions of people buy products containing the technology , such as washing powder which contains enzymes to make it more efficient .
these modern detergents work with less water and in lower temperatures , meaning less waste water , and lower energy consumption . it 's a good example of the benefits of white biotechnology , according to fritz brickwedde of the bundesstiftung umwelt , a national foundation for the environment . " we have three goals which we 'd like to see realized alongside white biotechnology - the protection of limited natural resources , the reduction of environmental pollution , and a more efficient means of production , " brickwedde said . political framework the expectations are high .
studies predict that in just a few years , up to a fifth of revenues from the chemical industry worldwide will come from biotech products - a market of over € 300 billion -lrb- $ 396 billion -rrb- .
jürgen hambrecht , president of the chemical industry association , believes it 's important that germany take a leading role in this market . " in the area of white biotechnology , the german chemical industry wants to continue to be a world leader , as we are today , " hambrecht said .
" whether that will happen depends on how the political framework continues to develop . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavaria has several fields where genetically modified crops have been planted under strict regulation hambrecht 's concern is with white biotechnology 's sister field , namely , " green " biotechnology , or the planting of genetically manipulated crops .
" we 're dealing with a kind of magic triangle here - green genetic technology , renewable raw materials , and white biotechnology , " he said .
" those who do n't see this certainly wo n't be among those to help usher in the future of this technology . " migration abroad in other words : industry views germany 's laws on genetic technology as overly restrictive .
hambrecht wants to be able to more easily plant genetically modified crops , as only by pursuing this field can the progress of white biotechnology be assured . hambrecht 's main criticism is directed at economics minister wolfgang clement , who responded : " as far as our legislation is concerned , in my view , it is deserving of criticism .
we held a critical discussion , so my assumption is that we 're in the midst of a process which could lead to changes on the laws regarding genetic technology , and in my opinion , should lead to changes . " the chemical industry clearly has a sympathetic ear in clement .
however , the economics minister ca n't speak for the whole government , and especially not for coalition partner , the green party .
after all , the greens harbor the most committed opponents to the cultivation of genetically modified plants . the next assessment of the legislation 's status is due to take place in two years ' time .
the chemical industry is waiting with baited breath .
should the laws not be loosened , hambrecht predicts that german research and development in the biotechnology sector will suffer , adding that it would no longer be possible to rule out a brain drain of german talent to countries with more relaxed legislation . gernot jaeger -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu-us rift remains over biotech food it 's been 10 years since the production of genetically modified crops reached commercial status .

zones to be sealed off include the area around the us embassy and the district around the presidential palace , the summit venue . president bush arrived in the slovak capital on wednesday evening from mainz , germany , on the final leg of a european tour designed to patch up rifts between the united states and europe over the iraq war .
russian president vladimir putin is due to arrive on thursday morning . questions of democracy events may take on a similar feel to those in europe where outward smiles attempted to hide tensions behind the scenes .
bush has already warned that russia must " renew a commitment to democracy and the rule of law . "
the us leader said tuesday in brussels that he would use his " good personal relationship " with the russian leader to convey his concerns " in a cordial way . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a constructive relationship allows me to remind him that i believe russia is a european country , and european countries embrace those very same values that america embraces , " bush told reporters after meeting with european union leaders . putin has taken a series of actions seen as increasingly autocratic , including moves against the oil giant yukos , a clampdown on the media , new kremlin authority to appoint regional officials and allegedly interfering in ukraine 's presidential elections .
washington is also concerned about russian nuclear cooperation with iran , which us officials accuse of trying to acquire atomic weapons . russian dealings with iran a sore point in mainz on wednesday , bush and german chancellor gerhard schröder united in warning iran against developing a nuclear weapon .
" it 's vital that the iranians hear the world speak with one voice that they should n't have nuclear weapons , " bush said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin had said last week in moscow that russia , which is helping iran build its first nuclear power reactor , was convinced that iran has no intention of making atomic weapons . bush said he had heard some concerns about developments in russia expressed by eu leaders during his talks in brussels , notably formerly soviet baltic states which were among 10 countries to join the eu last year .
" i think it 's very important that president putin hear not only from me in a private way , which he will , but also hears some of the concerns i heard around the table today , " he said . putin defends russian approach but on tuesday , putin told slovak media : " democratic institutions should be adapted to today 's realities in russian life , to our traditions and our history . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin " we are against use of this issue as an instrument for fulfilling foreign policy objectives or for making something amorphous of the russian state , to manipulate in one way or another such a large and important country for international relations , " the russian leader said , according to a transcript released in moscow by the kremlin . " but i do n't think that is the aim of our partners , " he said , stressing that russia made its choice for democracy 14 years ago when the soviet union collapsed not in order to please any other countries " but for ourselves , for our country , for our citizens . " a number of potentially thorny subjects analysts in moscow said however that thursday 's meeting , the second between the two leaders in three months , is unlikely to settle current differences . bush and putin are due to discuss combatting terrorism , sign an accord imposing controls on shoulder-fired missiles , and review events in iraq and north korea as well as russia 's bid to join the world trade organization .

the winter in germany has been cold and the demand for heating oil and gas has risen sharply .

in germany , they also have subsidiaries searching for oil and gas reserves both in the country and abroad .
the demand is rising , particularly for natural gas .

in the same time period , the use of natural gas for energy purposes increased from 15.4 percent of total energy consumption to 22.5 percent .
the increase creates incentives to tap into new sources .
germany has never been a rich country for natural gas and oil reserves , but one-fifth of the natural gas consumed by germans is german .

international pricing also plays a role .
" the development in germany has fallen because of the strength of the euro and the uncoupling of the gas price from oil , so that in germany , there has n't been a price increase in natural gas for the producers , " explained kalkoffen .
offshore attractive yet complicated as gas and oil reserves drop in germany proper , the producers have had to turn to increasingly more unconventional ways to win fossil fuels , such as extracting so-called tight gas from extremely dense layers of rock .

zones to be sealed off include the area around the us embassy and the district around the presidential palace , the summit venue . president bush arrived in the slovak capital on wednesday evening from mainz , germany , on the final leg of a european tour designed to patch up rifts between the united states and europe over the iraq war .
russian president vladimir putin is due to arrive on thursday morning . questions of democracy events may take on a similar feel to those in europe where outward smiles attempted to hide tensions behind the scenes .
bush has already warned that russia must " renew a commitment to democracy and the rule of law . "
the us leader said tuesday in brussels that he would use his " good personal relationship " with the russian leader to convey his concerns " in a cordial way . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a constructive relationship allows me to remind him that i believe russia is a european country , and european countries embrace those very same values that america embraces , " bush told reporters after meeting with european union leaders . putin has taken a series of actions seen as increasingly autocratic , including moves against the oil giant yukos , a clampdown on the media , new kremlin authority to appoint regional officials and allegedly interfering in ukraine 's presidential elections .
washington is also concerned about russian nuclear cooperation with iran , which us officials accuse of trying to acquire atomic weapons . russian dealings with iran a sore point in mainz on wednesday , bush and german chancellor gerhard schröder united in warning iran against developing a nuclear weapon .
" it 's vital that the iranians hear the world speak with one voice that they should n't have nuclear weapons , " bush said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin had said last week in moscow that russia , which is helping iran build its first nuclear power reactor , was convinced that iran has no intention of making atomic weapons . bush said he had heard some concerns about developments in russia expressed by eu leaders during his talks in brussels , notably formerly soviet baltic states which were among 10 countries to join the eu last year .
" i think it 's very important that president putin hear not only from me in a private way , which he will , but also hears some of the concerns i heard around the table today , " he said . putin defends russian approach but on tuesday , putin told slovak media : " democratic institutions should be adapted to today 's realities in russian life , to our traditions and our history . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin " we are against use of this issue as an instrument for fulfilling foreign policy objectives or for making something amorphous of the russian state , to manipulate in one way or another such a large and important country for international relations , " the russian leader said , according to a transcript released in moscow by the kremlin . " but i do n't think that is the aim of our partners , " he said , stressing that russia made its choice for democracy 14 years ago when the soviet union collapsed not in order to please any other countries " but for ourselves , for our country , for our citizens . " a number of potentially thorny subjects analysts in moscow said however that thursday 's meeting , the second between the two leaders in three months , is unlikely to settle current differences . bush and putin are due to discuss combatting terrorism , sign an accord imposing controls on shoulder-fired missiles , and review events in iraq and north korea as well as russia 's bid to join the world trade organization .

the star-studded affair will bring out the cream of tinseltown ... and a few germans with hopes of a prize and a passion for partying " like devils . " the global movie industry will turn its star-struck eyes towards hollywood once more on sunday for oscar night .
the 77th academy awards ceremony is usually quite an insular affair with back-slaps all round for the local talent and those associated with tinseltown productions .
but this year , the germans have a reason to be optimistic , with " der untergang " up for one of the coveted gongs . if " der untergang , " or " the downfall " to give it its english-language release title , gatecrashes the party , it wo n't be the first time for a german film .
in fact , german films have been gaining momentum and respect in hollywood for many years now and caroline link 's " nowhere in africa " snatched the best foreign language film statuette as recently as 2003 . history favors films about nazis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nowhere in africa the odds seem to be in the favor of director oliver hirschbiegel 's depiction of the last days of adolf hitler .
historically , german films with themes realted to the nazis have been very successful on oscar night .
link 's story of german emigrants in africa during world war ii followed the success in 1980 of volker schlöndorff 's wartime masterpiece " die blechtrommel . " regardless of the good omens , hirschbiegel is just happy to be nominated .
" for a filmmaker it is the biggest thing just to be there , this is like olympic gold .
whether we win an oscar or not - we will celebrate like devils , " said the german director . mixed responses from stateside critics in the meantime , under its english-language title , the german film has opened in the united states .
critics have reacted with mixed feelings towards the film .
the influential hollywood reporter - essential reading for many of the academy members - praised the german production highly : " one of the best war films of all time .
a film which can bring new standards in the transference of history onto celluloid . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the downfall -lrb- der untergang -rrb- however , the respected film reviewer a.o. scott of the new york times said the film contained " a reassuring message for the home audience that the germans were , above all , victims of nazism . "
he criticized the manner in which the film presented some figures linked with hitler 's regime and the way it attempted to extract sympathy from the audience . others have said that the film raises questions for all humanity , showing hitler and his cronies as people capable of horrific acts and not the demons of the nazi myth .
this same point has been used to deride the film , with some expressing concerns that humanizing the characters reduces their status as the most heinous criminals of the 20th century . growing global audience and profits the debate around the film has done little to distract audiences from seeing it .
" the downfall " has so far earned $ 40 million worldwide .
however , $ 30 million of that has been earned in germany where 4.6 million viewers have flocked to see it .
the film has also been on general release in france , belgium , the netherlands , poland , austria and switzerland , hungary , finland and spain . while german movie industry voices have been calling producer bernd eichinger " the most important man in german film , " he and his colleague hirschbiegel will have to wait until sunday night to see if they have a tangible accolade to go with all the praise . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a bumper year for german film after years of decline , german film appears to have made a comeback in 2004 .

the star-studded affair will bring out the cream of tinseltown ... and a few germans with hopes of a prize and a passion for partying " like devils . " the global movie industry will turn its star-struck eyes towards hollywood once more on sunday for oscar night .
the 77th academy awards ceremony is usually quite an insular affair with back-slaps all round for the local talent and those associated with tinseltown productions .
but this year , the germans have a reason to be optimistic , with " der untergang " up for one of the coveted gongs . if " der untergang , " or " the downfall " to give it its english-language release title , gatecrashes the party , it wo n't be the first time for a german film .
in fact , german films have been gaining momentum and respect in hollywood for many years now and caroline link 's " nowhere in africa " snatched the best foreign language film statuette as recently as 2003 . history favors films about nazis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nowhere in africa the odds seem to be in the favor of director oliver hirschbiegel 's depiction of the last days of adolf hitler .
historically , german films with themes realted to the nazis have been very successful on oscar night .
link 's story of german emigrants in africa during world war ii followed the success in 1980 of volker schlöndorff 's wartime masterpiece " die blechtrommel . " regardless of the good omens , hirschbiegel is just happy to be nominated .
" for a filmmaker it is the biggest thing just to be there , this is like olympic gold .
whether we win an oscar or not - we will celebrate like devils , " said the german director . mixed responses from stateside critics in the meantime , under its english-language title , the german film has opened in the united states .
critics have reacted with mixed feelings towards the film .
the influential hollywood reporter - essential reading for many of the academy members - praised the german production highly : " one of the best war films of all time .
a film which can bring new standards in the transference of history onto celluloid . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the downfall -lrb- der untergang -rrb- however , the respected film reviewer a.o. scott of the new york times said the film contained " a reassuring message for the home audience that the germans were , above all , victims of nazism . "
he criticized the manner in which the film presented some figures linked with hitler 's regime and the way it attempted to extract sympathy from the audience . others have said that the film raises questions for all humanity , showing hitler and his cronies as people capable of horrific acts and not the demons of the nazi myth .
this same point has been used to deride the film , with some expressing concerns that humanizing the characters reduces their status as the most heinous criminals of the 20th century . growing global audience and profits the debate around the film has done little to distract audiences from seeing it .
" the downfall " has so far earned $ 40 million worldwide .
however , $ 30 million of that has been earned in germany where 4.6 million viewers have flocked to see it .
the film has also been on general release in france , belgium , the netherlands , poland , austria and switzerland , hungary , finland and spain . while german movie industry voices have been calling producer bernd eichinger " the most important man in german film , " he and his colleague hirschbiegel will have to wait until sunday night to see if they have a tangible accolade to go with all the praise . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a bumper year for german film after years of decline , german film appears to have made a comeback in 2004 .

" this is a book which encourages crime .
do you think people should be encouraged to commit crime ? " rotfeld was reacting to the publication of 3,000 copies of a polish translation of " mein kampf " by a small publisher in the southwestern city of wroclaw .
the book sets out hitler 's anti-semitic , racist and fascist views and his vision of germany as a racially superior nation and a conqueror . " as the bible said , in the beginning there was the world , and the word became flesh .

a first edition was published in polish in 1992 but was withdrawn after claims that it incited racial hatred .
the book is banned from public display or sale in germany although it is available for historical research in libraries . hitler " was n't german " experts , however , say the new polish edition is unlikely to raise legal problems because its foreword puts it in a historical context .
the book includes an introduction by warsaw professor bogdan michalski . " the whole nature of this publication is to serve as a warning for the polish people , " michalski told reuters on thursday .

the star-studded affair will bring out the cream of tinseltown ... and a few germans with hopes of a prize and a passion for partying " like devils . " the global movie industry will turn its star-struck eyes towards hollywood once more on sunday for oscar night .
the 77th academy awards ceremony is usually quite an insular affair with back-slaps all round for the local talent and those associated with tinseltown productions .
but this year , the germans have a reason to be optimistic , with " der untergang " up for one of the coveted gongs . if " der untergang , " or " the downfall " to give it its english-language release title , gatecrashes the party , it wo n't be the first time for a german film .
in fact , german films have been gaining momentum and respect in hollywood for many years now and caroline link 's " nowhere in africa " snatched the best foreign language film statuette as recently as 2003 . history favors films about nazis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nowhere in africa the odds seem to be in the favor of director oliver hirschbiegel 's depiction of the last days of adolf hitler .
historically , german films with themes realted to the nazis have been very successful on oscar night .
link 's story of german emigrants in africa during world war ii followed the success in 1980 of volker schlöndorff 's wartime masterpiece " die blechtrommel . " regardless of the good omens , hirschbiegel is just happy to be nominated .
" for a filmmaker it is the biggest thing just to be there , this is like olympic gold .
whether we win an oscar or not - we will celebrate like devils , " said the german director . mixed responses from stateside critics in the meantime , under its english-language title , the german film has opened in the united states .
critics have reacted with mixed feelings towards the film .
the influential hollywood reporter - essential reading for many of the academy members - praised the german production highly : " one of the best war films of all time .
a film which can bring new standards in the transference of history onto celluloid . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the downfall -lrb- der untergang -rrb- however , the respected film reviewer a.o. scott of the new york times said the film contained " a reassuring message for the home audience that the germans were , above all , victims of nazism . "
he criticized the manner in which the film presented some figures linked with hitler 's regime and the way it attempted to extract sympathy from the audience . others have said that the film raises questions for all humanity , showing hitler and his cronies as people capable of horrific acts and not the demons of the nazi myth .
this same point has been used to deride the film , with some expressing concerns that humanizing the characters reduces their status as the most heinous criminals of the 20th century . growing global audience and profits the debate around the film has done little to distract audiences from seeing it .
" the downfall " has so far earned $ 40 million worldwide .
however , $ 30 million of that has been earned in germany where 4.6 million viewers have flocked to see it .
the film has also been on general release in france , belgium , the netherlands , poland , austria and switzerland , hungary , finland and spain . while german movie industry voices have been calling producer bernd eichinger " the most important man in german film , " he and his colleague hirschbiegel will have to wait until sunday night to see if they have a tangible accolade to go with all the praise . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a bumper year for german film after years of decline , german film appears to have made a comeback in 2004 .

zones to be sealed off include the area around the us embassy and the district around the presidential palace , the summit venue . president bush arrived in the slovak capital on wednesday evening from mainz , germany , on the final leg of a european tour designed to patch up rifts between the united states and europe over the iraq war .
russian president vladimir putin is due to arrive on thursday morning . questions of democracy events may take on a similar feel to those in europe where outward smiles attempted to hide tensions behind the scenes .
bush has already warned that russia must " renew a commitment to democracy and the rule of law . "
the us leader said tuesday in brussels that he would use his " good personal relationship " with the russian leader to convey his concerns " in a cordial way . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a constructive relationship allows me to remind him that i believe russia is a european country , and european countries embrace those very same values that america embraces , " bush told reporters after meeting with european union leaders . putin has taken a series of actions seen as increasingly autocratic , including moves against the oil giant yukos , a clampdown on the media , new kremlin authority to appoint regional officials and allegedly interfering in ukraine 's presidential elections .
washington is also concerned about russian nuclear cooperation with iran , which us officials accuse of trying to acquire atomic weapons . russian dealings with iran a sore point in mainz on wednesday , bush and german chancellor gerhard schröder united in warning iran against developing a nuclear weapon .
" it 's vital that the iranians hear the world speak with one voice that they should n't have nuclear weapons , " bush said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin had said last week in moscow that russia , which is helping iran build its first nuclear power reactor , was convinced that iran has no intention of making atomic weapons . bush said he had heard some concerns about developments in russia expressed by eu leaders during his talks in brussels , notably formerly soviet baltic states which were among 10 countries to join the eu last year .
" i think it 's very important that president putin hear not only from me in a private way , which he will , but also hears some of the concerns i heard around the table today , " he said . putin defends russian approach but on tuesday , putin told slovak media : " democratic institutions should be adapted to today 's realities in russian life , to our traditions and our history . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin " we are against use of this issue as an instrument for fulfilling foreign policy objectives or for making something amorphous of the russian state , to manipulate in one way or another such a large and important country for international relations , " the russian leader said , according to a transcript released in moscow by the kremlin . " but i do n't think that is the aim of our partners , " he said , stressing that russia made its choice for democracy 14 years ago when the soviet union collapsed not in order to please any other countries " but for ourselves , for our country , for our citizens . " a number of potentially thorny subjects analysts in moscow said however that thursday 's meeting , the second between the two leaders in three months , is unlikely to settle current differences . bush and putin are due to discuss combatting terrorism , sign an accord imposing controls on shoulder-fired missiles , and review events in iraq and north korea as well as russia 's bid to join the world trade organization .

they found a lack of nutrients in the womb permanently damages key cells in the pancreas which secrete insulin .
low levels of this hormone mean the body can not control blood sugar levels - raising the risk of diabetes .
the study carried out on mice by the joslin diabetes center in boston is published in the journal diabetes .
lead researcher dr mary-elizabeth patti said : " the bottom line is that if you do n't have delivery of enough nutrients from the mother to the baby , the baby 's pancreatic cells will be programmed abnormally . "
dr patti said the effect would not show up until later in life - probably not until adolescence or even adulthood . "
people and their doctors need to understand that prenatal under-nourishment makes a person permanently at higher risk for developing diabetes " dr mary-elizabeth patti , joslin diabetes center the researchers compared the offspring of mice fed a normal diet with those who were under-nourished for the final third of their pregnancy .
at birth , the babies of the under-nourished group weighed 23 % less .
tests showed that for the first two months of their lives all the baby mice had similar blood sugar levels .
but by four months those in the under-nourished group starting recording higher levels , and by six months they showed levels equivalent to full-blown diabetes in humans .
the researchers found no difference in pancreas size or numbers of insulin-producing cells .
but the cells were unable to step up secretion of insulin in response to a surge in blood sugar levels .
the problem seemed to be permanent , and persisted even when the animals ' achieved a normal bodyweight .
lifestyle important dr patti said : " people and their doctors need to understand that prenatal under-nourishment makes a person permanently at higher risk for developing diabetes , so prenatal care is important .
" moreover , if someone was born with low weight , they need to pay special attention to prevention tactics , including exercise and weight control to minimize insulin resistance - the other major factor involved in triggering type 2 diabetes .
" in particular , someone who was a low birth weight baby can compound the risk of developing diabetes by becoming overweight .
" the stage is set in two ways : low insulin production coupled with resistance to insulin - a double whammy . "
roopinder brar , of the charity diabetes uk , said the association between low birth weight and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes was well documented .
" this study on mice offers potential reasons behind this link .
although interesting , further research is needed before any definitive conclusions can be made . "
inadequate nutrition of a developing baby is not always simply down to the mother eating a poor diet .
it can be caused by abnormal development of the placenta and its blood vessels , or by high blood pressure , which damages the vessels .

to date , the swastika and other symbols of the national socialist party are banned only in germany and austria .
on thursday , the interior and justice ministers of the 25 eu countries met to discuss the possible ban of all nazi symbols , as well as questions of visa regulation and other timely issues .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-nazi demonstrators in dresden on feb .
12 the ministers decided against a ban on nazi insignia .
at the same time they vowed to reopen talks on combating racism and zenophobia across europe .
britain , denmark opposed danish justice minister lene espersen said the decision was final .
" it is better to drop any discussion on that .
it does not add any value to the proposals , " she told reporters .
" it would only open a long debate on what symbols it should be . "
german justice minister brigitte zypries called the move " regrettable " but admitted that the question of outlawing nazi insignia was less important than ensuring that racism and xenophobia were severely penalized across the european union .
" the central issue for us is to ban expressions -lrb- of racism -rrb- , " she said .
great britain , denmark and other countries spoke against an eu wide regulation on the grounds that it would go against the basic right of free expression .
but the ministers did agree to reanimate a sleeping debate on regulating racism and xenophobia .
in this case , great britain and italy dropped up their blockade-like reaction .
among other things , the agreement would make it punishable by law to deny the holocaust or other crimes against humanity .
regulation on racism but the racism regulation needs to be discussed with the 15 new european union members from eastern europe , a process that is expected to take time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister brigitte zypries zypries -lrb- photo -rrb- warned proponents of the actions that even if it does go into effect , it is not the solution to racism in europe .
" making something punishable by law can only be one part of the fight against neo-fascism .
the most important job is to convince people that neofascist politics must be fought .
above all , that is a job for civil society . "
concerns over freedom of speech the plan to outlaw nazi symbols was first proposed in 2001 , but talks collapsed after resistance from italy 's center-right government .
italian justice minister roberto castelli from the populist northern league , repeated rome 's concerns that the proposals could curtail the freedom of speech .
" i am favorable to reopening the debate , " castelli told reporters thursday .
" but there must be no provisions hampering freedom of speech and the question of symbols has to be tackled because it is very important . "
under the proposals , all eu countries would have to make punishable any attempt to incite violence , discrimination or hatred against any person or group on the basis of race , color , religion , national or ethnic origin .
the plans also seek to ban " condoning , denial or gross trivialization of crimes of genocide " such as the holocaust , which killed more than 6 million jews . bernd riegert -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : calls for eu ban on nazi symbols several german lawmakers have called for a europe-wide ban on nazi insignia following widespread outrage after britain 's prince harry wore a swastika as part of a costume at a high-society gathering .

to date , the swastika and other symbols of the national socialist party are banned only in germany and austria .
on thursday , the interior and justice ministers of the 25 eu countries met to discuss the possible ban of all nazi symbols , as well as questions of visa regulation and other timely issues .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-nazi demonstrators in dresden on feb .
12 the ministers decided against a ban on nazi insignia .
at the same time they vowed to reopen talks on combating racism and zenophobia across europe .
britain , denmark opposed danish justice minister lene espersen said the decision was final .
" it is better to drop any discussion on that .
it does not add any value to the proposals , " she told reporters .
" it would only open a long debate on what symbols it should be . "
german justice minister brigitte zypries called the move " regrettable " but admitted that the question of outlawing nazi insignia was less important than ensuring that racism and xenophobia were severely penalized across the european union .
" the central issue for us is to ban expressions -lrb- of racism -rrb- , " she said .
great britain , denmark and other countries spoke against an eu wide regulation on the grounds that it would go against the basic right of free expression .
but the ministers did agree to reanimate a sleeping debate on regulating racism and xenophobia .
in this case , great britain and italy dropped up their blockade-like reaction .
among other things , the agreement would make it punishable by law to deny the holocaust or other crimes against humanity .
regulation on racism but the racism regulation needs to be discussed with the 15 new european union members from eastern europe , a process that is expected to take time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister brigitte zypries zypries -lrb- photo -rrb- warned proponents of the actions that even if it does go into effect , it is not the solution to racism in europe .
" making something punishable by law can only be one part of the fight against neo-fascism .
the most important job is to convince people that neofascist politics must be fought .
above all , that is a job for civil society . "
concerns over freedom of speech the plan to outlaw nazi symbols was first proposed in 2001 , but talks collapsed after resistance from italy 's center-right government .
italian justice minister roberto castelli from the populist northern league , repeated rome 's concerns that the proposals could curtail the freedom of speech .
" i am favorable to reopening the debate , " castelli told reporters thursday .
" but there must be no provisions hampering freedom of speech and the question of symbols has to be tackled because it is very important . "
under the proposals , all eu countries would have to make punishable any attempt to incite violence , discrimination or hatred against any person or group on the basis of race , color , religion , national or ethnic origin .
the plans also seek to ban " condoning , denial or gross trivialization of crimes of genocide " such as the holocaust , which killed more than 6 million jews . bernd riegert -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : calls for eu ban on nazi symbols several german lawmakers have called for a europe-wide ban on nazi insignia following widespread outrage after britain 's prince harry wore a swastika as part of a costume at a high-society gathering .

they found a lack of nutrients in the womb permanently damages key cells in the pancreas which secrete insulin .
low levels of this hormone mean the body can not control blood sugar levels - raising the risk of diabetes .
the study carried out on mice by the joslin diabetes center in boston is published in the journal diabetes .
lead researcher dr mary-elizabeth patti said : " the bottom line is that if you do n't have delivery of enough nutrients from the mother to the baby , the baby 's pancreatic cells will be programmed abnormally . "
dr patti said the effect would not show up until later in life - probably not until adolescence or even adulthood .
people and their doctors need to understand that prenatal under-nourishment makes a person permanently at higher risk for developing diabetes dr mary-elizabeth patti , joslin diabetes center the researchers compared the offspring of mice fed a normal diet with those who were under-nourished for the final third of their pregnancy .
at birth , the babies of the under-nourished group weighed 23 % less .
tests showed that for the first two months of their lives all the baby mice had similar blood sugar levels .
but by four months those in the under-nourished group starting recording higher levels , and by six months they showed levels equivalent to full-blown diabetes in humans .
the researchers found no difference in pancreas size or numbers of insulin-producing cells .
but the cells were unable to step up secretion of insulin in response to a surge in blood sugar levels .
the problem seemed to be permanent , and persisted even when the animals ' achieved a normal bodyweight .
lifestyle important dr patti said : " people and their doctors need to understand that prenatal under-nourishment makes a person permanently at higher risk for developing diabetes , so prenatal care is important .
" moreover , if someone was born with low weight , they need to pay special attention to prevention tactics , including exercise and weight control to minimize insulin resistance - the other major factor involved in triggering type 2 diabetes .
" in particular , someone who was a low birth weight baby can compound the risk of developing diabetes by becoming overweight .
" the stage is set in two ways : low insulin production coupled with resistance to insulin - a double whammy . "

they found a lack of nutrients in the womb permanently damages key cells in the pancreas which secrete insulin .
low levels of this hormone mean the body can not control blood sugar levels - raising the risk of diabetes .
the study carried out on mice by the joslin diabetes center in boston is published in the journal diabetes .
lead researcher dr mary-elizabeth patti said : " the bottom line is that if you do n't have delivery of enough nutrients from the mother to the baby , the baby 's pancreatic cells will be programmed abnormally . "
dr patti said the effect would not show up until later in life - probably not until adolescence or even adulthood .
people and their doctors need to understand that prenatal under-nourishment makes a person permanently at higher risk for developing diabetes dr mary-elizabeth patti , joslin diabetes center the researchers compared the offspring of mice fed a normal diet with those who were under-nourished for the final third of their pregnancy .
at birth , the babies of the under-nourished group weighed 23 % less .
tests showed that for the first two months of their lives all the baby mice had similar blood sugar levels .
but by four months those in the under-nourished group starting recording higher levels , and by six months they showed levels equivalent to full-blown diabetes in humans .
the researchers found no difference in pancreas size or numbers of insulin-producing cells .
but the cells were unable to step up secretion of insulin in response to a surge in blood sugar levels .
the problem seemed to be permanent , and persisted even when the animals ' achieved a normal bodyweight .
lifestyle important dr patti said : " people and their doctors need to understand that prenatal under-nourishment makes a person permanently at higher risk for developing diabetes , so prenatal care is important .
" moreover , if someone was born with low weight , they need to pay special attention to prevention tactics , including exercise and weight control to minimize insulin resistance - the other major factor involved in triggering type 2 diabetes .
" in particular , someone who was a low birth weight baby can compound the risk of developing diabetes by becoming overweight .
" the stage is set in two ways : low insulin production coupled with resistance to insulin - a double whammy . "
roopinder brar , of the charity diabetes uk , said the association between low birth weight and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes was well documented .
" this study on mice offers potential reasons behind this link .
although interesting , further research is needed before any definitive conclusions can be made . "
inadequate nutrition of a developing baby is not always simply down to the mother eating a poor diet .
it can be caused by abnormal development of the placenta and its blood vessels , or by high blood pressure , which damages the vessels .

bbc news -pipe- uk -pipe- call for action on child exorcism bbc news / uk graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- uk contents : england -pipe- northern ireland -pipe- scotland -pipe- wales -pipe- uk politics -pipe- education -pipe- magazine friday , 25 february , 2005 , 05:38 gmt call for action on child exorcism black church and community leaders are calling for action to protect children from the effects of exorcisms .
a spokeswoman for africans against child abuse -lrb- afruca -rrb- said church leaders who believe in possession needed education on child protection .
a bbc investigation suggests only a third of london 's local authorities are addressing the issue seriously .
the newsnight probe suggests some children are being beaten by parents trying to drive out evil spirits .
afruca spokeswoman debbie ariyo said she was not surprised by the findings because the driving out of demons was known to be a widespread practice within the african churches .
" it 's part and parcel of what churches do in terms of freeing people from what they see as the stranglehold of the devil .
" but it does worry me that local authorities are not making the effort to link up with the churches in terms of their practices regarding child protection , " ms ariyo said .
' institutional failure ' however , joseph ocheno , a community activist in peckham , south london , said he believed some stories of exorcisms were an exaggeration .
" i know , as someone who 's actively involved in the community , that there are all sorts of stories that come out of churches and i do not think personally that these things are as widespread as they 're made out to be .
" i hope this does n't divert from the very fundamental issue of the massive institutional failure that led to the unfortunate death of victoria climbie , " mr ocheno said . "
exorcism is a good thing but it 's not meant to be abusive " katie kirby african caribbean evangelical alliance the newsnight investigation comes on the fifth anniversary of the death of eight-year-old victoria climbie , killed by carers who claimed she was possessed by the devil .
newsnight 's study found a third of all london boroughs did no work at all on the issue of the effects of child exorcisms .
they included lambeth in south-east london , a borough with one of the biggest african population in the uk .
however , hanna miller of the association of directors of social services said it was unfair to say the issue had been ignored .
" it does take a while for people to get geared up , to become expert , to find out about things , " she said .
" the fact is you have boroughs that are actively engaging , they have recognised those issues and done something about it . "
the challenge for london now was that good practice should be rolled out to boroughs not doing as much as they should , ms miller added .
' culture ' in tower hamlets in east london , where the authorities are taking the issue seriously , 30 churches which might inform parents their children were possessed have been identified .
the metropolitan police is currently investigating a number of cases of so-called " faith crimes " . "
abuse is abuse , and can never be overlooked or mitigated against by cultural or religious factors " david pearson churches ' child protection advisory service detective superintendent chris bourlet of the met 's child protection central command told newsnight reporter angus stickler the scale of the problem was difficult to determine .
" we are talking about child abuse , physical abuse , mental abuse , actually using emotional abuse against the child - quite serious offences in some cases - up to physical woundings of children , " mr bourlet said .
sociologist dr richard hoskins , of kings college london , recently returned from doing research on the issue in the democratic republic of congo , where he found thousands of children were believed to be possessed .
he told newsnight the problem for the uk was potentially " massive " .
" we are on the cusp of something quite sinister and major here , " he said , before calling for a government task force to look into the issue , rather than just leaving it to the criminal justice process .
however , katie kirby of the african caribbean evangelical alliance -lrb- acea -rrb- said it was important to keep the issues in context .
" exorcism is a good thing but it 's not meant to be abusive , there 's no biblical precedent for that , " she said .
" it 's important social services work with the faith communities to understand them and make sure they 're not misinterpreting the culture but challenging anything that 's immoral or unsafe for children . "
david pearson of the churches ' child protection advisory service , an independent authority , said it was vital cultural considerations did not take precedent over a child 's welfare .
mr pearson , who gave evidence at the inquiry into the death of victoria climbie , said : " abuse is abuse , and can never be overlooked or mitigated against by cultural or religious factors . "
lord laming , who conducted the inquiry into the climbie case , said he was " appalled by the terrifying experiences " to which some children in the report had been subjected .
" children are not chattels , they are citizens , and they are entitled to the protection of the law , " he told newsnight .
